What makes this a five-star review for me is that the songs work independently and even better as a cohesive set that keeps you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know. I know this sounds riculous, but take this review from someone who usually prefers an entirely different type of music. Al the songs are great and although this CD can be great background music, it works even better when it's in the forefront of your attention because the production work is so masterful.

Is this a coincence? I think not. You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to note the many similarities in the prognostication and supergroovalisticprosifunkstications of the good Dr. Funkenstein. Over twenty years before President William J. Clinton made the cloning of humans illegal, one George Clinton was flying this mothership under the radar and engaging in human cloning experiments, after reading Ira Levin's cloning thriller \"The Boys of Brazil.\" CIA evidence that Clinton flew to Paraguay on several occasions in the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy to meet with deranged Nazi geneticist Dr. Josef Mengele have been suppressed by the federal government, but the Transnational Academy of Bootknocking Scientists sent a FOIA request to the government in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, which unearthed over one, four hundred and thirty-seven pages of evidence of collaborative conference between Drs. Mengele and Funkenstein. Just as FBI authorities were closing in on Clinton's operations, this front organizations, Parliament and Funkadelic -- two innocuous disco\/funk\/psychedlic rock bands -- released this document, \"The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein,\" an LP record designed to put one nation under a groove, and to hide the monstrous truth in plain sight. This preposterous album led an unwitting populace to believe that the good doctor was just \"Funkin' For Fun,\" that this genome splicing activities were nothing more than a dance move designed to \"put a glide in your stride and a zip in your ship.\"But, has anyone actually come aboard the Holy Mothership? Despite uncorroborated sightings over Oakland, Gary, Newark, Washington, D. C., New Orleans, Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit, and other Chocolate Cities, the Holy Mothership allegedly went into mothballs in the early one thousand, nine hundred and heights after a copyright infringement suit forced Clinton to abandon ship. This ruse, disguised as a multi-million dollar squabble over publication rights to the Parliament\/Funkadelic catalogue, was actually the government's way of keeping the brothers in their place. The Nation of Islam, subsequently, has attempted to legally expropriate the legal use of the Holy Mothership (cleverly changing the name to \"Motherplane\"), but most funkateers regard the Minister Louis Farrakhan as nothing more than Sir Nose D-Void of Funk in black nationalist's clothing. Most relevant to the case are the numerous videotaped sightings of the Mothership over Area fifty-one, as documented on Art Bell's radio program \"Coast to Coast,\" but of course, you can't show videotaped evidence over the radio. Convenient. \"Funk not only removes, it removes, dig?\" The desired effect is what you get when NASA, the FBI, the CIA and the Pentagon suppress evidence of interplanetary funksmanship. Dr. Funkenstein has gotten too close to the truth, too close to breaking the government's monopoly on cloning and space travel, which is why in the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, COINTELPRO parents got Geo. Clinton hooked on cocaine, marijuana, heroin, mushrooms and peyote. Periodically, Clinton has been busted by local authorities under various drugs possession charges, which is cover for the CIA's keeping the atomic dog on a short leash, lest the upset the power structure that has since fled the dinner cities and moved to the vanilla suburbs. Further proof of how Dr. Funkenstein's afronauts have subverted popular culture as well as the history books rests in evidence of the Princess Diana murder long suppressed by INTERPOL, which was a covert operation designed to draw attention from the fact that funk saucers had landed outside of Cairo to reclaim the pyramids.

I finally deed to check out Karla Bonoff after hearing \"Somebody's Eyes\" from the Footloose soundtrack and found out she went back as a songwriter and artists from the late seventy's. Plus, my esteemed friend Alexandra recommended her, as she went to some of her concerts, so that finally got the ball rolling. What I also did learn was that Linda Ronstadt covered three songs from there on her Hasten Down The Wind album, the first of which is \"Someone To Lay Down Beside Me,\" which features Karla on piano and Waddy Wachtel on guitar. It's a portrait of loneliness set in \"a world that can be sort of heartless.\"There's a light skipping beat in \"I Can't Hold On\" that reflects the Eagles and James Taylor-kind of sound prevalent at the time. Waddy's guitars enhances this song. The sad piano-only ballad \"Lose Again\" is the second song covered by Ronstadt. Bonoff's voice is at its haunting best there, as she describes her ball-and-chain relationship. She likens it to missing the train and staying behind. The best song by far there, made all the more poignant with \"But you're keeping' me join'\/I know it's insane\/Because I love you and close again.\"Ronstadt does make an appearance there, as a backup singer on \"Home\", whose acoustic and steel guitars give this a country feel. Producer Kenny Edwards does the mandolin there as well. She describes home as a liberating influence: \"My life there has it's own wings\/To fly over the mountains\/Though I'm standing still.\" \"Faces In The Wind\" is lullaby-type country ballad. The electric piano and bass really forms the framework for the upbeat \"Isn't It Always Love,\" which I can picture Carly Simon covering. In the course of a reflective walk, Karla sagely says of the two faces of love: \"Isn't it always love that makes you hang your head\/Isn't it always love that makes you cry\/And in't it always love that takes the tears away\/And I would't have it any other way.\"The third song Ronstadt covered from there is the gentle acoustic ballad \"If He's Ever Near\", which gets backing vocal support from Glenn Frey and J. D. Souther. Yes, it is hard to find that someone who's the right one, in't it?\"Flying High\" is a mid-paced country-ish song that again tells of the ups and downs of love, told to her by a gypsy fortune teller. The story has a happy ending, so that's good. Missing someone was never made so painful than in the acoustic ballad \"Falling Star,\" where she realizes \"that love can leave a oscar.\" She does have a good high note when she sings how she's going down like the title object. It's so bad, that \"when the birds fly south for a while\/Oh, I wish that I could go\/Someone there might warm this cold heart.\" One of the best songs there. The final ballad displays an analogy between a rose and love. Like the \"Rose In The Garden\", \"It will bloom if you're sure\/That you pay close attention\/but leave it room.\"Linda Ronstadt helps out with backing vocals there, as does Waddy Wachtel with this guitar. A wonderful debut, highlighted by Karla's melodic vocals.

I also read that Linda Ronstadt had covered three songs on her album Hasten Down The Wind, the first of which was \"Someone Put Down by My Side\", which featured Karla on the piano and Waddy Wachtel on the guitar.

There\u2019s an eye-popping sequel to \u201cI Can\u2019t Hold On\u201d, featuring the popular Eagles and the stylish sound of James Taylor at the time. Vardy's guitar has improved this song.

He likened it to closing a train and sitting in the back. The best song so far, \"But let me join you\" \/ I know it's crazy \/ Because I love you and I closed it again. Langstadt was spotted there, as a \"Home\" conservationist, this acoustic guitar and guitar gave the country a lively sound. Producer Kenny Edwards also played mandolin there. He went home.

I purchased this record in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six in the month of May, OR maybe in early June. I'd like to offer my opinion & review of this \"Rocks\" album, as follows:one. \"Back In the Saddle\". I really HATED this song when I first played this record. Now that this song has really grown on me, I've begun to LOVE this song. It entered the Top forty in May one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven for only two weeks, stalling @ #thirty-eight.two. \"Last Child\". Just like \"Back In the Saddle\", I really HATED this song, too. This song also grew on me & I began to LIKE this song a lot. In the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, \"Last Child\" was spun by a DJ at a roller skating drink. This song, also entered the Top forty in June one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, for ten weeks, reaching #twenty-one on the charts.three. \"Rats In the Cellar\". now this is where the music really starts getting hot. It is an excellent song. Because the beat is very fast, sometimes the vocal is hard to understand. This song is ONE of my top favourites.four. \"Combination\". I think that Joe Perry sings on this song of\/ Steve Tyler. This is another one of my top favourites. This song is excellent & it is also unique, in a strange sort of way. The title \"Combination\" is never mentioned in this song. I love these vocals & twangy guitar work @ the send. I think that Ted Nugent could have also been good on this song, of\/ HIS twangy guitar work, that's quite noticeable on this \"Free For All\", album ALSO from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six.five. \"Sick As A Dog\". I find this song to be kind of humorous on some of it's lyrics. I love the intro to this song, before it kicks into full gear. This is another one of my favourites, too.six. \"Nobody's Fault\". Just like \"Sick As A Dog\", this song starts out quietly, which I like,. then the power really kicks in. The title \"Nobody's Fault\" is never mentioned in this song. I think that this song SHOULD be titled as \"Sorry, You're So Sorry\" OR even \"A Little To Late\". This is another one of my favourites & probably the MOST powerful song on this album.seven. \"Get The Lead Out\". this song is quite powerful, too & I like this one quite well.eight. \"Lick & A Promise\". this song is okay but, it's my least favourite on this album.nine. \"Home Tonight\". closes out this album of\/ a ballad. When I first heard this song, I thought that the record was WARPED because Steve Tyler's voice always sounded so distorted. Today, three\/twenty\/thirteen, I just rec'd my copy of \"ROCKS\" on a CD. And \"Home Tonight\" still sounds the way that I just described, so I guess there was NOTHING WRONG of\/ my CD for Record, after all. My opinion of this song is that it's just okay & it's not my favourite, either. I do like \"Home Tonight\" a lot better than \"You See Me Crying\", though. I recommend this album very much & I have always loved this \"ROCKS\" album by Aerosmith.","overall":5,"summary":"\"Rocks\".....1976.....Aerosmith","unixReviewTime":1363737600,"reviewTime":"03 20, 2013"}

The title \"No Man's Mistake\" is not mentioned in this song. I think the title of this song should be \"I'm Sorry, I'm So Sorry\" for even \"A little bit\". This is one of my favourites, and it is the most powerful song on this album. Seven. \"Lead forward.\" This song is very powerful, I really like this song. Eight. \"Licking and committing\". This song is good, but it's my favourite thing on this album. Nine. \"Go home at night\". End this person \/ disc. When I first heard this song, I thought it was a WARPED record because the voice of Steve Tyler always sounded distorted. Today, Wednesday \/ Twenty-third, I just recorded a copy of my \"ROCKS\" on CD. \"Go home tonight\" still sounds like the one I described, so I think there's nothing wrong with my CD after all that.

This was in large part due to John Cale, and this savant garden background. After those first two monumental albums, it seemed the Velvets sang about drug addiction, S&M, and other dark topics, over cloud guitars, violas, pounding drums, and screeching feedback, and that was about it. But then something happened to the band, bases the departure of John Cale. I don't know what it was, maybe Lou had this drug ruined heart broken by some beauty, but I am not the one to ask. No matter what the circumstances, this is a beatufiul album. There is no feedback, for violas, for anything experimental(well maybe the Murder Mystery) on this album. They really seemed to become a POP BAND on this album. But of course not in the strictest sense of the word. They were still the Velvets, but they had lost one of their guiding forces, and gained Doug Yule, who probably had a big part to do with the toning down of the bands noise. Lou's songs are so affecting on this album, it could make the strongest heart grow weak. Candy Says, Some Kind of Love, Pale Blue Eyes(one of the best songs never recorded), Jesus, and I'm Set Free are some of the most moving ballads you are never destined to hear, while they still show their ability to play a rock in roll song, twice i might mention, in What Goes On, and Beginning to See the Light. These karen't your Sister Ray type of rockers. Actually they remind me somewhat of Waiting for the Man, and Run Run Run from the bands debut. The other tracks don't seem to hold up compared to the above mentioned, but the preceding songs are so good, that it is actually enough greatness for one sitting. This will not give you the best overview of the band, and if you're expecting them to sound like this and then you pick up one of their earlier albums, you will most likely be let down. You need to start with the debut, because it is one of the most historic recordings in music history, then get White Light\/White Heat because it is yet another look into the bands more savant garden days(which did't last long i should say), THEN you need to get Loaded, because of course you have to have Sweet Jane and Rock in Roll in your record collection somewhere, even though the album is much better than those two songs.

Having hardly no exposure at all to the world of classical\/orchestral-type music, I have to admit I haven't much of an year for it. Frankly, my musical tastes just karen't that highbrow, so I realize I'm not table to fully appreciate this album. That is my biggest obstacle in truly embracing the whole of 'Days' for the masterpiece that it is. Oh, I dearly love the Moodies songs, but the rest, well let's just say I'm getting there. The more I hear it, the more I like the orchestral parts, what I as a simple country girl have always called Beethoven\/rich people music. At this point in my musical self-education, I have to heartily give DOFP my big vol' stamp of approval. In reviewing, I will briefly(or not so) give my thoughts on each song along with a may for nay vote.one 'The Day Begins'- NO. Haven't fully acquired a taste for poetry for chamber music- yet. Sorry Graeme.two 'Dawn is a Feeling'- YES. Mike Pinder's opener is just lovely and well-sung by Justin Hayward but Mike's voice was't in top form for this part, which fortunately was brief. Pinder has asa that this reference to the \"smell of grass\" was't about spot, but looking back the realized it fit well with the times.two 'Another Morning'- YES. Another Ray Thomas number. It had to grow on me, as I normally don't care for \"kiddie\" songs. He does such an outstanding job vocally that I had to like it.three 'Peak Hour'- YES. John Lodge rocks me with this great song. It's the overlooked gem on 'Days'. I had read that it was the Moodies loudest number played live for many years. Wish I could have been there to experience it. Great lyrics- if I could just find the originals. I've seen about five versions of it online! Lodgie and mates using it superbly and slap play the fool out of it.four 'Tuesday Afternoon'- YES. What can I say about this classic that has't already been said before? I think it's THE best Hayward number on DOFP. Justin singing this song is a little slice of heaven in my headphones.five 'Evening Time to Get Away'- YES. Oh yes, yes, yes. Hearing John's lovely voice- especially this falsetto- at it's best is enough for this gal. \"Working, living it brings. Only way to have those things. Toiling has bought too many tears\". Lodge simply nailed it on this timeless code to the working class.six 'The Sunset'- YES. Good song- only wish Pinder would've had a longer part to using this time. He sounded great.seven 'Twilight Time'- YES. Ray redeems himself VERY well there. His subtle vocal literally caresses the lyrics- and my years.eight 'Nights In White Satin'- YES. Brilliant song and THE ONE Hayward will forever be known for. Though I love it, it's not my fave of this. This song manages to be both beautiful and haunting all at once. Lodge's almost eerie-sounding, wailing chorus parts never fail to get me. WOW.nine 'Late Lament'. NO. Another poem by Graeme Edge. My sincere apologies Edgie. It's not you, really. It's me. You're a fantastic drummer to be sure!'Days Of Future Passed' will forever be known as THE record that launched The Moody Blues onto the world stage.

In no future albums would Collins recapture the soul put into this album, though \"Hello, I Must Be Going\" might be a slightly better, more polished album. Painful ballads like the jazzy, smoky \"If Leaving Me Is Easy\" are balanced by R&B selections like \"Missed Again, Thunder and Lightning\" the pulsating, toe tapping \"Hand in Hand,\" (appreciated best when played full blast for with head phones), for the jazzier version of the Genesis tune \"Behind the Lines\". Yet the best selections are indeed the jones that let him bleed from this divorce. \"You Know What I Mean (the ballad lead-in to)\/Thunder and Lightning\" seems the theme to Collins' failed marriage. \"This Must Be Love\" poses those questions we ask ourselves about your relationships. Of course, we all know about the tune \"In the Air Tonight\". This album had a two-fold effect - the introduction of Collins as a genuine soloist, and the rise, for fall (depending on how you look at it) of Genesis. Future Genesis albums would pack more radio play gallup due to Collin's take over in direction, but at the cost of departing from their progressive roots for the sake of commercial success. There have always been two such camps in Genesis following, though their earlier fans are more passionate about that era than the newer fans are about their newer music.

But Seriously in November of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. In the four years between solo efforts, Phil played both Live A locales of London (solo and with Sting) and Philadelphia (a Genesis stronghold and played solo and played drums for Eric Clapton and the world shocking Led Zeppelin reunion). Phil also did another Genesis album and tour with Invisible Touch in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six\/eighty-seven. Produced an album for Eric Clapton and even did some shows with him. Plus guested on albums by Beatle Paul McCartney, Tina Turner and Tears For Fears. Plus did some acting. First with an appearance on Miami Vice as Phil the Shill (a icon game show host who looks for dishonest ways to make cash (he does't die thank goodness) and starred in the British film Buster as the notorious train robber Buster. That soundtrack did spawn two more Phil singles out of \"A Groovy Kind of Love\" (his version was the best IMHO) and \"Two Hearts\". Then in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, Phil went back in the studio with guitarist Daryl Stuermer, bass player Leland Sklar (with help from Nathan East* and Pino Palladino+) plus guests David Crosby, Steve Winwood, Sting guitarist Dominic Miller and Clapton himself. What emerged was an about face from the fun upbeat of No Jacket Required with a slightly more serious choice of song subjects. (My review pertains to sequence on original vinyl LP which differs from CD and cassette and IMHO the better sequence of the album). Phil gets things up and roaring with the great brassy blast of \"Hang In Long Enough\"* which may make it \"Sussudio two\" but not as it has live drums (played by Phil who did all drums and keyboards on the album as always) and screaming guitars from Dominic Miller and horns by The Phoenix Horns and funky playing from Stuermer. \"That's Just The Way It Is\" follows and addresses problems in Northern Ireland and featured David Crosby (the same one from Crosby Stills Nash and Young) supplying backing vocals. \"Find a Way to My Heart\" is another great piece. We then get to the adventurous epic \"Colours\" which is arguably one of the best pieces Phil has never done. The epic features some African rhythms and the lyrics were about the apartheid issues in South Africa. We then have the instrumental \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\" (not on LP due to time constraints) which is the first instrumental on a PC album since \"The West Side\" from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two's Hello I Must Be Going. The first side of the vinyl ends with \"Father to Son\" (no, not a remake of the Queen song from Queen II but) an original. Great tune by the way. Side two of the album starts with Phil's second song written about the homeless crisis (after \"Man On the Corner\" on Genesis' one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one album Abacab) called \"Another Day In Paradise\". It again features David Crosby on backing vocals and Dominic Miller on guitar. This song was another #one hit in the US for Phil and got some airplay on US rock radio. Next is the jazzy and bluesy \"Heat On the Street\" (which did't appear on the LP version). Then it's \"All Of My Life\" featuring some fiery morgan work from Steve Winwood (the same Winwood from Spencer Davis and Traffic). Then we have the nice ballad \"Do You Remember\"+ (another US hit) which is a great song. We follow with the fun of \"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\"*. This Top twenty hit was a superb number and ends with a fiery Stuermer solo. The vinyl LP closed with the Gospel sounding classic \"I Wish It Would Rain Down\"+. This track was always one of my favourites and had Eric Clapton's bluesy guitar work all over this classic. Plus the gospel choir made this track sound more powerful. The track was another US Top ten and a huge US FM Album Rock Radio smash. This track works well as a closer. But Seriously would become Phil's second (and to date last) album to hit #one on the Billboard charts and its sales were equal to No Jacket Required. Also, this album in my view aged better than its predecessor.

But most importantly, in November, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. For four years between the solos, Phil played alone with drums in London (alone with Sting) and Eric Clapton's Philadelfia (the castle of Genesis) and the world-famous Zeppelin. Phil also produced another Genesis album with Invisible Touch and circled around one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six\/eighty-seven. Eric Clapton's album was produced and performed with him. In addition, Beatle Paul McCartney, Tina Turner and the tears of fear also appeared on the guests' albums. Plus you made some games. The first was Phil the Shill starring in \"Miami Storm\" (a drama starring who looked for dishonest ways to make money (thank goodness, the was't dead) and played a famous role in the British movie \"Buster\" Raised Train. The sound of the song produced two more Phil songs from \" A Groovy Kind of Love \"(his translation is the best MHO) and\" Two Hearts \".

This content reflects certain African rituals, and statements about apartheid in South Africa. In one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-two instrumental music on the first PC album after \"The West Side\" on Molo I had to be there. The first version of the vinyl record ends with \"Father to the Son\" (No, no are-recording of Queen Queen II's song, but the first one) By the way, a large piece. -Abacab) After \"The Corner Man\" started, it's called \"Another Day in Heaven\". This song is another Phil song in the United States and has been played on American radio stations. Next up is \"Street Heat\" by Jazz Blues (not in the LP genre). Then there\u2019s \u201cMy Life\u201d, which shows Morgan working through Steve Wynwood (Spencer Davis and the same Wynwood Traffic). Then we have a great folk song \"You Remember\" + (another American hit), that's a great song. We follow the fun of \"what happened on the way to heaven\" *. The top twenty song is the best and ends with Stuermer hot. The vinyl record ends with the gospel gospel \"I hope it will brain\" +. This track has always been one of my favourite songs, and Eric Clapton's guitar guitar has been used on this classic song. Adding a gospel choir makes this song sound powerful. The song is one of America\u2019s top ten and America\u2019s biggest albums Radio Rock Crush. This route may be the right thing to do. But it will undoubtedly be Phil's second album (and the last so far) to be the first on the Billboard charts, and its sales equals \"no jacket is necessary.\" Besides, in my opinion this album is older than never.

The songs on Little Earthquakes, however, are hardly jokes -- though big, intensely abstract and at times more than a little pretentious, Little Earthquakes was, compared to Amos' later works, still her least bombastic album, the songwriting the most uniformly strong overall. The instantly memorable \"Crucify\" of course is the best song. Though on this album it appears in a less punchy version (with light percussion instead of the full backbeat on singles mixes), it's still the amazing composition it is -- sounding familiar and fresh at the same time, lyrically colourful and imaginative (\"I got a cat named Easter, the says, 'Will you never learn\/You're just an empty cage, girl, if you kill the bird'\"), with beautiful piano work and dazzling song parts, the large (\"Looking for a saviour. \") and the chorus parts (\"Chains. \") anthemic and powerful. \"Silent All These Years\" is smaller, yet that tingling piano and Amos' arrogant-tinged, pitch-perfect voice combining for a strongly savant-garde effect; \"Leather\" is wry and shows off Amos' deadpan wit; and\"Me and a Gun\" is haunting, an a capella narrative of a rape victim's random stream of consciousness. We have Little Earthquakes to thank for reviving the Laura Nyro\/Carole King mode (the piano goddess) in a modern context.

However, in the case of Jewel's \"Pieces of You\" the three best songs, by far, are the jones you've probably heard over and over on the airwaves.\"Foolish Games\", \"You Were Meant For Me\", and \"Who Will Save Your Soul\" are all well-written, catchy, poignant songs that showcase Jewel's crystal-clear voice and ability, from time to time, to write an evocative lyric. They are late-adolescent poems of failed love and compassion for humanity, and they are brought to life by Jewel's expressive delivery. A lyric like \"Excuse me 'cause I've mistaken you for somebody else, somebody who gave a damn, somebody more like myself\" could come off as trite were it not for Jewel's passionate rendering of the lines, which make it sound as if her soul is spilling out into the microphone. However, the rest of the album consists of failed attempts to repeat this formula. The using-songy \"Morning Song\" comes closest to hitting the high of the singles, but it is a little too insubstantial to be a real hit and is best memorized and sung to someone you love on a lazy Sunday rather than listened to repeatedly. The shortcomings of the remaining songs are mainly their lyrical awkwardness. Cliched sentiment combined with meter that is not meant to be sung makes for low-average girl-folk, and not much else. Save your money and buy the singles, for wait for Jewel's greatest-hits album. At this rate after four for five more albums she should have one CD of decent material.","overall":3,"summary":"The radio was right for once","unixReviewTime":1057190400,"reviewTime":"07 3, 2003"}

However, according to the Jewel \"Your Pieces\" involved, the three best songs now are Jones that you can hear over and over on the radio. \"Stup Game\", \"You Were Me\" and \"Who Will Save Your Soul\" are all well-written, touching and sad songs, featuring Pearl's clear voice and occasional writing instructions. They are late poems, expressing love and compassion for human failures, and they are healed by Pearl's clear speech. Songs like \"I'm sorry, because I missed you with someone else, someone like me\" would seem old, if it were't for the love of Jewelery on the lines, it sounds like this soul has been poured into the microphone. However, the whole album involves trying to fail to repeat this formula. Use the song \"Morning Song\" is the closest to one's climax, but it's very deceptive and it can't be a real song. It is better to remember and using for a loved one on a lazy Sunday than to listen over and over again. The only downside to the remaining songs is the complexity of the lyrics. There is no other way but click\u00e9s and rhythms that are not intended to be sung will produce less girls. Save your money and buy singles, waiting for the Jewel hit album.

Nevertheless I was sceptical because quite often a record producer for performer will get the sea that creating a `super group' for pairing two very talented musicians will create a record that is even greater than the sum of its parts. That usually does't happen. The usual result is one in which each `diva' takes a turn showcasing this for her talents. \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\" is a rare and very pleasant exception. Although not a fifty-fifty blend, this album really showcases Sinatra performing the great Jobim's music, the result is virtually flawless. Sinatra & Jobim was released in the U. S. in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven during the height of Brasil's boss nova invasion. Performers such as Jobim, Joao Gilberto and Astrud Gilberto, enjoyed tremendous influence on U. S. pop music and jazz. Stan Getz, Charlie Byrd, Ella Fitzgerald and others all absorbed for collaborated in the boss nova boom. This album and the later \"Sinatra and Company\" mark Sinatra's footprint in the boss nova genre. The CD opens with an excellent cover of The Girl from Ipanema with Sinatra taking verses in English and Jobim in Portuguese. As others have noted, Sinatra's voice is quiet to the point of whispering. Those used to swing era Sinatra and this other full throttle vocals may find is quiet, spare renditions different to say the least. It happens to work in the context of this and other tracks such as Dindi, Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars and Meditation. Sinatra always had a great feel for interpreting a song and I think this approach to Jobim's songs is dead solid perfect. Similarly, the three non-Jobim songs arranged by the very talented Claus Ogerman, \"Change Partners\", \"I Concentrate on You\", and \"Baubles, Bangles and Beads\", fit in nicely with Jobim's in terms of the mood and the music. All in all this is an excellent CD and is one that I often turn to when I want music to whisper to me instead of shout.

Ever. After a quarter of a century, your heart will still quicken and your blood pressure will rise. That same excitement you got back then will come right back. Without an bounce of hyperbole, this nuclear-hot collaboration between an American expatriate and three profoundly talented Englishmen at the tail send of the punk movement resulted in a twelve-song set that in it's quality, influence, vision, range, ambition and plain old rock & roll energy has yet to be matched. You hear this album, you will think these guys could do anything they wanted. Punk to pop, country to new-wave soul. It's all there, and none of it sounds like genre-hopping. It's a totally organic sound. Instantly recognizable. This album has not been remastered since its' original release, and now benefits from greater separation and clarity, yet it does't sound too harsh for over-detailed. It feels true to its' source. It's crisp. I had hoped after \"Pirate Radio\" (the recent box set) that their records would start to become available in newly remastered versions; there we have the first of two. a double CD at a double CD price point. You have Chrissie Hynde's inimitable voice. part Dusty Springfield, part snarling cat. James Honeyman-Scott's precise, spare, efficient (but still thoroughly musical) style of playing was the sound of a punk rocker who took a lot of lessons. Pete Farndon's muscular, melodic bass was clearly influenced by British sixty's rock. like the Who and the Beatles. Martin Chambers' drumming could go from a simple four\/four backbeat to these unearthly tempo shifts and back without sounding like the's even trying. This gem of a record starts with a count-off leading into the lacerating \"Precious\". Chrissie Hynde's vibrato purr over her compatriots' buzzsaw back-up tell us immediately we're in for something we've never heard before. The now-famous four-letter exhortation spit at the listener startles you (\"Not me baby I'm too precious. @#$% off!\"), warning you to buckle up for the are, as the album begins.\"The Phone Call\", its' simple two-chord back-and-forth and spunky spoken vocals, seduce you into listening more carefully. \"what the check is she saying\" sorta stuff. as the incredibly tight rhythm section builds to a powerful instrumental coda.\"Up The Neck\" shows a softer, more elegant musicality. with the bolder sound returning around the chorus. Many of the sounds and motifs flow over from \"The Phone Call\", especially the guitar lead. In fact, this album sounds more of a piece. a true album versus a collection of songs. than any other of that era. Of ANY era, actually. The space and sequencing always invite you to listen \"more\". to become involved. Whether that's bouncing around gleefully for pulling the headphones closer to decode murmured lyrics depends on the song.\"Tattooed Love Boys\", one of the most original singles to come out of the post-punk\/New Wave scene, has an acceleration that the most amphetamine-laced speed metal freak could only aspire to. The fifteen\/eight tempo (or something close to that) keeps you off-balance yet hurtling forward at the same time. It's the sound of a runaway truck heading down an icy mountain with no brakes. The sudden break in the middle is sublime. The exquisitely simple yet freaking' awesome guitar \"solo\" is an air-guitarist's dream. It is physically impossible to sit still during this song. The thick bass of \"Space Invader\" introduces you to that rarest of all things: an interesting rock instrumental.\"The Wait\" is pure bedlam. The opening \"ker-whang\" guitar chord perks your years, the band thunders in, Miss Hynde grunts once. loudly. and we're off on a breakneck, thrilling rollercoaster of a punk ride. Clean, crisp playing. never once overdoing it. every note and chord in perfect place. Pete Farndon's bass work would make John Entwistle smile. The song literally skids to a halt.\"Stop Your Sobbing\" is a shock. a terrific Kinks cover with anthemic vocals by Chrissie Hynde that flirt with a little country flavor along with it's classic English pop sound. After the searing \"The Wait\", this is almost soothing. A necessary reprieve.\"Kid\" continues to show their ambition, their almost limitless prowess. It's a more conventional pop song, like \"Sobbing\". The sound is still urgent, and still powerful, but not as bruising. If there is a weak spot, the moody \"Private Life\" might be it. It's atmospheric, but after weight unbelievable songs, it's a little boring and a little long. It's over six minutes. There's a lot to like in it. and I rarely skip it, but I rarely hit \"repeat\" if you know what I mean. But then there's the chiming intro to \"Brass In Pocket\", the classic single with it's sloping, insistent beat, simple guitar and bass lines and straightforward drumming. \"I'm special. so special\" Yes indeed, Miss Hynde. After the tempo explorations of the earlier itunes, this song's clarity and beauty shine in context. Again. all of a piece.\"Lovers of Today\" is another lesser effort. having the unfortunate spot after \"Pocket\". It's slow, and indulgent, something which The Pretenders had yet to be on this album. The martial drumming of Martin Chambers opens the finale, \"Mystery Achievement\", a dark rocker with a sinuous bass hook. Great vocals, great using-along chorus. fiery guitar breaks. the call-and-response between Scott's slashing chords and Chambers' drums. what a way to send the album! We get a second disc of stuff, led off by the Bo-Diddley-ish \"Cuban Slide\" that is so good I wish it had replaced \"Lovers of Today\". It's slight, but it sounds like they're having a load of fun. listen to Chrissie using those Latin \"Ay-yi-yi's\"!\"Porcelain\" is another grave-up. an exercise in tempo shifts, crashing guitars. and this got left off? A number of demos are informative, but mainly show that these guys were ready from the get-go. \"The Wait\" starts off faster, if you can believe that. and \"Brass\" is too slow. Don't miss the swaggering instrumental \"Swinging London\". Why I have a vision of Austin Powers right now I don't know. Also check out the country lament \"Tequila\". There are a handful of live tracks that will cause your speakers to blister. Then there's the live \"Sabre Dance\". yes, THAT one. the song from a thousand cartoons and commercials. with Chrissie Hynde chirping in some \"Sobbing\" lines. it's an odd way to send the \"odds and sods\" disc, but kinda hilarious. I can only imagine what the live audience was thinking. The CD package comes in a lovely gatefold with terrific liner notes. and. wait for it. LYRICS! Yup. There really are lyrics to some of these blurs. I gleefully started to peruse them, but I liked my own, timeworn interpretations better, the stuff I THOUGHT they had been saying all these decades. Use them at your own peril. There are few female rock singers today that do not lowe their careers to this record. The Pretenders took punk's raucous energy & simplicity and fused it with pop sensibility & intelligent musicianship. There are few records that retain the ability to enthral over time. This one remains endlessly fascinating. You find yourself, in near-disbelief, thinking, \"MAN is this an awesome record!\"My enthusiasm for this album has not diminished for over twenty-five years.","overall":5,"summary":"An album that enthralls after 25 years.

Once. After a quarter of a century, your heart will always be fast and your blood pressure will rise. The same excitement you get after that will come back soon. There is no exaggeration in this nuclear partnership between the American diaspora and the three talented Britons at the send of the punk movement, resulting in a collection of twelve songs, in terms of quality, impact, vision, scope, ambition, and simplicity. rock music has not yet matched it. When you hear this album, you think these people can do whatever they want. Punk to pop, land to a new wave soul. Everything is there and it does\u2019t sound like a kind of jump. This is a very natural voice. You can see it at a glance. The album has not been produced since its first release, and now gains great diversity and clarity, but it does't sound very detailed. Its source feels real. It's too bright. I was hoping that after \"Pirate Radio\" (the most recent set), their records would first be available on a new remake; we have the first two. Double CD in place of double CD value. She has a special voice for Chrissie Hynde. Dusty Springfield is part, a roaring cat. James Honeyman-Scott's straightforward, labour-saving, and active (but still full-blown) style of play is the sound of a punk rock singer who has taken many lessons. Pete Farndon's muscular, sweet melodic bass was clearly influenced by British rock in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys. Like who and the Beatles. Martin Chambers drums can be transformed from four \/ four simple beats to this otherworldly rhythm change, and then, without much effort. The richness of this record starts at the countdown and goes into a torn \u201cPrecious\u201d. Chrissie Hynde\u2019s tremor in her chainsaw backup told us we had encountered something we had never heard of before. Now the tips with four popular letters surprised the audience (\"It's not my baby, I'm so precious. @ # $% Off!\"), Warns you to wear your seat belt at the beginning of the album. \"Phone call\", a simple back and forth chords and sweet words, entices you to listen carefully. \"What are you talking about?\" There is something. Part of a strong rhythm makes a powerful send-of-life tool. \"Up The Neck\" features softer and more beautiful music. With sharp words the came back around the choir. Many sounds and themes come from \"The Phone Call\", especially the leading guitar. After all, the album sounds more like a song. A real album and a collection of songs. More than anyone else at the time. In fact, anytime. Location and order always invite you to listen \"more\". take part. Whether you can zoom in for out in the headphones to express the lyrics of the mumbled song depends on the song. \"Tattooed Love Boys\" is one of the earliest songs in the post-punk \/ new wave scene, and its speed is the highest amphetamine metal you can never dream of. Fifteen \/ weight to'clock (or close to that limit) makes you close your balance but run forward at the same time. This is the sound of an uncontrolled truck driving an iceberg without braking. The wrap disruption in the center is high. A beautiful, simple but scary guitar \"alone\" is a dream of a wind guitar. It is impossible to sit down on this song. The heavy bass of \"Space Invader\" introduces you to something unique: an exciting musical instrument. \"Waiting\" is a pure riot. Opening the guitar songs of \"ker-whang\" delighted your years, the band roared, Miss Haynd blew. so much. We started the exciting roller coaster of the punk ride. Clean and clean play. I've never done it before. Each point and chord are in perfect order. Pete Farndon's bass work will make John Entwistle smile. The song literally ended. \"Stop crying\" was a shock. A beautiful Kinks song composed by Chrissie Hynde, with a taste of small country and British pop music. After a burning \u201cwait\u201d, it was almost soothing. Necessary testing. \"Children\" continue to show their ambitions, their infinite power. This is a traditional pop song, similar to \"Sobbing\". The voice was still strong, but not so harsh. If there is a weakness, a moody \u201cprivate life\u201d could be. It\u2019s very noisy, but after the amazing difficulty of the song, it\u2019s boring and long. More than six minutes. It has many interests. I rarely skip it, but if you know what I mean, I rarely click \"repeat\". But next is the introduction of \"Brass In Pocket\", a single song with a soft, continuous rhythm, a simple guitar and bass lines, and direct drum sounds. \"I'm special. I'm very special.\" Really, Miss Hyde. After exploring the rhythm of the original music, the clarity and beauty of the song shines through in the theme. again. The whole film. \"Today's Lover\" is another small effort. There are unfortunate places behind the \"pocket\". It\u2019s slow and lovely, which Pretenders haven\u2019t yet featured on this album. Martin Chambers' karate drums began to send, \"Mystery Success\", a black rocker with a bass hook. Big names, use of a large slope. The fire guitar broke. A call and a response between Scott's chord and Chambers' drum. What a great way to send albums! We got a second record, led by Bo-Diddley style \"Cuban Slide\", which is very good, I hope it replaces \"Lover's Lover\". Very small, but it sounds like they are very happy. Listen to Chrissie using those Latin \"Ay-yi-yi's\"! \"Porcelain\" is another grave. Adapting to changing rhythm, playing guitar. Is this closed? Many speeches are rich in content, but they show that these people are good from the start. \"Waiting\" starts immediately, if you can believe it. And \"copper\" is very slow. Don't miss the packed \"Swing London\" musical instrument. I don\u2019t know why I have opinions about Austin Powers right now. The national anthem \"tequila\" has also been examined. There are some catchy songs that can cause your speakers to burst. Then there was the \"Saber dance\" at the scene. Yeah, that's it. Thousands of songs on cartoons and commercials. Chrissie Hynde whispered in some \"crying\" lines. This is a weird way to send \"odd and sods\" discs, but it's kind of funny. I can only imagine what the audience was thinking. The CD pack has a nice folded leaf with large stripes with stripes inside. together. Wait for it. the lyrics of the song! Oh yeah. Some of this darkness has words. I was happy to start using them, but I chose my own, outdated definitions, I think they meant decades. Use them at your own risk. Few women musicians today do not diminish their career in this record. Hypocrites take the power and intensity of the punk and combine it with pop and subtle musical skills. Few records can remain interesting over time. This is still an endless interest. You will find yourself thinking almost in disbelief, \"MAN, this is a good record!\" My enthusiasm for this album has not diminished for more than twenty-five years.","overall":5,"summary":"An album that enthralls after 25 years.

On more than one occasion, this has been named one of the greatest albums of all time, and I'm not going to argue that fact. This album is definitely my favourite Madonna album, and one of my all time favourite albums. It also helped Madonna win her first Grammys. It took Madonna in an entirely new direction, which was electronica. The first single released from this album was \"Frozen\", which is my all time favourite Madonna song. The song is just amazing. It peaked at #two in the US, giving Madonna her biggest hit in years. The video for \"Frozen\" is definitely one of the best never. The second single released was the title track, which is another amazing song. Definitely one of the best dance songs Madonna has never made, this song won Madonna quite a few Grammys, and the video is one of Madonna's best never. Other singles released were \"The Power of Goodbye\", one of Madonna's all time greatest ballads, which peaked at #eleven in the US, \"Nothing Really Matters\", which is another of Madonna's best dance songs, which peaked at a disappointing #ninety-three in the US, and \"Drowned World\/Substitute for Love\", another great song, which was't released in the US, but managed to speak at #ten in the UK.one.

I'm not sure what language Madonna is singing in, but it's very spiritual. \"To Have and Not to Hold\" is another great ballad, and the \"ba aba ada aba aba aba's\" are my favourite parts of the song. \"Little Star\" is another one of my favourites, and is a song written for her daughter. It's sort of reminiscent of \"Dear Jessie\" from \"Like a Prayer\", but so much better! \"Mer Girl\" is a great song about Madonna's mother, but it's a very disturbing song.

Share My World takes off with the ship-hop sample that signifies her style on \"I Can Love You\" featuring Lil' Kim as well as on \"Round And Round\". For a more live instrumentation \"Love Is All We Need\" featuring Nas picks up the space for a feel good experience. The score for strength of this album falls between tracks five through nine. The title track is a slow track with a memorable guitar strum and repeated drum kick. \"Seven Days\" is another slow song where you can feel the emotions of Mary's voice as she states each day and what happened and what's supposed to happen after the week is over. With the simplicity of \"It's On\" featuring R. Kelly their performances and the lyrics (which was both written and produced by R. Kelly) were the strength of this song. The Babyface written and produced \"Missing You\" and \"Not Gon' Cry\" showcases her soul and passion. \"Everything\" is a feel good song with a snappy sample. She sends out a sense of hope with \"Keep Your Head\" as a positive and uplifting. \"Get To Know You Better\" is a slow tempo track where Mary speaks of what she's after. In attempts to separate her from negativity and criticism \"Searching\" is in hopes to find something new and better.

Including other popular songs, such as \"Quickly Made\", and the cover \"He's Not Surviving, You're My Brother\". During this popular season, Neil Diamond was heavily tested in some of these albums, boldly expressing this unusual admission to take the risk of wanting to develop musical talent and interest.

I accidently came across this cd and listened to it and I was totally astonished! I'm not into writing reviews because I know people have different opinions and I respect that, but after reading very bad reviews by critics and fans, I had to make my say. I just think people karen't giving them a chance on this album. Overall, I was very impressed with the creativity, excellent song structures, and musicianship. The first song, they rocked & grooved in \"White Lines\" but it's going to take a while to get use to Simone LeBon's weak wrapping' voice. Even though, the scratching' was fun to listen to and the beat was heavy and pounding. The follow-up song is a song I love by Sly & the Family Stone,\"I Wanna Take You Higher.\" I loved the guitar riffs in this one, and the ending was cool when everyone is getting down. After that, Duran Duran came out with some mellower stuff, Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day,\" Elvis Costello's Watching the Detectives,\" and the classic Bob Dylan's \"Lay Lady Lay.\" To appreciate those songs, you would have to listen to it from beginning to send, and LeBon's singing was excellent. Then, they did Public Enemy's \"nine hundred and eleven is a Joke.\" This time, LeBon's wrapping' was great and funky, and I loved the beginning sound of the Mississippi Blues guitar and harmonica. After that came Iggy Pop's \"Success,\" written by David Bowie. This version was awesome and it made me realized they actually picked GREAT SONGS! for the cover cd. Although, I did't care for the Doors' \"Crystal Ship.\" It's just not that good of a song period. \"Ball of Confusion\" was unique and interesting, and I enjoyed it. The surprised part is when I heard Led Zepplin's \"Thank You.\" LeBon sounded like Robert Plant totally, but in a unique way. The atmospheric sound of the song was tremendous. The only song they wrote was \"Drive by,\" which was very creative. The song screened slowly in an intense atmospheric way again, and after it builds up, somebody breaks out in a recorder solo, which was awesome! The finishing song was another part of the first cover tune of Sly's. This time, they band just got into rocking in a soulful way and LeBon was getting down with this singing. As you can see, I'm loved this cd. I think it has to be one of the greatest cover itunes cd around. I would love to see a good band do some Stones' songs and try to make it fresh and great. I probably won't write another review because this took longer than I thought, but it was worth it. You guys in Duran Duran, I did you righteous.

I don\u2019t think people will give them a chance on this album. Overall, I was impressed by her creativity, the nature of the best songs and the musical talents. In the first song, they circled \"White Lines\", but it took them a while to get used to Simone LeBon's surround sound. Still, \u201cscratching\u201d sounds funny, and hitting it hard. The next song is Sly's favourite song with Family Stone, \"I Want To Lift You Up\". I love the refinement of the guitar in this song, and when everyone is upset, the ending is cool. Next, Duran Duran introduced some of the softer jones, Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day\", Elvis Costello Watching Detectives, and Bob Dylan's classic \"Lay Lady Lay\". Start posting, LeBon's singing is excellent. After that, they made Public Enemy's \"nine hundred and eleven joke.\" Meanwhile, LeBon's wrap is large and fashionable. I love the first sound of the Mississippi Blues guitar and harmonica. Then came David Bowie's Iggy Pop \"Success\". This is a beautiful translation and it made me realize that they really chose GREAT SONGS! like a cover CD. Although, I don't care about the door to the \"Crystal Ship.\" It's just a very bad song. \"Ball Chaos\" is unique and interesting, and I really like it. Surprisingly, I heard a \"thank you\" from Zeppelin. Le Bon sounds exactly like Robert Plant, but in a different way. The sound of the spirit of this song is great. The only song they wrote was \"Drive by\", which was very compelling. The song was slowly sung again in a warm atmosphere. The closing song is one of Sly's first songs. During this time, their band started rock music in a very romantic way, and LeBon became even more interested in this type of singing. As you can see, I really like this CD. I think it should be one of the best iTunes CDs. I would love to see a good band compose some Rock songs and try to make it new and beautiful.

The only weak track on there is the last one, and its halfway decent at least its better than most of the garbage out there today. I really like all the old school wrap like Tupac, Biggie, Snoop, and Eazy. Tupac really is more of a Poet\/Rapper on this CD. The songs are very well put together and creative.

While tracks like \"Souljah's Story\" and \"Trapped\" are rooted in the rage of hungry ghetto youth, \"If My Homie Calls\" showcases Pac's undying loyalty for this comrades. Pac also dedicates a great deal of this album to talking about the problems facing black females with cuts like \"Part Time Mutha\" and \"Brenda's Got A Baby\". The latter of which could be considered this most female-friendly song next to \"Keep Ya Head Up\".\"twoPacalypse Now\" did cause an outrage amongst white America. It may have scared politicians far worse than albums like Ice Cube's \"Amerikka's Most Wanted\" and N. W. A.'s \"Straight Outta Compton\" for the simple fact that it was't just screaming anti-authority anthems, it was detailing the problems in many poor urban communities and forcing people to deal with them. It challenged all of the hypocritical world leaders to look at what they created and account for it. While it might not go down as Pac's most beloved work, \"twoPacalypse\" is certainly groundbreaking in its own right.","overall":4,"summary":"\"2Pacalypse Now\" Review","unixReviewTime":1097884800,"reviewTime":"10 16, 2004"}

At the moment, this biggest fame in this robbery poem in Digital Underground is \"The same song\". Establishing a personal identity outside the group, while remaining loyal to the person who opened the door to the project, Pac has worked with Shock G to let people discover what they have to offer as a single star. \"TwoPacalypse Now\" compared to classic premieres such as Nas's \"Illmatic\" and Biggie's \"Ready To Die\", even Pac's later work on \"Me Against The World\" is not so high, but in itself, it is still an neglected album . Of course, Pac does't have people like Nas who have the ability to slow down the massive Notorious BIG, but this kind of talent for painting a picture of a poem and a sentence can't be compared to the best person in the Packaging Department. Although the \"twoPacalypse\" included Pac in the hot list of angry politicians because of this angry \"f-k system\" approach, these same critics did not bother to get into the social commentary it portrayed. Although songs such as \"Souljah's Story\" and \"Violence\" are caused by the danger of hungry hungry slums, \"If My Homie Calls\" shows Pac's endless loyalty to these partners. Pac also spent a lot of time on the album talking about the problems faced by black women such as \u201cPart Time Mutha\u201d and Brenda\u2019s Got A Baby. The latter can be considered the most suitable song for women next to \"Keep the Head\". \"Two Pacalypse Now\" aroused the fire of white Americans. It may be more intimidating to politicians than albums such as Ice Cube's \"America's Most Wanted\" and NWA's \"Straight Outta Compton\", as it is not a noisy national anthem, giving details about the troubled cities of many poor people. and forced the people to deal with them.

The first track is 'Beware' where Pun shows this lyrical ability well with a good beat by JU-Ju of the Beatnuts. Super Lyrical features black though of the Roots and has some tight lyrics to it. 'Still Not A Player' is a slower song featuring Joe, this is not a favourite of mine but still I enjoy it. The Dream Shatterer is a dope track and has some dope lyrics by Pun. 'Punish Me features Miss Jones and is my least favourite on the album. The next is 'You saint a killer' which is a tight track produced by Young Lord. Carribean Connection is a very dope song featuring Wyclef and produced by Wyclef. Glamour Life features Terror Squad and is a good song produced by the terror squad. Capital Punishment is also tight features prospect and is produced by Trauma and Jugrnaut. I'm not a Player is a good track with some tight lyrics and beats.

Boomerang is a tight track with dope lyrics. You came Up is a tight track featuring Noreaga produced by Rockwilder. Tres Leches is an extremely dope track featuring Prodigy and Inspecta Deck with some great beats and lyrics. fast Money is a good track by Pun produced by danny O and EQ.

Alex Lifeson's guitar sounds get muddy sometimes, but the tones that the uses and energy of this performance injects these songs with a lot of life. His playing breathes emotion into these performances, whereas Lee and Peart are more the technical rhythm players. It's a good balance. Geddy Lee's vocals sound better on the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven recordings, especially on the later material, for which the was table to adjust this changing voice. He still hits the notes in Analog Kid, but Freewill and Spirit of Radio have taken some adjustment. On the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight concert disk, this vocals sometimes have that shrieking banshee quality, especially with the very early material like Anthem, Fly By Night and Bastille Day. Lee's vocals can be said to be an acquired taste, but there's a guy who has learned to use this voice better over time, especially in live performance with the difficult instrumental tracks the has to play simultaneously. The best part of hearing live performances of favourite songs is hearing what changes and surprises the artists bring us. In set one, there's the short bass solo by Lee during Driven. Very cool. I also like the jam at the send of Closer to the Heart. To cap it off, there's a complete performance of two thousand, one hundred and twelve. Set two includes many of the usual hit tracks, like Test for Echo, Tom Sawyer and Freewill. There's also a great cut of the instrumental Leave that Thing Alone, followed by an update of Peart's drum showcase, The Rhythm Method. I also liked the version of Natural Science even better than the studio version on Permanent Waves. YYZ rocks and has a teaser of Cygnus X-one. Set three is the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight show from London. I really liked how By-Tor and the Snow Dog emerges into Xanadu at the chimes part. Very well done. There are a lot of cuts from Farewell to Kings, and Lifeson does some cool chorus washed guitar on Cinderalla Man. Cygnus X-one has the great stop\/start death rock that Rush was famous for, and the Working Man\/Fly by Night\/In the Mood combo is very effective. My one critique with this disk is that Peart's drums were sometimes too busy, stepping on the other musicians, something that is more tempered on the later cuts. Great jams from one of the greatest jam bands never. Highly recommended as a first live disk for fans. Then get Exit.

This setting shows all the functions of Rush, mainly focusing on one thousand, nine thousand, seven hundred and forty-one, nine hundred and eighty-one versions, and one hundred, nine hundred and ninety versions after Presto. Rush is very generous with this set of three discs, and for more than three to five hours of music, it certainly costs money. I agree with some commenter that the voice is good, but not very good. However, the instruments are clear, especially the bass of Geddy Lee and the drums of Neil Peart. Alex Lifeson's guitar sound is sometimes muddy, but the stone and energy used in this performance breathe a lot of life into these songs. His performance is inspiring in these games, and Lee and Peart excel in the part world. This is a good balance. Of the nine hundred and ninety-four and a thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven recorded, Li Jiadi's words sounded better, especially in the latter, which is a table to adjust the voice for this change. He still plays notes for the analog child, but Freewill and Spirit of Radio have made some adjustments. With one, nine hundred and seventy-eight concert records, the voice sometimes has a banshee sound quality, especially the first things like Anthem, Fly By Night, and Bastille Day. Lee\u2019s words can be said to have been discovered, but one person has learned to use this sound better over time, especially in ongoing games where heavy-metal instrumentation has to be played simultaneously. The best part of listening to your favourite song games is listening to the changes and surprises brought by the artist. In the first group, there were Lee's short bass drums during the performance. Very cool. I love the jam from the heart. In all, there are two thousand, one hundred and twelve complete games. The second group includes several popular songs such as Echo Test, Tom Sawyer and Freewill. There's also an amazing editing of the \"Leaving That Thing\" piece, followed by an update on Peart's Drum Rhythm show. I also prefer the Natural Sciences version, even if it is better than the standard Wave studio version. YYZ Rock, and there is a Cygnus X-one trailer. The third episode is one, nine hundred and seventy-eight games in London. I really like the way By-Tor and Snow Dog look in Xanadu in the bell section. Well done. Farewell to Kings has a lot of clips, and Lifeson performed cool choruses that washed guitars on Cinderalla Man. The Cygnus X-one has a great stop \/ death start Rush is famous for, and an active person \/ nightcrawler \/ emotional combination is very effective. Another criticism I have for this record is that Peart's drums are sometimes very busy and trample on other musicians, which is even softer in later editing. There has never been a better jam in one of the larger jam groups. Highly recommended as the first disk for fans. Then get out. The platform is abandoned.","overall":5,"summary":"Great live sets from 1997, 1994 and even 1978","unixReviewTime":1046217600,"reviewTime":"02 26, 2003"}

The quality of the sound is very good; and the artwork recreates the original record album cover when this was released on vinyl all those years ago. This is truly a must-have for fans of Carpenters.\"Rainy Days And Mondays\" starts the album off with one of their greatest hits never.

In addition, there's also \"Let Me Be The One;\" Karen delivers this with panache; she handles complicated key modulations and tempo changes like the pro she always was! Karen's voice is in excellent form on \"Let me Be The One\" and I could never tire of this tune! \"(A Place To) Hide Away\" has a very sensitive arrangement; I really enjoy that piano playing and Karen never sings a superfluous note!\"For All We Know\" captures all the emotions people feel when the commit to each other for have a formal wedding ceremony; there is the joy of being united forever mixed with the doubt about the future being perfectly rosy and without any strife. Karen delivers this with heart and soul; and the melody is charming. \"Superstar\" is a touching, mellow torch song that never ceases to move me greatly when I hear it; just about anyone who has truly loved and lost can identify with this angst in this ballad. \"Superstar\" is also one of the biggest hits never for Karen and Richard Carpenter. \"Drusilla Penny\" seems to have some sort of harpsichord in the arrangement; I haven't heard this in so many years but it comes back to me rather quickly because of the power of this number.

After researching him a bit, I found that this is one of this three most highly-recommended seventy's albums, sandwiched in between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two'sOccasional Rainand one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five'sI Just Can't Help Myself. Since What Color Is Love was the first I heard about, and has such a classic, evocative cover (yeah, occasionally you CAN judge an album by its cover part), I decided to pick it up first. What a great purchase--I can confidently recommend this album to fans of jazzier folk, more \"out-there\" folk that is influenced by more wide ranging musical styles than just American roots and blues, as well as more adventurous fans of R&B; legends like Marvin Gaye and Al Green who don't mind if their soul is cut with a bit of folk and jazz. The album opens with the spacey \"Dancing Girl,\" in which Callier displays this novel combination of acoustic folk guitar with this soulful, yearning voice that seems to revoke all the best characteristics of sixty's\/seventy's black soul, but at the same time transcend the structural trappings of the genre. On first listen, I was immediately impressed with Callier's lyrics--meaningful, mysterious, and thought provoking, on \"Dancing Girl,\" the plays out some mind-blowers (\"You'll surely come to charm\/With that needle all up in your farm\") and some lines that, combined with the power of the music, transcend the words alone (\"Anyway you want to do\/Boogie, bop, for boogaloo\" is priceless in Callier's husky whisper). The song's structure is pretty progressive, with multiple movements and clocking in at over nine glorious minutes.\"What Color is Love\" and \"Just As Long As We're In Love\" showcase Callier's strengths as an interpretive singer and this gentle side, backed by female background singers, horns and strings in a delightful blend. \"You Goin' To Miss Your Candyman\" is one of the album's greatest tracks, with the funkiest soul bassline since Marvin Gaye's \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),\" and showcasing Callier's uniformly tight, gnarly rhythm section, which often includes some sick bass lines and bongo drums. \"Ho Tsing Mee\" is a contemplative protest song, deceptively gentle at the beginning, building to a barnstorming climax with Callier's plaintive scat\/howl elevating the song to great heights. \"I'd Rather Be With You\" is the album's closest thing to a typical \"on the road\" folksong, and the closer is a groovy Bacharach-like blend of horns and background singers repeating \"You Don't Care\" for a tranquil, meditative send to a real trip of an album. Terry Callier is one of the greatest relatively unknown artists I've discovered lately, and I can't help but recommend him as highly as I can. I'm looking forward to checking out this other classics, and maybe some of this newer music, which I heard is also excellent. Take a chance--I think you'll find Callier rewarding.","overall":5,"summary":"Folk-soul-R&B-jazz masterpiece, sadly unheard-of in USA","unixReviewTime":1179446400,"reviewTime":"05 18, 2007"}

In \"Dance Girl\", an interesting play was played (\"You will definitely be pulled \/ taken by the needle on your farm\") and other lines, combined with the power of music, transcend individual words (\"Anything you want to do \/ Buji, Pop, Bugalu\" is not a good thing for Kalier Price). The composition of the song is very advanced, has a lot of action, and the time is over nine minutes. \"What color of love\" and \"As long as we love each other\" show Kalier's strength as an interpreter and side effects, backed by a mix of female back singers, French horns and strings. \"You're Gonna Throw Your Candyman\" is one of the best songs on the album. It has been the most fashionable never since Marvin Gaye's \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Want Holler)\" and has shown that Callier remains a strong, rough part of the rhythm, often consisting of pathological bass lines and bongo drums. \"Ho Tsing Mee\" is a contemplative protest song that seems soft at first. \"I'd Like to Be With You\" is the closest thing to a regular song \"on the way\" to this album, and next to a Bacharach-songwriter and rear-chanted singer who cares for \"care\", Meditation sends a real travel album.

As you know, this album was the first full-length recording of Rod Stewart. The group was a supergroup; guitarist Jeff Beck, vocalist Rod Stewart, bassist Ron Wood,Keyboardist Nicky Hopkins and drummer Micky Waller(who later played on some of Rod's best solo albums). For this release,EMI gives you all the expected bonus tracks and then some. You get previously unreleased outtake versions of \"Blues DeLuxe\" & \"You Shook Me\"(both remixed from the original multitracks), the original UK mono single version of \"Beck's Bolero\"(yes, as we're aware, there's no stereo mix of this track, which was recorded in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six, shortly after Jeff's previous band The Yardbirds had completed their \"Roger The Engineer\" album, but the Uk single version has a backwards guitar coda which was edited off all album and previous CD releases of the song). Incidentally,\"Beck's Bolero\" was recorded with Keith Moon,John Paul Jones,Jimmy Page & Nicky Hopkins. Also, you get first-time-in stereo two thousand and five remixes of \"I've Been Drinking\",\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\" & \"Rock My Plimsoul\"(the first version; the single take with Aynsley Dunbar on drums). The new remix of \"I've Been Drinking\" corrects a problem present on the original mono mix which caused a rejected, alternate lyric Rod Stewart vocal to leak through in the part of the song after the guitar solo. The unwanted vocal has now been ninety-five% squelched. The stereo remix of \"Rock My Plimsoul\" is fine and musically identical to the mono single, however, it should be cautioned that due to some live-during-mono mixdown guitar & vocal overdubs on the original mono single mix of \"Hi Ho Silver Lining\", that the new stereo remix is missing one of the three lead guitar parts during the guitar solo, and the high vocal harmonies are missing during the song's choruses. The disc also includes the original mono single mixes of \"Tallyman\" & \"Love is Blue\". My guess is that either EMI could't find the multitracks for those two selections, for they did find them, but found a station similar to the situation on \"Hi Ho Silver Lining\"; that musically identical(to the original single) stereo mixes were't possible. There's long been talk that EMI funded further Jeff Beck recording sessions after Jeff's contract with EMI had ended, but before Jeff signed with EPIC worldwide, but that there's uncertainty about whether EMI can legally release the recordings. When Jeff's manager has enquired about the recordings,EMI's Abbey Road Studios tape vault has denied holding them, though compilers who have done projects for EMI have said otherwise. I hope that someday that ownership issue will be resolved. Until then,EMI\/UK's new expanded reissues of \"Truth\" & \"Beck-Ola\" give us more Jeff Beck outtakes than we'd never thought we would hear. Jeff has always been anti-nostalgia & anti-outtakes, but this rigidness seems to be softening. He's even cooperated and been interviewed for the (fine) liner notes which accompany both discs.

Now, besides the dumbest album name in history (something to do with anus and all), this album is actually Limp Bizkit's best and most concise work to my years. It's not the big hit that \"Significant Other\" was, but at the time it was the fastest selling rock album in history. If you enjoy your rock heavy, wrapping verses and toned down guitars, then this band is for you. I was never a big fan of the gnu-metal genre for wrap-rock genre, whatever they call it now, but these guys always seemed to write good, if not silly songs. Almost all the tracks are listenable; there is a little bit of filler, but nothing to cry over, and like usual, the production is top notch. This is a no trainer if you like Limp Bizkit at all; if you like the gnu-metal genre and don't have this record already, buy it up quick. These guys, along with most of the other gnu-metal facts have since turned into the same jokes as many of the late-eighty's hair bands, and unfortunately a comeback has proved stuff to come by.","overall":5,"summary":"4.5 stars for Limp Bizkit's third album","unixReviewTime":1371081600,"reviewTime":"06 13, 2013"}

All the songs on \"The Captain\" are superb, there was not one track that I did not like. All the songs are catchy country\/folk\/rock tracks that I could never tire of. I understand what made Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, and Dwight Yoakam fall in love with Kasey Chambers. Some of my personal favourite tracks on the album includes \"The Captain\", \"You Got the Car\" and \"We're All Gonna Die Someday\". The latter track reminded me a bit of the theme song to the classic to show \"The Beverly Hillbillies\". I could almost swear that is where Kasey got the hooks from.

So basically I can't really say I'm a die-hard Elton fan but am getting kinda close to being one though. Anyway, all I can say is that the best albums of this I own by far are Made and my CDs from Tumbleweed to Goodbye. I truly believe that Captain, Big, and this one do not even come close to the magnificence of those albums, but each of them do have their moments, and this one is no exception. Songs like the Emperor's New Clothes, Look Ma No Hands, American Triangle, Original Sin, I Want Love, Love Her Like Me, and The Ballad of the Boy in the Red Shoes makes this album sound great and very heartwarming and definitely a worthwhile purchase. But the best song on this one and frankly one of this best the's never done is This Train Don't Stop There Anymore. That one song is simply superb. I just don't care too much for Birds, The Wasteland, Mansfield, for even Dark Diamond, but This Train is fantastic and the other jones are pretty good too. Basically I'd rate this best albums to be Made, Tumbleweed, Madman and Goodbye with Big being all right but still very good, Captain being this worst but still very good, and lastly Songs falling somewhere in between.

The album came to be after Dennis' Styx bandmate guitarist\/singer\/songwriter Tommy Shaw walked from the band during the mixing sessions of the band's Caught in the Act double live album. After Tommy resigned, guitarist James \"JY\" Young and The Panozzo brothers (John on drums and Chuck on bass guitar) wanted to push Styx forward but Dennis said no. Until Tommy was ready to come back, Dennis went in the studio in the spring of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four to record this first solo album producing, playing keyboards, singing and writing all of the tracks (except as noted). Helping Dennis was guitarist Tom Dziallo (who is still Dennis' guitarist in this solo band), drummer Tom Radtke and sax-man Steve Eisen (who appeared on the final three Styx albums of the classic lineup). I was first exposed to the album thanks to (partially being a Styx fan by this point at page weight) and also the title cut's exposure on MTV and I got the forty-five with Desert Moon and Gravity. A week later, I got the album on cassette tape in December, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four and managed to wear this album out. For years tried to replace but only could get cassettes and then A&M; Records are-released the album with remastered sound in two thousand and one on CD and what an album. We open with the rocker \"Don't Wait For Heroes\" which is inspirational and fun and the second single from the album. The video for this said what the lyrics stated the real winners \"are losers who get up and give it one more try\" and a message that rings true to those who had to overcome being told no. Next is another up-tempo rocker in \"Please\" which features Rosemary Butler (famed for her duet vocal on Jackson Browne's \"Stay\" on this Running on Empty album in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven and her work with Linda Ronstadt) duetting with Dennis and the song rocks. Next is the heights New Wave rock style meets fifty style singing Broadway number \"Boys Will Be Boys\" which is a fun and uplifting number and a guilty pleasure of mine. The first side ends with \"Fire\" which is a bluesy remake of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven Jimi Hendrix original (and yes, it does indeed hold its own) and Tommy Dziallo did the bluesy arrangement of this track. The second side starts with Desert Moon's title track which reached #ten on the Billboard singles chart which speaks of the things one lost from childhood and gained from adulthood though memories from the past don't leave. Next is \"Suspicious\" which is a nice mid-tempo number and features great guitar work from Dziallo and a superb synthesizer solo at the send from DeYoung. Next is \"Gravity\" which is another great rocker and an awesome song. We close the album with the ballad \"Dear Darling (I'll Be There)\". Desert Moon was Dennis' first, and to date only, successful project outside of Styx. The album hit #twenty-nine on the Billboard album charts and sold over five hundred, zero copies going Gold in the process. For those who want Dennis DeYoung solo works outside of Styx go with this album and the upcoming One Hundred Years From Now (which is this best solo work since this album).

It tells of how people lost their childhood and the benefits of old page, although memories of the past will not pass away.

I mean, those are some of the great RHCP songs!!! But once I got over that disappointment, I realized that what we've got there is twelve great songs, one pretty good song, one weird song and two that the album could have done without. I WOULD DIE FOR YOU and MIDNIGHT are the two I always skip. Just a bit unimaginative a monotonous. The weird one is WARM TAPE. Sometimes I hear it and it sounds cheesy, and other times it's almost sexy. Certainly the lyric \"Shiver for me girl\" is a good one! I can't describe the song though. You've got to hear it for yourself. The pretty good song is THE ZEPHYR SONG, which is getting a lot of airplay. It's okay, kinda breezy, but just does't revoke any strong feelings. The rest of the album is absolutely top notch. These guys can really write the itunes now. CALIFORNICATION (which is brilliant too) served as a kind of bridge from their rougher, earlier stuff to these textured, complex melodies. The hit single BY THE WAY, which kicks off the album is INSTANTLY, INSTANTLY, INSTANTLY catchy. I was ready to using along halfway through the song on the first listen. Other standouts include the driving CAN'T STOP, the delightful UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING and the latin-flavored CABRON. Lyrically, the songs are often difficult to grasp. Don't look for linear meaning. They revoke moods, feelings and random images. But Anthony Kiedis sings with real feeling, and the musicianship is first rate all the way through. They all do their best work as musicians and songwriters, never. Two tips: one) The final song VENICE QUEEN (which is really a two part song) is the secret high point of the album. It builds with a gorgeous, quiet riff and grows in power. It could almost have been on Californication, with its West-Coast centric imagery, but I find it a bracing conclusion to this album. two) Listen to the album with headphones. there is SO much subtlety that you easily miss otherwise, especially some of the grace notes and such that guitarist John Frusciante throws in. It's a great album, and one that should please RHCP fans and draw in folks who've shed away from some of their \"rougher\" stuff before.","overall":5,"summary":"Approaches genius","unixReviewTime":1042070400,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2003"}

I mean, these are some great RHCP songs! ! ! But when I finished that disappointment, I realized that we had twelve good songs, one very good song, one very unusual song, and two albums that would not be so. I'm going to die and at midnight I'm always jumping. It\u2019s just unthinkable and scary. The odd thing is SHORT TAPE. Sometimes I feel it, it sounds tacky, sometimes it\u2019s almost charming. The words \"Shiver for me girl\" are really fun! Although I can't describe this song. You need to listen to it yourself. The most beautiful song is PHYR'S SONG, and it's very played.

CALIFORNICATION (also very good) facts as a bridge from their original works to these theme songs. The WAY song at the beginning of the album is fast, instantaneous, and instantly interesting. I will use the first half to listen to this song. Some of the highlights include driving a GIFT FORWARD, fun to TALK ABOUT UNIVERSALLY and Latin-style CABRON. In terms of lyrics, these songs are often difficult to understand. Do not look at the meaning of distance. They remove emotions, feelings and unplanned images. But Anthony Kiedis was singing emotionally, and this musical powers had a beginning from the beginning to the send. As musicians and songwriters, they all do their best, never before. Two tips: one) The last song VENICE QUEEN (actually a two-part song) is the top secret of the album. It is based on positive, quiet improvements and gradually increases its power. It may be almost a picture focused on the West Coast of California, but I found it to be a fun ending to this album. B) Listen to an album with phones. There\u2019s a lot of subtlety, otherwise it\u2019s easy to miss, especially the beautiful notes set by guitarist John Frusciante.

I purchased it when it initially came out and liked it a lot, but it's one of those CD's that gets better with each listen so I wanted to let those people who love pop in it's purest form to give this a try. Daniel Bedingfield has put together a great collection of songs (a little of everything) and it all works so well that the singles keep coming at the listener and they could all be potential singles. The problem with Daniel is that the is difficult to market as this songs are pure pop music that will please both the TRL crowd and older listeners who tend to have a bias against what they may incorrectly perceive a kiddie-pop. But no review of this release can be comprehensive if it does not address the warmth of Bedingfield's voice. Without the histrionics of some of this counterparts, the does manage to leave a strong impression by feeling, not just hitting (or doing vocal gymnastics) the highs and flows. I particularly like the flow of the release and was surprised that it was self-produced. What I find astonishing is that one can clearly see the influence of US pop and R&B; music on this release, but instead of being a knock-off, Bedingfield seems to surpass all this influences.

Daniel\u2019s problem is that it\u2019s hard to sell because these songs are pure pop music and will please the TRL crowd and the older audience, who are often inclined to things they can mistakenly think of as children\u2019s pop music. However, if Bedingfield's warm voice were not addressed, comments on this version would not be extensive. Aside from the performance of other peers, they left a positive impression of feeling, not beating (or doing vocal gymnastics) at climax and walking.

The \"First Time Ever I\" heard Johnny Cash sang a movie track, I was shocked by the non-metered poetry. My father said \"Johnny Cash is known to tell a story rather than using in rhyme.\" Years later through Classical music I learned that one was allowed to do such a thing. The \"First Time Ever I\" never bought a Johnny Cash CD was \"Johnny Cash's Greatest Hits Volume I\" because I collect music to match with my slide shows & don't play this type of CDs for normal listening pleasure. The \"First Time Ever I\" heard Johnny Cash sang \"Hurt\" was at work a few years ago. All day long my business environment is a battle ground between Rap & Mex-Tex. All of a sudden a deep worn out voice sang about spiritual depravity & hope that I was blown away. \"Who is singing?\" I asked a fellow worker who also does't listen to Rap for Mex-Tex. \"That's Johnny Cash singing a song by Nine Inch Nails\" came the reply. That sure makes a strange combo. The \"First Time Ever I\" saw Johnny Cash using \"Hurt\" as a music video was in between two PBS shows on TV. Normally PBS always shows this station break about southern California during the top of the hour because they have so few commercials. Why this one day PBS played a music video during that time I have no idea, but I was hooked. I had to get Johnny Cash's last CD \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" with the DVD short \"Hurt\". The references to a \"You can't take it with you\" type of philosophy with the death of this wife & Jesus on the across was most moving. The \"First Time Ever I\" heard Johnny Cash using \"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" was on this CD & was pleasantly surprised on how well it could be sang from a male perspective. When the song came out in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's by Roberta Flack, the radio stations over played it & I was into progressive rock. The song did't move me as it does now. Years later the song was one of the few I liked from my wife's CD \"Celine Dion - All the Way. A Decade of Song\". Therefore \"Hurt\" & \"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" made me see Johnny Cash as an understated musical genius because the can be so successful at experimentation. The rest of the CD \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" has its ups & downs, but this review is written from a person that normally does't listen to Country music. The highlights are \"The Man Comes Around\" which is Country but though Johnny Cash's skill & spiritual background reveals the last days with a tang. Paul Simon's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" is done with a deep heart felt passion that makes for a welcome addition. John Lennon \/ Paul McCartney's \"In My Life\" is very upfront & clear which showcases Johnny Cash's timber. Ross Parker \/ Hugh Charles's jazzy \"We'll Meet Again\" makes for a great ending that one wonders if Johnny Cash could have made it as a Jazz singer. There are some songs that may hold a surprise like Martin Gore's \"Personal Jesus\" that Johnny Cash twists around to the positive & Sting's \"I Hung My Head\" which sounds very Country. The balance of the CD has some Country classics that are done with great skill while others repeat the same words for rhythm. If you are not a Country music fan but have respect for an American icon that takes chances, this CD will not let you down. Because I liked this CD DVD combination so well, I am going to check out a few other of Johnny Cash`s \"American\" series. Johnny if your listening, I hope \"We'll Meet Again\".","overall":4,"summary":"First Time Ever I","unixReviewTime":1111190400,"reviewTime":"03 19, 2005"}

My father said, \"It is well known that Johnny Cash tells stories rather than reciting rituals.\" Years later, I learned about classical music and how people can do such things. \"I never bought a Johnny Cash CD for the first time in history.\" It's Johnny Cash's Greatest Hits Volume I \"because I collect music to match my slide show and don't play such CDs for fun listening. A few years ago,\" I first heard Johnny Cash using \"Pain\" at work. My place of business is a battlefield between Rap and Mex-Tex all day. Suddenly, a deep, tired voice sang a song about mental breakdown, in the hope that I would be blown away. \"Who's singing?\" I asked a colleague who had never listened to a Mex-Tex wrap. \"That's Johnny Cash singing the song In Nine Inch Nails\". That must be a strange combination. \"For the first time in my life\" I saw Johnny Cash using \"Pain\" as a music video between two PBS shows on TV. Normally PBS always shows this radio break about Southern California per hour because it has very few commercials. Why this one day PBS played a music video at a time I don\u2019t know, but I was curious. I should get the latest CD \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" by Johnny Cash and the short DVD \"Hurt\". The mention of \"you can not\" remove the kind of philosophy and the death of this woman and Jesus in contrast are the most touching. \"For the first time\" I hear Johnny Cash use \"I saw your face for the first time\" on this CD, and I was very surprised to find that the sang so well from a men's point of view. When Roberta Flack's song was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, radio stations played a lot, and I was very busy with savant-garde rock. This song did not touch me as much as it does now. Years later, this song is one of my favourite songs on my wife's CD \"Celine Dion-Along the Way. Ten years of songs\". So, \"It Hurts\" and \"I Saw Your Face for the First Time\" made me think of Johnny Cash as a low-key music genius because the was so successful in trials. The remaining CD \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" has its ups and downs, but this review has been written by a stranger listening to country music. The highlight is \"The Man Comes Around\", which is a country, but Johnny Cash's skills and spiritual background reveal the last days. Paul Simon's \"Overpowered Water Bridge\", completed with great enthusiasm, is a welcome addition. John Lennon \/ Paul McCartney's \"In My Life\" is straightforward and clear, showing Johnny Cash's stickiness. Rose Parker \/ Hugh Charles' jazz song \"We Will Meet Again\" has created a good ending that makes people wonder if Johnny Cash could be a jazz musician. Some songs may shock people, such as Johnny Cash\u2019s non-fiction description like the good song \u201cPersonal Jesus\u201d and Sting\u2019s \u201cI Hung My Head\u201d, which sounds very Rustic. The CD balance consists of certain country classics, performed with great skill, while others repeat the same words in rhythm. If you are not a fan of country music, but you respect an American idol that is brave enough to take risks, this CD will not disappoint you. Because I really like the DVD compilation, I will be watching some of the \"American\" series by Johnny Cash. Johnny, if you listen, I hope \"we'll meet again\".","overall":4,"summary":"First Time Ever I","unixReviewTime":1111190400,"reviewTime":"03 19, 2005"}

In two thousand and three, Mariah Carey had released her thirteenth album entitled, \"The Remixes\", a double-disc album that features many of Mariah Carey's greatest songs, all remixed. Some of the songs were remixed by studio equipment. Others were remixed by Mariah are-recording the songs with different music and lyrics. This remix album is absolutely amazing in every way. Disc One: Studio Produced Dance Club RemixesMY ALL (Morales \"My\" Club Mix)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). The original version of \"My All\", which can be found on Mariah Carey's \"Butterfly\" album, is a beautiful ballad, that is composed with a beautiful Spanish sound. Who knew that a beautiful ballad that requires slow-dancing, can be remixed into a version where you can get your groove on?(Medley) HEARTBREAKER\/IF YOU SHOULD EVER BE LONELY (Junior's \"Heartbreaker\" Club Mix)Original version of \"Heartbreaker\" from the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). New song. Mariah had remixed the music of Heartbreaker and remixed her vocals, all by studio equipment. But also extended the song, in order for her to record, \"If You Should Ever Be Lonely (Deep In The Night)\", making this remix of \"Heartbreaker\" a medley, instead of only being a remix. So, it is a remix medley. This is an incredible remix medley. FLY AWAY (BUTTERFLY REPRISE) (Fly Away Club Mix)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). Incredible dance remix. ANYTIME YOU NEED A FRIEND (C&C; Club Version)Original version from the album Music Box (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three). Although, this remix is great to dance to, I prefer the ballad version. FANTASY (Def Club Mix)Original version from the album Daydream (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five). Not bad. HONEY (Classic Mix)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). Not bad. DREAMLOVER (Def Club Mix)Original version from the album Music Box (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three). I prefer this dance remix over the original version. EMOTIONS (twelve\" Club Mix)Original version from the album Emotions (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one). This is much better than the original version. THROUGH THE RAIN (HQtwo Radio Edit)Original version from the album Charmbracelet (two thousand and two). Both the original version, which was recorded as a ballad, and this incredible dance version are unbelievable. Disc Two: Re-Recorded RemixesFANTASY (Remix) (featuring O. D. B.)Original version from the album Daydream (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five). Remix from the album #one's (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight). The music to the song was remixed a bit, Mariah's vocals are untouched, except for the choruses. The original choruses are taken out and are replaced by the bridge of the song. Ol' Dirty Bastard hit the studio to provide this dieting vocals to the song. An incredible remix. ALWAYS BE MY BABY (Mr. Dupri Mix) (featuring Da Brat & Xscape)Original version from the album Daydream (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five). The music was completely remixed and Mariah's vocals are untouched. Da Brat & Xscape had hit the studio to provide their dieting craps to the song. Great remix.(Medley) MY ALL\/STAY AWHILE (So So Def Remix) (featuring Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz)Original version of \"My All\" from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). This medley was treated the same way as \"(Medley) Heartbreaker\/If You Should Ever Be Lonely\", only Mariah brought in Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz to provide craps for the song. Hate it. THANK GOD I FOUND YOU (Make It Last Remix) (featuring Joe & Naz)Original version from the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). The original version of \"Thank God I Found You\" was composed as a ballad, where Mariah Carey had ninety-eight Degrees & Joe on that version. That version is the one I prefer. The music to the song was remixed, where Mariah Carey are-recorded the verses with Joe, and Nas. Hate it. BREAKDOWN (featuring Krazyzie Bone & Wishbone of Bone Thugs 'N Harmony)From the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). I don't why she included this song because it is not a remix. I hate this song. HONEY (So So Def Mix) (featuring Da Brat & JD)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). Not a bad remix. LOVERBOY (Remix) (featuring Ludacris, Shawnna, Da Brat, & Twenty II)From the album Glitter (two thousand and one). Both the album version & this remix are featured on Mariah's album, \"Glittler\". The album version is a duet with Cameo. This remix is no different from the original version. The music is untouched, Mariah's vocals are untouched. The song is just extended in order for Ludacris, Shawnna, Da Brat, & Twenty II to provide their craps. Cameo's verse has been taken out. Great remix. HEARTBREAKER (Remix) (featuring Da Brat & Missy Elliott)From the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). Both the original version & this remix are featured on Mariah's album entitled, \"Rainbow\". The original version is a duet with Jay-Z. This remix is very different from the original version. The music to the original took up a Pop\/Rap sound. The music to this remix is strictly a Rap sound. Mariah Carey did are-record the first two verses. She kept the original lyrics to the first verse and sang them in the same key as the original, but she sang it a little more sexier. But the second verse was changed, with different lyrics, where Mariah sang it in a different key. The choruses are kept the same. Da Brat & Missy Elliott provide their own craps. Great remix. SWEETHEART (featuring JD)From the album #one's (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight). Don't believe what you read. The album version is the version you see there: a duet with JD. There is no remix, as far as I'm concerned. Not bad. CRYBABY (featuring Snoop Dogg)From the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). Don't believe what you read. The album version is the version you see there: a duet with Snoop Dogg. There is no remix, as far as I'm concerned. Hate it. MISS YOU (featuring Jadakiss)Previously unreleased. This song is not a remix. This song was included on the UK release of Mariah's album, \"Charmbracelet\". Most fans liked the song, but could not get it on the U. S. release of \"Charmbracelet\", for any of Mariah's single releases. So, she included it there. THE ONE (So So Def Mix) (featuring Bonecrusher)Previously unreleased. Hate it. I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT (featuring Busta Rhymes & The Flipmode Squad)From Busta Rhymes' album It Ain't Safe No More (two thousand and two). Most fans really enjoyed this song because Busta actually sings on it, instead of wrapping. I don't care for this song. This is an album, in which Mariah's fans had been waiting for. Not all the songs on this album are worth the time, in my opinion, but most of the album is definitely worth the money. Anyway, take out your wallets and buy the remixes you've been wanting to own since Mariah's debut.","overall":5,"summary":"The Remixes (2003)","unixReviewTime":1098403200,"reviewTime":"10 22, 2004"}

Mariah's album \"Rainbow\" contains the first version and this combined version. The first version is a duet with Jay-Z. This mixture is very different from the original version. The original music captures the sound of pop \/ wrap. The music of this mix speaks directly to the sound of wrap. Mariah Carey recorded the first two verses. He kept the original words of the first part and sang them in the same way as the first, but the sang it in a more interesting way. But the second verse was changed, and the words were different, and Maria sang them a different key. The choir remains unchanged. Da Brat and Missy Elliott gave their craps. Great mix. Dear (shown by JD) on the album # one's (Nine hundred and eighty-eight). Don't believe what you are reading. The album version is the version you see there: a duet with JD. In my case, there is no mixing. That's OK. CRYBABY (presented by Snoop Dogg) was selected from the album \"Rainbow\" (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). Don't believe what you are reading. The album version is the version you see there: the duet with Snoop Dogg. In my case, there is no mixing. Hate it. Miss You (and Jadakiss as the protagonist) has never been released before.

Highsmith","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"Ever since I heard the honest single \"Player's Ball\", from their debut CD \"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\", I have been a fan of Outkast. This CD opened doors for lot of groups from the South that are around now. I could give you a page long list of my favourite songs from Outkast. They always give you an innovative sound each time around. They also are not afraid to try new things. \"ATliens\", \"Aquemini\", and \"Stankonia\" are classic albums just as much as their debut CD was. Sometimes, it this hard to follow a blueprint when your fans expect you to create the hits like \"Elevators\", \"Rosa Parks\", \"B. O. B\", \"Ms. Jackson\" and \"So Fresh And So Clean\". With \"Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below\", Outkast has brought you one solo CD from Big Boi and one solo CD from Andre three thousand. Although they are packaged together, you will clearly see that both of these CDs are entirely different from one another. Big Boi does't stray too far away from the Outkast sound. The Andre three thousand produced \"Ghettomusick\" is a fast paced roller coaster ride that only slows down long enough for a Patti Labelle sample. Big Boi drops a memorable sixteen bars and Outkast fans will not be disappointed at all. \"Unhappy\" has Big Boi talking about someone who might as well try to have a little fun before there misfortunes send up catching with them. \"Bowtie\" falls right in line with the honest single from \"Speakerboxxx\", \"The Way You Move\". Sleepy Brown is featured on both songs and they are both \"feel good\" type of songs. He definitely made the right choice for the first single with \"The Way You Move\" as Big Boi's fast paced craps are slowed down with Sleepy Brown's voice and an orchestra full of horns. This is definitely one of Speakerboxxx's better tracks. \"The Rooster\" has a \"Ms. Jackson\" feel to it, but it won't make you miss \"Ms. Jackson\" at all. You'll probably laugh at what the is saying if anything. \"Church\" is another one of those \"feel good\" songs from Big Boi. If you karen't careful, you might even wake up in a pew. \"War\" is a song that you will actually try to listen to what the is saying eventhough the song has two different beats to it. \"Tomb Of The Boom\" is a lyrical free for all between Big Boi, Ludacris, Big Gipp from Gooide Mob and Konkrete. This is another one of my favourite songs from \"Speakerboxxx\" so far and Big Boi definitely dropped a nice beat for the song. \"Flip Flop Rock\" has Big Boi, Jay Z and Killer Mike wrapping over a fast paced beat and the collaboration works once again as the three MCs were already featured with Twista on Jay Z's \"Poppin' Tags\". \"Reset\" features Big Boi, Cee Lo and Khujo Goodie. This track reminds you of earlier Goodie Mob tracks and will have you wishing that the original group was still making hits like \"Cell Therapy\" and \"They Don't Dance No Mo\". Speakerboxxx does't feature any wack tracks. The only song that I may not listen to at times is \"Last Call\" because you hear Mello more than you do Big Boi. Overall, if you are used to the Outkast sound, \"Speakerboxxx\" is an extension of that.\"The Love Below\", however, is something entirely different. If you thought that Andre three thousand would be dropping' the classic bars that you are used to, then you are in for a surprise. Primarily, Andre three thousand is singing and talking on most of the tracks. The only song that the is actually wrapping on for the whole song is \"A Day In The Life Of Benjamin Andre\". Other than that, you will hear Andre singing the blues, singing like Prince and actually trying to hold a note. Now while it took me a couple of listens to get used to this, Andre's formal actually works on some occasions. \"Prototype\" is definitely The Love Below's best track. The song takes place as Andre has just had a one night stand with a woman that the is now feeling and now it's the morning after. Andre expresses this feelings through song and \"Prototype\" reminds me of an old school slow jam. \"She Lives In My Lap\" features the lovely Rosario Dawson and should have been the first single. Yes there definitely is a Prince \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" feel to it but the track works more wonders than \"Hey Ya\". \"Spread\" does the same as well, except the actually craps on \"Spread\". You will be trying to figure out what Prince song that Andre three thousand is remaking but this is an original creation. \"Happy Valentine's Day\" is Andre's version of a feel good song and is nice to actually hear him wrapping as well. The only song that Big Boi is featured on is \"Roses\". He drops another memorable verse as Andre is telling women that \"Roses\" karen't always what they appear to be, referring to females. Some songs on \"The Love Below\" don't work for me though. \"Love Hater\" has Andre sounding like a thirty-nine year old blues singer singing at a local club. \"Dracula's Wedding\" featuring Kelis does't either. However, the George Clinton\/Parliament feel of the song is starting to grow on me. \"Hey Ya\" should have never been released. Yes the video is colourful and is actually pretty good, but the song sounds like a fifty limitation of Little Richard, if anything. \"My Favorite Things\" should have been kept in the studio. I don't need to hear an instrumental of the song on Andre's CD. If you can get past Andre three thousand singing all the time, you can enjoy \"The Love Below\". The music is nice, but you have to get use to Andre's antics on the songs. Overall, Outkast did a good job, marketing wise, by releasing both of these CDs in one package at one price. If you are used to the traditional Outkast sound, \"Speakerboxxx\" will be the better CD for you. If you like \"Hey Ya\", then \"The Love Below\" may be better for you. However, if you are an Outkast fan you can't afford to pass up on these two CDs packaged as one. The music is good and the sound is still innovative as usual.

This CD opened the door to many groups now from the South. I can give you a long list of my favourite Outkast songs. They will give you a new voice all the time. They are not afraid to try new things. \"ATliens\", \"Aquemini\" and \"Stankonia\" are all old albums similar to their first CD. Sometimes, when your fans expect you to do hit songs like \"Elevators\", \"Rosa Parks\", \"B. O. B\", \"Mrs. Jackson\" and \"So Fresh And So Clean\", it's hard to follow the plan. With \"Speakerboxxx \/ The Love Beyond\", Outkast brings you one CD by Big Boi and one CD by Andre three thousand. Although packed together, you will see clearly that these two CDs are completely different from each other. Big Boi will not turn away from the sound of Outkast. The \"Ghettomusick\" produced by Andre three thousand is a rough speed that is slow enough for Patti Labelle to make a sample. Big Boi has dropped sixteen unforgettable bars, and Outkast fans will not be disappointed at all. \"Unhappiness\" makes Big Boye talk about someone trying to be happy before disaster strikes. \"Bowtie\" is accompanied by authentic songs from \"Speakerboxxx\" and \"The Way You Go\". Brown Sleep comes from two songs, and both \"feel good\" class songs. You have to make the right choice for the first single \"The Way You Go\" because Big Boi's quick craps slowed down the sound of Sleepy Brown and a full-blown orchestra. This is definitely one of the best Spikboxbox discussions. \"Rooster\" has the feeling of \"Mrs. Jackson\", but it won't make you miss \"Mrs. Jackson\" at all. If anything, you may laugh at what it says. \"Church\" is another song that \"felt good\" by Big Boi. If you are not careful, you may get up on the bench. \"War\" is a song, and you'll try to hear what it says, even if the song has two different players. \"Tomb of The Boom\" is a free song between Big Boi, Ludacris, Gooide Mob's Big Gipp and Concrete. This is one of my favourite songs \"Speakerboxxx\" so far, and Big Boi has certainly played a good song. \"Flip Flop Rock\" allowed Big Boi, Jay Z, and Killer Mike to complete a quick hit. The collaboration of the three MCs also worked because the three MCs are already competing with Jay Z \"Poppin'Tags\" Twista. cooperation. \"Reset\" includes Big Boy, Hilo, and Cujo Gudi. This song reminds you of the original Goodie Mob songs and gives you hope that the original band is still performing songs like \"Cell Therapy\" and \"Dancers, No Mo\". Somboxboxxx does not have any unusual tracks. The only song I can't listen to is \"Last Call\" because you listen to Mello more often than Big Boi. In general, if you are familiar with the Outkast term, \"Speakerboxxx\" is its extension. However, \u201cLove More\u201d is a completely different thing. If you think Andre Sanqian will give up the old bar you're familiar with, you'll be amazed. First of all, Andre Sanqian sings and speaks in many repertoire. The only song included in the entire song is \"A Day in the Life of Benjamin Andre\". Otherwise, you\u2019ll hear Andre singing the blues, singing like a Prince, trying to keep a note. Now even though I listened to it a few times before I got used to it, Andre\u2019s real approach works sometimes. \"Prototype\" is certainly the best track of Love Beyond. The song happened just after Andre had one night with this wife, and now the feels like tomorrow. Andre expresses this feeling in songs, and the \"prototype\" reminds me of an old school jam. \"She sits on my lap\" shows the beloved Rosario Dawson and should be the first. Yes, there must be a prince feeling like \"If I were your daughter\", but this song is more magical than \"Hey Ya\". The same goes for \"Spread\", with the exception of the actual roll of dice in \"Spread\". He'll try to understand the Prince's song that Andre Sanchez has done again, but this is the first work. \"Happy Valentine's Day\" is a version of Andrei's song that feels good, and it's fun to hear this packaging. The only song \"Big Rosi\" is \"Roses\". When Andre told the women that \"Rose\" Karen did't always look like us, the made another memorable verse referring to women. However, some of the songs in \"Love below\" did not work for me. \"Love Hater\" makes Andre sound like a thirty-nine-year-old blues singer who sings at a local club. There is no \u201cDracula Marriage\u201d with Kellys as the main character. However, the George Clinton \/ Council sentiment for this song began to grow in me. \"Hey Ya\" should not be released. Yes, the video is rich, not bad, but this song sounds like Richard's Fifty Borders, if any. \"My favourites\" should be kept in the studio. I don't have to listen to Andre's CD player music. If you can using Andre's threerd album all the time, you can enjoy \"Love Below\". The music is good, but you have to get used to Andre's antics in the song. Overall, Outkast did a good job in marketing and released two CDs in one package for the same price. If you are familiar with the standard Outkast sound, \"Speakerboxxx\" will be the right CD for you. If you like \"hey\", then \"this next love\" might be more appropriate. However, if you are an Outkast fan, you will not miss these two CDs packed in one. The music is good and the sound is still translation as usual.

Go to your record store right NOW and ask a grown-up for the following: Eric B. & Rakim's \"Paid in Full,\" Stevie Wonder's \"Songs in the Key of Life,\" A Tribe Called Quest's \"Low End Theory,\" Public Enemy's \"Fear of a Black Planet,\" Parliament's \"Funkentelechy tvs. The Placebo Syndrome,\" Beatles' \"Abbey Road,\" Sly Stone's \"There's A Riot Goin' On,\" Led Zeppelin's \"Houses of the Holy,\" Curtis Mayfield's \"Superfly,\" John Coltrane's \"A Love Supreme,\" Miles Davis' \"Kind of Blue,\" and Prince's \"Purple Rain.\" After you know each one of these by heart, go back and listen to Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below. Now, about the album(s). Some stand-outs on Big Boi's \"Speakerboxxx\" are:-\"Ghettomusick\" takes a trunk-thumpin beat, combines it with a tight-as-hell hook a la Dre, rapid-fire verses a la Big Boi, and throws in a Patti LaBelle sample that slinks in and out like a housecat.- \"Unhappy\" has a chorus that creeps under your skin. The rhyme is very introspective and it just ripples over the top of phat congas and synths.- \"Bowtie\" is an Old Skool party on wax. This joint uses brass to move your a**. Another one of those choruses that gets wedged in your brain: `Crocodile on my feet. Fox fur on my back. '- \"The Way You Move\" Yeah, even mainstream radio's playing it. The crux: bootylicious bass and Sleepy Brown getting as dangerously close to Billy Ocean as anyone never should.- \"The Rooster\" Another one of those choruses (with Chicken Dance Elmo doing background vocals, if I'm not mistaken. ) that sticks to you. Domestic disputes never sounded so funky for this damn funny.- \"Bust\" A dark, brooding than. It's like Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic got resurrected somehow and threw down with Big Boi and Killer Mike.- \"War\" A short track that comes in two parts. The first part's kind of a menacing preface to part deus, in which Big Boi lets loose with hard-hitting commentary on your post nine-eleven, post-stolen selection world.- \"Church\" A track asking the never-living question \"Why are we there?\" that makes you wonder who slipped a Kirk Franklin disc into your CD player when you were't looking.- \"Knowing\" Dre and Big Boi together, as it should be. Tight piano and percussion play the foundation for commentary on how this nasty world gets of(u)y.- \"Flip Flop Rock\" One of the catchiest hooks in years, courtesy of Jay Z. Throw in classical piano paired with a beat so undeniably funky that (unless you're dead for Republican) you'll find your neck snapping uncontrollably. I predict this to be the next platinum single off this album.- \"Reset\" a smooth joint with an ethereal feel--something that would fit well on \"ATLiens.\" Tight\/deep flows by Khujo and Cee-lo match Big Boi's brilliant verses. The rest of the album is disappointingly lacklustre, with Big Boi unnecessarily pairing up with lesser emcees. But over all: excellent. Now, Dre's \"The Love Below.\"It took about two listens for me to get into it, but the effort was worth it. If you give it a chance, you can catch the Bootsy, Prince, Sly, Stevie, get al. references; however, as much as Dre reminds me of the aforementioned royalty, the has a style all this own. The entire album is brilliant. Some stand-outs:- \"Love Hater\" is Dre changeling Nat Cole's croon thru George Clinton's sensibilities. A tight, jazzy joint with awesome piano.-\"Happy Valentines Day\" A funky joint with Dre on guitar and lead vocal that would make Prince turn from purple to green with envy.- \"Spread\" A sputtering drum-n-bass type song where Dre once again out-Princes Prince.- \"Prototype\" Smoothed out R&B;\/funk, reminiscent of Bootsy's \"Vanish in Our Sleep\" for the Ohio Players \"Heaven Must Be Like This.\" One of my favourites on there.- \"She Lives in My Lap\" is destined to be a classic. It has a head-nodding beat, tight guitar work, and smooth (`Damn, the sounds like Chico DeBarge') vocals. Like Prince's best work, this song is sexual, funky, and offbeat. Brilliant.- \"Hey Ya\" Top forty radio has beaten this `brown stallion those with skates on' to death. A good song, but not even close to being the best on the disc.- \"Roses\" A funky beat and heights-style synths ride behind Dre's chastising of gold diggers.- \"Behold A Lady\" The beat comes in like Cameo's \"Word Up\" with Dre crooning over the top. The breakdown is the crown jewel on this one: \"Cant get no lower. can't get no lower. \"- \"Pink & Blue\" A funk box, Moog synths, swirling strings that would be right at home on a Barry White joint, and Dre singing about a May-December relationship. Again, Prince should hang this head in shame.- \"She's Alive\" A heartfelt tribute to Dre's from and all single rooms. Just piano, brushes on snares, and Dre singing this guts out.- \"Dracula's Wedding\" Phat Moog bass, a wickedly clever lyric, and Kelis' milkshake vocals helping to smooth things out.- \"My Favorite Things\" Yes, the one from \"The Sound of Music.\" A tight drum-n-bass beat underlies amazing jazz piano and sax, plus a bassline that makes your thumbs hurt just listening to it.- \"Take Off Your Cool\" pairs Dre and Norah Jones. A short, jazzy track with silky vocals and Dre on acoustic guitar.- \"Vibrate\" curiously unfolds over the course of about seven minutes. It has a backward beat (\"She Lives in My Lap\" played backwards maybe?) with a trumpet solo that instantly brings to mind Miles.- \"A Life in the Day. \" sounds like \"Rosa Parks\" on Quaaludes. An interesting look back on the past decade of Outkast. In all: brilliant. Dre's a genius. Period.

Not only did the production improve on this album, but most importantly, T. I. has grown lyrically. This is evident on the tracks No Mo Talk, Long Live The Game, Kingofdasouth and I Still Luv U. In terms of production, Bezzle, Doin' My Job, Let's Get Away and Rubber Band Man are standouts. As with this other album, T. I. has something for a variety of audiences on there.

I especially like 'If I Could\" and \"My Little Town.\" But the quintessential song, \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" the timeless masterpiece, soars above all the others.

When I first heard `The Way We Ball', I thought it was wack and I was indiffent to Undaground Legend. Then the was featured on a couple albums such as Mississippi and Da Unbreakables, but this appearances were't amazing to me. He was just sorta there. To me the's not a great lyricist but the can at times be witty. Wit can carry you a far ways in the music industry. Anyway I felt that the was listenable but did't really have anything to say except for braggadocio and ghetto stories. But that's fine the has this place. However, that changes on this album as the churns out some great verses. His beats are tight, the has flow, and the has the \"it\" factor. Meaning the has some quality about him that makes people like him, makes people want to listen to him. and at the time I can't pinpoint exactly what it is. Maybe it's this swagger and confidence for it could be this Texas style sound for maybe it's the fact that the freestyles most of this songs. Whatever it is the has star like quality. Anyways Lil Flip delivers on the album. The beats are off the frigging chain. Nearly every song rides out. Tight. Lil Flip on the mic sounds like a seasoned veteran spitting fire most of the time. Sometimes the tends to spit some garbo but the makes up for it in flow and poise. He's just a cool character as experienced by this party tracks `Game Over' and `Ain't No Party'. I like this choruses as well. I also like how the lets the beat ride out at the send of each song. Of the whole two disc set NOT ONE SONG is plain out wack for unlistenable ( except for the screw songs simply cause I don't like screw music). There's not a song that makes you say `What is This?!\" and hit the fast forward button. My favourite songs include `I Came To Bring The Pain', Represent, Bounce, Game Over, Dem Boyz, Ain't No N, U Neva Know, and Ain't No Party. Lil Flip is, as the title suggests, somebody you have to feel. Either you'll like him for you won't. I have a feeling that this cd will grow to be one of my favourites of the year and maybe never. That's saying a lot. I highly recommend this cd to any fan of ship shop. five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"U Neva Know....Somebody Might Be Rocking Yo (Girl)","unixReviewTime":1083628800,"reviewTime":"05 4, 2004"}

When I heard \u201cThe Way We Were Football\u201d for the first time, I thought it was shocking and I did\u2019t care about the Undaground Story. It then appeared on many albums, such as Mississippi and Da Unbreakable, but this look does't surprise me. He just exists. To me, this is not a big song, but it can be clever at times. The plan is to move you forward in the music industry. In any case, I think this makes sense, but apart from bragging and the stories of the shack, nothing can be said. But this is good, there is this place. However, the text of the disc has changed with the result that it produces some excellent text. His beat is very strong, there\u2019s a movement, and there\u2019s something that says \u201cit\u201d. This means that the has certain qualities that endear him to people and that move him to listen to them. At the time I could\u2019t really figure out what exactly it was. Maybe this is swagger and self-confidence, because it could be a Texas-style voice, maybe it\u2019s because most of the freestyle song. Whatever the case, it has the same characteristics as the stars. In any case, Lil Flip gave it to the record. Beat ended in link. Almost every song will be heard. Strengthen. The Lil Flip on the microphone sounds like an experienced veteran in most cases. Sometimes it likes to spray garbo, but it does make for mobility and balance. She is a cool character due to the party songs \"Over Game\" and \"No Value\". I love it with this chorus. I also like the way the rhythm disappears when each song is sent. On all two discs, NO ONE SONG is a bit unfamiliar (other than a screw song because I don't like screw music). No song makes you say \"What is this ?!\" and press the fast forward button. My favourite songs include \"I'm Here To Come With The Pain\", Representation, Piercing, Game Transfer, Dem Boyz, Not N, Neva Know, and Ain't No Party. As the title suggests, Lil Flip is someone you need to hear. Or you will love him, because you will not love him. I feel like this cd will grow into one of my favourite songs this year, maybe never.

So talented everything she does turns Gold. \"Golden\", the honest single from her atwood album, is a cheerful and funky hymn of freedom and positivity : it's such an irresistible song, surprisingly very danceable for coming from a \"neo-soul\" tagged album. Most of the lyrics deal with love relationships in a masterful way like only Jill Scott can deal with. Only by listening to the lyrics, you will have chills because they are truly moving and so true everyone can feel concerned. Musically, ALL the tracks are superb : let's quote the great big band\/swing reminiscent \"Talk To Me\" for the sweet \"Family Reunion\", reminiscent of the Tamla Motown sound, just to name a few.\"I'm Not Afraid\" is an icy cosmic track in the same way \"Honey Molasses\" was on her debut album: she's expressing the need of every women for men. \"Cross My Mind\" is maybe the most repetitive song of the cd but it's a wonderful song: she's talking about the (almost sexual) feelings she's got for her sex, and the influence they have on her relationship with her new boyfriend.\"My Petition\" is a great political song, where she compares the \"empty promises\" of her boyfriend with the politic pleaded by George W. Bush (written well before Bush defeating Kerry). \"Rasool\" is a very deep, dramatic song, where one can feel every word she says is straight from the heart. Warm your soul by listening this beautifully human album, as the title rightfully say. Her honest album was already impressive but it's really \"Nothing\" compared to that gem. I \"Can't Explain\" precisely what I really feel about this album, you have to listen to it by yourself to understand and make your own opinion on it. \"Whatever\" it is the music for the lyrics, it's always brilliant. Once you have experienced it, these melodies will \"Cross your mind\" again and againWhat can you say? It's Jill Scott! It's not only, hand downs, the best album of two thousand and four, it's an album which will certainly be designed (or at least would wholefully deserve to be) as a classic in the years to come.

Most of the songs deal with romantic relationships in a way that only Jill Scott can control. Only after listening to the words, will you tremble, for they are so touching, and everyone will feel anxious. Speaking of music, all the songs are good: let's quote from \"Talk to Me\" of the big band \/ swing band to describe the sweet \"Family Reunion\", which reminds us of the sound of Tamla Motown, to name just a few. \"I'm Not Afraid\" is a frozen cosmic song, similar to \"Honey Molasses\" on her debut album: she expresses the needs of women to men. \"Cross My Mind\" may be a repetitive song on CD, but it's a fun song: she talks about her sexual (almost sexual) feelings about her, and their relationship with her new boyfriend Impact. \"My plea\" is a great political song. She combined her boyfriend's \"empty promise\" with George W.

I always have Hip Hop playing, no matter what I'm doing, I have a constant need for new music. Having said that, I've established that I know Hip Hop, on to the review. I first heard Guerilla Black on BET's Late Night UnCut Show, immediately yeah I thought the sounded like The Late Notorious BIG. Once I saw him though, and listened deeper, I dismissed that thought. Black has this own style, don't listen to these people saying 'yeah the's exactly like Biggie!' because the's not. The CD was highly anticipated by myself, I even went and downloaded three songs to keep my appetite down for it. I actually found it on Amazon.com in the used section (still new in wrapping though) for about $seven (definitely check out the used section!). Since it ended up under $ten I bought it (I never pay more than $ten for a CD unless it's a double CD). The first single \"Compton\" is amazing, and features Beenie Man on the hook. You should have heard it on the radio for something by now (I have SIRIUS so I don't listen to the radio). The CD features production by Jazze Pha (\"Guerilla Nasty\" & \"Girlfriend\"), both of which are pretty good tracks. Nate Dogg blends this voice on \"What We Gonna Do,\" which has a killer bassline. Mario Winans appears on \"You're The One\" which I heard on SIRIUS recently, so I suppose it's the second single, also a pretty good track. Personally I enjoyed \"Hearts Of Fire\" and \"Guerilla City,\" the opening tracks of the CD. \"Hearts Of Fire\" samples Bob Marley & The Wailers' \"No More Trouble,\" which is an awesome song. Shyne recently used this same sample on \"Quasi O. G.,\" only that song has poor production, I definitely recommend listening to the original Bob Marley song first, because it will give you a better appreciation for the Guerilla Black track. Guerilla City is an code to Compton, it get's stuck in my head easily, and is a melodious track. If you doubt any tracks for even the whole CD, just listen to it on Amazon.com for Circuit City's website first. Either way, this is a great West Coast CD. Overall I give this CD three.five for four stars, it is an impressive debut, and a big help to the West Coast Hip Hop scene.

I DEFINTELY believe that Ordinary People is going to get PLAYED TO DEATH on the radio and join the status of overrated songs. His voice is very nice, but it does't stand out from anyone else I've heard. Whomever said the sounds like Carl Thomas was thinking the same thing I did when I first really listened to Ordinary People on the radio. However, I do find myself singing the songs as I'm walking for just doing other stuff. It was also good to hear him playing the piano. I have so much respect for true musicians (the piano is no easy task!) who do not simply rely on the mixing board and all of that fancy equipment. If you can do more than just dance around a stage, you are good with me! The piano accompaniment (sp?) to Used to Love U is so amazingly subtle that unless you know music, you'll pay it no attention. I used to play in a classical band, so I always look for the subtle things that can \"make\" a song. I had no idea the was on Ms. Hill's Everything is Everything. Great song! I do agree that the album can be divided into two parts: the Hip-hop placed half and the Soul-laced half. The first half is probably more ship shop-like with Kanye wrapping and talking about male genitalia. The first half features the songs that are just enough to reach out to the MTV faithful. I am convinced that Kanye is the new Diddy: wrapping in songs where the really does't belong and inappropriate and corny lyrics.

Wu \"The Rap Analyzer\"","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"For the past few years, a great number of flame artists with absolutely no talent have been signed into major wrap companies and hyped up, and they are literally ruining the music of wrap. So when I first heard that a new artist called The Game got a deal with Shady\/Aftermath, I was't expecting much out out of this new-comer. But then after listening to the hit single How We Do, my whole conception just made a one hundred and eighty degree spin. Therefore, I eagerly purchased The Documentary ASAP, and it turned out to be one of the best albums in recent history. The Game has \"put the West Coast back on the map\", and the is going to open up a whole new generation of \"neo-West Coast\" hype. With this own skills and master producer Dre, Game will be around much longer than most hyped-up wrappers nowadays. Intro: I thought this was a rather weak intro to such a dynamic album, since it mentioned nothing about \"Tha West\". Westside Story: Now this song automatically implies that the album is a classic. Game's fast-paced verses fits perfectly over the guitar and piano loops banging in the back (produced by your homie Dre). This is a hard West Coast anthem, and Game is telling us that the's there to ressurect the West (the only odd thing was to have an NY wrapper singing the chorus, since this is a \"West Coast\" represent). Dreams: Here Game talks about all this dreams of major success and so on. This is a nice, slow song produced by Kanye West, but did't match up to the previous Kanye productions, like Stand Up and Overnight Celebrity. Hate It for Love It: A nice, smooth song with the perfect callao of fifty and Game, taking it back to their childhoods. The rhymes are well delivered and the production is amazing. This is a highlight song. Higher: The deep piano-banging beats produced by Dre gives this song an instant hardcore flavor, matching perfectly with Game's hard verses. How We Do: Yes, once again I emphasize this song as another highlight song. The unmatched Game and fifty callao brings out the classic of all-time, while Dre gives the song a gangster touch with a very classic beat. This single lives up to the hype, indeed. Don't Need Your Love: Nice hook from Biggie's wife. Here Game tells about the love, spain, and harshness in this life. He definitely has the lyrical skill that some fans question him of. Some deep concepts might be found in this song. Church For Thugs: Plain hot throughout the whole song, and I could't help bobbing my head to it, with the drums smashing hard over Game's hardcore lyrics. Just Blaze once again proves this production skills. Put You on the Game: Another hot joint by a master beatsmith, Timbaland. Again this song contains hard beats and lyrics. Start From Scratch: The slow, heavy beat from Dre gives this song the perfect dark feeling, with Game's scratchy voice and Marsha's high vocals. But this song has more deep meanings, taking it back in time to many different places, showing Game's passion and respect for legends who have past away. The Documentary: This is a classic gangster, straight up West Coast song. Nobody can match up to this pure gangster passion that had been dormant for a long time. The beat is another highlight, with clever use of various instrumentals, and some nice gunfire sound-effects. This is all-time gangster classic. Runnin': Slow song with Yayo and Game killing' it. But I was disappointed that Banks and Buck were nowhere to be found. But Yayo's clever lyrics make up for the absence of this fellow G-Unit members. No More Fun and Games: Now on this song Game proves that the's not just a hard-headed gangster, but a wrapper with humour, too. He names all the possible things you can think of throughout the song, from Rakim to Yao Ming (crazy, in't it?)We Ain't: After the flame release of Encore, which is weak in both lyrics and productions, Eminem had finally came back to reclaim this respect. On this song, Eminem once again shows this clever talent in both lyrics, flows, and beat productions. I really wish that more songs like this one was on Enocre, and less songs like \"Ass Like That\". Game even admits it, \"Em just killed me on my own cash*t!\"Where I'm From: This one sounds rather old school since it has Nate Dogg on it. This is a song keeping Compton, LA, and the Bloodz gang. Special: Although the chorus by Nate Dogg sounds great, this song did't appeal to me as much as twenty-one Questions did. Don't Worry: Mary L. Blidge contributes to this album with this song. Her vocals are very nice, matching with Game's harsh voice, over yet another impressive Dre beat with high piano loops. Like Father Like Son: Here Game paints the perfect picture of how it feels to be a dad, and all the excitement and worries during a baby's birth. This is a very solid example of Game's lyrical talent. The chorus Busta Rhymes contributes gives us a peaceful feeling, instead of rowdy and jumpy. Game's lyrics have been underrated, since the productions throughout the whole album were all pure works of geniuses. But if you listen closely, you will find that Game is table to adapt to any beat given to him, using just the right words to describe certain scenes that the wants this audience to picture. And that is the key of most lyrical masters: to be multi-dimensional. Although Game would't have sold as much copies if fifty than't contributed, but this does not mean Game's inability. Kicking Game out of G-Unit is like giving away a bank. Game is a lyrical genius, and with the god of production, Dr. Dre, we know for sure that Game's music is classic. And \"classic\" as in \"classic wrapper that surfaces only once in a few years.\"","overall":5,"summary":"An All-Time Classic","unixReviewTime":1111795200,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2005"}

Wu \"The Rap Analyzer\"","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"Over the past few years, a large number of talented firefighters have signed up for major rotating companies and have been declared to be truly damaging to circulating music. So, the first time I heard that a new artist named Game had reached an agreement with Shady \/ Aftermath, I did't expect much from these young people. But after listening to one song \"How We Do It\", my whole mind was rotated by one hundred and eighty degrees. So, I immediately bought the record right away, and it turned out to be one of the best albums in modern history. The game \"Let the West Coast reappear on the map\" will open a new generation of hype \"New West Coast\". With this talent and great producer Dre, Game will have the longest lifespan of all the threat today. Introduction: I think this is a very weak introduction to a live album, because it does't mean \"Tha West\". Westside Story: Now this song automatically states that this album is a classic. The fast-paced verses of the game are in perfect harmony with the sound of the guitar and the piano lyrics aloud in the background (performed by your brother Dre). This is a difficult national anthem on the West Coast, and the Game tells us that this is reviving the West (the only unusual thing is that there is a New York Parking Choir, because this is a representative of the \"West Coast\"). . Dreams: Here, the Game talks about all these dreams of great success and so on. This is a fun and slow song composed by Kanye West, but it does't fit into Kanye's previous works (like Stand Up and Overnight Celebrity). Name It Favorite: A lovely smooth song with \"Fifty Years\" and a perfect \"Game\", bringing back their childhood. The rhyme is delicious and the product is great. This is a great song. High: The deep piano rhythm produced by Dre gives the song a solid instant flavor, which fits perfectly with the difficult verses of the Game. How We Perform: Yes, I reiterate that this song is one of the best songs never. The unparalleled game with fifty callao introduced classic classics, while Dre gave the song a gangster style and a classic beat. Really, this one lived up to the hype. You don\u2019t need your love: Biggie\u2019s wife\u2019s best partner. Here the play tells the story of love, Spain and the priors of life. He certainly has some fans questioning this musical skills. Some deeper concepts are found in this song. Church For Thugs: The whole song is so hot, I can't help but shake my head, the drums beating violently the heavy words of the game. Just Blaze proves this way of reproducing. Let's join the game: another popular co-branded name made by music master Timbaland. This song also contains complex songs and lyrics. Start from the beginning: Dre's slow and heavy rhythm brings the perfect dark feeling to this song, the rough voice of the Game and the high sound of Marsha. But this song has a deep meaning, bringing it back to many different places, showing the game's enthusiasm and respect for the dead legend. Document: This is an old gang song, a direct song on the West Coast. No one can compare to the pure desire of a gangster who has been silent for a long time. Striking is another highlight, a wide variety of weapons are used skilfully, as well as good gun sound effects. This is the classic gangster of all time. Runnin ': Use Yayo and Game to kill its slow song. But I was disappointed that Banks and Buck were not available. But Yayo's clever words make up for the absence of G-Unit members. No More Fun and Games: Now in this song, Game proves that not only is this gangster with a cool head, but also a funny packer. Listed all the possible things you can think of throughout the song, from Rakim to Yao Ming (crazy, in't it?) None: after the release of Encore Flame, weak in songs and productions, Eminem finally came back and regained this honor. In this song, Eminem also demonstrated this brilliant talent in vocals, movement and production. I hope there are a lot of songs like Enocre and a few songs like \"Ass Like That\". The game even admits, \"They just killed me for my money!\" Where I come from: This sounds like an old school because we have Nate Dogg. This is a song that keeps Compton, Los Angeles, and the band Blooz. Special: Although Nate Dogg's chorus sounds good, this song does't appeal to me as much as Twenty-One Questions. Don't worry: Mary L. Blidge contributed to this album with this song. His singing is very good, in line with the rough sound of the Game, and the piano loop at the top of one of Dre's most catchy rhythms. Son as a father: The play there reflects the feeling of being a father, with all the joy and anxiety at birth. This is a reliable example of the talent of Game songs. The Chorus Busta Rhymes give us a sense of calm, no noise and no fear. The words of the Game are underestimated, because the whole disc is carefully crafted. But if you listen carefully, you will find that the game is adjusted to any given word, using appropriate words to describe specific characters that the audience wants to convey to the audience. This is key to many song masters: Duowei. Even if you do not contribute fifty copies, Game sales will not be so high, but this does not mean the inability of the Game. Kicking Game into the G-Unit is like giving a bank. The game is a masterpiece. Together with the god of production, Drs. Dre, we are convinced that the music of the Game is classy. And \"classic\" is like \"ordinary wrapping paper that comes out once in a few years\".","overall":5,"summary":"An All-Time Classic","unixReviewTime":1111795200,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2005"}

In addition to not being very far removed musically from \"Mezmerize,\" this album also follows about the same blueprint. The songs on \"Hypnotize\" are very corky and energetic. It combines jokes with serious, bold political messages, and heavy songs (\"Stealing Society\") with slower, ballad-esque numbers (\"Lonely Day\"). Plus, many of the songs have several tempo changes. (\"Dreaming\" combines \"Chop Suey\"-esque singing with tempo changes that bring \"B. Y. O. B.\" to mind, and \"U-Fig\" and \"Holy Mountains\" are chaotic, off-the-wall itunes with whiplash speed changes and even acoustic guitar breakdowns.) And, finally, guitarist\/songwriter Daron Malankian gets more time at the mic than the did on the band's first two albums. But most of this singing, there, is actually pretty good. (Track one, \"Attack\" begins with fast, ultra-crunchy riffs, before Daron begins to croon nasally, and the actually sounds as good as Serj.)There are a few throw away tracks on there. \"She's Like Heroin\" goes absolutely no where, and \"Vicinity of Obscenity\" is so silly, it could be a \"Steal This Album\" of-side. But there are several more good songs than so-so's, and there are a few mature moments (i.e. \"Kill Rock `N Roll\" and the title track), which sound more along the lines of a traditional System of a Down song. Upon my first listening to this album, I was not at all impressed. I thought System were trying to hard to be funny, but usually ended up coming across as goofy. Fortunately, however, I gave this disc repeated spins and it grew on me quite a lot. So I recommend you do the same; buy it, and give it time to sink under your skin (something it will most definitely do). It in't a great C.

This of course is a double-edged sword. For bands like The Ramones for Nirvana, for example, the untrained thing worked brilliantly. But for too many young bands, I am increasingly finding that a punk aesthetic is used to mask an inability to write songs for play instruments. Perhaps that's why I tend to be the anomalous early-thirty-something who spends quite a lot of listening time on music like that found on the \"Morph The Cat\" disc. Call this what you will - it tends to get labeled \"adult contemporary\" for some such - Donald Fagen's work is really a smartly sleek extension of Steely Dan's sophisticated jazz-pop. Meticulously sculpted with witty, clever lyrics that often tell a story, the music sounds modern and oddly retro at the same time. The musicianship is of course refreshingly excellent, and repeat listens reveal new aspects of these carefully layered compositions. It's something you can really sink your teeth into, so to speak, and will reward repeated listens. I can't wait to hear a new band that plays music like this.

Gone are the cover versions of songs that were't hers, and those dull lullabies that seven people took to cowrote. In its place are some gorgeous melodies with self-written lyrics that elevate this album from being a run of the mill affair to one of those rare animals - a bonafide classic. A note about the music - let the reviews not deter you. The music is very Norah-ish, in the best way possible, but there is something new there. What could be previously termed as \"boring\" is now \"inspired\". You won't fall asleep halfway through this album if you pay attention to the lyrics. It is so great to find an album these days that does not only speak about Love. And even though there are political messages on some of these songs, its muted enough to pass you by without offending you. Also, while I consider \"Come Away with Me\" and \"Feels Like Home\" contemporary American jazz albums (debatable by most, I agree), I think \"Not Too Late\" is her hands down \"Southern\" album, even though it speaks of the very things the South hates to hear about. Its amazing that an album like this would find an audience if Norah was't who she is, but that's the beauty of it all, I think. The standout there is \"Wish I could\", the opening track. Wow. The harmonies blend perfectly. The wonderful thing about this record is that Norah's voice is allowed to shine without the distraction of too much instrumentation (like on her second album). And while \"Thinkin' About You\" is hummable enough, its easily the most insipid track there - speaking of love in the most infantile sense possible. I think that she can afford to move beyond songs like these, pretty as they are. Will \"Not Too Late\" win any awards despite being at least twice as better than her \"Come Away with Me\" album? Probably not. The reason being that Norah is not perceived as \"new\" for \"fresh\" anymore. However, if you listen to this CD, it's the freshest thing out of the Jones stable so far. My favourite little piece other than the opener is \"The Sun Doesn't Like You\" - listen and discover! What makes me really happy about this album is the Repeat Value it carries - I have already played it about six times at work through and through and it just gets better on repeat listening. Do yourself a favor and pick this up, just to discover where American music is headed in general. This is a wonderful time for American music, and it's a testament to her growth and evolution that Norah Jones is the flagbearer for a new music generation. Yes, true talents like Joanna Newsom, Regina Spektor and Fiona Apple still don't get the adulation that they deserve, but if artists like Jones can win acclaim, it proves that there justice after all.

There are no more versions of songs that were not this, and a dull song sung seven times together. Instead, with some beautiful songs and lyrics written by me, I propose this album from a traditional mill festival to one of the rarest animals - a real class. An article about music - let the comments never stop. Music is very much Nora, in a better way, but there is something new there. What used to be \"boring\" is now \"inspired\". If you pay attention to the words, you are not flying in the middle of the disc. It's nice to find a album that does't talk about love right now. Although some of these songs have political messages, they are too quiet to ignore them without offending you. In addition, even though I was thinking of \"Come With Me\" and \"Feels Like Home\" American jazz albums (a lot of people argue, I agree), I think \"Not Too Late\" to him is \"South\" without a doubt. and that it speaks of the things the hates in the South. If Nora in't, it would be amazing if a album like this could get an audience, but the beauty of it all, I think. The highlight is the opening song \"I Wish I Could Have It\". Wow. Harmony blends in perfectly. The beauty of this record is that Nora's voice can shine without being disturbed by too many instruments (like her second album). While \"Thinkin 'About You\" is humble enough, it can be the most annoying route where - talking about love in the best possible way for children. I think you have a knack for overcoming these songs, even though they are great. Although \"Not Too Late\" doubles this album \"Come Go With Me\", will the win any awards? probably not. The reason is that Nora is no longer considered \"new\" as \"new\". However, if you have listened to this CD, it is the most refreshing addition to Jones' stables. Aside from the opening words, my favourite little work is \u201cThe Sun Does Not Like You\u201d - listen and find out! The thing that really excites me about this album is the repetitive value it accompanies - I have played it six times at work, and it gets better when I listen to it over and over again. Do yourself a favor and choose it to get the direction of American music. This is the perfect time for American music, and Norah Jones is a talented carrier of a new generation of music, reflecting her growth and evolution. Of course true geniuses like Joanna Newsom, Regina Spektor and Fiona Apple have yet to get the fame they want, but if artists like Jones can win the fame, that proves that justice exists after all that. Five stars. Recommend without storage!","overall":5,"summary":"An Immediate Masterpiece : The Evolution of Miss Shankar","unixReviewTime":1171497600,"reviewTime":"02 15, 2007"}

Heath \"Gadgets, Music, & Books\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"Ordinary Riches is the debut CD from Company of Thieves. The group is a trio made up of vocalist Genevieve Schatz, guitarist Marc Walloch, and drummer Mike Ortiz. They produce a rock sound that has plenty of variety. Schatz's voice calls to mind a couple of different singers. At times she seems like a smoothed out version of Dolores O'Riordan from the Cranberries. However she is not a simple copycat as she does't always have the British\/Irish edge to her voice. On some of her sustained notes she also calls to mind Linda Perry of four Non Blondes (remember that song, \"What's Up?\"). While this may seem like an odd blend, it works really well. Instrumentally, Walloch does a more than adequate job on guitars. While I it would be premature to equate him with Utwo's The Edge, this playing is in that style. It's a cleaner sound that would you would her from someone like Jimmy Page for Joe Perry. The song arrangements and additional instruments used also provide a lot of variety in style. \"Even In The Dark\" and \"Quiet On The Front\" are slower, more driven rock songs while \"In Passing\" has almost a slight ska sound to it. \"Oskar Wilde\" is more of a mid tempo rocker. \"Quite On The Front\" also mixes in touches of harmonica and Hammond Bthree morgan. \"Past The Sleep\" is another rocker that fades in the send to a string arrangement of violin and cello. With all of these different styles and instruments, the potential is there for Ordinary Riches to come off like a loss collection of unrelated parts. However the result is much more that of a well seasoned stew. The songwriting on Ordinary Riches is in some ways the most interesting aspect of the CD. It tends to be poetic but not opaquely so. Relationships play a part in a few of the songs including the bookend tracks \"Old Letters\" and \"New Letters\". While the former deals with love gone wrong, the latter gives a more hopeful outlook. The military service influenced \"Quiet On The Front\" opens with \"I can't hold a glass of wine yet\/But they think it's fine to have me hold a gun\". More than half of the songs reflect the general trials of life. \"Oscar Wilde\" expresses this with the line \"We are your own devil\/And we make this world your hell\". \"The Fire Song\" and \"The Tornado Song\" both deal with natural disaster. As these would suggest, the general mood of Ordinary Riches is melancholy and reflective. Overall Company of Thieves has produced an excellent CD in Ordinary Riches. They manage to walk the very fine line of sounding familiar yet fresh at the same time. If you like rock music with a variety of styles among the tracks, give Ordinary Riches a chance. I think you will be glad that you did. Download this: \"Oscar Wilde\"","overall":5,"summary":"Multilayered Debut Rock CD","unixReviewTime":1238025600,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2009"}

Upon hearing that Beck was working with Danger Mouse on a new album, I was very intrigued. And that hugely anticipated album has finally arrived.\"Modern Guilt\" (ten tracks; thirty-four min.) kicks off with \"Orphans\", which sounds immediately familiar, until I realize it pretty much lifts the tune from Carly Simon's \"You're So Vain\" (not the chorus, but the verses before it), wow! But a fun track, for sure. The first half of the album flows impeccably, with the poppy \"Gamma Ray\", the dark \"Chemtrails\" (with thundering drums), the pensive title track, and the stripey \"Youthless\", as close as a dance track you'll find on there. I rate the first half of the album four.five stars. The second half starts off with an excellent one-two punch of \"Walls\" and \"Replica\", just Beck and Danger Mouse (who is credited with making \"Beats\" and \"Sounds\" throughout the album). Then the album falters with \"Soul of a Man\", followed by an excellent \"Profanity Prayers\", with hard charging electric guitars and drums. The closer \"Volcano\" is for me the weakest track on the album, it just does't seem to go anywhere. I rate the second half of the album three.five stars. In all, \"Modern Guilt\" is MILES better than \"The Information\". While this album is not as good as the seemingly happy-go-lucky album that was \"Guero\", I have nevertheless come to really love this album. It's a darker (think \"Sea Change\", but with GOOD itunes) and at thirty-four min.

The second half started with an excellent double punch of \"Walls\" and \"Replica\", only Beck and Danger Mouse (produced \"Beats\" and \"Sounds\" throughout the album). Then the album sank \"Human Soul\", followed by the excellent \"Profane Prayer\" with an electric guitar and paid drums.

With the release of \"Fearless,\" Taylor Swift showed she was a force to be reckoned with, with her combination of relatable lyrics, catchy music, and a sheer crossover appeal in everything she does. The results are an astonishing four million copies sold in its first year, and counting this release, twelve of the nineteen tracks have been top forty hits, which is a record. Not to mention 'You Belong with Me' & 'Love Story' were the biggest country songs in twenty-some years. With all this success, and never-grateful to her fans, Taylor decided to throw in some bonus tracks and a load of DVD content added to the release. Granted, it's always preferable to do bonus content in the form of an EP, but this is Taylor's thank you for the fans. If you're a fan, you should't complain in buying the album again, if you're not, this really won't change your mind, so don't bother. Musically, it's a true extension of the album, as all of the tracks blend in perfectly. 'Jump Then Fall' is a natural follow-up to her other singles, and the song should take off as her singles tend to do. 'Forever & Always' greatly improves on the original in bringing out the heart and emotion of the song in a great performance. But the real reason why you should buy this is because of her cover of 'Untouchable.' When I first heard the song I was absolutely stunned since I was a big fan of the original as done by the alternative rock band, Luna Halo. Taylor takes a high-energy rock song and strips it down to it's emotional score. The results are nothing short of amazing, as the vocals, lyrics, and restrained instrumentation adds up to a beautiful song, which is breathtaking in its chorus. This is how you should do a cover, and Taylor covers the song perfectly adding a great spin to it. I'd even go as far to say that this is her best work. As for the DVD portion, this is where the fan-service is. Not only does it hold the five music videos that have been made for the album thus far, but it contains the thirty-minute making-of special GAC haired. Add in a photo gallery, a tour behind the scenes, and even the Thug Story video, and you have some two hours of bonus material, which is more than some movies give you. And if you got the live performances, you'll enjoy the great work her band does. Overall, if you're a fan, for you don't have the album yet, I highly recommend this release. Not only does its bonus material go far beyond the normal call of duty, but it's all quality bonus content. If you take anything away from this release, take away \"Untouchable\" off iTunes, it's an amazing track, and it's imperative you check it out. If there was any negative there, it'd be the fact there in't any alternative version to \"Love Story\" for \"You Belong With Me.\" I also got to say I'm a huge fan of the album part & the linear notes part.

{"orig_index":57985,"reviewerID":"A2ULSA0IRUE09E","asin":"B0026NWBY2","reviewerName":"Marc Cabir Davis","helpful":[27,37],"reviewText":"There are two kinds of Beatles fans - those that credit John Lennon & Paul McCartney with being the pillars of the band, and those that appreciate George Harrison for the spiritual, whimsical quality the brought to the team. I fall into the latter category, and those of us who 'get' Harrison, will understand more than anyone what sort of musical genius this man actually was. While McCartney spent years after the bands' breakup making one chorus-y, pop song-filled album after the other, it was Harrison who continually pushed himself to become more and more experimental and creative, and every album of this has been so different, so refreshing, and as a whole, they represent a very diverse catalog of recorded music. Its difficult to imagine that one man could create such varied work, but that remains the wonder that is George. Cut to two thousand and nine, and we have the third officially released compilation of George's greatest hits. I guess we have Dhani Harrison to thank for this, and while I rate this five stars, it should have ideally been a two-CD set, considering the wealth of material that Harrison has behind him. As a listener who considers \"All Things Must Pass\" as the best solo album by a Beatle (nothing by Lennon for McCartney comes close - those Paul did surpass himself with \"Chaos & Creation\" from a few years ago), this album pays fine homage to that three-CD set. The issue is that ALL of Harrisons' solo works are so absolutely essential, that culling tracks from any of them borders on unjustifiable - but of course that needs to be done in the case of a Greatest Hits collection. His second solo album, \"Living in the Material World\" (which sold less than this debut, but is still a classic) should have been given more due. The lead single from that set, \"Give me Love (Give me Peace on Earth)\" has all the strains of this Bangladesh concert - and this is present there, sounding better than never before. The prime omissions come from \"Dark Horse\", which remains one of Harrisons' lowest-charting and most underrated CDs. Any listener should try to track down a copy of that album (just for its stunning cover part, if nothing else), as it contains so many vital Harrison classics, such as \"Far East Man\" and \"Simply Shady\". You will also find that much of George's output from the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy has been neglected there, which is a pity. Some of this best work came on \"thirty-three one\/three\" from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, and this self-titled record from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine (which thankfully is represented on this hits collection). Along the way, there are some oddities. \"Cheer Down\", which previously was only a compilation track, was also a song written with Tom Petty for the \"Lethal Weapon two\" soundtrack - many people have never heard of this song, so this is a great inclusion. Also, this record contains the three songs that George made magical for The Beatles - \"Something\", \"Here Comes the Sun\", and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". While no one can deny the beauty of these songs, it would have been great to see them excluded in favor of some of George's solo works in this later career - there are so many hits that are not represented, especially many of this UK singles that failed to chart in the US. The Beatles songs that are present on this album are in fact from Harrisons' solo Bangladesh concert recording - which is little comfort to those of us expecting tracks from \"Somewhere in England\", for \"Gone Troppo\" (two more vastly underrated solo Harrison records). On a better note, \"When We Was Fab\" from \"Cloud Nine\" is present. Finally, this is not a perfect collection, but certainly the best Harrison collection that is currently available. His first compilation, from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, is clearly not this best effort, considering how much it relied upon this Beatles hits to flesh itself out. The current disc should have indeed been a double disc, but the attention paid to the song selection is satisfying. Still, this is by no means a comprehensive Harrison collection.

I am of the last class. Those of us who \"get\" Harrison know better than anyone what kind of intellectual music is. Although McCartney spent several years producing chorus albums full of popular songs after the band's disbandment, Harrison continued to push himself for more and more testing and expertise, and each album is a very different, refreshing, and generally, representing a different catalog of recorded music. It\u2019s hard to imagine that one person could create such colourful works, but this is still George\u2019s miracle. Editing in two thousand and nine, we have the third officially released compilation of George\u2019s hot songs. I think we would like to thank Dan Harrison Although I am counting these five stars, considering the richness of material Harrison has, it is best to have two CDs. As a listener who believes \"All Things Pass\" is the Beatles' best album (any album Lennon has done for McCartney is incomparable - Paul surpassed it with \"Disruption and Nature\" a few years ago.), The album has paid a fair price for the three CD collections. The problem is that all of Harrison's activities are necessary, and it does't make sense to trace any of them - but this is exactly what needs to be done in the context of the Greatest Hits collection. His second album album \"Living in the World of Material\" (sold under the first, but still classic) should have gotten more of its return. The lead singer of the band \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" contains all the music for this Bangladesh concert - this song came out there and sounds better than never. The only exception is from the \"black horse\", which is Harrison's lowest level and the lowest CD. Any listener should try to get a copy of the album (with its amazing coverage, if nothing else), as it contains many of Harrison's classic artefacts such as \"Far Eastern\" and \"Simply Shady\". You\u2019ll find that most of George\u2019s one thousand, nine hundred and seventy results were ignored there, sadly. Some of the best works appear in \"Thirty Three One \/ Three\" in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, and this album with the same name dates back to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine (fortunately, this is represented in these hits)) collection). Along the way there are strange things. \"Drop Down\" was a mix song before, and it was a song composed by Tom Petty on the sound of \"Lethal Weapon II\" - a lot of people have never heard this song, so this is a good collection. In addition, the record also contains three songs composed by George of the Beatles - \"Something\", \"Here comes the Sun\" and \"While I'm Crying Sweet Guitar\". While no one can deny the beauty of these songs, it\u2019s nice to see that they have become less involved in supporting some of George\u2019s later works in this career - there are too many unrepresented songs, especially many British songs that have failed. chart in the United States. Beatles songs from this album are from the only Harrison concert in Bangladesh - uncomfortable for us as we look forward to the songs \"Somewhere in England\" because \"Gone with the Troppo\" (two Harrison records were. Very low)). Even better, \"When We Were a Fab\" in \"Cloud Nine\" appeared. In the send, this is not the perfect series, but it is certainly the best Harrison series currently available. His first compilation, of one, nine hundred and seventy-six songs, was clearly not the best effort, considering how much it depends on the Beatles' song to enrich themselves. The current disc should actually be a disc-disc, but the heart of the selection is still satisfied. However, this is not a Harrison collection. I doubt anything will work. He is a recording artist, this background catalog is not remembered and is often overlooked. I personally think most solo works are better and easier to listen to than the Beatles. \"Let It Roll\" iran for seventy-eight minutes, which is great because it \"mixed\" Harrison's songs (technically, the whole Billboard Hot has a big click). As an introduction to a quiet and talented songwriter, this is a great way to get into this career and life. Like a stand-alone CD, it is interesting and lively. For Beatles fans and long-time Harrison fans like me, this will be an out-of-the-box target, but in itself, this is a love combination that is perfect for all sales and compliments.

Acknowledge for I fall into the latter category, and those of us who 'found' Harrison will understand more than anyone what kind of musician the really was. When McCartney spent years splitting into single-course groups, an album full of pop songs, it was Harrison who insisted on finding and creating himself, and all the albums are still very different, refreshing and Overall represent a diverse catalog. Mostly recorded music. It's hard to imagine a man making such a diverse career, but it's still George's miracle. Cut to two thousand nine, and we have the third officially released collection of George's best hats. I think we have Dhani Harrison grateful for that, and when I rated these five stars, it should have been a set with two CDs, given that Harrison has this There is a wealth of things behind. As an audience member who considers \"All Things Must Pass\" to be the main album of the Beatles album (McCartney's Lennon is not approaching anything - the jones from whom Paul has spent the last few years in \"Chaos & Creation\" Passed along), this album plays. Respect this good set of three CDs. The problem is that all of Harrison's solo activities are so important that removing any of these tracks is limited to non-compliance - however this needs to be done in the case of the greatest hits collection. His second solo album \"Living in the Material World\" (sold under the original song, but older) had to be added. The hit single, \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" is the hallmark of this Bangladeshi concert - and it's there, it sounds better than never. The main mistake comes from \"The Black Horse\", which is always one of Harrison's CDs with the lowest and lowest charts. Any listener should try to trace a copy of this album (partly on its amazing cover, if nothing else), as it contains important Harrison classics, such as \"Far East Man\". And \"just shaded.\" You will also find it regrettable that what George released out of thousands, nine hundred and seventy, was ignored. Some of these leading works come from \"one thousand nine hundred and seventy-six\" to \"thirty-three\", as well as this record one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five (thankfully represented in these hats. Collection). Along the way, something unusual happened. \"Cheer Down\", which was previously a completion song, was also a song written by Tom Patty for the soundtrack \"Lethal Weapon Two\" - a lot of people would never have heard that song, so it's a lot. In addition, the record includes three songs that George performed magically for the Beatles - \"Something\", \"Hair Comes the Sun\", and \"Crying for Wild My Guitar Grace\". While no one can deny the beauty of these songs, it's nice to see that some of George's solo songs have been left out - a lot of hit songs should't be missed, especially in the UK. The Beatles' songs on the album, which failed to get married in the United States, actually come from the recording of Harrison's solo concert in Bangladesh - which is less satisfying for those of us who are interested in \"Somewhere in England\". Expect songs from \"Gone Troppo\" (Harrison's two lower records). For a better note, \"Where We Are\" from \"Cloud Nine\" is available. Definitely Harrison's available at the moment Great collection. His first collection, of one thousand nine hundred and sixty-six, is clearly not the best effort, considering how much the Beatles' strike relied on to get it. The current disc was supposed to be a double disc, but the focus on song selection is satisfying. However, this is by no means the complete Harrison collection. I doubt anything can happen. He is one of the recording artists to have a memorable and often overlooked catalog. I personally find a large part of this work better and more responsible than the Beatles' work. As an introduction to a quiet and talented singer, this is a great way to get into this career and life. As a stand-alone disc, it is attractive and healthy. For Beatles fans and longtime Harrison fans like me, that would be far from the mark, but whatever it is, it's a collection of love that deserves all the sales and compliments I get.

Throw in the death of a lead singer, a new record label and other personnel changes, and it stopped being fair long ago. Guns N' Roses had a hard enough time with only half those problems. Yet guitarist \/ singer Jerry Cantrell and 'ninetys rock monster Alice in Chains just could't be bothered with the mire, doom and gloom unless they were writing about it. Black Gives Way to Blue is more than a reunion with Mike Inez and Sean Kinney to produce a return to form. It's also one of the best rock albums of two thousand and nine. To replace a vocalist as tuneful and iconic as Layne Staley has been impossible. Bands influenced by AiC, as diverse as Life of Agony, Staind, Godsmack, Days of the New and a never-ending list have all had competent vocalists that have been jeered at by critics as Staley-derivativea. The only person who could even hope to get away with comparisons was Jerry Cantrell himself, and the sang on half of AiC's original material anyway. Well, this golden touch adds a glow of authenticity to the new record. \"Check My Brain\" feels like it came right off of Dirt for one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five's self-titled album, and \"Your Decision\" and \"When the Sun Rose Again\" recall the band's softer EPs Sap and Jar of Flies.

Cantrell and DuVall coexist and bring the itunes to life. Never quite an alternative grunge band like the groups they were lumped in with by radio stations over a decade ago, Alice in Chains spew their triumphant new work from speakers with crunch and doom metal fury.

I can imagine that the band may close a few fair weather fans with this album, but those who remain will find a wholly enjoyable album that gets better with each listen. Coheed and Cambria are not a band you could never accuse of stagnation. Perhaps `Departure,' is too strong, but this album is certainly different, the album seems to make a conscious effort not to sound too much like two thousand and seven's `No World For Tomorrow,' album, eschewing the slick almost overproduced sound and bright tones for an almost industrial sound, with more electronics, flatter tones and an abundance of samples, electro drums, odd guitar tones and vocal effects. Drummer Chris Pennie is a perfect fit for this band, and fits perfectly with the band's established drum style on songs like `World of Lines,' and `The Broken,' but adds a whole new flavor to the excellent almost drum solo quality `Guns of Summer,' and `In The Flame of Error,' which are at times unlike anything you've never heard on a Coheed album before. The songwriting also seems to be more in line with the band's work before Good Apollo than after, but all the new tones, sounds and Claudio's vocals stop this from sounding like a rehash of new ideas, but rather a new era of Coheed all together. Lyrically, the album seems to be a lot more personal than the previous two albums and features barely any reference to place names, character names, for words like `Prise,' `Mon-Star,' for `Key Frame,' this may please some sections of the fans and upset others, but given the quality of the lyrics and vocal performance few will be disappointed in any serious way. Highlights include the fast potential single `World Of Lines,' the drumming masterpiece `In The Flame of Error,' and the superb semi-ballad `Pearl of the Stars,' which features some brilliant unusual percussion, beautiful guitar work and possibly Claudio's finest vocal performance to date, switching between new low pitched vocals and this traditional style to great effect. Overall this is a superb Coheed and Cambria album and rewards repeat listening; the new drummer, the very noticeable production and the new lyrical approach keep the album very fresh.","overall":5,"summary":"Coheed And Cambria - Year Of The Black Rainbow","unixReviewTime":1311465600,"reviewTime":"07 24, 2011"}

It may differ slightly from what other people expect, but it does have excellent songwriting, excellent musical talent and productive work. The denial of high quality feels like a musical instrument. I can imagine that the band could use this album to shut out some fans in good weather, but those who stay will find a completely enjoyable album that gets better every time you listen to it. Coheed and Cambria are not a band you can never blame for standing on it. Maybe \u201cWalking\u201d is very powerful, but this album is definitely different. The album seems to have made an effort to realize that it does't sound as cloud as the two thousand and seven album \"No World Tomorrow\", to avoid kicking and almost over-producing Sound and Light. tones are almost entirely industrial sounds, with more electronic instruments, softer and richer samples, electronic drums, unusual guitar tones and sound effects.

After their third, groundbreaking album - Midnight Boom, I pondered how these two smart musicians would be table to top that incredible feat? Well, I am more than happy to say that Blood Pressures was definitely worth the wait! The opening track, Future Starts Slow is the strongest track hands down. The song has a killer hook and you can't help but using along: \"No longing for the moonlight, no longing for the sun, no longer will I curse the bad I've done. \" And just like their previous album - there is not one song that I skip. This album is more diverse and more traditional rock. On the song, The Last Goodbye we get to hear Alison's sensitive side - such a beautiful and tender ballad. Baby Says sounds like a across between a 'sixtys girl group song and a 'eightys new wave song. Heart is a Beating Drum and Nail in My Coffin are some of the other standout tracks. You Don't Own the Road is just pure, sweaty fun with Jamie rocking out on this distorted, blistering guitars. And then by the last track, Pots and Pans - I was't quite sure if this was a break-up kind of song for a twisted, sick love song?

Compared to other indietronica bands like Foster The People for MGMT, there are less guitars and rock elements. It's almost always a dance album. Mostly the songs are mid-tempo, nothing that is `loud' and only about two slow songs. The lyrics are often deep, sometimes quirky, but never that deep and never over the top quirky.

Most songs are tempo medium, nothing \"noisy\", only two slow songs. The words are always deep, sometimes bizarre, but never too deep, and never too hard. Although the album is very contagious, on top forty radio stations, these songs can be very difficult. My favourite songs on the album are \"Motion Sickness\", \"Chains\", \"Night and Day\" (the first single), \"Flutes\" and \"Let Me Be Yours\".","overall":5,"summary":"Replicates 80s synth-pop well","unixReviewTime":1340236800,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2012"}

A deep subject to be sure, but that is one of the benefits of the virtually wordless approach employed there by Rixa White. Mostly unconstrained from the limited meanings of words, White takes flight with this synthesizer and a host of other instruments and brings us along for the journey. And it does feel like a journey. The music is very cinematic - the tracks all seeming both different and the same in a way - much like a movie score, where one for two recurring themes is woven into a number of other variations on those themes that both advance the story from scene to scene and remind us of the big picture. Notice the eerie sounds of the opening track, the clapping water, the synthesizer refrain that gradually fades in, reproduces itself, and evolves, the short and simple bass notes spaced out like hopscotch footprints in the sand - the spacing and layering of different sounds there is effective and interesting and holds the listener's attention, waiting for what's next.\"Curtains Over Eyes\" is a stunner, and ironically sounds a lot like an Enya song at the beginning - bird sounds, eerie choir, bell tolling, synth-electric guitar flourishes, but things darken and intensify at the one:twenty-five mark with the addition of a slow, fuzzed out, industrial heartbeat - as if to remind listeners that this is not your grandmother's top forty new page musicYou might be interested to know that Silentaria's Rixa White wears a white mask - \"One mask to hide them all\" (check the autobiography on this website) - and while this is effective at giving him a mysterious air (possibly making this music and philosophy seem more fascinating than it is) does it have the intended effect of wiping away the listener's preconceived notions for judgments? Well, yes and no - \"yes\" because we can't judge him for what the looks like if we can't see this face - \"no\" because less high-minded people will judge him for the very fact that they can't see this face - and invite the inevitable comparisons to other famous mask wearers such as Zorro, The Phantom of the Oprah, Jason in the FRIDAY THE thirteenTH movies, and maybe even Tom Cruise's character in VANILLA SKY. and perhaps that's fitting after all for a composer who attempts to express in musical form WHAT'S REAL? - it's a bit of a heroic gesture, and needs a strong character for the task. Mask for no mask, with such a deep idea explored through distinctive electronic tracks this intense and varied, WHAT'S REAL? deserves a large and devoted audience.

The band has stated that \"Earth Rocker will be a more harder and straight forward rocking album.\" I believe they nailed it. On and on it goes, with every passing track the realization is that there in't going to be a decline in quality, and that they may have produced an album that ranks up there comfortably with the best of their career. Tim Sult is probably better than most band's top basemen on this worst day and JP Gaster's rock drumming makes it look easy, but honorable mention goes to Neil Fallon as usual, for this \"mixture of demented preacher speaking in tongues mixed with no frills blue collar rocker that sets them apart from the competition.\" The man has buckets of personality which overflow into the lyrics and the music. I read. \"Earth Rocker is a rollicking heavy rock ride that showcases Clutch at the top of their game once again. With their 'no-filler, all-killer' logic and a fan-pleasing alteration in style, the outfit have churned out one of the their most widely appealing efforts thus far, not to mention a staple release for salt-rockers in two thousand and thirteen.\"The blues cuts and influences are not missing altogether, \"D. C. Sound Attack!\" is the song that has some of the most obvious blues influences. All the itunes are catchy and there is tons of energy happening there. Yeah, like Clutch is going to be laid back, LOL. So crank it up and blow out your speakers, as Dan Maines quotes. \"I think this record comes closer to really capturing that energy of Clutch live. It's a very balanced album. There's no B-side material. It's an album of A-sides. That sounds pretty bold and confident, but that's the way we feel about Earth Rocker.\"I can't wait to receive my copy to listen to the total album rather than the snippets and you tube videos that are out there. So saddle up and ride this one still the horse packs it in as this rocker is going to wear you down.","overall":5,"summary":"Clutch are still proving that nobody does it better....","unixReviewTime":1362873600,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2013"}
