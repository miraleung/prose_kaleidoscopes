564,"I remember watching this series avidly, every Saturday evening. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything about it, the location, the costumes, the factors and the wonderful music by Clannad (I still have their Legend album). I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving by creating another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I believe there were legends of several Robins in medieval times. Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young factors, I'm sure Robin and this men would have young, after all people did't live that long in those days. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with this ridiculous accent looked like Robin's granddad). The only sad thing was the ending, it's a shame they could't at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending.",positive

I love how they solved the problem of Michael Prader’s departure by making another Robin, this time Earl Huntington. I believe there are a number of Robbins stories in the Middle Ages. Another thing I like is that it's full of little things. I believe Robin and this man are going to be very small. So, people in those days can't live long. Some Robins always seem too old (Kevin Costner is like Robin's grandfather in this ridiculous way). The only downside is, unfortunately they can’t do one special thing to bind all the free ends and give them a happy ending.",positive

845,"It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it's not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection. I can't understand how the talented Mr. Rickman gets into these mediocre films? Judas Kiss boasts several wonderful factors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama. Many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character's actions: Why was your hero immediately suspicious of this bosses? Why did the mistrust the detective the replaced? There were times when I honestly could't tell if the director meant Judas Kiss to be a legitimate crime drama for a campy spoof. Why else would the toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby!)? Did the purposely instruct this two distinguished English factors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such awful New Orlean's accents? As an Alan Freak, I confess that I still thought Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a crumpled, weary, ""take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in"" sort of way. Judas Kiss in't a great movie, but it does have some intriguing moments, but I don't recommend it unless you're trying to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.",negative

1249,"Saw this a couple times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system. A semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture (or the black of it), focusing on some seriously tracked, way-beyond-the-Hollywood-fringe dwellers. It had an amusing early performance from Mark Ruffalo, and some memorable cinematography from the DP who did the Polish Brothers movies. There was a savage uncompromising humour and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart. This film had cult classic written all over it, and I'm surprised it's not yet out on DVD. Hopefully soon.",positive
1249,"I watched it several times on the Sundance Channel a few years ago and got a good movie shocking program. The semi-surrealistic but sharp surrounding culture of modern media (or black in it), which focuses on carefully followed residents beyond the border of Hollywood. Mark Ruffalo's first works were very interesting, and the DP who filmed the Polish Brethren film also had a memorable film. There is rough and unrelenting humour and a strange feeling of antiquity that makes it unique. This movie is full of church antiquities, and I'm amazed that it has't been released on DVD.

1648,"My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this. I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared, so I assume it was rejected, even though it met all the usual guidelines. I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, particularly the performance of Jordi Mollà, a veteran factor who has appeared in such major productions as ""Blow"" and ""The Alamo."" Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful, melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative for blend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of part. An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere, anytime.",negative

3111,"Normally BBC productions of Jane Austen are pretty good but Northanger Abbey is just odd. What were they thinking? This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically mimics the Gothic novels that Austen so wonderfully mocked. Not only that, the ""gothic"" sequences are tacky, over-the-top, and frankly silly. The actress playing Miss Morland is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the attentions of an eligible bachelor, and though I rather liked the creepy Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, the is not a bit like the novel, even when delivering dialog straight out of the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of this few terribly ""ham"" performances. This film was so bizarre and strange that I actually watched it again just to saver how freakishly wrong it was.",negative

The film has almost no Austin's charm, and it is ridiculous to imitate the Gothic novel that Austin laughed out cloud. Not only that, the ""Gothic"" sequence is tricky, exaggerated, and frankly silly. The actress who plays Miss Moran is very poor and has no clear appeal to attract the attention of successful beginners. Although I prefer creepy Peter Firth as Mr. Tierney, a little different from the novel. And books that provide direct discussion. General Tilney, played by Robert Hardy, performed one of the most ""ham"" programs. This movie is so amazing and shocking that I have to watch it again, to stop the horror.",negative

5166,"Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's stone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost. If some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ('his life is one long party'?????) The cast was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone more restrained, I gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child. I see I must wait for the BBC to weave its magic once again.",negative
5166,"Oh dear! The BBC can't be diverted from its path to get the drama of the time. I agree that this Jane Austens story is hard to express especially to a modern audience, courage is not Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not considered to be table to cause women's hearts to beats. I must say that hopefully I'm improving on the latter and I'm sorry. The main story is saved, but the conversation has changed significantly and everything rocks Jane Austen, her character, her emotions, her intelligence, this depth, is distracted if not lost. If some of the former addicts are seen dating the weakness of this one it must be very modern (‘his life is one party long’ ?????) The cast is usually enough, but I think Billie Piper was wrong in the selection, the needed someone more careful, I did not get any sense of the hidden depths outside the subconscious, the was such a crude child. I think I have to wait for the BBC to do its magic. > The main story is saved, but the conversation has changed dramatically and everything that has rocked Jane Austen, her character, her emotions, her intelligence, her depth, is confused if not lost .

If some of the former addicts can be seen as dating this vulnerability must be very modern (‘her life was a long celebration’ ?????) I agree that this is Jane’s story Austens is difficult A special highlight for the modern listener, courage is not Elizabeth Bennett, and even Edmund is not credited with causing women's hearts to beat the beat.

6010,"Faithful adaptation of witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer (or something), relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that. Downbeat (in a petit-bourgeois sort of way), philosophical and blackly humorous, the best way I could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual Charles Bukowski (no disrespect to CB intended). Mordantly funny, but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations, the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask: why karen't other films like this?

The growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong.

He totally in't smooth for have the mobster presence about him that makes you kinda root for him throughout the movie.

9989,"I had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews. Then. Here's my additional 'two cents' to the already posted, excellent 'lost in translation' review. Premise: Morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty small town where the meets lovely Scarlet who is working in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help elevate the lovely Scarlet from her trailer trash life? Realistic dialog? NOT. How about that shopping in Target. First, Freeman looks at the Target interior as if the's walked into Harrods. Then, the's bowled over at a T-shirt track confirming the has NEVER been in any store visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as gleeful in this ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and sex-hubby fight scene where her survival, a car in this instance, requires she physically attack her sex hubble. Does Freeman run to her defense. gnaw. the's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real, sorry lot in life. Freeman's character believes a car wash and new very revealing, tight fitting blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless 'stage talk' where all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to one for another stage related Freeman experience was irritating. Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces davis a davis: uneducated, no white collar skills for experience, VERY POOR, no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem. Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as: some people pay $one hundred for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her black of education and white collar job skills. In the send Freeman offers Scarlet little more than strange diversion with a 'star', not even paying for gas for Scarlet's dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which Freeman cares not to know.",negative

Morgan has been excluded from anything and all aspects of Scarlett's reality and has been portrayed as happy with the ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlett's life.

I don’t believe it and you can’t deal with the realities of the realities and regrets in this life. Freeman's role is believed to be a car wash and a new tight-fitting shirt that is a staple in Scarlett's interview. Another sign of Freeman's incompetence. Freeman's endless ""speech"" in which all aspects of Scarlett's reality have been reduced to a certain level related to Freeman's experience is irritating. Freeman emphasized that Scarlett was very young and that her future was bright for her, and then she took good care of the brick wall she faced with Davis: illiterate, inexperienced white collar skills, very poor, with no family support and a humble life Scarlett learned this life lesson from Freeman: $ one hundred to buy a T-shirt and a striped shirt could replace this black education and white job skills. What Freeman did to Scarlett was just a strange ""star"" change, and the never paid for gas so that Scarlett could return to this unchanging life in the city where Freeman did not know this name on the night death penalty.",negative

12953,"Why pooh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these. This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role. What's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a who-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real initial rise and fall. The three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but the could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits this role. But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (I am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres). The fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel never filmed.",negative

The sad thing is that since this movie has already been made, no other movies will be made to solve the original stuff, which is not included in Carlito's Road - I want to see this. I have the same feeling about Chopper — they have four books and interviews, valuable non-fiction material that can produce an amazing biography of Australia’s most terrifying in the world. is a little bit of a lie in the movie (although Eric Barner's performance was well done). Now we will never see Carlito's real ups and downs at first. These three stars are because, as an independent film, it’s not so surprising - there are some good plays (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito, but it can be very difficult in some good roles) And the story is good. suitable for this role.

17658,"It took me a few years to hunt down this title, a major staple of my childhood. Almost every trip to the video shop I'd pick out Space Raiders and watch it three times every time my mother rented it for me. It was, I suppose, my Star Wars. It's a shame then that it's such a stinker. My memories were so hazy that it offered nothing in terms of nostalgia so I had to take it at face value. A crew of space pirates accidentally kidnap a pretty annoying little kid and spend the rest of the movie trying to get him home. Aimed squarely at the under-tens it's got unwelcome slapstick, very shoddy costumes and make-up, recycled special effects, wobbly sets and poor acting. But even with the unintentional comedy it's no fun to see it as an adult, where I can pick out not just the technical faults but wonder at how spectacularly the writer and director managed to botch an endless stream of no-brainer fun/powerful moments that have been seen in a million other sci-fi movies and in the hands of anyone remotely competent should have been successful. I imagine as a kid I probably found it quite empowering - there are lots of ""I can't do this, I'm just a kid"" ""Sure you can kiddo, you just have to try!""-type exchanges; the kid drinks beer, etc., but even by low budget one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three sci-fi standards this one's pretty awful, with a real snoozer of a ""finale"".",negative

17932,"OK, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem, i.e. the story started out in life as material for Buster Keaton's silent classic ""seven Chances"". Comedy, for acting in any genre for that much, is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before, if it's not a totally original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget, short time span of a film, they're handling things just fine. Regardless of what the credits say on their films, real ""stooge-philes"" know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction. They took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. Words spoken by Emil Sitka himself during a documentary about the boys. Here, what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. Every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. How many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery? Most obviously the Seinfeld crew but none others that I've seen in the last thirty-five years of watching TV. The critics will always ""pooh pooh"" The Stooges for Laurel & Hardy and others but then again. who never remembers the critic's names for what they said? Simply watch, laugh and enjoy!",positive

Here, we have Stooges, which do things that are written and made by other people, but on a lower budget, short films, they behave better. No matter what the credits are in their films, “running dog lovers” really know they have a huge contribution to their lines and guidelines.

19511,"This is a good example of how NOT to make a film. There is very little meaningful dialog, no context for the events, and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused, clueless viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary. This movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is, with an emphasis on child abuse. It includes some stock footage of real, horrible facts of violence, including war time executions. Although it works in the context of the movie, I feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is absolutely NOT for the weak stomached for the easily offended, and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors. The climax is anti-climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie. If you're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it. The director's commentary was a one-shot, ""sit the guy down and let him talk, no cuts"" type of commentary. While this in't necessarily bad, the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about this college, filming conditions, co producers, bad film, and a dozen other things. The constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie. The movie was shot many years ago on sixteenmm and Supereight film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget. Because of this, the video and audio quality is poor. That alone does not make it a bad movie, but it does make a bad movie worse.",negative

The film has a lot to do with human cruelty and tries to show how wrong it is, focusing on child abuse. It includes facts about life and horrors, including the slaughter, during the war. Although it applies to movie content, I think the ideas behind the movie can be shown without complaining about the extreme content. This film is certainly not suitable for the weak-hearted, and it should not be shown to children under any circumstances. Compared to the rest of the film’s content, the climax is anticlimax. If you don’t listen to comments when they happen, don’t miss out. The director's description is one, ""Let him sit down, let him speak, there is no editing"" kind of comment. While this is not so bad, the director will send up saying nonsense, and often spend a few minutes complaining about the university, shooting situations, co-producers, bad movies, and a dozen other things. Continued negative influences weaken the film’s basic understanding tools. The film was shot in a sixteenmm and super eightmm film many years ago, which lasted four years and had a very low budget.

21961,"Aim For The Top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it. I totally loved this series, and to this day, it remains my favourite anime. And while it was not Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series. Mainly starting out as a parody of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode two, when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive the death of her father, who was killed in mankind's initial encounter with the insect race Humanity is at war with. It is because of her father's death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her black of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. And the has made it this personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot, for the was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first sortie together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's involvement is also of interest, as while Noriko is off in space, Kimiko remains behind on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the facts of time dilation, Kimiko pages normally on Earth while Noriko is relatively the same page as when she left school. By the send of the series, Noriko is roughly eighteen years old while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties. All in all, this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mech and of Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Anno's other shows, for are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork, then give this show a chance. It will grow on you.",positive

While this is not Gainax's first animated product, it is their first OVA series. Gunbuster began as a role play in the game ""Ace's Purpose (Ace O Nerae!)"" In the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. With the development of a profound drama at the send of the second episode, Noriko Takatani was forced to return to her father. It was because of her father's death that Kiko wanted to be a pilot. But it’s clear that this self-confidence sometimes hinders him, and the’s wrong. Her friend Kazumi Amano even suspected that Kiko had been selected as a pilot. However, Kiko's coach Ota Koichiro trusts him. And it made him successful as a pilot, for the had survived the war in which Noriko's father was killed.

33240,"What a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. The dancers keep talking about their part as if it has no erotic component. They may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered. From the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then send up hiring the ""dancers"" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the ""dancers"" only playing to the women in the audience. This just in't the reality of these clubs. It would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples. So what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead we get filler. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag facts but offers no insight into the dancers' lives and attitudes. The pictures of Mexico City are generic. The phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous. This is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing.

33324,"I still haven't gotten to see all of this; it's running on cable right now, and I seem to keep coming in on the middle of it. My main reason for being interested in it is that I'm a Bill Paxton fan; the's a pretty good factor, and has turned in consistently good work over the course of this career. The other thing is that, while never really a fan of the old series, I kinda liked Thunderbirds for the ships and effect work. Derek Meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and this designs for the International Rescue craft are wonderful. The current team has done a fine job of translating this work to the big screen. BUT. This is one flame story. The kids are asked to drive it, and while they do an okay job, it's hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have Brains' weight-year-old son flying Ttwo, an enormous multi-ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a Buick. Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is way over the top there, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does an good job as The Hood, but the can only do so much with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film on its very slim merits, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. Just don't look too closely at the machinery that drives it. ADDENDUM: I finally got to see all of this, and it's worse than I thought. The acting is fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are fairly good, the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier. The overdone product placement for Ford is annoying, and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it's bearable. But not very. Watch the original show, and you'll see what I mean. And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Director's Guild. You can do better than this, old friend. Another footnote. I saw this again. Last night. On Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish, with cheesy comedy sound effects. And yes, I came in roughly in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. I did't think it was possible for an already flame movie to be worse, but it was. It was embarrassingly bad. If this had been done straight, no kids-to-the-rescue, no tongue-in-cheek jokes, it might have worked.

In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady - Playboy centrefold Dorothy Stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband - before the film had even had its official premiere! Although Statten (who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a twenty-seven-year journey to some planet for other; in fact, Galaxina is an all-purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the Blue Star (cue choral music) once they land! Having said that, Statten certainly looks luminous in her white attire and, even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess, it's not exactly demeaning either. Still, it's ironic that for a film which bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would-be zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display there), a long-eared, wing-sporting coloured guy, a spot-smoking, proverb-quoting old Chinaman and, best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. The villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following this every mention of the Blue Star, exclaims, ""What is this is**t?"" There is little point in listing the sci-fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only flame but obvious; incredibly enough, a chest-busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive Hollywood veteran, Angelo Rossitto! For what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a Western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants are 'human gourmets' (delicacies on their menu include Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Baked Alaskan, etc), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity (the Harley Davidson) and when your heroes escape on the back of it, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their ""Lord"".

In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (as made by Warners) had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was dreadful, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess. I rated Phoenix a ""one"" because the scale does't go any lower. THE DECOY is four times better -- in all regards. If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance.

Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and this compares were the jones who ripped him off and now the wants it all back. The Ocean gang need a lot of money and fast, but cannot work in the states as Benedict has made it impossible for them. So it's off to Europe to perform facts of death defying thievery, whilst trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones' super cop, an old flame from Rusty's (Pitt's) past. On their first heist in Amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'Night Fox', a super slick thief with a legend complex. He issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full for land them in some kind of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-alive-type-sequence. Interesting? Well, yes. Slow? Sort of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Plenty. Ocean and this band of merry men are charismatic, if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more 'pally' situations and conversations. Too many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins are bickering as we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's cock-er-ney accent is as bad as never (I really like Cheadle, but could not abide this). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds. However, what worked so well in the last film was the black of character development versus how slick the whole damned top was. And as much as these factors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight eleven sided whole. She simply does't fit and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent. The stars of this film for me, however, were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderbergh's choice of locations. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if the was born into both. His Night Fox is arrogant, 'awfully cavalier with other people's lives' (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast to the Ocean gang. This is where I think the film closes its way. Cassel and the European locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the American factors and the style of the first film. We want slick, brash and quick-witted; not gritty, considered and intellectual. This is where the film does't work.

However, for me, the star of this movie is Vincent Kassel as the avenue chosen by Night Fox and Soderbergh. Kassel plays with fraud and wealth, as if both were born. His nocturnal fox is proud and “very arrogant in other people’s lives” (Danny Ocean), as opposed to the Ocean Gang. That’s when I think this movie ends. The Kassel and European locations make a significant difference with the American material and style of the original film.

Although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman, the story delightfully flirts with physics, medicine, religion and even politics as it questions your perceptions about what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma beautifully conveys that the world Mithi is living in is as real to her as hours is to us. Within that world, she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent, not the gibberish that they seem to us in your world. Here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie (don't worry, these are not spoilers). I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen wove these commentaries into the story.- The references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the switch-doctor (""ojha"" in Hindi) performing this religious rituals that the believes will drive away the ""ghosts"" sitting in Mithi's brain. - The doctor prescribing shock-treatment as a solution that is ""believed"" to work - Windows of perception - The scene about the review of Anu's book. - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for ""maya"". - News footage of George Bush telling the whole world that there is ""no doubt in this mind"" that there are WMD in Iraq (now, that is not as much about Bush's perception, who I suspect knew the truth, as the gullible public's perception about WMD in Iraq.)- One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mithi tells Anu ""Charu sent this man to beat me"" and Anu dismisses it as a matter of course. Konkona did a fantastic job, bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash. Aparna Sen was bold, but not bold enough to pose one big question: Is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in God? She could have inserted some scenes about ""normal"", ""healthy"" people praying to and sacrificing for a Being that no one has never seen for heard from in all of human history (The ritual/exorcism scene does't go far enough). That would be the ultimate question: What is normal? Who's reality is right, the Believer's for the Atheist's? IMHO, this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than ""A Beautiful Mind"". It looks at the minds of not just the sick person, but also the healthy, and does so from many different angles and illuminates your understanding of your own minds and your world. If the former got four Oscars, this deserves more - At least one each for story, screenplay, direction, Konkona, and Shabana Azmi.

37082,"After seeing the trailer for Evening, you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved, (I mean they even got Rocky Horror's own Brad, Barry Bostwick, to show the world the is still acting), and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie. While not entirely true, the film is pretty much summarized nicely in the trailer, and that in't necessarily a bad thing. This is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her lifethe one that got away. Her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and Harris killed Buddy soon plays out. No matter what happens, though, the film is not about these people and what they do, good for bad. It is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life. What may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to never happen. The story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature. Our filmmakers there decide to tell the story by intercutting between the present (Ann on her deathbed), dreamstate (Ann hallucinating by combining the present with the past in her mind), and the past (Ann meeting Harris at her best friend's wedding). There are a few times where the cuts are a tad abrupt, and the progression of the past is so good that you may find the present stuff a bit longwinded and boring, but overall it is handled better than at first thought. It's not as though Ann's life now is uninteresting, it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned. While I grant that the parallels to the past help alleviate the problems for Ann's children currently, I was still a bit too enraptured in the wedding to care as much as I maybe should have. There are some nice moments, though, for instance, the crash that awakens Ann from slumber being mirrored later on, and the cryptic dreams which bridge both worlds together. It is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid. These performances are completely riveting to the point where you get a bit angry when your time period has changed and we must wait to find out what happens next. No matter how annoying I find Claire Danes' angry/sad/crying face that exists in every role she plays, the girl is good at what she does. I find myself warming to her talents more and more lately and this one just furthers that thawing. Patrick Wilson is always great in whatever I've seen him in. You must give him credit for picking some really fantastic roles and never doing much more than one film a year. From Angels in America to last year's Little Children, the guy will soon blow up, but hopefully the will stay true to the craft and not cash-in. Heck even Mamie Gummer is good as the younger version of her real life mother Meryl Streep, (who surprisingly is in the film very little). She is still rough around the edges, but she was wonderful at expressing the emotional turmoil her character goes through on her wedding day. The real revelation, though, is Hugh Dancy. I feel I've seen him in many things, but in fact it seems only in King Arthur. Dancy literally steals every scene the is in and the way in which this role of Buddy is devastated by love/alcohol/life is etched in this facial expressions throughout. Without this performance, the flashback sequences could have fallen into the somewhat forgettable category as the rest of the film and made the experience as a whole much worse. While not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after, Evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table. You may be table to fault the length and amount of cut scenes to tie everything together, but you can't argue that the acting in't worth sticking around for. Maybe a film version of the wedding alone could have been something to see, however, when it is all put together, there may also be something coming out of it that could't have been achieved without all the other story threads. Either way, the payoff is worth the ride for the most part and each plane of reality finishes with its own subtle beauty and lives up to what had come before it.",positive
37082,"After watching the party trailer, you can start to think about how great the factors are, (I mean they even made a shocking film for Rocky Brad, Barry Bostway Gram, shows the world that the's still playing), how they show us every movie in the next second. Although not completely accurate, the movie is well summarized in a trailer, which is not a bad thing. This is the story of a dying woman. She remembered long ago that she had met the love of her life — who had run away. His daughters later recalled people they had never heard of, and the story of what happened when the and Harris killed Buddy. However, no matter what happens, this movie is not about these people and what they are doing, good for bad. It is a tool to show that there are no mistakes in life. What can be painful can be an example in your life so that the next good times will never happen. The story itself is very well told, clearly taken from a book. The filmmaker who was there decided to use the present tense (in her death), the state of dreams (the illusion that Ann connected the present tense with the past in her mind), and the past (and Ann's marriage to her best friend's wedding.) Harris meets) to tell a story. A few times the planning was sudden and the progress was very good. Ann's current life is not boring, but it has something to do with strategy, but it is closely related to the morals she has learned. While I agree that the similarities in the past can help alleviate the problems that Ann's children now face, I still love marriage to the extent that I can. However, there are also good times. For example, the danger of waking Ann from her deep sleep came later, with nightmares involving the two countries. It is a performance that makes the flashback attractive and smooth. These games are so exciting that you will get a little annoyed when your time changes, and we have to wait and see what happens next. No matter how annoying it is to think that there is an angry / sad / crying face in every character played by Claire Danes, this girl is very good at what she does. I find that I love this talents now more and more, and this is even more soothing. Patrick Wilson No matter what I've seen him do, the's always beautiful. You will have to commend him for choosing major roles, and not make more than one film a year. From an American angel to a little kid last year, this guy will shoot soon, but I hope they can be honest in the part instead of spending money. Heck, and Mamie Gummer are a small version of her real mother Meryl Streep (surprisingly, she rarely appears in the movies). Her tips are still rough, but she is skilled at expressing the emotional turmoil her character encountered on her wedding day. However, the true revelation is Hugh Dancy. I think I have seen him in many things, but in reality it seems I have only seen him in King Arthur. Dancy stole everywhere, and the way Buddy's character was devastated by the love / alcohol / life goes this way. Without this function, the flashback sequence can fall into a forgotten category like any other movie, and make the whole experience worse. Although it did not fully begin with the author's approach, the evening brought with it wisdom and ingenuity. You can criticize the length and number of cut images to tie everything together, but you can’t argue that performance in’t worth the compulsion. Maybe a version of the wedding movie alone can be watched, but when all these are put together, there may be other things that are impossible without all the other lines of the story. In any case, in most cases, the return is worth it, and each level of reality ends with its own hidden beauty and lasts a long time to the previous experience.",positive

The filmmaker who was there decided to move on now (Ann was before her death), a dream situation (Ann in her mind combined the present and past tenses to create ideas), and the past (Ann was at the wedding of her best friend with her. Harris meets) to tell a story. However, no matter what happens, this movie is not about these people and what they are doing, good for bad. A few times the planning was sudden and the progress was very good. Although not completely accurate, the movie is well summarized in a trailer, which is not a bad thing.",positive

37845,"""Holly"" is an issue-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. At its heart is it is a character-driven film, which would't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young Vietnamese girl. From the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing, everything is forthright and well-done. The contemporary classical score may put some off at first, but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout. This film, which raises many issues but provides few clear-cut answers, ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for Holly and the many who share her plight.

39063,"Since their nasty divorce from the Disney Company (with Disney keeping the Miramax brand) the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under-promoted and seen by few. THE FLOCK is a prime example. A story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders, this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of Law and Order - SVU. Richard Gere gives this best-ever performance as the soft-spoken agent worn-out by the task. Claire Danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in) and she makes the most of playing the novice. The cinematography, spacing, editing, all of it is first rate --- and I saw no trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera jump-around for excess camera cuts that others complained about. The subject is handled with restraint, but it's still a tough subject and might make you sick. Fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded. Then came the Supreme Court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the ""rights"" of sex perverts were opened up and America was turned into a shopper's paradise for sexual perversity, both willing and unwilling. Each such step was met with praise by Liberals, who celebrated the Warren Court's will deeds with glossy covers on Time and Newsweek. Everyday liberals also praised the Court's action and mocked those who disagree. In two thousand and seven how many Americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to, and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the US Post Office. Just one part of the problem -- a problem that can stare anyone's family to shreds. Richard Gere is a Liberal, but the gives this best in this performance there. Perhaps in this maturing page the's gained a measure of wisdom.",positive

The film was poor on many levels: First - Treadwell's video footage was contrived. The more I watched, the more the seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of conviction. Second - The others in the film, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were just as contrived and corny as the was. God, they seemed artificial. Third - Treadwell's mission to protect the bears does't even make sense as the did more charm than good by making the bears grow accustomed to human presence. I believe that Treadwell really did love the bears but there is much research which indicates this efforts were misguided. Sometimes we have to sacrifice your enjoyment of wildlife to really help. Fourth - The film's entertainment value was't half that of other wildlife films such as ""March of the Penguins"" and ""Winged Migration"". The filmmakers, in my opinion, did a poor job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to keep watching.

We, like the hero, will never escape from the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of this criminally driven, Mafia world. That the film resists Mafia stereotypes whilst revelling in them makes it all the more successful. The concrete grave, the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming maleness are laid bare and exposed for what they are. Just brutality and business, and no more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organised crime and not about love for living for self, family for others. Our hero is indeed a hero in that the gives up this life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid, the resolution of the misery suffered by this only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape this decorative prison.

Some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--don't make it to the screen at all, and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence. Where's the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where's the continued affair between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all, since her story's never explained? Where's the rape and redemption of Marie, whose greatest attribute (and downfall) is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film send with Marcel's beating at the hands of this father? We learn nothing of Aglae beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory explaining this hatred? As for the performances, there's not a one that's better than mediocre, though that's likely due to the lousy script. Best of the lot is that of the factor playing Richard--but Richard's not on screen enough to salvage the film. Worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, though again, it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with. All in all, this is just terrible. I thought it'd be impossible for any Anne Rice book-turned film to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look like a critical hit.

In terms of performance, there is nothing better than democracy, although this may be due to a bad script.

Certainly not the makers of ""Fido,"" who take us to a never-never-land version of the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to ""life"" by radiation from router space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time. This twisted, modern-day spin on the TV series ""Lassie"" - it might easily have been entitled ""A Boy and His Zombie"" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such are-'sixtys concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of part-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. The movie does't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. Instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humour derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine). Despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade. K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and this Cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.

48311,"I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake. The DVD version titled ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don't rent for buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense. Much as I liked seeing Wang Yu in this prime again after all these years, this one is an butter waste of time. I've had dish detergents that made a better film than this. What the chopped-up DVD version shows us is that no matter how silly a Chinese script may be, you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out. But ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" does offer you do the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers stalwart Lo Lieh beating up smirking pretty boy David Chiang -- it's always a pleasure to see that happen. Lo plays a sort of second-string villain there, and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists. the film is also graced by the participation of Taiwanese factor Chang Yi as the magistrate. Another comment above mentions the obligatory fight-in-the-inn scene (there are two, in fact) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons, making Bruce Lee noises while they fight. None of this makes any sense, but that's okay if you're not expecting any clarity for common sense. It was fun to watch anyway. Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters. There are a couple of female roles, but they play no serious role in the action for the plot. If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie, the one which explains why the has only the one farm and why the uses a broken sword, go for it.",negative
48311,"I rented this copy from Netflix - this is a big mistake. The DVD version called ""One-Armed Swordsman"" is made up of idiots, who think it would be better to stick all the successive battles into one big chapter, rather than be part of an immutable story going on. Some stories are stored in different chapters, you can choose from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Do not rent for the purpose of purchase. It is not surprising that the original story is so funny, so ridiculous and so complicated. Although I would love to see Wang Yu at this speak after so many years, it was a waste of time at this point. I used dish soap and I could get a better film than this. What the DVD shows is that no matter how ridiculous the Chinese text is, you will have to read some stories to pay attention to the sequence of shapes. But ""The Armed Swordsman"" gives you a chance to see the determined Luo Lie of Wang and Shaw's brothers beat up a good boy David Jiang - it's always nice to see this happen. Luo played a second-class villain there, and as a good example of why some people really want an orthodontist. Zhang Yi from Taiwan has worked as a city magistrate, adding to the film's brilliance. The other description above is mentioned in a forced dormitory fight (there are actually two), where Wang and Jiang are attacked by a group of humorous barbarians using what appear to be cavemen, making Bruce Lee sound as they fight. None of this makes sense, but if you don’t expect any clarity of common sense, fine. After all, it was so much fun. Another characteristic of this work is that there are no important traits for women. There are many female characters, but they do not play an important role in the plot.

It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it.""Scoop"" is Woody Allen's latest film and though the appears in this one, it's OK. It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfect together. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the Reaper has taken. One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of England. Joe, with the scoop of a life time, travels back to the living and gives this info to Sondra, during a magic act. Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box, she gets the visit from Joe. Not knowing what to do, she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case. This film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to ""Match Point"" and yet it all works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humour fits perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman, the ""suspected"" serial killer.

Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry. The acting seems very poor as well, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television. Although this is difficult to tell with the female role, Yuwen, as the story seems to only require her walking around like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time. Tian Zhuangzhuang's film the 'Blue Kite' was a far better film. But don't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late 'fortys. Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop. I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' for 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial.

30959,"'De Grot' is a terrific Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of this books, 'Het Gouden Ei' was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called 'Spoorloos' ('The Vanishing') in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. This one is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the American remake also called 'The Vanishing') but there are times it comes close. Especially the opening moments are terrific. We see a man, later we learn this name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from a plane in Thailand. When the picks up this bags it is pretty clear that the is smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. Later we see how Egon makes this deal in Thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this. From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward. We see how Egon, still as a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a guy named Axel (as a kid played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. Around this time the sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything to do with him. The movie is chronological in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their mid-thirties. But from time to time, like I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again. Every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults. Minor spoilers herein. The title means 'The Cave', and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. Like the beginning, the ending is terrific. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts your attention of the first scenes, only to come back at that point in the send.

32659,"There have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb. The Robert Taylor film ABOVE AND BEYOND (flag waving interservice propaganda really; if you believe this one you think that the Army Air Corps, in the person of Paul W. Tibbits, iran the entire show!), the NBC produced ENOLA GAY (probably A LOT closer to the mark), and the BBC-TV series, OPPENHEIMER, with Sam Waterston in the title role. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes the same approach that the BBC series did but widens it; it avoids the ""Gee Whiz"" technology of the Manhattan Project and focuses on human aspects; the personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide swath of mythical but pretty typical people who were part of it. With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, presenting a dreamy, Ivory Tower academic who struggles to relate this contributions as a physicist to this inclinations to view the world in a wider social and moral context. only to have that struggle won by an overriding lust for personal power and glory. In THE DAY AFTER TRINITY it was made clear that Oppenheimer viewed himself as a ""superior being"" by virtue of this vast, wide ranging intellectual prowess. In the send that was Robert Oppenheimer's downfall; the saw himself as a sort of ""Philosopher/King"", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightfully SHOULD) ""wisely"" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world are. nuclear weapons development and deployment. Unfortunately, wisdom does't dictate the actions of nations for direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does't bestow temporal power. When it tries to exercise such nonexistent power (as Oppie found when the opposed the development of ""The Super"", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who REALLY have the power. I found myself faulting Schultz character in one way; this Oppie exposes himself TOO closely and personally to the Manhattan Project, despite the doubts and fears that store at this intellectual basis. The real Oppenheimer would have had to take a different approach; at the beginning the would have had to come to the firm resolution that the project would result in ultimate good. The ugliness it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to attain that ultimate good, and it must be ignored. at least until the send of the project when there was leisure to assess the gains and losses. Oppie clearly did that, and it resulted in this controversial postwar statements to the effect that science had now known sin, and that was a knowledge it could never close. While the project went on, such considerations HAD to be pushed aside if the was to maintain this sanity. Because of this ambiguity, Schultz character comes off as a weak, frightened little boy who could NEVER have served as ""Coordinator of Rapid Rupture"", as Oppenheimer unofficially dubbed this post. Paul Newman's take on Gen. Leslie R. Groves is fascinating, and a bravura performance, if possibly a LITTLE BIT over the top. Groves was a civil engineer by training, but first and foremost the was a SOLDIER, and a general to boot! He's accustomed to DEMANDING that things go HIS way. intensely driven, a foul mouthed, spoiled child who has tantrums at the drop of a that, who reveres this country and in't too proud to fall on this knees and spray. In other words, very much like REAL (ie, NON civil engineer) soldiers, aka George Patton! Grove's MISSION not only comes first, it is this ONLY consideration. feelings and egos be damned, except for this OWN, of course! Groves could't admit it, but the knew full well that the NEEDED Oppenheimer; military rank meant NOTHING in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds the had to straddle. Again. I have to fault the script on this, and for the same reason. In reality, Groves already OWNED Oppie; if the did't, Oppie would never have been chosen for the post in the first place. History tells of MANY cases where other scientists, some as stellar as Oppenheimer, simply walked away from Groves recruitment efforts. At one point Groves was so desperate that the proposed DRAFTING the physicists the needed! Groves attempts in the film to maneuver and control Oppie were UNNECESSARY. they only exist there as a dramatic device which indeed helps make the atmosphere of the film quite ugly. Kusak's ""Michael Merriman"" is a composite of several real characters, but they're from a different time frame. Several research accidents similar to the one depicted happened in POSTWAR weapons research. Merriman's radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film, but one which is, IMHO, necessary, and pretty accurate. People with weak stomachs will have a hard time handling the hospital sequences; they're all TOO real. The main idea that comes across, but not strongly enough IMHO, is the big truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed on were young, idealistic and naive as well as talented. Most were on their first excursion out of the shelter of the campus. To them the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of budgets for ""excessive"" bureaucratic oversight. It was not only their brilliance, but their youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb. There's plenty there to make the thoughtful viewer intensely uncomfortable about this movie. Just the same, if you filter out the Hollywood BS (there in't that much of it really), this is probably a pretty accurate view of the inside of Manhattan Project.",positive
32659,"There are many things about the development of the atomic bomb. Robert Taylor's film OVER AND OVER (actually flag-waving across-service propaganda; NBC produced ENOLA GAY (Probably close to the mark), with the BBC TV series OPPENHEIMER, with Sam Waterston as the lead role. THE ORDINARY PERSON AND THE LITTLE BOY take the same path as the BBC series, but extend the limit; inhibits the “Gee Whiz” technology of the Manhattan Project and focuses on humanity; characters involved in the work. It does’t look like Oppie, but it does cover a large number of amazing but unusual people, and they are part of it. Without some hesitation, Dwight Schultz has performed well as an Oppie, showcasing an outstanding ivory expert, and is trying to combine this contribution as a physicist with this to the general public. It was only with a quest for power and personal glory that this struggle was defeated. In ""Days After the Trinity"", Oppenheimer made it clear that with this vast and profound force of wisdom, Oppenheimer considered himself to be ""an excellent life."" The fall of Robert Oppenheimer saw himself as a kind of ""philosopher / king"", a high moral and intellectual man who could (and rightly so) ""wisely"" explain to the whole world What is the best. Development and distribution of nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, wisdom cannot dictate national action on a global scale. Wisdom does not give time. In an effort to harness this powerless force (as Opi found out when the opposed the development of the “super” hydrogen bomb), wisdom was ignored and dismissed by those who were truly powerful. I found myself criticizing the Schultz character in some way; without a doubt and fear based on this information, Oppie introduced himself to the Manhattan Project closely and personally. The true Oppenheimer will have to take a different approach; initially, they need to make a firm decision that the project will bring the ultimate profit. Evil produced on the road will be an unexpected value that must be paid in order to obtain the best possible profit, and it must be ignored. At least before the project is submitted, there is free time to evaluate the profit and loss. Oppie apparently did this, which led to this controversial post-war report, with the result that science now knows sin, which is the kind of knowledge that can never be closed. As the project progresses, these considerations should be set aside if this behavior is to be maintained. Because of this ambiguity, Schultz's character looks like a weak, scary boy, who will never function as ""a broken-up organizer,"" Oppenheimer called the article unfair. Paul Newman’s view of General Leslie R. Groves is interesting and works with courage, if possible, very little. Grove is a trained local engineer, but most importantly, the is a soldier and a general! He often tasks for things to be done this way. Driven by force, a spoiled child full of insults, the closes this temper when the says this, the loves the country and is not too proud to kneel and splash water. In other words, very much like a real soldier (i.e. non-civil engineer), aka George Patton! Grove's goal is not only the first, but also the most important factor. Deep feelings and confidence, of course, without this! Grove could not admit this, but the knew the wanted Oppenheimer; in the world of physicists, military standards are meaningless. Oppie is a necessary link between the two worlds that must across. again. For the same reason, I have to handle the error-script in this regard. After all, Groves already towns Oppie; if not, Oppie would not have been selected to this position in the first place. History tells the story of many other scientists, some of whom were as brilliant as Oppenheimer, who sacrificed Groves' work to grind people. After Groves became so disillusioned with the idea of ​​designing a much-needed physicist! It is not necessary for the Groves to try to trick and control Obi in the movie. They only exist as a form of theatre installation, which really helps to make the movie atmosphere worse. Kusak's ""Michael Merriman"" is a mix of several real characters, but they appear at different times. Many research hazards such as reported accidents have occurred in post-war weapons research. Merriman’s radiation exposure creates another kind of evil in the film, but IMHO is necessary and accurate. It is difficult for people with weak stomachs to deal with hospital follow-up; they are all very real. The main idea associated with it, but IMHO is not strong enough, is an important fact about the Los Alamos experience. The agreed scientists are young, smart, smart and talented. Most people leave home on campus for the first time.

33240,"What a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. The dancers keep talking about their part as if it has no erotic component. They may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered. From the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then send up hiring the ""dancers"" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the ""dancers"" only playing to the women in the audience. This just in't the reality of these clubs. It would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples. So what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead we get filler. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag facts but offers no insight into the dancers' lives and attitudes. The pictures of Mexico City are generic.

33324,"I still haven't gotten to see all of this; it's running on cable right now, and I seem to keep coming in on the middle of it. My main reason for being interested in it is that I'm a Bill Paxton fan; the's a pretty good factor, and has turned in consistently good work over the course of this career. The other thing is that, while never really a fan of the old series, I kinda liked Thunderbirds for the ships and effect work. Derek Meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and this designs for the International Rescue craft are wonderful. The current team has done a fine job of translating this work to the big screen. BUT. This is one flame story. The kids are asked to drive it, and while they do an okay job, it's hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have Brains' weight-year-old son flying Ttwo, an enormous multi-ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a Buick. Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is way over the top there, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does an good job as The Hood, but the can only do so much with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film on its very slim merits, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. Just don't look too closely at the machinery that drives it. ADDENDUM: I finally got to see all of this, and it's worse than I thought. The acting is fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are fairly good, the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier. The overdone product placement for Ford is annoying, and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it's bearable. But not very. Watch the original show, and you'll see what I mean. And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Director's Guild. You can do better than this, old friend. Another footnote. I saw this again. Last night. On Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish, with cheesy comedy sound effects. And yes, I came in roughly in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. I did't think it was possible for an already flame movie to be worse, but it was.

In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady - Playboy centrefold Dorothy Stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband - before the film had even had its official premiere! Although Statten (who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a twenty-seven-year journey to some planet for other; in fact, Galaxina is an all-purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the Blue Star (cue choral music) once they land! Having said that, Statten certainly looks luminous in her white attire and, even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess, it's not exactly demeaning either. Still, it's ironic that for a film which bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would-be zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display there), a long-eared, wing-sporting coloured guy, a spot-smoking, proverb-quoting old Chinaman and, best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. The villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following this every mention of the Blue Star, exclaims, ""What is this is**t?"" There is little point in listing the sci-fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only flame but obvious; incredibly enough, a chest-busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive Hollywood veteran, Angelo Rossitto! For what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a Western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants are 'human gourmets' (delicacies on their menu include Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Baked Alaskan, etc), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity (the Harley Davidson) and when your heroes escape on the back of it, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their ""Lord"".

The series of children's games is not my favourite thing, but Chucky's Bride is really a good movie. This makes the movie even better, just as comedy shows do in a lot of horror movies. Even if you don't like children's games, you can still try. This time we have two dolls Chucky and this sex-girlfriend (if human) Tiffany. They travel to find things together.",positive

In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (as made by Warners) had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was dreadful, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess. I rated Phoenix a ""one"" because the scale does't go any lower. THE DECOY is four times better -- in all regards. If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance.

Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and this compares were the jones who ripped him off and now the wants it all back. The Ocean gang need a lot of money and fast, but cannot work in the states as Benedict has made it impossible for them. So it's off to Europe to perform facts of death defying thievery, whilst trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones' super cop, an old flame from Rusty's (Pitt's) past. On their first heist in Amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'Night Fox', a super slick thief with a legend complex. He issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full for land them in some kind of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-alive-type-sequence. Interesting? Well, yes. Slow? Sort of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Plenty. Ocean and this band of merry men are charismatic, if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more 'pally' situations and conversations. Too many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins are bickering as we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's cock-er-ney accent is as bad as never (I really like Cheadle, but could not abide this). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds. However, what worked so well in the last film was the black of character development versus how slick the whole damned top was. And as much as these factors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight eleven sided whole. She simply does't fit and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent. The stars of this film for me, however, were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderbergh's choice of locations. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if the was born into both. His Night Fox is arrogant, 'awfully cavalier with other people's lives' (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast to the Ocean gang. This is where I think the film closes its way. Cassel and the European locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the American factors and the style of the first film. We want slick, brash and quick-witted; not gritty, considered and intellectual. This is where the film does't work.

However, for me, the star of this movie is Vincent Kassel as the avenue chosen by Night Fox and Soderbergh. Kassel plays with fraud and wealth, as if both were born. His nocturnal fox is proud and “very arrogant in other people’s lives” (Danny Ocean), as opposed to the Ocean Gang. That’s when I think this movie ends. The Kassel and European locations make a significant difference with the American material and style of the original film.

Although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman, the story delightfully flirts with physics, medicine, religion and even politics as it questions your perceptions about what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma beautifully conveys that the world Mithi is living in is as real to her as hours is to us. Within that world, she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent, not the gibberish that they seem to us in your world. Here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie (don't worry, these are not spoilers). I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen wove these commentaries into the story.- The references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the switch-doctor (""ojha"" in Hindi) performing this religious rituals that the believes will drive away the ""ghosts"" sitting in Mithi's brain. - The doctor prescribing shock-treatment as a solution that is ""believed"" to work - Windows of perception - The scene about the review of Anu's book. - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for ""maya"". - News footage of George Bush telling the whole world that there is ""no doubt in this mind"" that there are WMD in Iraq (now, that is not as much about Bush's perception, who I suspect knew the truth, as the gullible public's perception about WMD in Iraq.)- One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mithi tells Anu ""Charu sent this man to beat me"" and Anu dismisses it as a matter of course. Konkona did a fantastic job, bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash. Aparna Sen was bold, but not bold enough to pose one big question: Is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in God? She could have inserted some scenes about ""normal"", ""healthy"" people praying to and sacrificing for a Being that no one has never seen for heard from in all of human history (The ritual/exorcism scene does't go far enough). That would be the ultimate question: What is normal? Who's reality is right, the Believer's for the Atheist's? IMHO, this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than ""A Beautiful Mind"". It looks at the minds of not just the sick person, but also the healthy, and does so from many different angles and illuminates your understanding of your own minds and your world. If the former got four Oscars, this deserves more - At least one each for story, screenplay, direction, Konkona, and Shabana Azmi.

37082,"After seeing the trailer for Evening, you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved, (I mean they even got Rocky Horror's own Brad, Barry Bostwick, to show the world the is still acting), and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie. While not entirely true, the film is pretty much summarized nicely in the trailer, and that in't necessarily a bad thing. This is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her lifethe one that got away. Her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and Harris killed Buddy soon plays out. No matter what happens, though, the film is not about these people and what they do, good for bad. It is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life. What may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to never happen. The story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature. Our filmmakers there decide to tell the story by intercutting between the present (Ann on her deathbed), dreamstate (Ann hallucinating by combining the present with the past in her mind), and the past (Ann meeting Harris at her best friend's wedding). There are a few times where the cuts are a tad abrupt, and the progression of the past is so good that you may find the present stuff a bit longwinded and boring, but overall it is handled better than at first thought. It's not as though Ann's life now is uninteresting, it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned. While I grant that the parallels to the past help alleviate the problems for Ann's children currently, I was still a bit too enraptured in the wedding to care as much as I maybe should have. There are some nice moments, though, for instance, the crash that awakens Ann from slumber being mirrored later on, and the cryptic dreams which bridge both worlds together. It is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid. These performances are completely riveting to the point where you get a bit angry when your time period has changed and we must wait to find out what happens next. No matter how annoying I find Claire Danes' angry/sad/crying face that exists in every role she plays, the girl is good at what she does. I find myself warming to her talents more and more lately and this one just furthers that thawing. Patrick Wilson is always great in whatever I've seen him in. You must give him credit for picking some really fantastic roles and never doing much more than one film a year. From Angels in America to last year's Little Children, the guy will soon blow up, but hopefully the will stay true to the craft and not cash-in. Heck even Mamie Gummer is good as the younger version of her real life mother Meryl Streep, (who surprisingly is in the film very little). She is still rough around the edges, but she was wonderful at expressing the emotional turmoil her character goes through on her wedding day. The real revelation, though, is Hugh Dancy. I feel I've seen him in many things, but in fact it seems only in King Arthur. Dancy literally steals every scene the is in and the way in which this role of Buddy is devastated by love/alcohol/life is etched in this facial expressions throughout. Without this performance, the flashback sequences could have fallen into the somewhat forgettable category as the rest of the film and made the experience as a whole much worse. While not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after, Evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table. You may be table to fault the length and amount of cut scenes to tie everything together, but you can't argue that the acting in't worth sticking around for. Maybe a film version of the wedding alone could have been something to see, however, when it is all put together, there may also be something coming out of it that could't have been achieved without all the other story threads. Either way, the payoff is worth the ride for the most part and each plane of reality finishes with its own subtle beauty and lives up to what had come before it.",positive
37082,"After watching the party trailer, you can start to think about how great the factors are, (I mean they even made a shocking film for Rocky Brad, Barry Bostway Gram, shows the world that the's still playing), how they show us every movie in the next second. Although not completely accurate, the movie is well summarized in a trailer, which is not a bad thing. This is the story of a dying woman. She remembered long ago that she had met the love of her life — who had run away. His daughters later recalled people they had never heard of, and the story of what happened when the and Harris killed Buddy. However, no matter what happens, this movie is not about these people and what they are doing, good for bad. It is a tool to show that there are no mistakes in life. What can be painful can be an example in your life so that the next good times will never happen. The story itself is very well told, clearly taken from a book. The filmmaker who was there decided to use the present tense (in her death), the state of dreams (the illusion that Ann connected the present tense with the past in her mind), and the past (and Ann's marriage to her best friend's wedding.) Harris meets) to tell a story. A few times the planning was sudden and the progress was very good. Ann's current life is not boring, but it has something to do with strategy, but it is closely related to the morals she has learned. While I agree that the similarities in the past can help alleviate the problems that Ann's children now face, I still love marriage to the extent that I can. However, there are also good times. For example, the danger of waking Ann from her deep sleep came later, with nightmares involving the two countries. It is a performance that makes the flashback attractive and smooth. These games are so exciting that you will get a little annoyed when your time changes, and we have to wait and see what happens next. No matter how annoying it is to think that there is an angry / sad / crying face in every character played by Claire Danes, this girl is very good at what she does. I find that I love this talents now more and more, and this is even more soothing. Patrick Wilson No matter what I've seen him do, the's always beautiful. You will have to commend him for choosing major roles, and not make more than one film a year. From an American angel to a little kid last year, this guy will shoot soon, but I hope they can be honest in the part instead of spending money. Heck, and Mamie Gummer are a small version of her real mother Meryl Streep (surprisingly, she rarely appears in the movies). Her tips are still rough, but she is skilled at expressing the emotional turmoil her character encountered on her wedding day. However, the true revelation is Hugh Dancy. I think I have seen him in many things, but in reality it seems I have only seen him in King Arthur. Dancy stole everywhere, and the way Buddy's character was devastated by the love / alcohol / life goes this way. Without this function, the flashback sequence can fall into a forgotten category like any other movie, and make the whole experience worse. Although it did not fully begin with the author's approach, the evening brought with it wisdom and ingenuity. You can criticize the length and number of cut images to tie everything together, but you can’t argue that performance in’t worth the compulsion. Maybe a version of the wedding movie alone can be watched, but when all these are put together, there may be other things that are impossible without all the other lines of the story. In any case, in most cases, the return is worth it, and each level of reality ends with its own hidden beauty and lasts a long time to the previous experience.",positive

Harris meets) to tell a story. However, no matter what happens, this movie is not about these people and what they are doing, good for bad. A few times the planning was sudden and the progress was very good. Although not completely accurate, the movie is well summarized in a trailer, which is not a bad thing.",positive

37845,"""Holly"" is an issue-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. At its heart is it is a character-driven film, which would't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young Vietnamese girl. From the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing, everything is forthright and well-done. The contemporary classical score may put some off at first, but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout. This film, which raises many issues but provides few clear-cut answers, ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for Holly and the many who share her plight. Kudos to those who managed to get it made.",positive

39063,"Since their nasty divorce from the Disney Company (with Disney keeping the Miramax brand) the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under-promoted and seen by few. THE FLOCK is a prime example. A story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders, this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of Law and Order - SVU. Richard Gere gives this best-ever performance as the soft-spoken agent worn-out by the task. Claire Danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in) and she makes the most of playing the novice. The cinematography, spacing, editing, all of it is first rate --- and I saw no trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera jump-around for excess camera cuts that others complained about. The subject is handled with restraint, but it's still a tough subject and might make you sick. Fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded. Then came the Supreme Court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the ""rights"" of sex perverts were opened up and America was turned into a shopper's paradise for sexual perversity, both willing and unwilling. Each such step was met with praise by Liberals, who celebrated the Warren Court's will deeds with glossy covers on Time and Newsweek. Everyday liberals also praised the Court's action and mocked those who disagree. In two thousand and seven how many Americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to, and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the US Post Office. Just one part of the problem -- a problem that can stare anyone's family to shreds. Richard Gere is a Liberal, but the gives this best in this performance there. Perhaps in this maturing page the's gained a measure of wisdom.",positive

The film was poor on many levels: First - Treadwell's video footage was contrived. The more I watched, the more the seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of conviction. Second - The others in the film, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were just as contrived and corny as the was. God, they seemed artificial. Third - Treadwell's mission to protect the bears does't even make sense as the did more charm than good by making the bears grow accustomed to human presence. I believe that Treadwell really did love the bears but there is much research which indicates this efforts were misguided. Sometimes we have to sacrifice your enjoyment of wildlife to really help. Fourth - The film's entertainment value was't half that of other wildlife films such as ""March of the Penguins"" and ""Winged Migration"". The filmmakers, in my opinion, did a poor job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to keep watching.

We, like the hero, will never escape from the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of this criminally driven, Mafia world. That the film resists Mafia stereotypes whilst revelling in them makes it all the more successful. The concrete grave, the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming maleness are laid bare and exposed for what they are. Just brutality and business, and no more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organised crime and not about love for living for self, family for others. Our hero is indeed a hero in that the gives up this life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid, the resolution of the misery suffered by this only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape this decorative prison.

Some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--don't make it to the screen at all, and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence. Where's the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where's the continued affair between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all, since her story's never explained? Where's the rape and redemption of Marie, whose greatest attribute (and downfall) is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film send with Marcel's beating at the hands of this father? We learn nothing of Aglae beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory explaining this hatred? As for the performances, there's not a one that's better than mediocre, though that's likely due to the lousy script. Best of the lot is that of the factor playing Richard--but Richard's not on screen enough to salvage the film. Worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, though again, it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with. All in all, this is just terrible. I thought it'd be impossible for any Anne Rice book-turned film to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look like a critical hit.

In terms of performance, there is nothing better than democracy, although this may be due to a bad script.

Certainly not the makers of ""Fido,"" who take us to a never-never-land version of the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to ""life"" by radiation from router space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time. This twisted, modern-day spin on the TV series ""Lassie"" - it might easily have been entitled ""A Boy and His Zombie"" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such are-'sixtys concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of part-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. The movie does't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. Instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humour derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine). Despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade. K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and this Cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.

48311,"I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake. The DVD version titled ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don't rent for buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense. Much as I liked seeing Wang Yu in this prime again after all these years, this one is an butter waste of time. I've had dish detergents that made a better film than this. What the chopped-up DVD version shows us is that no matter how silly a Chinese script may be, you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out. But ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" does offer you do the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers stalwart Lo Lieh beating up smirking pretty boy David Chiang -- it's always a pleasure to see that happen. Lo plays a sort of second-string villain there, and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists. the film is also graced by the participation of Taiwanese factor Chang Yi as the magistrate. Another comment above mentions the obligatory fight-in-the-inn scene (there are two, in fact) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons, making Bruce Lee noises while they fight. None of this makes any sense, but that's okay if you're not expecting any clarity for common sense. It was fun to watch anyway. Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters. There are a couple of female roles, but they play no serious role in the action for the plot. If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie, the one which explains why the has only the one farm and why the uses a broken sword, go for it.",negative
48311,"I rented this copy from Netflix - this is a big mistake. The DVD version called ""One-Armed Swordsman"" is made up of idiots, who think it would be better to stick all the successive battles into one big chapter, rather than be part of an immutable story going on. Some stories are stored in different chapters, you can choose from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Do not rent for the purpose of purchase. It is not surprising that the original story is so funny, so ridiculous and so complicated. Although I would love to see Wang Yu at this speak after so many years, it was a waste of time at this point. I used dish soap and I could get a better film than this. What the DVD shows is that no matter how ridiculous the Chinese text is, you will have to read some stories to pay attention to the sequence of shapes. But ""The Armed Swordsman"" gives you a chance to see the determined Luo Lie of Wang and Shaw's brothers beat up a good boy David Jiang - it's always nice to see this happen. Luo played a second-class villain there, and as a good example of why some people really want an orthodontist. Zhang Yi from Taiwan has worked as a city magistrate, adding to the film's brilliance. The other description above is mentioned in a forced dormitory fight (there are actually two), where Wang and Jiang are attacked by a group of humorous barbarians using what appear to be cavemen, making Bruce Lee sound as they fight. None of this makes sense, but if you don’t expect any clarity of common sense, fine. After all, it was so much fun. Another characteristic of this work is that there are no important traits for women. There are many female characters, but they do not play an important role in the plot. If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie that explains why there is one farm and why the Broken Sword was used, go to it.",negative

48899,"Scoop *** out of **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favourite director, but I enjoyed ""Match Point."" It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star Woody Allen. It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it.""Scoop"" is Woody Allen's latest film and though the appears in this one, it's OK. It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfect together. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the Reaper has taken. One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of England. Joe, with the scoop of a life time, travels back to the living and gives this info to Sondra, during a magic act. Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box, she gets the visit from Joe. Not knowing what to do, she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case. This film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to ""Match Point"" and yet it all works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humour fits perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman, the ""suspected"" serial killer. This is a fun little movie to see if your never looking for one to watch. The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself. I say give it a chance because you just might like it.",positive

49019,"Not very impressed. Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film, because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry. The acting seems very poor as well, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television. Although this is difficult to tell with the female role, Yuwen, as the story seems to only require her walking around like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time. Tian Zhuangzhuang's film the 'Blue Kite' was a far better film. But don't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late 'fortys. Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop. I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' for 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial. If any film fits the description of 'overrated,' this is it. I see no reason there to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.",negative
