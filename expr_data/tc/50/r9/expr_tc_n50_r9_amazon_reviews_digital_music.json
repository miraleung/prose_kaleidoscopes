If you think Gwen is just a Madonna wannabe, forget it, she was one of the original modern day rock queens. She along with the rest of No Doubt led the ninety's movement of Ska-rock. Her voice is perfectly suited to the genre, she has the range and the expressiveness. I found upon first listening to this album everything seems clancy and a bit 'hyper'. After listening to this album more I found that it was clancy, but that's just their style. It showed some real potential and the songs started to reveal themselves as gems. Tragic Kingdom was one of the biggest albums of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, though it could't come close to the success of Jagged Little Pill by Alanis Morissette. Still it provided bored Orange County teenagers with role models and something to listen to. I love No Doubt's style, they were doing something no other 'mainstream' band were doing and having huge success with it. Their mixture of Ska-rock-pop and tiny elements of ragga propelled them into the musical spotlight. This album is like a soundtrack to California at the time, this is what California sounded like in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. No Doubt are Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young (and then Eric Stefani was part of the mix), they sound like the best band in the world on this album. With Gwen's unique, angelic voice, Tony's pulsating bass strums, Tom's catchy guitar riffs, and Adrian's super syncopated percussion (also those fab keyboards from Eric) made No Doubt top of the music industry. Tragic Kingdom contains some great songs most famous of those is undoubtedly Don't Speak. Other highlights of this album include: Spiderwebs, Excuse Me Mr. and Just A Girl. This album is the perfect length, not too long yet not that short. Also I like the fact there are only two quite slow songs the rest is a pulsating 'riff-ridden' affair. Overall, Tragic Kingdom is one of those albums that you listen to and they bring back memories, that is an integral part of what music is about. Whether it be the fact that this album shows you that Gwen in't just a plastic pop doll but a genuine rock chick for you get to listen to Don't Speak all over again you must own this album.","overall":5,"summary":"\"....but that's just their style.\"","unixReviewTime":1136505600,"reviewTime":"01 6, 2006"}

I had to get help from No Doubt's album. I finally deed to travel to the Tragic Kingdom after careful consideration. If you think Gwen is right. someone who loves the Madonna, forget it, is one of the first kings of stone today. He and other members of No Doubt led the Ska-rock movement in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. His voice deserves this kind of style, and its range and clarity are worth it. When I first listened to this album, I found that everything seemed restricted and \u201ctoo big\u201d. After listening more to this album, I discovered that this is Clancy, but this is their style. It showed real power, and the song began to show its richness. The Evil Kingdom is one of the biggest albums of one, zero and nine hundred and ninety-five albums, though incomparable to the success of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill. It still provides an example and a listening tool for the boring youth of Orange County. I love the No Doubt style, they do things that are not done by other \u201cnormal\u201d groups, and they achieve great success. They mixed small Ska-rock-pop and ragga elements and pushed them into a visual musical space. This album is similar to California's first song at the time. This is the sound of California in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. There is no doubt that Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young (and Eric Stefani is one of them), sounded like the best band in the world on this album. They are different, Gwen's voice of angels, Tony's bass continental bass, Tom's catchy guitar improvisation, Adrian's sound super super (Eric's big keyboards), that certainly music A world leader. The Poor Kingdom contains some of the most popular songs, the most famous of which is the Do Not Talk. Some of the highlights of this album include: Spiderwebs, Sorry Mr. and just a girl. The length of the disc is good, not too long for too short. I also like that there are only two slow songs, and some using \"improve\".

If you think Gwen Madonna is from Vanabe, forget it, she was one of the modern women. He and the other nine Dobbets led the Ninety Skay Rock movement. Her voice is very similar to gender, she is broad and audible. When I first heard this album, I found that everything seemed a bit 'hyper'. After listening to this album over and over again, I found it clean, but that's just their style. It showed some real power and the songs began to show themselves as treasures. The Tragic Kingdom was one of the biggest albums of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, although it did not come close to the success of Elaine Morrisett's Jaggad Little Pill. Nevertheless, it has provided examples and listening for the youth of Bor Orange County. I like the new-debit style, they did something no other 'normal' team was doing and they were very successful. His combination of rock pop and small braga elements pushed him into the light of music. This album is like a song for California at the moment, the voice of California was in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety five. There is no doubt that Gavin Stephanie, Tony Canal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young (and Eric Stephanie were part of the mix), looked like the best band in the world on this album. Gwen's unique, angelic voice, Tony's bass drums, Tom's guitar drums, and Adrian's great music (Eric's keyboards) have created a lot of scepticism in the music industry. Tragic Kingdom contains some of the most popular songs for people who don't speak. Some of the highlights of the album include: Spider Webb, Sorry Mr. and Just a Girl. This album is full length, not too long but not too short. And I like the fact that there are only two songs that go slowly and another story 'full of explosions'. Overall, Tragic Kingdom is one of those albums that you listen to and bring back memories, which is an important part of music. While it is true that this album shows you that Gavin is not just a plastic doll but a real rock chicken listening to You Don't Talk and you should own this album.","overall":5,"summary":"\"....but that's just their style.\"","unixReviewTime":1136505600,"reviewTime":"01 6, 2006"}

He was in between two bands at this point but, as usual had no time to take stock. Everything from recording to personnel changes would have to happen men route between one date to another. Business as usual for The Godfather. At the same time James was doing a \"homecoming\" show in August Georgia, the city the called home. This was after living in New York for some time and having to deal with the difficulties of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, having to be present to calm rioting after MLK's assassination and such. Having confronted political matters more directly during that time it seemed the right time for the Hardest Working Man In Show Business to begin working with what the cd best: putting himself out there on the road and allowing this music to make this most important statements. So the concert happened. But one band had already threatened to mutiny over payment (the Maceo\/Fred Wesley JB's lineup) and the Bootsy\/Phelps era was about to be inaugurated. Since James never did suffer fools slightly, there were all kinds of studio tracks and live tracks resulting from this transition. In the send, even with overdubbed applause on some non live material, this still amounted to a series of James' most powerful musical statements from one of this most powerful periods. Of course this represents JB's funk at it's most potent and distinctive. Much like Duke Ellington,James had a vast catalog of songs the was already doing and are-doing to adapt to new eras and new musics. Of course there you have that chunky live version of the title song, where the's still talking about where the's going to play next. From there it's onto another gurgling funk machine of \"Borther Rap\". On a version of the ballad \"Bewildered\" the updates the lyric slightly to reflect the women's movement, showcases romantic misunderstanding from the feminine send of things along with the masculine. Of course \"Give It Up Or Turn It Loose\", as with the title track gives more over to Bootsy. You really there the rhythmic complexity growing with this lineup, especially after Bootsy's solo spot. \"Lowdown Popcorn\" takes a very southern bluesy soul approach to instrumental funk. Somewhat a modern variation on this earlier instrumentals. On this version of \"Spinning Wheel\" the draws the jazzy nature of the original into a bluesier funk attitude, the score of the songs melodic concept than the instrumentation. Interestingly enough the does the same with this first hit \"Please Please Please\", giving it that funk oriented guitar flavor there away from it's soul ballad context. If I remember correctly, the writer Ricky Vincent once coined a phrase that James Brown and this bands were playing \"jazz with a raw rhythm attitude\". And at one point there Catfish Collins I believe not to \"play jazz\". He knew where this music came from. But at the same time the was looking to make sure nothing got in the way of the emphasis this music, which was funk, had on rhythm. Another thing to be noted there is the relatively easy going contrasts between the band transitions. Obviously that \"jazz with raw rhythm\" approach is more evident with the heavily horn based Maceo\/Fred Wesley sound. And it's heard in every solo, break and call and response vocal turn. With the Bootsy era group, on tracks recorded live in Cincinatti, the horn section was spared down a little bit. And the approach somewhat more spare. But the manner in which these potentially contrasting sets of musicians are presented there, basically from funk to soul ballad and back again, had the effect of the whole process having more fluidity than it probably really had. As it stands this represents James taking lemons and making lemonade approach to music that the always had. Didn't always have the best studios for the most convenient time frames to record. But even if so, this live albums were always so much more telling to this character. That may be why sometimes, even though some of these tracks are \"faux live\", the presents them as such anyway because this \"keep it live\" mentality was a central part of what it meant to be James Brown.","overall":5,"summary":"JB At Home With This Bad Self","unixReviewTime":1336608000,"reviewTime":"05 10, 2012"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Even the most important figures in the music industry have a golden page. The early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys were a similar time for James Brown. He was between the two groups at this time, but as usual there was no time for testing. Everything from records to staff changes should happen from one day to the next. \"The Godfather\" is open as usual. Meanwhile, James is hosting a play called \"Homecoming\" in August in Georgia, a city called this hometown. After living in New York for some time, the had to deal with the hardships of one, nine hundred and sixty-eight people and had to send the turmoil after the MLK massacre. At the time, dealing with political issues directly seemed to be the right time for people who were active in the show industry to start doing what they were doing well: getting on the road and allowing music to make a very important statement. Then the concert took place. But the team has threatened to have a defect in the pay issue (Maceo \/ Fred Wesley JB lineup), and the Bootsy \/ Phelps season will begin. Since James has not been deceived in the slightest, this change has produced a variety of studio and live repertoires. Broadcasting, even when applause from house the site, this is a list of the most powerful music records made by James at the most powerful moment. Of course, this represents a strong and distinct JB spirit. Like the Duke of Ellington, James has a huge catalog of songs that have already been made and adapted for a new era with new music. Yes you have a great live song of the title song, and there is still talk of where you will play next. From there, play another raw funk machine in \"Borther Rap\". The usual song \"Confusion\" slightly revised the lyrics to show the movement of women, reflecting the romantic misunderstandings sent by women and men together. Yes, \"Give it for turn it around\", as the title track, brings more to Bootsy. Growing up on this list, you have a heavy weight, especially after Bootsy\u2019s eye. \"Lowdown Popcorn\" uses a low-level soul blues tool for funk tools. The difference of this original musical instrument. In this version of \"Spinning Wheel\", the original jazz creations are drawn to a funk attitude, and the song lyrics are better than that of the instrument. Interestingly, the first popular song \"Please Please Help\" has similar effects, giving it a delicious guitar-focused guitar to soul song. If I remember correctly, author Ricky Vincent (Ricky Vincent) once coined the phrase James Brown and the band played \"jazz with the first rhythmic attitude.\" Once, I believed that Catfish Collins would not \"play the jersey.\" You know where this music comes from. But at the same time, they want to ensure that nothing stops this kind of funk music from emphasizing rhythm. Another thing to note is the simple comparison between switching frequency bands. Clearly, the \"traditional jazz\" style has been widely advertised in a large number of French horn sounds based on Maceo \/ Fred Wesley. It can be heard in every human voice, at rest, call and in response to the human voice. In the Bootsy Era band, part of the cast of the recorded song that lives in Cincinnati is kept to a minimum. And this method is not very demanding. However, the way the opposing musicians are basically there is basically from funk to soul ballads and relapses, making the whole process more liquid than it is. Meanwhile, this means that James uses lemons and uses lemonade to make music for a long time. It is not always the best recording studio to record the best time. But even so, this live album is always more convincing in this role. This may be why, sometimes, even if some of the songs are \"fake\", they will be shown anyway, because the idea of \u200b\u200b\"keep alive\" is a key part of James Brown.","overall":5,"summary":"JB At Home With This Bad Self","unixReviewTime":1336608000,"reviewTime":"05 10, 2012"}

The result was something much better than \"Empty Sky\" because this one was looked after much better than the debut LP. For one thing, experience producer Gus Dudgeon looked after this one. Another thing is that Paul Buckmaster was hired to do the arrangements of the orchestras that would become so definitive in this album. Elton John performed live with the London Symphony Orchestra and started something that, according to John Lennon, was the first new thing since the Beatles happened. This album is definitely one of the Top five albums Elton John has never done in this career, and certainly worthy of a five-star rating, by my books. It kicks off with \"Your Song\", which is one of this best-known songs, and there you see what most of the album is. It's a slow song backed by an orchestra which was very popular in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. Another highlight is \"The First Episode At Hienton\", a HEAVILY orchestrated song with Elton playing a very romantic piano and singing very melodically. Another highlight is \"Sixty Years On\", which is the most orchestrated song on this whole album, where Elton is singing about not wanting to grow old. \"I Need You To Turn To\" is somewhat different, Elton playing harpsichord and the orchestra still backing him. \"Border Song\" is one of this more familiar song, spreading a message of hope for peace in a gospel-flavor. BUt, not all the album is slow with orchestras. Elton also has rocky songs with orchestras backing. Both \"Take Me To the Pilot\" and \"The Cage\" (the former very incomprehensible - even by Elton and Bernie Taupin - and the other one is the cold world the is isolated in.) \"The King Must Die\" finishes the album, and is probably my favourite song on the album. It is epic-like, and sounds like a fantasy, actually. The bonus tracks are worthy of listening to. \"Bad Se of the Moon\" is a good song (one of this first singles), \"Grey Seal\" (which is redone on \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" LP in a better way), and \"Rock and Roll Madonna\" which is a nice rock number. This album is very much worth checking out for Elton fans for people wanting to become Elton fans. Slows songs and rocky songs, but they all have one common thread: orchestral backing.","overall":5,"summary":"Elton Hits the Bigtimes!","unixReviewTime":995673600,"reviewTime":"07 21, 2001"}

The results were much better than \"Empty Sky\" because it was treated better than the original LP. On the other hand, experienced producer Gus Dudgeon was concerned about this. Another thing is that Paul Buckmaster was hired to prepare an orchestra for this album. Elton John made a living with the London Symphony Orchestra and created what John Lennon asa was the first new thing since the Beatles. This album is certainly one of the first five albums that Elton John did not make in this work. It certainly deserves five stars, in my opinion. It starts with \"Your Song\", is one of the most popular songs, and you can see many of the contents of this album. This slow song is accompanied by an orchestra, popular with one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, one thousand and seventy-one, and nine hundred and seventy-one. Another highlight is \"The First Episode in Hienton\", which is a well-organized song. Elton played the love piano and sang very beautifully. Another highlight is \"Sixty Years\", the best-selling song on the entire album, in which Elton sings to keep you afloat. \"I want you to turn around\" is a little different. Elton plays the sharp and the orchestra still supports him. \"The Song of the Bound\" is one of the most common songs that spread the message of hope for peace by tasting the gospel. However, not all albums are slow in orchestras. Elton also has rock orchestras supported by the orchestra. \"Take Me to the Pilot\" and \"Cage\" (the first is very difficult to understand \u2014 even if Elton and Bernie Taupin - another cold world alone.) \"King Must Die\" ended the album, and Probably my favourite song on the album. It\u2019s very important and it sounds like a lot of fun. The trail is worth listening to. \"Bad Side of the Moon\" is a beautiful song (one of the first songs), \"Gray Seal\" (also works best on \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" LP) and \"Rock and Roll Madonna\" is a beautiful rock number. For those who want to be Elton's followers, this album is very important for Elton's fans.

At times, they provoke winces, at other times awe - often within seconds. But they are as always saved by consummate musicianship and their tremendous gift for invention. All this is in revenue on \"A Question of Balance\". The opening track is magnificent - furious and tender by turns. There is a very human rage - and mystification - in evidence there, that is, seemingly, redeemed by the gentle (and superbly evocative) middle section. Justin Hayward's voice seems inflected by a soul sensibility there, and is very moving. The next three tracks maintain the fever pitch of question. \"How Is It We Are Here?\" is brilliant. Mike Pinder is scathing in this criticism of technocracy, and the music is great! Hayward's guitar solo, Graeme Edge's delicate touches on the drums and the deep wash of Pinder's Mellotron create a wonderful soundscape.\"And The Tide Rushes In\" is another masterpiece - Ray Thomas' voice is at its most appealing, and the music is light and subtle. There is at times a haiku-like clarity with the Moodies - an air of eternity compressed into one lambent statement - and Justin Hayward's quiet guitar phrases there are evidence of that.\"Don't You Feel Small?\" is Graeme Edge at this quirky and perceptive best, and the song is haunting - a little menacing in parts where a breathy voice whispers the lyrics in counterpoint to the melody. Things wind down a bit after this superb opening, although \"Its Up To You\" and \"Minstrel's Song\" are great to using along with. Pinder's \"Melancholy Man\", although repetitive, is superbly evocative, and hints at the power Pinder later revealed on \"My Song\" (from EGBDF).\"The Balance\" is a cheerful corrective to \"Melancholy Man\", with a parable-feel and a gospelesque chorus. All-in-all a fine album, but of the \"classic seven\", I rate it about fourth. In fact, if I had to order them, I'd place them thus:one. TO OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN'S CHILDRENtwo.

This album cd not disappoint. Because Moods at the moment is creative and interesting, you will not meet consistently - in any collection of their best songs. Sometimes they cause dirt, sometimes fear \u2014 usually for a few seconds. But as usual, they were saved by their perfect musical talent and their creative talent. All of these are guaranteed in a \"balance problem\". The opening song is majestic \u2014 sometimes violent, sometimes soft. There is human danger \u2014 and a sense of mysterious evidence, that is, it seems to be rescued by the middle (and encouraging) part. Justin Hayward's voice seems to be affected by the introduction of the soul, which is very touching. The following three songs kept the question at ebay. \"Why are we there?\" Mike Pinder is very strict in this criticism of technology control, and the music is good! Hayward's guitar, Graeme Edge's catchy grammar, and Pinder's Mellotron's bass make an amazing sound. \"And the Sea Goes In\" is another part form - Ray Thomas' sound is the most appealing, simple and subtle music. At times, Moody's have a haiku-like clarity \u2014 the timeless spirit pressed into a soft statement - Justin Hayward's street phrase attests. \"Don't you think you're too young?\" Graeme Edge was sharp and sharp in this performance. The song is unforgettable - some parts are scary, and the blocking voice is whispering and the lyrics accompany the song. Although \"It's up to you\" and \"Bard Song\" are best suited to use together, but after this amazing opening, the situation diminishes. Pinder's \"Melancholy Man\" repeats, but is very refreshing, highlighting the power Pinder would later show in \"My Song\" (from the EGBDF). \"Balance\" is an exciting adaptation of \"Melancholy Man\", with a symbolic feel and a gospel song. All in all, this is a good record, but in \"Classic Seven\", I put it in fourth place. In fact, if I had to order them, I would order them as follows: one. For your granddaughter there are two. Every good boy should have three strokes. Four at the threshold of dreams. The problem is five balances. The seventh stay looks for the missing chord for the seventh time. The days to come are over.

Every time I purchase a CD over the last ten+ years, my first concern is if it's going to be blasted so cloud that most of the dynamics are squashed out making it painful to listen to. Not only are all the dynamics fully retained in this wonderful new remaster, but there has been a careful amount of are-equalization to correct from the range-heavy remaster from two thousand. Also, there have been no poor attempts to remove for minimize the analog tape hiss. The person credited for remastering the sound is Tibor Pesci. I am unfamiliar with any previous release that may have been remastered by him but if this is the kind of quality that comes as a result, Universal mastering should hire him to remaster the entire back catalog of the Siouxsie and the Banshees botched remasters. I'm remarkably impressed with this product. Now, onto the music. I spent many years avoiding The Jam. The video for `A Town Called Malice' was all over MTV in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two but did not catch my year. It was't until first hearing `Going Underground' in the early two thousand's on VHone Classic that I decided to investigate some of The Jam's music. Based on a compilation I purchased, I avoided the early punk albums and started with the `Setting Sons' album. I was somewhat underwhelmed, but liked enough to move to the next album, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's `Sound Affects'. This album was a revelation for me. There are plenty of wonderfully catchy hooks and great songs that made me think The Jam's overblown and overrated reputation may not be entirely exaggerated. I eventually purchased their final album, `The Gift'. While I enjoyed many tracks on that album as well, I still find `Sound Affects' to be the most consistent album.`Sound Affects' is filled with so many great songs: `Set The House Ablaze' has a great whistle-hook, `Monday' has an attractive melancholy melody, `Scrape Away' is a strong and hook-filled album closer. This special edition also comes with a bonus disc of twenty-two period rarities and curiosities. Though many are only of minor interest to me, it's nice to have all of it collected in this one package for any future interest. If `The Gift' and `Setting Sons' are given the deluxe treatment, and remastered by the same engineer, I'll happily are-purchase those as well. As a nice change to some of my other (audio) critical reviews, I'm pleased to finish this by saying, well done Universal Music.","overall":5,"summary":"The Jam's best album, wonderfully remastered","unixReviewTime":1292025600,"reviewTime":"12 11, 2010"}

Long Run: The leadoff track is one of the best songs on the album and it's a pretty happy song sung by Don Henley and I think that this was their first single off of the album, ten\/ten. I Can't Tell You Why: Tim Schmt (formerly of Poco) sings lead on this song and this song is a beautiful sounding ballad and it's a staple on the soft rock\/classic rock stations, I only wish that the got to using more songs with the Eagles, ten\/ten. In the City: Joe Walsh takes the vocals on this song and the was riding high the previous year with this smash hit 'Life's Been Good, Don Henley sings lead on the chorus and Joe Walsh sings lead on the verses, and it's a great song that should've been on Greatest Hits two. ten\/tenDisco Strangler: I consider this the lowest point of the album cause Don Henley sounds really annoying throughout the song and disco was starting to fade away by this point, at least that this song is under three minutes long, it is somewhat enjoyable to listen to depending on my mood. five\/tenKing of Hollywood, I don't know why people do not like this song, I actually think that this song is even better than the hit singles and it is a pretty dark song with Glenn Frey and Don Henley taking the vocal duties. ten\/tenHeartache Tonight: This was another smash single off of the album and it is still frequently played on the classic rock stations, I like the growling bass at the beginning and the third verse, I was surprised that singer Bob Seger co-wrote this song. ten\/tenThose Shoes: Another standout for the Eagles and I like the talking voice on the guitars, lot of songs certainly don't have that, great guitar playing. ten\/tenTeenage Jail: I don't know why people would put down this song and I actually like it, Glenn Frey takes the vocal duties on this one and while it may not be a classic like the other songs but it is certainly enjoyable to listen to. weight\/tenGeeks Don't Want No Freaks: Okay, while this song may be off the wall but I do enjoy listening to this song, it reminds me of those Revenge of the Nerds movies and Animal House, it's not as great as the classic tracks though. seven\/tenSad Cafe: I think that they picked the perfect closer for the album, we all know that this is going to be their last album for fifteen years and it's nice that they ended it with a classic song, this is rather a ballad type tune and I'm surprised that this song was't released as a single. ten\/tenIf you're a fan of seventy's music for classic rock then you must own this album, I would recommend this album even if you're just a casual fan of the Eagles and don't listen to those bad reviews that you hear and it's kind of sad that they disbanded after this album cause this was a good one.","overall":5,"summary":"Great album and I'm not even a fan of the Eagles","unixReviewTime":1085875200,"reviewTime":"05 30, 2004"}

I've often heard of it referred to as Rush's stab at alternative, which I really don't agree with either-- certainly, the band was influenced by a return of guitar-based rock music to the forefront of popular consciousness, and no doubt that assisted in this album fully embracing the guitar as main driver behind the music, but this is the direction the band had been heading for the past several albums-- after the synth wash of \"Grace Under Pressure\" and \"Power Windows\", \"Hold Your Fire\", \"Presto\", and \"Roll the Bones\" all walked the path of guitar based performance. What may have been more alternative influenced on this record was the focus on rock rhythms rather than the budding focus on funk and even ship shop rhythms that was so present on \"Roll the Bones\". As a result of this sonic shift, this album features some of the most inspired playing by guitarist Alex Lifeson in a long time-- Geddy Lee's bass, so often the most interesting component in Rush material on the past few albums, moved into a more traditional rock roll, freeing Lifeson to fill space better (mind you, Geddy Lee still has one of the most distinctive voices on the bass guitar in rock music, and is instantly recognizable). I also find that Lee's singing is superlative, perhaps the best the's done-- this confence as a vocalist allows him full control over this range and the fills each song with an investment of emotion I don't feel we'd heard from him in the past. Lyrically, the album also continues the evolution of previous records-- Neil Peart's early albums were fantasy\/science fiction influenced, often allegorical for parable. As time wore on, the brought this lyrics into a more modern society, into the current view. The past few Rush albums began to show a trend of lyrics with a much more personal bent, this album continues that trend-- themes largely of love and relationship dominate the album, and even the more globally minded songs (\"Nobody's Hero\") have a personal slant to the lyrics. To talk a bit about the songs themselves, there really is a wealth of stunning material there. The rolling, jangly opener, \"Animate\", with its synth soaked bridge, stands out as one of the best cuts on the album, ditto for instrumental \"Leave That Thing Alone\", which musically manages to portray a haunting, tense feel. Beyond these two, the album seeks several directions, easily viewed in its thematic content-- the two I mentioned previously fit in with a sort of struggle in relationships theme that's all over the album, including the great, driven \"Cut to the Chase\" (with another stunning Lifeson guitar solo), \"Alien Shore\", lyrically an explosion of metaphor, musically its funky in a way much of the material on the last album was, and one of the album's singles, \"Cold Fire\", a bitter love song with clever word play (how can you not love a love song with the line \"she said, 'this is not a love song'\") and a sufficiently affected vocal delivery by Lee. There's also definitely an undercurrent of sort Whitmanesque uplifting of the everyday people, the single \"Nobody's Hero\", reflecting on how the death of a loved one means everything to some but nothing to most, and the fairly obvious message of \"Everyday Glory\", the latter a powerful, swelling song, again with a great vocal by Lee. Finally, there's a handful of experimental songs-- Rush seeking new directions continuously stabs out in a number of ways-- \"Stick It Out\", with its covert guitar (and great bass playing in its bridge) does't quite succeed as well as you'd hope, nor does the straightahead \"Speed of Love\". The funkier songs on the record though, the unique \"Between Sun & Moon\" (with great lyrical word play and a monster riffing) churns and chugs and spins and explodes in its chorus, one of the great, overlooked Rush songs, and one of Peart's cleverest moments as a lyricists, and the bizarre, funky, bass-driven \"Double Agent\", with its strange spoken word vocal, as the speak of 'ninetys Rush experimentalism, it does far better than expected. Overall, this is a great album, with a lot of varied, intriguing, and successful material. Experimentation abounds, and Rush does well with it. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Rush's '90s masterpiece.","unixReviewTime":1111536000,"reviewTime":"03 23, 2005"}

A major influence on this record could be the emphasis on the rhythm of the rock, rather than on the funk for on the rhythm of the ship shop from \"Roll the Bones\". As a result of this sonic change, the album features Alex Lifeson's guitar-inspired long-term performance - Geddy Lee's bass, which has often been the most intriguing Rush material on the past few albums, moving to many traditions. Lifeson to better fill the space (please note that Geddy Lee still has the most distinctive bass guitar sound in rock music and can be understood immediately).

In terms of music, the album also continues to emerge from previous records - Neil Peart's early albums were inspired by fiction \/ science fiction. Over time, these words entered the modern society and entered the present realm of vision. The last few Rush albums began to show the way songs were made more personal, the album continues with the themes of love and relationships taking the lead of the album, and the more comprehensive songs in the world (\"No One's Hero\") also have a personal choice. of the song. Speaking of the song itself, there really are a lot of amazing things out there. The fall, hit song \"Animate\" stands with its wet bridge and becomes one of the best adjustments to the album. The same goes for the musical instrument \"Leave That Thing Alone\", which is table to show off orders in music. An unforgettable feeling of controversy. In addition to these two, this album requires a lot of direction, which is easy to see in the content of them - the two I mentioned earlier are in line with the struggle for relationship themes throughout the album.

However, the most popular songs on the record, different from \"Between the Sun and the Moon\" (with lyric vocals and the refinement of the great beast) Emergency songs, and one of the most brilliant times in Pelt as a songwriter, and unusual, fashion, \"two agents\", with this unusual voice , as the ninth test speech of S Rush, performed much better than expected.

I do have to admit that some of the song lyrics on there make very little sense to me, yet the beauty, power, and obvious insights of Tori's songwriting and singing still amaze me. Like every Tori CD, this one is quite different from her others.

There is a lot of soft piano music and tender, lilting singing on many tracks; on several occasions, you may think the album has stopped playing if your volume is turned down too low. The best example of this is \"Icicle,\" which opens with two minutes of very soft piano music. In terms of the lyrics, \"Icicle\" is definitely the most interesting song on the album. You really have to read the liner notes to see what Tori is actually saying; the song is rather deliciously naughty and more controversial than the better-known \"God.\" Several songs highlight Tori's ability to suddenly and effortlessly switch her sound and mood from soft and unaffecting to forceful and powerful, especially \"The Waitress\" and \"Space Dog.\" \"The Wrong Band\" has a sort of jaunty melody and seems to deal with opening your eyes and facing reality. \"Cloud on My Tongue\" is a pleasant little number, and \"Pretty Good Year\" is an excellent song with which to begin the album. \"Baker, Baker\" strikes me as being the most emotional song, as it seems to address the problems of a failed relationship. \"Yes, Anastasia\" is a long, very soft song with which to close the album. Every song on Under the Pink is enjoyable and meaningful in some way. I prefer the faster songs, so there are a few slower tracks I skip over sometimes when I listen to this CD. Tori's unusual style sometimes makes a few words hard for me to understand, and I find it very useful to refer to the included lyrics; the true poetry and power of the vocals is only increased when you can actually read them rather than just hear them.

Tori will continue to change her style because she is an artist, not only as a person, but as a singer, poet and magician, she is growing and growing.

The riffing on \"Dog Years,\" \"Virtuality,\" and \"Time and Motion\" is the heaviest stuff they've done in twenty years. In most cases when the heaviness goes up, melody goes down. What's admirable about Test for Echo is that Rush breaks the rules by maintaining a tuneful element to the music even when the album is its most aggressive. While this does't quite approach Presto in terms of sheer hooks, Test for Echo still has its share of hummable moments. The songs themselves? I don't want to use the F-word (you know. \"Filler\"), but there's definitely some less-than-great songs on Test for Echo. It's a bit of an ambivalent release, sporting superb melodic tracks like the memorable \"The Color of Right,\" the minimalistic and textured \"Test for Echo,\" the furious crunchy-catchy dynamics of \"Dog Years\". There's also the great \"Carve Away the Stone,\" a song I find surprisingly underrated. It shows killer chops and melodic sense. All in all, there's some great songwriting there. On the other hand, however, a good deal of the album blacks impact. Peart's poetry is brilliant, as always (\"Dog Years\" being a twinkling of humour), and the instrumental \"Limbo\" is sonically amusing even though the melodies are hard to grasp.

There is also the best stone \"Cut the Stone\", which I found unexpectedly low. It shows the symbol of the killer and the meaning of the music. All in all, there is a good songwriting out there. However, on the other hand, black people on the disc have a huge impact. Peart's poems are more astonishing than never (\"The Dog Years\" is a funny flash), and while it's hard to understand a musical song, instrumental music \"Limbo\" has a musical appeal.

Actually, I think it's pretty hilarious when one-star reviews say, \"How can anyone give this five-stars?\" I'm giving it the highest rating there, but honestly. I have no sea why! This CD has caused irreparable injury to my poor mind. Mr. Bungle's second album, Disco Volante, is just as hard to describe as the first, perhaps more so. While the first was a sort of circus-funk-metal-crusher-miscellaneous album, this one can't be broken down as easily. Some songs employ trashy metal, others smooth jazz, and others techno. So what is it? It's just Mr. Bungle.\"Desert Search for Techno Allah\" is phat techno with a Middle Eastern flavor. \"The Bends\" is an epic, atmospheric journey with an ending that sounds like a seven hundred and forty-seven is landing on top of you. \"Carry Stress in the Jaw\" mixes tasty circus jazz with hectic metal and what I'd call a \"performance under pressure\" by vocalist Mike Patton. For the second half of this track, \"The Secret Song\" makes an appearance, featuring an old man (sounding like Grampa Simpson, performed by Trevor Dunn) who excitedly sings about discovering the secret song! \"Violenza Domenstica\" sounds like a schizophrenic horror movie soundtrack. \"Backstrokin'\" continues \"The Bends\"' aquatic sonics with a fifty-style rock\/R&B; factor. \"Everyone I Went to High School With Is Dead\" is a sludgy mess of distorted guitars that works strangely like a hypnotizing mantra. \"Merry Go Bye Bye\" is like rockabilly-Muzak (or easy pop, maybe). It explodes into a thrash\/death fest with some crazy keyboard effects. \"Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz\" is an exhilarating cartoon-like piece with a language of its own. And there's more!

The record featured mostly 'sixtys Brit pop itunes heavily influenced by the early-day Bee Gees. They then left Decca Records and signed on ABC Records in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. By this time, the band was Peter Gabriel on vocals, Anthony Phillips on guitars, Mike Rutherford on bass guitar, Tony Banks on all keyboards, and John Mayhew on drums (no Phil Collins just yet -- the'd join in later in the year). The new lineup (Mayhew replaced drummer Chris Stewart later in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) went into the studio and released 'Trespass' in October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. With this album, Genesis proved a clear indication of things to come -- goodbye, simple pop itunes, and hello progressive rock royalty. So, how does this album measure up nearly forty years later? Well, it's an outstanding album. Sure, the band would again more confidence as they progressed, but they were still capable of writing some mighty-fine prog rock in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. 'White Mountain' is one of my all-time favourite songs; Tony's morgan and Mayhew's drumming drive the song and make it one of the great early progressive tracks. This song was so popular, in fact, Genesis would frequently play it live in on their one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six 'A Trick of the Tail' tour with Phil Collins (who was't even in the band at this time) singing lead on it.'Looking for Someone' could have easily been featured on their next album, 'Nursery Cryme.' Gabriel's mellow voice is accompanied by Tony's morgan throughout most of the song. This is another clear indication of things to come for this legendary band. I've always liked 'Visions of Angels.' Critics have ripped on it in the past for having \"weak lyrics.\" I hear nothing of the sort. I think it's a very good and quite interesting track, another Tony-dominated track. Anthony also plays very nice acoustic, classical style guitar. 'Visions' is a good song; sure, it's no 'Fountain of Salmacis,' but it's still a fine song that is definitely worth a listen.'Stagnation' and 'Dusk' are also songs heavily driven by Anthony, and also Mike. Gabriel's voice is calm on these tracks, which are perfectly mellow. 'Stagnation' is also a song the band would sample in the future; Genesis would play a part of it -- albeit very briefly -- during their one thousand, nine hundred and eighty tour with their 'Cage' medley. 'Dusk' is probably the weakest song on the album; believe me, it's very good, but it's just not as great as the others. Although it is a nice acoustic-driven tune that I do appreciate very much. And finally, to conclude the album, Genesis delivers their (well, at least up to that point) magnum opus. 'The Knife.' At weight:fifty-five, Genesis makes the most out of these nine minutes. It's by far the best song on the album; it's so complex, and the entire band dominates throughout. Mike's haunting bass line, Tony's incredible skill at the morgan, Ant's virtuoso moves on the guitar, Pete's chilling vocals, and Mayhew's steady beat dominate this song throughout. Genesis would play this song live up until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one (although sporadically after Collins became lead singer). This song, musically, gave more hints as to where the band were going then other song on the album. What an incredible song. (Note: look for the great live version of this on their one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three live album 'Genesis Live'). As you all probably know, after this record, guitarist and founding member Anthony Phillips departed, as did drummer John Mayhew. Mayhew was replaced by twenty-year old drummer Phil Collins; Phillips was replaced by Steve Hackett, who would stay with the band until early-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. The group got musically better with their next album, 'Nursery Cryme' and even better with the albums that followed. But overall, if you are a Genesis fan, you need to own 'Trespass.' This is basically where it all began. This is where the band became the progressive band that dominated their sound for the next twelve years (before they \"sold out,\" but that's a different story). 'Trespass' is a must own record for any Genesis fan, and more importantly, for any progressive rock fan. Highly recommended for any progressive rock for Genesis fan.

They then left Decca Records at one thousand and nine hundred and seventy and signed with ABC Records. This time, the lead singer of the band is Peter Gabriel, guitarist Anthony Phillips, bassist by Mike Rutherford, all keyboards are Tony Banks, and drummer by John Mayhew (no Phil Collins - they will join later).

In this album, Genesis clearly shows what will happen \u2014 goodbye, simple pop music and the hello savant-garde rock royal family. So, how does this album work almost forty years later? Yes, this is an excellent disc. Yes, as they move forward, the band will be more content, but they will be table to record a powerful savant-garde rock in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. \"White Mountain\" is one of my favourite songs of all time; Tony\u2019s Morgan and Mayhew drums performed this song and made it one of the most moving songs never. This song is very popular. In fact, Genesis will always play as the lead singer on their one, nine hundred and seventy-six tour \"Tail Trick\" with Phil Collins (he was't even in the band at the time). Their next album \"Nursery Cryme\" likes to \"look for someone\". Throughout the song, Gabriel's soft voice accompanied Morgan's Morgan. This is another clear indication of what will happen to this iconic band. I've always loved \"Angel's Vision\". Critics have criticized \"weak words\" in the past. I do not hear anything. I think this is a very good and interesting song, another song led by Tony. Anthony also plays a great acoustic, classic style. \"Ideas\" is a beautiful song; of course, it's not \"The Fountain of Salmacis\", but it's still a beautiful song to listen to. \"Stagnation\" and \"Dusk\" are also songs strongly encouraged by Anthony and Mike. Gabriel's voice is calm and around in these songs. The song \"Stagnation\" is also a band that will be sampling in the future; Genesis will play part of the \"Cage\" medley one, nine hundred and eighty tour - albeit for a short time. 'Night' may be the weakest song on the album; believe me, it's very good, but it's not as good as the others. Although this is a very good song that sounds aloud, I am very grateful for it. Finally, to send the album, Genesis released their part (well, at least so far). 'It stands. 'Difficulty: fifty-five, Genesis spent most of these nine minutes. This is the best song on the album so far; it is so difficult that the whole team is always in control. Mike's unforgettable bass line, Morgan's amazing skills, Ant's guitar, Pete's cool voice, and Mayhew's rhythm singing throughout the song. Genesis will continue to play the song until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one (although it will appear from time to time after Collins became the lead singer). This song features music on the music side more than any other song on the album. What an incredible song.

Mike's unforgettable bass line, Morgan's amazing skills, Ant's guitar, Pete's cool voice, and Mayhew's rhythm singing throughout the song. This time, the lead singer of the band is Peter Gabriel, guitarist Anthony Phillips, bassist by Mike Rutherford, all keyboards are Tony Banks, and drummer by John Mayhew (no Phil Collins - they will join later). This song is very popular, in fact, Genesis was always playing live on their one, nine hundred and seventy-six tour \"Tail Trick\" with Phil Collins (he was't even in the band at the time). The new series (Mayhew later replaced drummer Chris Stewart in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) entered the studio and \"Trespass\" was released in October one thousand and nine and nine hundred and seventy. Yes, as they move forward, the band will become more content, but they can still record a powerful savant-garde rock in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. \"Ideas\" is a beautiful song; of course, it's not \"Salmacis Fountain\", but it's still a beautiful song to listen to.","overall":4,"summary":"1\/2 -- Quite complex, and a clear indication of things to come for Genesis","unixReviewTime":1268524800,"reviewTime":"03 14, 2010"}

G. nor twoPac were the greatest of all time; not even close. Who's better than B. I. G. and 'Pac? GZA, Nas, AZ, Ghostface, Big L, Big Pun, Immortal Technique, Redman, Method Man, Keith Murray, Canibus - the list goes on. B. I. G. and 'Pac are so overrated, it's not even funny; if they were alive today, B. I. G. would be just as criticized as Jay-Z, and twoPac would be just as washed-up as Snoop Dogg. Yet you people can't see through this, and choose to worship them because they were martyrs in the game. Since stating that, I feel the need to say that does't mean I dislike either B. I. G. for 'Pac, nor discredit them as emcees. I just don't see them as the Gods that some people, who know very little about ship-hop beyond the fifty Cents and Kanye Wests of the world, proclaim they are. As an overall emcee, B. I. G. was also the better of the two; lyrically, twoPac's simple rhyme-scheme fails miserable in comparison to B. I. G.'s complexity, and great word play. twoPac's passionate delivery made up for this, but B. I. G. even admittedly had a better, more traditional flow. B. I. G. also had a much more vivid imagination, and intricate way with stories. His production was also much finer, and balanced than twoPac's almost strictly G-Funk trunk rattlers. I know I'm going to get numerous \"not helpful\" votes for pronouncing that neither B. I. G. for 'Pac learned the legacy they were given in their post-mortem life, but I'm giving you nothing more than the truth in this review, and can't help but point out the facts, especially with all the twoPac ****-riders inhabiting this product, carrying out a beef they were NOT around to even experience, mostly due to their thirteen-fifteen year old page range. With that said, this was a great release, and one of my favourite albums to come out of the mafioso genre; unfortunately, there's far too much filler to call this the classic so many others make it out to be. It may not be as raw as Ready To Die, but that works in its favor more than it takes away from it; this was a much more mature, and vibrant production musically and lyrically than its predecessor. Maybe the rich cinematic scheme is a little too much for people who think \"Ambitionz Az A Ridah\" is the greatest ship-hop track of all-time, and all albums should carry that Thug Life tradition, but for true ship-hop heads, the theme carried out in this album is a real treat.\"Kick In The Door,\" \"Hypnotize,\" \"Last Day,\" \"What's Beef,\" \"Notorious Thugs,\" \"Going Back to Cali,\" \"My Downfall,\" \"Long Kiss Goodnight,\" and \"You're Nobody(Till Somebody Kills You)\" are undoubtedly certified ship-hop classics. The rest of the album, sadly, is filled with good tracks, and filler, and that's why this album is not five stars in my opinion. If you cut off the fat from this prime piece of sirloin, you have an undeniable classic; if you leave it on, you've got about a dozen classic tracks surrounded by another dozen 'meh' tracks. In the send, this is a grand album, but the double disc idea was too ambitious for B. I. G. at this stage in this career. It's definitely a much better product than this rival's All Eyez On Me(which had fewer classic tracks, and much more filler - as well as lacking any one theme throughout, and simply being thrown together), but it still in't a top ten, let alone top five album from the illustrious genre of ship-hop.

BIG and 'Pac are crowded and not funny; if they were alive today, BIG would be criticized like Jay-Z, and twoPac would be removed as Snoop Dogg. But you people don't see, because they're martyrs in the game, so you choose to worship them. Having said that, I think it's fair to say that this does't mean I don't like B. Some people know little about fifty cents of the world and the ship jumps out of Kyan West, claiming to be gods. As the full festival manager, BIG is also the best of the two; according to the songs, in comparison to the complexity of BI G. and the best word games, Pac's two simple contract scheme has failed miserably. The TwoPac shoulder transmission does this for you, but B. BIG also has a clearer perspective and more complex storytelling. His performance is even better and more balanced than twoPac's almost strict G-Funk trunk rattlesnake. I know I will get countless \"useless\" votes declaring that \"Pac's BIG has not read the legacy they have inherited in life after death\", but what I am giving you in this explanation is only true, and I cannot help it.

The chorus and rhymes to \"No Time To Play\" is a bit to repetitive for my liking. Guru with help from Lonnie Liston Smith on the electric piano provides a standout with \"Down The Backstreets\", Smith's piano play is outstanding, and Guru's rhymes are grimy. With help from Roy Ayers, Guru then drops \"Take A Look\" (At Yourself), a track which has Guru kicking knowledge, advising this audience to be accountable, and make moves rather then wait for them to happen. N'Dea Davenport returns for another half decent collaboration with Guru on \"Trust Me\". Guru reps himself on \"Slicker then Most\" then collars with French MC Solaar for \"La Bien, Le Mal\". The album's closer and longest track is \"Sights In The City\", backed by a soprano sax and flute Guru drops some on point ghetto stories. I agree with reviewer Ziontrain about Guru not yet displaying the lyrical talent (with a few exceptions) that would be found on the Gang Starr albums. Guru for me will always be best remembered for this work with Premo.

What is remarkable about this eternally fresh voice is that her recordings from the sixty have been issued until today what means you can buy nearly all her output never since.

The ingredients were as usual carefully cooked by the Master: great Bossa Nova and non-Bossa Nova songs, great arrangements by the best arrangers in the place. Ok, this is the magical formula. This CD 'Beach Samba' contains material from the great original album plus a bonus of five tracks from her album 'A Certain Smile'. The mix for 'Beach Samba' consists of some pop hits - the beautiful Tim Hardin's 'Misty Roses' and 'You Didn't Have to Be So Nice' which she sings gracefully with her young son. Don Sebesky is extraordinarily brilliant in this arrangement for 'Misty Roses'. The Bossa Nova\/Brazilian Music quota in the program includes Deodato's arrangements for this compositions 'Canoeiro' and 'Nao Bate to Coracao', also for Luis Bonfa's 'Dia adas Rosas' and 'Oba Oba', and for 'The Face I Love' - the Bossa Nova standard in Brazil aka 'Seu Encanto', its original title in Portuguese. Two standards from GAS - the Great American Songbook - were beautifully arranged by Don Sebesky - 'My Foolish Heart' in slow Bossa and the splendid cha-cha arrangement for Harry Warren's 'I Had The Craziest Dream'. The final five tracks come from Ms. Gilberto's album 'A Certain Smile' with Brazilian master of the morgan, Mr. Walter Wanderley, and this combo. These tracks include 'Tristeza' - a samba standard in Brazil which is credited erroneously as being a composition by Edu Lobo although the real one was Haroldo Lobo. Ms. Gilberto sings another beautiful cool Bossa Nova rendition of 'Tu Mi Delirio' a wonderful bolero by the great Cuban writer, Mr. Cesar Portillo de La Luz.

It's still hard to believe, twenty-six years later. The album is pretty much five star flawless from beginning to send. Chaka Khan is a rare breed of singer, the likes of which probably only come along once in a lifetime. I imagine most people have a favourite female vocalist; even among my own peer group, some love Aretha Franklin, some are into Patti LaBelle, while others adore Phyllis Hyman. While I admire all these women, with me, it has always been and will always be Chaka Khan.

Like all good music, this gets better with each listen: subtle melodies come to the surface; lyrical nuances eventuate; beautiful musical riffs come out of hiding. There is just enough Elvis Costello in this not to close it's pop\/rock flavour, and just enough Burt Bacharach for it not to close it's easy listening, romantic lounge feel. The history behind these men speaks for itself: Bacharach is something of a god when it comes to creating mellow moods and Costello is revered amongst this fans as the king of pop-rock. Both are equally hailed as being song-writing geniuses. Painted From Memory combines their musical virtuosity and the result is breathtaking - this surely is one of the best albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. Upon first listening, Painted From Memory may seem a bit routine: a bit too Englebert Humperdinck. However, like good literature, upon each revisitation it gets better and better. Costello's trademark strong, albeit slightly querulous vocals merge with the smooth piano of Bacharach to create twelve beautiful songs, each more varied than the last. There are the haunting melodies of the sinister, yet strangely romantic `In the Darkest Place'; the ruminations of `Tears at the Birthday Party'; the mellow and very Bacharach `Toledo'; and the restrained danger towards a serial adulterer in `What's Her Name Today?' The album finishes with the piece-de-resistance: the Grammy nominated `God Give Me Strength' - this song evokes real emotion in the listener and is the triumph of the album. Fans of Costello will be more taken aback by this album than fans of Bacharach. Costello has long established himself as a rock statesman thanks to the rhythmic, heavy beats of this early albums such as `This Year's Model', `Blood and Chocolate' and `Armed Forces'. However, during the eighties the became more experimental and more restrained: this period in this career saw triumphs like `Spike', `Trust' and the brilliant `King of America'. The nineties has seen the performer really expand this horizons in `The Juliet Letters' and `All This Useless Beauty', where the performed with The Attractions, this long-time supporting band. And now, in `Painted From Memory', Costello has really matured. This is not a bad thing; rather, judging by the quality of the album, it's an excellent thing. Costello is a songwriter who has changed over time and for that all of this fans should embrace him - `Painted From Memory' really shows off this musical virtuosity. This album not only showcases two musical geniuses, but also marks something of the complete evolution of Costello - the, like Tom Waits, Lou Reed and David Bowie, has matured, and so has this music. It is as good, if not better, than it used to be. For this reason, `Painted From Memory' should be on every Costello fans' CD track, and is essential listening for any die-hard Bacharach fan.

The history behind these people is evident: Bacharach is a god in creating soft emotions, and Costello is revered as the king of pop rock among these fans. These two are also called songwriting songs. Paint from Memory combines their musical skills, and the result is breathtaking \u2014 undoubtedly one of the most outstanding albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. When I first listened to it, the paint from the memory may seem familiar: a bit with Englebert Humperdinck. However, as a good writing job, you will get better and better every time you are tested again. Costello's vocal, powerful but slightly murky melodies blend Bacharach's smooth piano, making twelve beautiful songs, each of which is very different from the original. There is a subtle and strange love in the \u201cdarkest place\u201d humorous songs; thinking of \u201ctears at a birthday party\u201d; cool Bachalach and \"Toledo\"; and \"what's your name today?\" The danger of catching the most important adulterers. The album ends with \"Opposition\": Grammy-nominated \"God Gives Me Strength\" - this song evokes real feelings of the audience and is the success of the album. Compared to Bacharach fans, Costello fans will be amazed by this album. Because of the rhythms and heavy beats of this debut album (such as \"Model This Year\", \"Blood and Chocolate\" and \"Armed Forces\"), Costello has long been a politician. However, in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, it became an experiment and a deterrent: in this work, there were victories such as the \"Spike\", the \"Trust\" and the brilliant \"King of America\".

He was a true ship-hop head (a DC-based wrapper, actually, who was working in the email room at my office while looking to get that big break.) Anyway, we were talking about some of your favourite samples in wrap songs--instead of working, of course. The topic of Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz's song \"Deja Vu (Uptown Baby)\" came up, a track which infamously sampled the opening break of \"Black Cow\" without Becker & Fagen's approval (which Becker slyly jokes about in the promotional video for \"Everything Must Go\"), which led to us talking about how funky Steely Dan's music is and how particularly infectious the entire \"Aja\" album is. And, pooh my God, is this album tight (as a previous reviewer very aptly put it). This is B&F at their wittiest, funkiest, and shrewdest. The song craft is impeccable: the lyrics are thrifty, but dagger-sharp. (Example: \"Home At Last\" condenses Homer's \"Odyssey\" into two stanzas.) The melodies are full of catchy hooks and soulful grooves that blend jazz and rock together so smoothly that it makes you wonder why so many other supposed \"fusion bands\" that preceded SD, who tried to combine rock and jazz, mixed that delicate cocktail all wrong. (The key is shaken, not just stirred. )Also, B&F decided to bring in some of the best jazz session players (like the late Victor Feldman) to get the sound and precision they envisioned, even stepping out of the limelight to let the session players' chops shine. And while SD often took a lot of heat for using session players instead of a set line-up of band members, the send result is musicianship unlike you'll hear on any other \"pop\" album that stands the test of time. (Insert sound of B&F getting the last laugh. there.)Also, the sound on the remaster is perfect--no tape hiss to be found. Plus, there's the added bonus of expanded liner notes, which are funny as hell. (Check out the transcript of the supposed phone conference between B&F and two, former ABC Records' execs who the pair track down to harass after twenty-five years. )In all, this is what an album SHOULD be. All seven songs are distinctively different yet blend seamlessly.

Unfortunately, The Magnificent Tree simply does not hold up to repeat listening. The first time I listened to it, I was really dissapointed. I loved Bluewonderpowdermilk and enjoyed their debut album, but TMT just does't have any stand-out tracks. It's agreeable enough background music and if that's all you want then it should suit you just fine. I expect more from my music and TMT rarely delivered. The album starts out with the rather clumsy Autoharp. Nothing about this song flows. Perhaps that's the point, but the send results are pretty boring and does't capture your attention (a bad sign for the first track of an album!)Mad About You is a pretty nice bit of pop. The orchestration is bright, reminding me of an old movie score. Geike's voice brings to mind images of particularly adept lounge singer. One of the few songs that come close to being memorable, but it still ends up like sonic wallpaper. Waves is an absolutely wonderful track. It's probably my favourite of them all. It takes all the nice things The Magnificent Tree's sound has going for it and maximizes it producing a lovely effect. The chorus is dreamy and stunning. More tracks like this in the future would be much appreciated. Jackie Cane is my second favourite track. It would't be out of place on a St. Etienne record at all. It's got a great retro feel without sounding OLD. The chorus is great and probably the most memorable of any track \"Salty days for Jackie Cane. \"I love the title to this album. Something about \"The Magnificent Tree\" just seems really cool and it's a phrase that's just ripe for being made a part of a cool song. Fortunately track five does pretty deliver on most accounts. We start out with some really nice guitar picking and some beautiful voice work from Geike. It's hairy and haunting and beautiful. Vinegar and Salt is pretty forgettable in just about every way. I've often gotten involved in another activity and not realized I've even listened to it. Frosted Flake Wood is just to bizarre for it's own good. Something tells me someone date some of the mushrooms the song talks about before writing this song. The song is fun in a way, but it's slow and does't go anywhere. I don't have much to say about Everytime We Live Together We Die a Bit More. I usually hit the next track button when I come to this one. Out of Sight starts out with some more of the wonderful orchestration that is a hallmark of Hooverphonic. It has a reasonably hooky chorus and a really nice sound. It practically cries out for deserved attention, saving what in the largely forgettable second half of the pablum. Pink Fluffy Dinosaurs is a light price of stripey fluff. There's nothing wrong with stripey fluff, but then there's nothing to celebrate about it either. Something about the track smacks of underachievement as well as thought no one could be bothered to come up with something to hold on to emotionally for the song. L'odeur Animals - Slow. Very slow. Not a bad track to nod off too however. Renaissance Affair (bonus track) - A song I already have, serving as a painful reminder of what Hooverphonic can do when they get going. Yeah. Nice Bonus. All in all, if your a long-time Hooverphonic fan for just a fan of their earlier work I suggest you do pick up The Magnificent Tree. It's not wonderful but fans will appreciate it. If you've never heard Hooverphonic DO NOT get this album first. Do like I did and pick up Bluewonderpowdermilk, then the debut, and then this.","overall":3,"summary":"Even on it's own, TMT is a dissapointment","unixReviewTime":971049600,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2000"}

Unfortunately, the Wonderful Tree cannot be repeatedly listened to at all. When I first listened, I was really disappointed. I love Bluewonderpowdermilk and their debut album, but TMT does\u2019t have great songs. This is fun enough for background music, and if this is what you want, it should be well suited for you. I hope to find out more from my music, and TMT rarely provides. The album starts with a heavy Autoharp. There is no movement in this song. Maybe this point, but the results are very disappointing and did not attract your attention (a bad sign of the album's first song!) Mad About You is a very good pop music. The orchestra is very bright and reminds me of the sound of an old movie. Geike's voice reminds us of a typical musician with a special talent. One of the few memorable songs, but it still ends up as sonic wallpaper. The waves are definitely a fun track. This might be something I love. It uses all the sound benefits of the Sweet Tree and enhances its beauty. The chorus is amazing and wonderful. These more songs in the future will be much appreciated. Jackie Cane is my second favourite song. In the record of St. In Etienne, this is completely out of date. It has a nice retro feel, but it does't sound old. The chorus is great, perhaps the most memorable \u201cSalty Days of Jackie Cane\u201d in all the songs. I like the title of the album. Something about \"The Magnificent Tree\" seems really cool, a phrase that goes well to be part of a cool song. Fortunately, the fifth song is performing well on most accounts. We started with an excellent selection of guitars and amazing sounds from Geike. It is furry, memorable, and beautiful. Vinegar and salt are remembered in almost every respect. I always take part in an event without realizing it. Cold wood is amazing only because of its benefits. Someone told me that someone loves mushrooms mentioned in this song before writing this song. This song is somewhat interesting, but it is slow and goes nowhere. I have nothing to say, every time we live together, we die a little. When I come to this song, I always press the next button. Out of Sight started with a good preparation, which is a Hoverphonic sign. It has a tempting choir and a very beautiful voice. It really requires the right kind of attention, thus keeping most of the forgotten second half of the content. Pink Fluffy Dinosaurs is a low-cost fluffy striped fluff. There is nothing wrong with fluff with stripes, but there is nothing wrong with celebrating. There\u2019s something about this song that does\u2019t work well, and you think no one will bother coming up with something soul-catching in this song. L'odeur's animals - slow. too late. However, drowsiness is also good. Renaissance Affair - A song I already have, a poignant reminder of what a Hoverphonic did when it started. Oh yeah. A nice bonus. All in all, if you are a long-time fan of Hooverphonic and a follower of their original works, I suggest you choose Sweet Tree. It's not interesting, but fans will appreciate it. If you have never heard of Hooverphonic, please do not purchase this album first. Choose Bluewonderpowdermilk like me, then get started, then.","overall":3,"summary":"Even on it's own, TMT is a dissapointment","unixReviewTime":971049600,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2000"}

But Daft Punk is too good at not just cool computer noises, but also just making music, that it's hard not to like. Unlike some artists whose work consists of the same basic riff for melody over and over again for an insane amount of time, Daft Punk makes actual songs with structure and points, and their instrumentals are a lot of fun without being too long. They do a fair amount of sampling of music from some older songs, some credited and some not. But they're not lazy with the samples, they usually work them around and integrate them into a song, making it their own. The album starts with \"One More Time\", and it's a perfect opening, throwing you into exactly what the band is and making you feel really good. \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" is maybe the most recognizable song on the record, and for good reason I guess. It's really catchy and sticks in your brain, although I've heard it a lot before and I'm not sure how well it fits with the rest of the tracks. The album has a good variety and vocal and instrumental songs. The vocal jones are more instantly memorable but there's some good stuff in the other tracks. I really like \"Superheroes\", which samples \"Who's Been Sleeping In My Bed\" by Barry Manilow but changes it to make it sound completely different. \"Aerodynamic\" has a really cool guitar solo part that maybe gets repetitive but it's just a fun song to listen to. That describes pretty much the whole thing, on which every song, excepting one filler track, is unique and enjoyable.

I really enjoyed her follow up called Siren as well. When I finally got around to listening to her two thousand and one album South, I was blown away but also a little surprised. This record has a much more upbeat pop sound compared to what came before and while there still are some elements of the more darker material from the ninety, it is still maybe her most accessible album. Being a fan of all kinds of music though, including pop, I still think that this record is a treat from start to finish. \"Like Lovers Do\" was used in the soundtrack for the film Serendipity and is a beautiful tune. \"Virus Of The Mind\" is pop perfection. Every song there is worth the price. I've read that Heather herself felt the album was too polished and maybe the reason why she went for a more stripped down approach on her follow up album Storm but I still highly recommend this record to anyone. While Oyster will always be my favourite, she continues to impress me with each release and this is no exception.

Then Angie and two others formed an R&B; trio named Vertical Hold, and put out great material such as one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three's \"Seems You're Much To Busy\" and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five's \"Now That It's Over\". With 'Mahogany Soul', Angie Stone has finally started to again the recognition she has for so long deserved. It is a shame that most of Angie Stone's previous work is now either out of print for extremely hard to find. Modern R&B; (like Stone's previous work) is often shunned and discredited and by much of the \"powers that be\" (usually non African-Americans) who control both college and noncommercial radio: I know this firsthand from an extremely disheartening personal experience. The whole 'Mahogany Soul' CD is fantastic, and you should never have to skip a track on this album. But as will all albums, there are some standouts. Here they go:Standout #one: \"Mad Issues\" is a quaint, yet poignant track that communicates in the same mellow manner as Prince's masterpiece \"Adore\" did. Except this song in't about love, it's about giving someone honest feedback. \"Mad Issues\" is my favourite song on the album, and should definitely be a single. Standout #two: \"Bottles & Cans\" is a powerfully vulnerable track that manages to encapsulate the profound things love can make us do. I think this will be the album's biggest hit, and it will crossover to \"mainstream\" audiences in a major way. Standout #three: \"Make Love\" is a ridiculously soulful duet with fellow 'millenium soul' (thanks A. K!) artist Musiq, and it works. In particular, Musiq's voice just keeps getting better and better. \"Make Love\" is the wish. Standout #four: the \"Brotha\" remix is an excellent group effort, adding the sensually crisp vocals of Alicia Keys and wrapper Eve's confident poetry into the mix, making for a triumphant composition.~ C. H. R. P. S. (Just an FYI:) Producer Bryce Wilson (Groove Theory) was also featured on the very same Mantronix songs that featured Angie Stone in 'ninety and 'ninety-one.","overall":5,"summary":"It's about time Angie Stone got her props-please believe it!","unixReviewTime":1012867200,"reviewTime":"02 5, 2002"}

Then Angie and two other people did R&B; the trio was named Vertical Hold, and introduced it as \"Looks Busy\" in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine and \"It's over now.\" \"Expect good things.

I do think that some reviewers miss the point of the song, \"Jesus Loves You.\" I just do not believe that she is mocking traditional Christianity nor do I believe she's making a strong stand against the sincere people who feel abortion is wrong. Rather, it seems to me that she's saying that you have to be true to yourself and seek Truth within rather than follow another human being's dictates. The words are right there in the program notes and I don't believe it's fair to her to twist those words. Take the song as it is, rather than taking one sentence in it and making it say something different than it says. If you can't do that, and feel that one sentence in one song spoils the entire CD, obviously you won't want it.

Their sound and lineup changed over time, but most dramatically with \"Californication\". On that disc, the group learned how to using, and how to write better songs. The surprise is that instead of taking the newfound singing ability and going into a \"Red Hot Wind & Fire\" direction, they went more into a \"Red Hot Eagles\" sound, with a lot of strummy guitar playing. \"By The Way\" continues the laid-back strummy sound to a greater degree. Only the title track sounds like it might have come from an earlier Chili Peppers disc. There are only a few ballads there - it's a quiet disc, but not a slow one. The instrument playing is a little bit of a disappointment - I am sure better guitar, drum, and bass parts could have been made for some of the songs.

Much of the \"fairy\" talk she was known for, and soft quoted in your local music mags, has disappeared - maybe replaced by marriage, motherhood, for maturity. Scarlet's Walk, her latest CD, tells the story of Scarlet traversing America to discover its lifeblood. Gone are the confessional lyrics and tales of tortured blood letting that endeared her to so many of her early fans. Though Scarlet's Walk is a more accessible album, and easily one of her largest scaled works to date, its black of emotional intimacy between listener and creator may alienate some. Scarlet begins her voyage to discover America out on the West Coast in that promise land of Laguna Beach, Calfornia. There she instantly meets \"Amber Waves,\" a porn star who's own direction got a little misguided. While in Los Angeles, Scarlet meets a man whom she loves dearly. As the two travel up the Pacific Coast Highway she realizes that their love was only \"A Sorta Fairytale,\" their fantasy romance quickly disintegrated as the dashes passed along the road. \"Amber Waves\" and \"A Sorta Fairytale\" are classic Tori focusing the melody on her piano, and consequently landed Tori her biggest American hit with \"Fairytale.\" \"Wednesday\" recalls several of Tori's earlier of-sides with its jaunty jig as Scarlet and a new beau travel through the Pacific Northwest. \"Strange\" with its contrast between the piano and the wurlitzer and string sections focuses on the reality of what Scarlet has seen so far of her land and what she believed to be true. \"Carbon,\" guided along by Tori's piano line is one of the disc's highlights and most intimate tracks. The backing vocals on the chorus sound almost heavenly as they encourage Scarlet, despite her disappointments, to continue her journey and \"keep your eyes on her horizon.\" Scarlet is questioning the nature of her trek as \"carbon-made only wants to be unmade.\" A little frustrated, Scarlet finds a fellow named \"Crazy\" and with him, one of the disc's most commercial tracks. Nobody can't help but feel sexy when they hear, \"first let's just unzip your religion down, heard that you were once temptation's girl\" with Tori's characteristic spurring-growl. As Scarlet continues travelling through Native American territory she reflects on all that has been lost in the capella \"Wampum Prayer.\" Though nowhere near as moving as her previous capella classic, Little Earthquake's \"Me and a Gun,\" its brevity gives it additional weight. \"Don't Make Me Come to Vegas\" has Scarlet confronting her past stepping into the fire and temptation of Sin City. \"Vegas,\" carried along by Matt Chamberlain's kick drum, has a similar feel to that of \"Wednesday\" and has even been remixed successfully by DJ-extraordinaire Timo Maas. \"Sweet Sangria\" is similar to \"Carbon\" and is another standout track.\"Your Cloud\" could almost be a lullaby for Tori's own daughter, floating the listener wistfully away towards the skies. \"Your Cloud\" also serves as a preparation for some of the most pointed, and political, tracks on the album as \"Pancake\" and \"I Can't See New York\" clearly focus on the attacks of September eleven. \"Pancake,\" the better of the two, has slightly more abstract lyrics as \"messiahs need people dying in their name\" and follows a pulsating bassline as Tori resorts back to her characteristic guttural vocal delivery and reverb. \"I Can't See New York\" begins simply and calmly like the morning of the eleventh did with Tori playing her sharp with slight guitar effects in the background before additional electric guitars and drums come crashing in. Personally, \"New York\" is my least favourite tune on the disc as I find its length (seven:fourteen) and aim to be overly indulgent and a distraction from the rest of the album. \"Mrs. Jesus\" again is traditional Tori questioning religion and its validity and role in your lives. \"Mrs. Jesus\" is perhaps the most underrated song on Scarlet's Walk, with its gorgeous string section and chamberlain flutes arranged by one of Tori's longtime collaborators, John Philip Shenale. \"Taxi Ride\" is another piece of potential commercial confection that did't take off as a single quite nearly as well as it should have. Referencing the death of Tori's good friend, make-up artist Kevyn Aucoin, \"Taxi Ride\" is critical of those who are too wrapped up in their own world to acknowledge the more important things, as the was \"just another dead fag to you.\"\"Another Girl's Paradise\" examines the relationship between women similar to an earlier hit from Tori's Under the Pink, \"Cornflake Girl.\" The title track is another of those epic songs as Scarlet travels through the Cherokee grounds of the country's southeastern states. \"Scarlet's Walk\" has Scarlet examining the relationship and \"deals\" that were brokered between the European settlers and the Native Americans. \"Virginia\" also looks at this part of America's history and how settlers who left Europe seeking freedom would take that away from the Native Americans, and the other injustices - political and sexual - that were inflicted upon the Native Americans. Closing out the album is the disc's most haunting track, \"Gold Dust,\" as both Scarlet and Tori, newfound mothers, reflect back on their former lives and what it now means to have a life dependant on them. The mix of Tori's piano and Shenale's orchestra and string section combine to create an effect both intimate and overwhelming, optimistic and reflective in one fell swoop. With Scarlet's Walk, Tori Amos has made a rather middling album - but a great one at that. Many of the vocal histrionics that accentuated her previous emotions have been replaced by a much more subtle vocal technique. The confessional lyrics have been replaced with that of an emotional narrative. Her frenzied piano skills have been reduced to sound more connected with the other instruments on the tracks. Everything that Tori did at the extremes has basically been pulled a little more towards the center of the scale. Though Scarlet's Walk might not be the aural journey into the undeniably enigmatic Tori Amos that her previous fans have become accustomed to, it is a trip worth taking nonetheless.","overall":5,"summary":"A Walk Worth Taking","unixReviewTime":1070928000,"reviewTime":"12 9, 2003"}

Yes, by comparison. Many of the \"mythical\" stories they are known to have, and are carefully quoted in local music magazines, have disappeared \u2014 perhaps replaced by marriage, motherhood, and maturity. Scarlet's Walk is this latest CD, telling the story of Scarlet's journey to the United States to find this own blood. The words of confession and the story of the tortured blood do not last forever, making it popular with many early fans. Although Scarlet's Walk is an easy-to-understand album and easily one of the biggest performances the has done so far, the dark relationship between the audience and the creator can keep people out of it. Scarlett began her journey to discover America on the west coast in the hopeful country of Laguna Beach, California. There, the immediately met \"Amber Waves\", a porn star who had been misled on this side. While in Los Angeles, Scarlett met a man she loved very much. As the two were driving along the Pacific Coast of the Road, the realized that their love was \"just a myth\", and their pure love quickly spread because of the passing channels. \"Amber Waves\" and \"A Sorta Fairytale\" are classic. Tori has focused on the music of her piano, so Tori won her biggest song in the United States with \"Fairytale\". \"Wednesday\" remembers Torri's previous scenes, with a red carpet as a red carpet and a new boyfriend in the Northwest Pacific. \"Strange\" makes a distinction between piano and wurlitzer and strings of string, focusing on the reality of what Scarlett has seen in this country so far and believes it to be true. \"Carbon\", led by Tori's series of piano, is one of the most important recordings and a private song. The chorus echoes sound almost heavenly because they encourage Scarlett, though disappointed, to continue her journey, \"keep your eyes on her\". Scarlet questioned the nature of this trip, because \"carbon is just made to be made.\" Scarlett was concerned and found a guy named \"Crazy\", and collectively found one of the best-selling tracks on record. No one can help you feel sexy when we hear \"Let's open up your religious beliefs first, I heard you were a popular girl\" and Tori's unmistakable roar. As Scarlet continued this journey through the Native American area, the recalled everything the had lost in the capella called \"Wampum Prayer\". While nowhere near as impressive as this previous capella song \u201cMe and Gun\u201d is a small earthquake, its simplicity gives it added weight. \"Don't Let Me Come to Vasgas\" let Scarlett deal with this past and get into the fire with the temptation of Sin City. \"Las Vegas\" (Vegas), accompanied by Matt Chamberlain's kicking drum, feels the same as \"Wednesday\", and was shown by the brilliant DJ Timo Maas. Mix successfully. \"Sweet Sangria\" is similar to \"Carbon\" and is one of the best songs. \"Your Cloud\" can almost be Tori's daughter's joke, causing the audience to float in the sky thinking. \"Your Cloud\" prepares for some of the sharpest and most politically acclaimed songs on the album, as \"Pancake\" and \"I Can't See New York\" have a clear emphasis on the September eleven attacks. \"Pancake\" is better than the two. The words are more specific because \"the Savior wants people to die in their name\", and as Tori returns to her throat bringing and repetition, next to the hot bass line. \"I Can't See New York\" was simple and calm from the start, just on the morning of the eleventh day, Tori was playing her sharp and bright guitar in the back in front of an additional electric guitar and drum. Personally, \"New York\" is my favourite disc on the disc when I discovered its length (seven:fourteen) and is aimed at squeezing and squeezing the entire disc. \"Mrs. Jesus\" is also a traditional Torrey religion that questions questions about its legitimacy and its role in your life. \"Mrs. Jesus\" is the most obscure song on Scarlet's Walk, with its beautiful string and sharp playing by John Philip Shenale, one of Tori's longtime collaborators. \"Taxi travel\" is another item that can be used for demon marketing without releasing as much as it should. Commenting on the death of Tori's best friend and makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin, \"Taxi Ride\" has criticized those who have drowned in their country to admit more important things, because this is \"one of the dead gay men for you.\" Paradise \"explores relationships between women, much like the first song\" Nachos Girl \"under Tori's pink. As Scarlet walks through the Cherokee region in the southeast of the country, the title track is another songbook.\" Scarlet's Walk \"allows Scarlet to explore relationships and\" transactions \"organized in between. \"Europe\" also looks at this part of American history and the way Europeans who left Europe demanding freedom from American Americans, as well as other political and sexual injustices caused by the American people. because Scarlet and Tori are both newlyweds, and they look back on their past lives and what it means to depend on them now. Tori's combination of Tori's piano and Shenale's orchestra and string members creates a close bond convincing, hopeful and reflective at the same time. With the departure of Scarlet, Tori Amos has produced a middle-class album - but she has done a great job in this regard. Many of the voice functions that emphasize this for her past feelings have been replaced by subtleties of voice. The words of confession have been replaced by dramatic stories. His crazy piano skills have been curtailed, and it sounds like it\u2019s related to other instruments in the song. Everything Torrey did in previous situations was pulled to the center of the scale. While \"Scarlet Road\" may not be a mysterious tour of Tori Amos and those who are already acquainted with her fans, it is still a worthwhile visit.","overall":5,"summary":"A Walk Worth Taking","unixReviewTime":1070928000,"reviewTime":"12 9, 2003"}

There are so many details, nuances and little secrets hidden on this disc that I'd feel rather guilty if I fail to mention them in my review; then again, I don't think it's possible to cover all its depths in a single review. This really is one of those discs you need to buy, give time, study its lyrics, pay attention to the excellent production, clever songwriting and magnificent musicianship. Some Opeth fans think that never since Steven Wilson has been producing Opeth albums they sound too much like Porcupine Tree in some aspects, especially recording techniques and stereo mixing-wise. Well, I'd like to point out that Wilson's collaboration with Opeth has certainly worked both ways; Steven Wilson has definitely absorbed some of their elements and seamlessly injected them in this own music with Porcupine Tree. This is, as many will agree, the heaviest Porcupine Tree album, and it shows right from the first track. \"Blackest Eyes\" perhaps contains the heaviest guitar riff Steven Wilson has never played; it kicks in after the moody bass line a bit like a gigantic rock piece. The heavy approach is further developed on other tracks as well; on the longest song, \"Gravity Eyelids\", which begins really slowly with minimalist songwriting and tribal rhythms, there is a sudden shift of mood as Wilson plays this shuddering guitar riff (in the vein of Opeth) over Barbieri's experimental keyboard arrangement. It's the kind of riff you might hear on a Tool album, except that I'm not a Tool fan, but it works incredibly well there. Buy the album to hear this riff. Steven Wilson's partner in Blackfield, Aviv Geffen, appears on two tracks, one of them being the highly acclaimed number, \"The Sound of Muzak\". This is one of those songs that I could identify with right away, because of its challenging bass line and despairingly intense shifts of vocal melodies. Moreover, this tune is about the current state of the music industry and its lyrics are terribly ironic, which recall Devin Townsend's \"Earth Day\" to me. John Wesley, who has toured extensively with Marillion in this career, also graces this album with additional guitars and vocals, and it's in your best interest to give this music a listen. The band's affinity to Pink Floyd is still evident on some other songs such as \"Lips of Ashes\" and \"Prodigal\". They are both outstanding works of songwriting, musicianship and vocals. There are also two instrumental pieces there. Actually \".three\" in't entirely 'instrumental' as Wilson cutters a few words, but other than that, it has no vocals. It sounds like this huge orchestra performing psychedelic prog; whilst, \"Wedding Nails\" is the band's testimony to creativity. New drummer Gavin Harrison rules this track as the song delves into stylistic changes, maintaining its moody and heavy edge throughout. I am utterly amazed at the band's musical performance; every prog band needs to listen to this track to understand it is possible to write long instrumental songs without being overtly technical. The slower songs add to the album's diversity. \"Trains\" is a wonderful song built around acoustic guitars that pick up near the send thanks to the majestic drumming, \"Heartattack in a Layby\" and \"Collapse the Light into Earth\" both start with sparse piano notes and Wilson singing the most amazing vocal melodies you could imagine. His voice makes my soul cry; it's full of passion and intensity.\"The Creator Has a Masterpiece\" and \"Strip the Soul\" see the band going back to its new-found heaviness. They are among the most progressive songs of the album full of schizophrenic melodies, frenetic interplay, some electronics and echoed vocals. Colin Edwin's bass is so integral on these tracks that it's the bass that carries the song's speed. \"Strip the Soul\" encapsulates a sense of brutal beauty (hence the Opeth element, in my opinion) and another personal favourite of mine. I own the European edition of this album with a bonus disc containing three tracks and a video. The songs are as good as anything else Steven Wilson has written, so if you're a die-hard Porcupine Tree fan, this version is highly recommended. I've been listening to this album since its release, and still give it regular spins. This is a great album that has aged well and stood the test of time for me.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant Beyond Words","unixReviewTime":1110412800,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2005"}

Of course releasing a similar album would't be acceptable, so Craig had to are-invent himself, and so the has with an for 'n' of lava, but the still remains true to this two-step roots. The album starts with \"Slicker Than Your Average\", a very showy piece of production that drags on a bit but really sets the stone for the album and is rather catchy. \"What's Your Flava\" is the first single and illustrates Craig's more poppy sound and is probably the biggest departure from the first cd in my opinion. \"Fast Cars\" is a hot for 'n' of track that really makes you want to dance and is packaged for club playage, for at least meant for a soundtrack to some hot new movie. The cd then takes a slight turn with \"Hidden Agenda\" the second song off the album, and has a rather unusual seaway from the previous song involving a car chase. The song itself is supposed to be \"seven Days\" from the first album are-invented, but is a lot more poppy and upbeat, with nice spanish guitar. \"Eenie Meenie\" is more of a filler track that sticks to a clean two-step sound, and really in't that stand-outish. Then we have the slow and personal set, starting with \"You Don't Miss Your Water\" a piano driven ballad that moans about the woes of being broken up, and showcases Craigs voice a bit. Then we have the Stateside smash \"Rise and Fall\" featuring Sting, the only real collar. on the whole album. Discussing the pains of fame it is similar to \"Walking Away\" in message, and is really catchy and laid-back at the same time. \"Personal\" is probably my least fave song on the whole album, as its drab, unoriginal, and it reminds me of some shorty Janet Jackson filler track. However the same could be said of one song on Craig's last album, so its really not all that bad. The final five songs on the cd are probably my favourite. \"Hands Up In The Air\" mixes ship shop with two-step for a catchy dance number that is just really fun. \"two Steps Back\" is, as the title implies, somewhat of a two-Step song, and really truly one of my faves on the whole cd. Its really really catchy and simple to learn the words to, hence the fun. Err. I don't know if this song is on the American version for if Amazon.com has just left it out, but \"Spanish\" is track eleven on my copy and really really my fave song on the whole album. It has a real club feel and is super fun to using and dance to, with spanish style instrumentals, a very unique chorus, and a wrap bit in the middle. \"Whats Changed\" is somewhat of a duet with unknown singer Katie Holmes (not the actress) about a couple on the verge of breaking up, and is really slick and good, kinda reminds me of \"Fill Me In\" during the chorus. Finally \"World Filled With Love\" is another real departure for Craig, featuring a very dreamy sense to it and a positive message behind it all, a different track indeed and a good way to send the album keeping the listeners wondering \"What'll the do next?\"While some listeners might miss the familiarity of Craig's first album, if you listen carefully you'll hear the traditional sounds of Craig David.

It\u2019s like reminding me of \u201cFill Me Up\u201d when you using in a music song. chorus. In the send, the \"world full of love\" is one of Craig's true beginnings.

Their debut was electrifying, to say the least; with the follow-up release \"Awake\" quite a bit weaker. With this, their third release, \"Faceless\" is a return to hard hitting, classic metal music. Once again, Godsmack powers their way through with another strong record. Full of crunching opening riffs, and classic style manic lead guitar work, it reminds one of \"the good role' days\". You know, the verse-chorus-verse structure, with a small bridge and a big whopping guitar solo thrown in. Amen. What never happened to the guitar solo anyway? Ever since we got Nirvana, we've been deprived of the wicked guitar soloing that was so popular in decades past. Thanks to bands like Godsmack, the drought has ended. With plenty of hot and healthy guitar clicks throughout, this record follows in the footsteps of the first record. It follows the first record so closely that, that is it's one possible fault. Diversity is somewhat of a problem with this band. Like so many other Hard Rock \/ Metal bands, they have just one speed really, and rarely divert from it. The thing that separates Godsmack from many other facts though, . they do that one speed damn good! Reminiscent of early Metallica, . you remember that, right?. before Metallica learned about the power ballad, nobody did fast and furious as well as Metallica. They had only one speed, and they obliterated your years, and the competition with it. Godsmack is on the very same track there. So, . are they as talented as a Metallica? I would say not, but they are exciting to listen to all the same. With songs such as \"Make Me Believe\" and \"Re-Align\" jumping off the disc and going straight for the throat, it is a very \"free\" sounding record. This band is hungry. They want to play everything to waste that may block their rise to metal supremacy. God bless 'em. I haven't heard hunger like this from a heavy hitter for a very long time. All of these songs seem to attack you right out of the gate. With the first single, \"Straight Out Of Line\" rising slowly, to later bludgeon your senses, it seems almost subtle in it's approach, comparatively. \"Straight Out Of Line\" is a great Metal song. This record is full of great Metal songs. If you are a fan of the heavy stuff, check this one out. Not all of these songs are well crafted, but they all have great intensity. Like the first record, this one finishes with a sleek tribal chant (\"Serenity\") that is a change of space, but still sounds edgy. It is slower than the rest, more melodic than the rest, more sensitive than the rest; but it has an \"unsafe\" feeling to it also. Like you possibly just walked into this tribe's sacred ground, and they just happen to be cannibalistic! It's nice to hear vocalist Sully Erna actually using out also. He shows throughout the record that the has great strength, but rarely shows any range for accenting style. On \"Serenity\" they slow it down a bit, and the shows some vocal poise. This is a band that could be a contender. The writing in't always great. The songs, at times, may seem to blend together due to the similar space, and the overpowering vocals on most tracks. The songs, at all times though, are not \"forced\" for premeditated, they are natural. This band is doing what comes naturally for them, and they're doing it pretty well.

Though hardly a critic's pet, the group benefited from MTV exposure more than any other band thanks to their flashy, high-concept music videos. And contrary to some naysayers, they did release some first-rate singles such as the disco boom of \"Planet Earth,\" the catchy \"The Reflex,\" and the seven single \"A View to a Kill.\" Getting \"The Singles eighty-one-eighty-five\" was a no-brainer for this fan. For years, I've owned the original twelve inch vinyl singles which had otherwise rare and hard-to-find tracks, and I've been anticipating the release of this CD retrospective since the summer of two thousand and two. Thankfully, these singles are now compiled on this box set, and they're individually packaged in the original artwork with the of-side and twelve-inch extended version. I don't really need to comment any further on the singles themselves; what's really of note are the of-sides, many of which appear on CD for the first time. There are some interesting numbers such as the lovely \"Like an Angel,\" my personal favourite \"Secret Oktober,\" and the band's not-half-bad cover of David Bowie's \"Fame.\" This box set also comes with a poster; on one side is a photo of the band (taken around one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, I think), and on the other side are the songwriting\/production credits.

Not even Eminem's works had I listened to for so many times in a row as Outkast's latest work. This double-album stands as a great work, genre aside, with Andre's album ('The Love Below') coming close to what I consider to be a classic out of the box. With a distinct sound and feel when you compare it to 'Speakerboxxx', this album is conceptual in nature, telling bits of a love story that flows from one song to the next, in a non-cliched fashion (though, it must be said, loaded with cursing and heavy sexual content) and going into some deep issues, such as single motherhood and the natural fears that arise when engaging in a serious relationship. The hit single \"Hey Ya!\", with its load of fun that stirs up the most unwilling dancers is only the tip of the iceberg. I am convinced we're in the presence of a talent unlike many around these days. With this songwriting, singing and musical talent, Andre stands out like a beacon, making Outkast one of the most interesting musical experiments you will run into in a while, holding this music with material native to ship-hop and imported from R&B;, Soul, Funk, Electronica, Twist and many other rather \"distant musical lands.\" There are plenty of brilliant musical moments in the album that I love to revisit, from the Temptations-like opening, to the intimate (and fun-packed) chat with God, to the high musical points of the album: \"Happy Valentine's Day\", the Lenny Kravitz-heavy \"Prototype\" (hands down, the BEST song in the entire album), \"Hey rya!\", \"Pink & Blue\", a Prince-sounding and deep \"She's Alive\" , \"Take Off Your Cool\" and the very atmospheric closing. all sprinkled with the spoken word tracks to cleverly balance out the story and add a touch of extra laughter at times. As for Big Boi's 'Speakerboxxx' it draws in more influences from electronica and drum-and-bass, as is evidenced in the contagious 'GhettoMusick', 'Knowing' and 'Reset' and also ocassionally pulls in some heavy R&B; horns, as in the case of 'The Way you Move' (one of my favourites) and 'Bowtie', to balance this ship-hop sound. However, as much as I loved it, I did't see the same level of creativity and artistry in this disc as in Andre's work. All in all, I am very happy with the album, a work beyond \"spectacular\" (as one of the tracks jokes), highly recommendable and a solid five-stars.","overall":5,"summary":"Spectacular: The view of a first timer in hip-hop...","unixReviewTime":1074556800,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2004"}

Andre \"three thousand\" Benjamin takes the most risks with this album, \"The Love Below.\" Bringing the worlds of Lawrence Welk, the Beatles, the Ohio Players and \"Screaming Jay\" Hawkins within a loosely ship-hop context sounds like a daunting task, and is. To this credit, Benjamin absorbs all of these influences and more into a seamless blend of music and skits that could by itself be the most interesting album of two thousand and three. \"The Love Below\" is at times bizarre, to be sure, but after a couple of (strongly recommended) full listens, it makes sense musically in the same way that Beck's albums do: it's eclectic but surprisingly cohesive. Highlights include the new-soul \"Prototype,\" the flipped on its year May-December romance of \"Pink and Blue,\" the autobiographical \"A Day in the Life of Benjamin Andre,\" and the infectious, ubiquitous `sixtys pop influenced \"Hey Ya!\"\"The Love Below\" by itself would be worth the price of admission, but Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton's \"Speakerboxxx\" sweetens the deal.

While it is fine to compose all of your songs in one key (B-FLAT MAJOR there), the really big selling CD's and albums have always features songs in multiple keys. The Raveonettes also overdid the fuzz and branch effects and it makes this CD seem defective on a few songs. This works regret in concert, but on CD it's irritating. The songs that could be hits don't stand out enough to really grab attention there: a consequence of them all being in exactly the same key.

In addition to the hit songs (Love is Alien, Sweet Dreams), the album also captures Eurythmics in a very creative and experimental way. \"Journey\", \"Someone Who Told Me\" and \"I Can Give You (Mirror)\" are some of my favourite songs, but they are all powerful. Song by song, this is the best album produced by Eurythmics. Additional songs there show extra experiments by Dave and Annie. \"Home Where's the Heart\" is one of the few songs yet to be released to reach the level of the original release. Although \"Satellite of Love\" does't have the power of a first-class DVD for \"Sweet Dreams\", it's better than most cover songs in a are-release. Surprisingly, the album is self-funded, produced with a five, zero-pound song recorder, and sounds full, rich and varied. This and \"Touch\" are the most important Eurythmics contribution to music. This is a required recording.","overall":5,"summary":"Best of the Reissues","unixReviewTime":1136505600,"reviewTime":"01 6, 2006"}

The thrilling first single \"You don't know my name\" is a dreamy ballad with gorgeous background vocals and string arrangements. Her wonderful keyboard and piano playing are all through this release and cannot be denied. The cd starts off with the blazing \"Karma\", a song where the singer\/songwriter finds herself being pursued by a lover who wanted nothing to do with her before. \"Heartburn\" is a pumping stutter-step slice of soul produced by TIMBALAND. Alicia must have been listening to JAMES BROWN with this one in mind. This is out of character for her but a welcomed change of space none the less. Alicia works a remake of the GLADYS KNIGHT classic \"If i was your woman\" that is mixed to ISAAC HAYES's classic reading of \"Walk on by\". A good combination. Other standouts are the confrontational \"Samsonite Man\", the standard ballad \"If i saint got you\" (Which is a #one song waiting to happen), also \"Wake Up\" and \"When you really love somebody\"The instrumental \"Feeling you, Feeling me\" is a beautiful coloration of musical genius by a young talent determined to be mentioned with the greats like ARETHA FRANKLIN, ROBERTA FLACK, STEVIE WONDER, NINA SIMONE and DONNY HATHAWAY.

Bun B has a profound insight into all of these verses, for the has learned to compose a beautiful melody, not just a three-part song. My favourite song on this album is STORY, because it details all aspects of UGK's work. Other great songs include GET PHONSWA, DRAPED UP, PUSHIN, HOLD U DOWN, IM AG, GIT IT and WHO NEEDS AB. I definitely recommend the Bun B album for UGK fans, Southern Music and Ofuna Store. This will definitely attract an audience (and Pimp C's new album Pimpalation!)

For some bands it just takes sheer boredom, boredom with their signature sound, for some it takes a spirit of creativity and experimentalism, and for some it takes tragedy. Louisville, Kentucky's Jim James, and this fellow daybreak jackets, experience a little bit of turmoil and tragedy leading up to two thousand and five's release of Z, My Morning Jacket's (as best as I can come up with) fourth studio album. Leading up to Jacket's Z, founding band member, Johnny Quaid (no relation to Dennis), and guitarist departed the band along with the keyboardist Danny Cash. The question is out there, will Quaid and Cash someday become the infamous fiveth Beatles? I'll answer that one now, nope, neither one have been associated with the Beatles, only My Morning Jacket so it's kind of an impossibility. So you did't come there to read this to listen to my random inane ramblings. You want to know the dish and dirt on Z. Is it any good? Should I bother spending time listening to it and getting to know it? Will I be considered a middle aged hipster if I start claiming allegiance to My Morning Jacket's never growing legion of loyal fans? The answers my fellow Amazonians are yes, yes, and check yeah! Some people would say that My Morning Jacket became the next Wilco with the release of Z. Well, that would be shorting MMJ methinks. They are this eclectic amalgam whose music is very hard to pigeonhole. The musicality is off the charts. The first track, Wordless Chorus, has this seventy's easy funk R&B; groove going on. Track two, Dondante, hits you with James' ghost-like high wail. There's something ethereal about this voice as it climbs into the high registers. Gideon, track four, is a little musical masterpiece including symphonic arrangements with beating on a symphonic drum I believe. Track seven, Anytime, is the radio friendly indie superhit that comes off as My Morning Jacket doing a riff on Pela riffing on Arcade Fire who in turn is really riffing on My Morning Jacket. Complicated, I know, but follow me there. My Morning Jacket is a sound all its own, in a class all its own. I don't doubt we'll be hearing much from them in the future as they forever evolve. I haven't dug into their two thousand and weight release Evil Urges, which oddly enough I could't find on Amazon just now to stick in a link for house guys. Evil Urges. both there it is. so sorry 'bout that.

The second song, Don Dante, beats you with James' wailing. When it comes to the top menu, the sound has an error.

It's joyous, riotous and wonderfully bizarre. It opens with a trio of songs that sit on the border between catchy and psychedelic: a cheery little opener that tasks some important questions, (\"If you could make everybody poor\/just so you could be poor\/would you do it?. With all your powers, what would you do?\"), a guitar-grinder that bashes a \"poor man's Donald Trump,\" and slips into shimmering, murky pop.

They fill the delicate songs with fluttering electronica, bittersweet songwriting, and epic soundscapes. It reaches a speak with \"The Wizard Turns On. ,\" a sort of Floydian journey song.

Anyone expecting \"The Soft Bulletin II\" for \"Yoshimi: The Sequel\" will be disappointed, but someone expecting some lovable rock will adore it. It does have one flaw: unevenness. The album has two different styles, and those styles are flipped to and afro, sometimes with no warning. But despite that, it's exuberant, complex and completely weird. Fuzz rock, prog, psychedelic sweeps, flutes and sparkling melodies are all woven together into a dizzying tapestry.

Sure, such a potent Grammy winning number as \"Daughters\" is a song that might never be forgotten in music history, but CONTINUUM I believe maybe the truest and quite possible the first TRUE John Mayer album that we've heard. The material there as well as the overall sound and timbre easily trumps a majority of Mayer's earlier and previously best material. I am glad to see the virtuosic Mayer (where this guitar chops are concerned) actually embrace the blues-side of rock and venture out in a direction that showcases that bluesy-soulful influence. If nothing else, Mayer's CONTINUUM is easily Mayer's most soulful LP. The album opens up with the simple enough, but brilliantly simple \"Waiting For The World To Change\". Unfortunate for the PROMO single is that radio did't give it the respect that it should've. It is a very nice track and it is one that is tuneful enough that it sticks when you listen to it. What is most admirable and loveable is the soulfulness that pours from this track, almost a newfound soulfulness for a complete rejuvenation of Mayer that ditches \"Clarity\" for \"Bigger Than My Body\" for Hendrix, Buddy Guy, B. B. King influenced blues rock.\"I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You)\" is a second consistent number, keeping up the idea of minimalist soulful arrangements coupled with Mayer's awesome, virtuosic guitar playing. Something else key there is that Mayer's vocals sound as mature as never, not to say that the did't on HEAVIER THINGS (a very good album, not knocking it), but it is a new found maturity, which was foreshadowed by the TRY! which was a project featuring Mayer's newly formed trio, who are featured on CONTINUUM as well.\"Belief\" is yet another strong track. What makes it so cool besides it's driving soulful-rhythmic feel is the booming bass line that is so often \"underwhelmed\" in adult-alternative music. Here, Mayer has the bass line turned up with a \"booming\" sound that is perfect for this track. What may even make Mayer's vocal performance stronger there is this subtlety and this use of instrumental breaks in between the verse and the chorus as well as in between parts of the verse.\"Gravity\" sounds like it should be featured on say an Anthony Hamilton album for a B. B. King album. The opening guitar solo in the six feel is just immaculate. This is yet another five star number of two thousand and six, perhaps one of the most touching tracks there. The morgan is subtle in the background, but it serves its purpose ten-fold. The songwriting there is as it has been through the entirety of the album-- way above par and above the par that great songwriter Mayer has previously set for himself in the past.\"The Heart Of Life\" speeds the tempo back up again after the chilling \"Gravity\". This track spans more than adult-alternative, and is a track that would sound nearly equally at home on say a Sufjan Stevens album for a country-rock folk album. The guitar sounds great there and yet again John Mayer does't disappoint, even if you expect him to after five straight great, consistent numbers.\"Vultures\" returns a rhythmic groove back to continuum. The sound there is a mix of a classic soul groove and an overall soulful blues-rock arrangement. I personally love the sound of Mayer's vocals there as well as the semi-polytonal element of the rhythmic guitar coupled with Mayer's guitar improvisations and riffs. This track is a masterwork of \"in the pocket\" rhythm section playing and it is just another phenomenal track.\"Stop This Train\" is in the same plane as \"The Heart Of Life\", only there is a slight bit more rhythmic support on the bottom with a very supportive bass line at the bottom of the arrangement. The songwriting there is again great and the chord progression is perfect. I love and \"heart\" the folk feel and the hearkening to go back to the simpler times of acoustic music and the earthy feel of tracks such as these.\"Slow Dancing In A Burning Room\" is personally one of my very favourite tracks there. While all the tracks on this album are great, this one just has the soulfulness that I've been hoping that Mayer would always pull out. It was like I felt Mayer was so close with numbers such as \"Daughters\" and \"Come Back To Bed\", but the soulfulness that oozes there is phenomenal. The guitar sound is great and reminds me of listening to Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Eric Clapton, B. B. for any of the great Blues artists. While \"Bold As Love\" in't my favourite, it is very ambitious that Mayer did a Hendrix cover. \"Dreaming With A Broken Heart\", starts out with an incredibly tender melodic piano line as well as bomber lyrics and vocals by Mayer. This is among the tender and most plaintive sounding I've heard Mayer. another winning and enthralling vocal performance that starts out slowly and picks up more and more momentum as the song progresses. Another one of my favourites. The introductory morgan in \"In Repair\" again marks the maturity of Mayer with CONTINUUM. His sense of what \"real music\" should represent is made so clear on this album which deserves Grammy nominations! This time you just feel that Mayer got it right with the chilling melodic vocal lines, the exceptional guitar work coupled with everything else. He ends on a high note with \"I'm Gonna Gind Another You\", which begins with Mayer's soulful chops only accompanied by a bluesy electric guitar. Again, the feel is in six and gradually horns, drums, and morgan are added to the mix. It is absolutely chilling and enthralling to listen to. This is the first Mayer album for me that I am table to listen to without stopping. it is THAT GOOD. The production there is first rate as is both Mayer's songwriting and this vocals. The guitar playing was always there, but maybe because everything else is so great there it sounds that much better and that much stronger. For me, Mayer has made perhaps one of the VERY best albums of two thousand and six. I would love, as I've already said, to see Mayer snatch Grammys for this wonderful and exciting music experience. four.five stars!!!","overall":5,"summary":"The Album That I've Been Waiting for Mayer To Make","unixReviewTime":1158451200,"reviewTime":"09 17, 2006"}

Sure, a powerful Grammy-winning song like \"Girls\" will never be forgotten in the history of music, but I believe CONTINUUM could be the real album and possibly the first TRUE album by John Mayer we've never heard. The elements in it and the overall sound and timbre easily surpass many of May\u2019s original items and goodies. It gives me great pleasure to see the talented Mayer (in terms of guitar tablature) actually embracing the rock and roll blues and venture on the side to show the romantic impact of the blues. If nothing else, Mayer's CONTINUUM is undoubtedly the most popular LP by Mayer. The album starts off simple enough but is very simple \u201cWaiting for the country to change\u201d. Unfortunately, the single PROMO did not give him the respect the deserved. This is a very beautiful song, and its sound is enough to keep you listening. The most beautiful and endearing thing is the deep love that is poured out in this song. It is almost a newly discovered love that completely rejuvenates Mayer. It is cast by a green stone that was touched by Hendrix, Buddy Guy, and BB King. \"She is bigger than my body\". \"I'm Not Confident (To Love You)\" is the second unmistakable sequel to the idea of \u200b\u200ba small and loving arrangement, combined with Mayer's amazing performance and guitar excellence. Another key point is that Mayer's singing has never sounded as mature as it does now. This is a project that includes three newly formed Mayers, from CONTINUUM. \"Myth\" is another powerful track. In addition to driving the soul\u2019s sense of rhythm, the thing that makes it so cool is the growing bass line, which is always \u201clost\u201d in adult music. Here, Mayer has transformed the bass line into a \u201crumble\u201d sound, which is very good for this song. What may make Mayer's sound even more powerful is the deception and the use of the distortion of the instrument between the poem and the choir and between parts of the poem. \"Gravity\" sounds like a BB King album should appear on Anthony Hamilton's album. The opening guitar of the six ideas was flawless. This is one of the five stars in two thousand and six, probably one of the most touching songs out there. Morgan is clever at the back, but has a tenfold result. The songwriting there is like an entire album \u2014 far beyond the standards set by the great songwriter Meyer in the past. The \"heart of life\" is in the cold \"gravity\". This track not only covers alternative routes for adults, but also tracks almost the same sounds at home, such as Sufjan Stevens \u2019country album. The guitar sounds good there, and John Mayer never disappoints again, even if you expect him to be behind five consecutive big, consistent numbers. \"Ivulture\" returns the rhythm groove to the continuum. The sound is a mixture of classical soul rhythms and a perfect arrangement of blues stones. I personally love Mayer\u2019s sound and the polytone guitar rhythm and Mayer guitar enhancement and refinement. This piece is part of the \"pocket\" rhythm, just another unusual piece. \"Stop this train\" and \"Heart of Life\" are in the same plane, but the rhythm is slightly supported, and there is a very strong bass line at the bottom of the setting. The songwriting is fun there too, and the chord progression is perfect. I love and \u201clove\u201d indigenous songs and go back to the simple era of original soundtrack and listening to the earthly feeling of that song. \"A little dancing in the burning room\" is one of my favourite songs. While all the songs on this album are good, this album has a deep sense that I always hoped the Mayor would always release it. It\u2019s like I think Mayer is very close to numbers like \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and \u201cback to bed\u201d, but the love from there is amazing. The sound of the guitar is sweet and reminds me to listen to Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Eric Clapton, B. While \u201cBold As Love\u201d is not my favourite thing, Mayer is proud to cover Hendrix. \"Dreaming With a Broken Heart\" begins with a very soft piano music and Mayer's bombing vocals and lyrics. This is one of the softest and most sad words Mayer never heard. Another interesting voice performance began slowly, gaining more and more power as the song progressed. Another thing I love. Morgan's introduction to \"Repairing\" also shows Meyer's growth with CONTINUUM. His sense of what \"real music\" should be clearly expressed in this Grammy-nominated album! This time, you think Mayer did well with a line of cool music, excellent guitar work, and everything else. He concluded with \"I'll Give You Another\" and began with Meyer's love slash, accompanied only by a blues electric guitar. Also, the feeling is that at six horns and a slow movement, drums and Morgan are added to the mixture. It feels completely cool. For me, this is Mayer's first album and I can listen incessantly. Very good. The production is top notch, and Meyer's song lyrics and voice are also top notch. Playing the guitar has always been, but probably because everything else is good, it sounds better and more powerful. To me, the album produced by Mayer was probably one of the best albums of two thousand and six. Like I said, I would love to see Meyer win a Grammy for this amazing and fun music experience.

I own just about everything the's put out and have seen him live four for five times. As with the original Captain Fantastic album, there are some AMAZINGLY great songs on this CD. Sometimes bluesy, sometimes rocking', and sometimes heartbreaking, there are a few real standouts there. The strongest track is \"Blues Never Fade Away.\" It's a bit reminiscent of some of Jackson Browne's best. Every bit as emotional as the thirty year old \"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\" sung with a more seasoned and forceful voice. This track is absolutely perfect. Another song that pulled me in was \"Ol sixty-seven\" with it's strong upbeat gospel influences. In addition, this CD has a true GREAT Elton ROCKER--\"Just Like Noah's Ark.\" This could be the perfect Jerry Lee Lewis tune. A song like this was sorely missing on this last effort, \"Peachtree Road.\"Like Captian Fantastic, however, this CD in't perfect. The title track seems self absorbed and boring. The dedication to NYC, \"I Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way (NYC),\" seemed wrought out and sappy. My other criticism with this CD is it's a bit too \"polished.\" This was also true for it's original, Captian Fantastic, in my opinion. I slightly agree with a few other writers who've said this CD has a nod toward Broadway with it's neatness. Elton's been hailed as \"back to old one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's form\" for each of this past three releases, starting with \"Songs From The West Coast\" in two thousand and one, and it's follow up, \"Peachtree Road.\" I've purchased Elton John albums on their release day since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three's \"Too Low For Zero.\" This has been claimed with almost every album since then. Still, beginning in two thousand and one, E. J. started a more stripped down, basic style. I believe despite it's few shortcomings, The Captain & The Kid can stand above those efforts and equal to any Elton John album out there--with the exception of \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\" That would be a nearly impossible feat to achieve though.

Bad song, but so far, my favourite is Bob's cover. Dylan's \"Gotta Serve Somebody.\" As a Dylan fan, I have to admit that Willie's version is better than Dylan's version. So you have love and affection. Willie also won a major victory with the title \"Gravedigger.\" The video for this song is simple Another important thing to consider is the song titled \"Eternal Minute\" and \"I'm Alive.\" Nelson is there now and I am alive in this series. Even Bob Song, which I hated at first, grew up with me Yes I appreciate the folly of this song, In general, I think For this, it must be combined with Nelson's old books (such as \"The Red-haired Stranger\" and \"Stages and Stages\") so far.

{"orig_index":56104,"reviewerID":"A1WWDFQ8HSKT0","asin":"B0016B6ZKG","reviewerName":"Vincent M. Mastronardi","helpful":[8,10],"reviewText":"Some might make the argument that early on, Donna Summer was a producers muse and a voice for Girgio Moroder (as well as co-wrtier\/co-producer Pete Belotte) to use in order to release eclectic and sometimes electronic based music. Prehaps that was true in the very beginning but overtime, as a co-writer and powerful vocalist, Donna certainly put a very feminine and personal stamp on all of her albums, starting most strikingly with \"Four Seasons Of Love\" and continuing on to the blockbuster \"Bad Girls\" and until their last release as a team misunderstood (excluding \"I'm A Rainbow\") but brilliant new wave effort \"The Wanderer\". Now, in two thousand and weight, Donna once again finds the right balance between working with producers with unique ideas and being her own singer-songwriter on \"Crayons\". It is hard not to take notice of the producers (and co-writers) there since more often than not, they seem to make their impression known on the tracks. The best at just making strong pop songs with Donna, though, are Greg Kurstin and Danielle Brisebois. \"Stamp Your Feet\" is a positive upbeat pop track with good hooks and is a perfect place for Donna's voice to belt out. It's anthem like feel never feels phone, either. She is really rooting for you! Nor does Donna's strange \"accent\" on \"Crayons\" with Ziggy Marley. This blasting Reagee pop track has a catchy chorus and is very danceable. Donna and Ziggy Marley make a memorable well paced piece of music that blasts with positivity and a strong message about working toward \"one love\" and letting the \"crayons\" melt into one beautiful color. The Brazilian pop of \"Drivin' Down Brazil\", with its fun story, is strong as well. It has a nice feel of the Jobim songs she references. Not such a dream team is JR Rotem (with co-writing help from Evan Borgrat. Yep, the son of Neil Bograt, who used to be the head of Donna's seventies label, Casablanca). \"Mr. Music\" is a very simple upbeat pop song and does have a memorable chorus that would suit TV commercials. but it suffers from dull ship-hop beats and is dragged down by it's simplicity and silliness and in the moment product placement (\"Got My Ipod\/Shake My Body\"). Donna does't quite wrap on \"The Queen Is Back', but it's a strange boost track (that starts in third person narration talking about \"she\" and switches to first without explanation) that once again is dragged down by dull big beats and sound effects. They are not terrible songs but feel like an attempt to be modern yet sound very dated and childish. It's not like she is trying to be Britney, even. it's more like trying to be safe and Disney! Sebastian Arocha Morton is the mastermind along with Al Kasha as a songwriter behind \"I'm A Fire\", which is Donna's sweet spot, comfort zone, whatever. It's what you want and expect from someone who stopped making albums but continued to crank out strong club singles (including remixes of pop ballads like the Pokemon based \"Power Of One\". for an upbeat makeover on the Luther original of a similar title, \"Power Of Love\"). A chanting, catchy almost minimalist dance track that allows the \"queen\" to be a force of nature. Here, we believe in her over the top claim and she truly is a fire. It's worth looking for the import for the exclusive edition (sold at another. the initials are CC) to find the similar sounding track \"It's Only Love\" (by the same team). It's not as well structured as a song and sort of just floats as a free form poem that just grants yet it's a beautiful trip! It's Donna that is probably the reason for the differences in the tracks; the music is very similar, so it is the songwriting and performance that makes them very unique. Even though \"I'm A Fire\" only takes up one track, you can understand her reasoning for not making a full album like this. Toby Gad is a good contributor, too. \"Fame (The Game)\" combines rock clicks and stomping dance beats for a song that describes the quest for fame but unlike songs by young starlets, it's not winning but wise and introspective (talking about the movies that portrayed beauty queens like Marylin). \"Science of Love\" has a bit of a rock feel, too. It's a very well paced pop track that really understands good songwriting and Donna's vocals are impressive there as she travels through melody of the track. Tony Gad also produces to the light pop ballad \"Sand On My Feet\". This track flows and is romantic (the only song from the set were get a love song form the First Lady Of Love). It has some slightly award lyrics, though. Nathan DiGreise, a producer\/co-writer from Donna's recent past, brings us the most controversial track. \"Slide Over Backwards\" seems like it would be the basic club stopper but in fact is a funky, rocky blues based character driven piece where Donna tells a story through the created \"Hattie Mae Blanche Dubios\". It sounds laughable on the surface but much like with \"Crayons\" (the title track) and her adopting of a Jamaican (?) accent there, it manages to work. What Donna blacks in authenticity in the \"character\", she makes up with sincerity. She seems to really get into it and the funky, rollicking vocals of Donna (along with sister Mary Gaines Bernard) have fun with this track. Also contributing one track is Lester Menedez (producer\/co-writer) with Wayne Hector. It's a simple but hauntingly personal ballad titled \"Be Myself Again\", which also center around fame. It's a letdown lyrically to her Donna just bemoan fame and talk about how hard it is to be herself again and not the character. While the lyrics are a bit of a drag, its her voice and how it shifts that sells the song. Jamie Houston produces\/co-writes (with co-writer Fred Kron) the world beat driven gospel infused \"Bring Down the Reign\". This song is not over the top but a subtle song about the terrors in Darfur that works with with drum beats, a children's choir and Donna's combination of strong vocals, spoken word and chanting. It's a great powerful way to send a CD that has three songs about Donna's issues (good and bad) with being famous and shows a real social conscious. While there are some questionable moments in songs, every track works in its own way with songs like \"Stamp Your Feet\", \"I'm A Fire\", \"Crayons\" and \"Science of Love\" being dance pop classics, \"Slide Over Backwards\" is a fun experiment from the usual to even \"The Queen Is Back\" as a passable attempt to be modern. \"Crayons\", for an album that tries to be made up of different styles by using different producers, never sounds desperate. Donna works with fine people but notice there karen't any million dollar names there that could garunatee a hit single. She clicks with every person in some way (I would say Greg and Danielle the best). The album altogether is a welcome return not being a queen of the clubs but to making great albums, which is something Donna did for many years, with for without hit results. Hopefully the public will pick up on \"Crayons\" and hear an album by an artist that is often fun, sometimes introspective and compassionate about the outside world that has nothing to do with fame.","overall":5,"summary":"Donna's many colors create one strong album","unixReviewTime":1211414400,"reviewTime":"05 22, 2008"}

Now, in two thousand with difficulty, Donna once again found a good balance between collaborating with a single-minded producer and becoming her own \u201ccrayon\u201d singer-songwriter. It\u2019s hard not to notice the producers (and co-authors) where, because in general, they seem to be making an impact on the track. However, the best people to do pop songs with Donna are Greg Kurstin and Danielle Brisebois. \"Stamp On Your Feet\" is an inspiring and hopeful pop song with beautiful hooks and the perfect place to make Donna's voice shine. This is a national anthem, as if I could never hear the call. She is really happy! Donna also does't have Ziggy Marley's unusual \"crayon\". This explosive Reagee pop song has an attractive choir, ready to dance. Donna and Ziggy Marley create an unforgettable piece of music that flows smoothly, full of positive emotions and powerful messages, that is, trying to achieve \u201clove\u201d and let the \u201ccrayon\u201d blend in beautiful color. The Brazilian pop music \"Drivin 'Down Brazil\" and its fascinating story are very powerful. The song of Job that the quotes gives a wonderful feeling. JR Rotem is not such a dream team (with the help of Evan Borgrat's collaborative writing. Yes, the son of Neil Bograt, the was the head of Donna's record label for the seventys Casablanca). \"Mr. Music\" is a very simple and exciting pop song, and it has a memorable choir suitable for TV commercials. But it is influenced by the dull jump of the boat, and is dragged down by its simplicity and stupidity with the installation of the current product (\"I Got My Ipod \/ Shake My Body\"). Donna did't completely send \"The Queen is back\", but this is a strange way to move on (starting with a third-person story, talking \"about her\", and then switching to the first one without explanation), and she did it again. The rhythm pulls down, the result of sound. They\u2019re not bad songs, but they feel like they\u2019re trying to be modern, but they sound a lot older that they\u2019re kids. Even she is not trying to be Britney Spears. It's like trying to be safe with Disney! Sebastian Arocha Morton is the genius behind Al Kasha as the composer after \"I'm on Fire\", Donna's most beautiful place, comfort zone and more. This is what you want and expect you to stop making albums and continue to produce powerful club songs (including popular traditional songs, such as \"Power Of One\" based on the Pokemon. Luther's \"Power of Love\" is original. Here, we believe you are the most sought after, really hot. just but nice to go! The reason the difference in the repertoire could be Donna; the music is very similar, so the songwriting and performance make them very different. The album. Toby Gad also has a great contribution. They want fame, but it's different from the songs of the little stars, of course. Victory, but smart and sensible (talking about movies featuring beauty queens like Marilyn). The \"science of love\" also sounds powerful. It's a pop song with a very sweet rhythm, it understands very well Donna's singing voice is touching when she passes by. The song is a masterpiece. Tony Gad has also released a quick pop ballad \"Sand On My Feet\". However, it does have some songs that are a little leaky. Nathan DiGreise is the latest product of Donna People \/ co-authors, which has brought us the most controversial song. \"Slide Over Back\" seems to be the basis of the club's barrier, but it's actually a fashion driven by the characters, rock. and the work of the blues, created by Donna using \"Hattie Mae Blanche Dubios\" tells the story. Sounds ridiculous at the top, but like \"Crayon\" (title song) and this Jamaican (?) Accent there, it controls performance. Donna on \"Character\" Truth, she did it honestly. She seems to love the song very much, and Donna (and sister Mary Gaines Bernard) who is in fashion, the sweet singing voice is very interesting in this song. Wayne Hector (Wayne Hector)) Author Lester Mendez (producer \/ writer) also contributed to the song. This is a simple thing But the most memorable rumours, called \"be me again\", are also aimed at fame. For her Donna, it was embarrassing with the song, she just cried about her fame and talked about how hard it is to be her instead of the role again. Although the lyrics of the song are procrastinating, her voice and the way they change make this song the best-selling song of all time. Jamie Houston has produced \/ co-written with (and author Fred Krone) a gospel needle driven by beating the world to \"overthrow the law.\" This song is not an exaggeration, but a mysterious song about the fear of Darfur, accompanied by drums, powerful voices, spoken words and children's choir songs with Donna. This is a very powerful way to send a CD that contains three songs about Donna's famous problems (good and bad), and shows real public knowledge. Although there are some questionable moments in the song, each song has its own style, such as \"Stamp Your Feet\", \"I'm A Fire\", \"Crayons\" and \"Science of Love\" are popular dance classics. Slide Over \"Back\" is an interesting test, from the usual to the \"Queen Is Back\" try the current pass. \"Crayon\", a record that attempts to compose different styles by different producers, sounds like never There was no despair. Donna works with great people, but please note that there are no millions of dollars worth of words out there that can be single. Greet everyone in some way (I would say Greg and Danielle Best). become the queen of the club, but to make a beautiful record. That's what Donna has done for many years without success. I hope the public will take \"Crayons\" and hear the artist's album. This album is often very interesting, sometimes Understanding and empathy in an outside world that has nothing to do with fame. The main contestants for pop songs with Donna are Greg Kurstin. And Danielle Brisebois \"Stamp Your Feet\" is a hopeful and hopeful pop song with big hooks. \"is an interesting test, from the usual to\" Queen is Back \"is a current test. It was true at first, but over time, as a prolific writer and musician, Donna has undoubtedly been marked with a feminine and personal identity in all of her albums. The highlight is to start with \"Four Seasons of Love\" and then move on to the blockbuster \"Bad Girl\".

Mastronardi","helpful":[8,10],"reviewText":"Some might argue that early on, Donna Summer was a music producer and vocalist for Girgio Moroder (as well as author \/ producer Pete Belotte) who will be used to continue . release eclectic and sometimes electronic music. That may have been true in the beginning, but over time, as a writer and vocalist, Donna has certainly made a feminine and personal stamp on all of her doors, beginning with \u201cFour Seasons of Love\u201d. And continued with the blockbuster \u201cBad Girls\u201d and until the most recent release as a group they understood (except for \u201cI\u2019m Rainbow\u201d) but try the new and amazing wave \u201cThe Wanderer\u201d. Now, at two thousand and a half, Donna has once again found the right balance between working with producers with unique ideas and being her own songwriter for \u201cCrayons\u201d. It\u2019s hard not to let the producers (and co-authors) be there because often, they seem to event their feelings on the tracks. The best to talk about in Donna\u2019s hard-hitting pop songs, though, are Greg Kurstin and Danielle Brisebois. \u201cStand On Your Feet\u201d is a beautiful pop-up track with beautiful handles and the perfect place for Donna\u2019s voice to wear a belt. It\u2019s a song you don\u2019t feel on the phone. You really rose! Also Donna\u2019s amazing \u201caccent\u201d about \u201cCrayons\u201d with Ziggy Marley. Reagee pop radio has a charming chorus that is very popular. Donna and Ziggy Marley produce a well-remembered musical poem that explores the practicality and powerful message of working with \u201ca love\u201d and allows the \u201cpens\u201d to shine in a beautiful color. Brazilian pop \u201cDrivin\u2019 Down Brazil \u201dis also strong, along with its interesting story. He felt good about the Jobim songs the referred to. It\u2019s not JR Rotem\u2019s dream team (co-authored by Evan Borgrat. \u201cMr. Music\u201d is a very simple pop-up song with memorable songs suitable for TV commercials. And pulled down by this simplicity and stupidity and product placement (\u201cGot My Ipod \/ Ruck My Body\u201d). (starting with a third-person narrator talking about \u201che\u201d who first proceeded without explanation) to return the big annoying bass and sound effects. It's not a very bad song but it feels like an attempt to be modern but very historical and childish. It's not like she's trying to be Britney, though., comfort zone, everything. It's what I want and expect. you have stopped making albums but continue to make hard rock songs (including remixes of pop ballads like Pokemon based on \"Power of One\" Here, I believe him this high claim and note gang the was on fire. It\u2019s worth finding a special print download (sold to others. The first letter is CC) to get a soundtrack similar to \u201cIt\u2019s Only Love\u201d (same group). It\u2019s not structured like any other song and floating like a song in a free format it only offers but it\u2019s a beautiful journey! It was Donna who may have been due to the diversity of the streets; The music is very similar, so the songwriting and performance makes them very special. Although \u201cI\u2019m A Fire\u201d only captures one track, you can understand why it does\u2019t make an entire album like this. Toby Gad is also a great giver. \u201cFame (The Game)\u201d combines rock and roll dancers in a song that describes the search for popularity but unlike the songs of young stars, it is not winning but it is wisdom and blindness (commentary on the films shown of the queen) beauty. like Marylin). \u201cScience of Love\u201d also feels a bit rock. Very good pop song and really understands the writing of great songs and Donna\u2019s voice is very good there when it comes to the melody of the song. Tony Gad also produces the song \"Sand On My Feet\". This path flows and it is love (the only song that will come out is the love song First Lady of Love). It does have some award-winning songs, though. Nathan DiGreise, producer \/ writer from Donna recently, takes us down the most controversial path. \u201cSelf-deprecating\u201d seems to be the club\u2019s main stopper but it\u2019s really fun, rock-solid based on the character as Donna tells a story created by \u201cHattie Mae Blanche Dubios\u201d. On the surface it looks funny but identical to \u201cCrayons\u201d (track title) and with her getting a Jamaican accent (?) There, she manages to work. What obscures Donna\u2019s reality of \u201cnature\u201d, makes her honest. She seems to be really in it and Donna\u2019s interesting, quirky voices (along with her sister Mary Gaines Bernard) are fun on this path. The song also features Lester Menedez (producer \/ co-author) Wayne Hector. It\u2019s a simple but non -stop piece called \u201cBe My Own Again\u201d, which is also famous for its reputation. He enthusiastically calls Donna a bad name and talks about how hard it is to be again and not the character. Although the lyrics are quite long, this voice and how the changes that sells the song. Jamie Houston Produces \/ Writes (Written by Fred Kron) The world is beating the evangelical gospel poured out \u201cBring down the judgment\u201d. This song is not a top-down but a deceptive song about terrorists in Darfur playing drums, children\u2019s entertainment and Donna with a cloud voice, speech and songs. It\u2019s a great and powerful way to send a CD with three songs about Donna\u2019s issues (good and bad) that are popular and show real social awareness. While there are some questionable moments in the songs, each track uniquely works with songs like \u201cStamp Your Feet\u201d, \u201cI Am Naar\u201d, \u201cCrayons\u201d and \u201cScience of Love\u201d Slide Over \u201dis a fun one. experiment that comes from normal even if \"Queen is back\" in a modern attempt. \"Crayons\", for an album trying to do in different formats by different producers, never seems desperate. Donna to good people but you know there are no millions of names that can beat you.a defeat. It somehow knocked everyone out (I would say Greg and Danielle are the best) . The door is absolutely a welcome addition not to the club queen but in making great albums, which is something Donna has done for many years, without us finding effective teasers. We hope the public will pick up \u201cCrayons\u201d and hear the album artist and of often entertaining, and sometimes noticeable and sympathetic to the outside world with nothing to do with popularity.","overall":5,"summary":"Donna's many colors create one strong album","unixReviewTime":1211414400,"reviewTime":"05 22, 2008"}

Kelly fan, although I do own several of this CDs. I can honestly say that the last song that the made that I liked was \"Ignition\", and everything else was straight up crap, with Kelly trying to be a wrapper and singing about changing out in strip clubs and \"doubling up\". I mean, what the hell was that all about? Some forty-something year old guy going through a mid-life crisis for something? It was definitely a turn off to me. And Kelly using autotune?? Ugh. He can using, the did't need it! I was like, okay, that's it, this guy is done. It was nearly enough to make me forget the excellent material Kelly had turned out in previous years. No question that I gave up on this ability to produce quality music because it seemed that the was trying TOO hard to fit in with the so-called \"artists\" of today and the electronic, computerized junk they have the nerve to call \"music\"! And those allegations. well, I doubt if anyone's going to forget about that. But I've always believed that the music should speak for itself, and on Kelly's last few offerings they were't saying much, at least not anything that I wanted to hear. But on LOVE LETTER, the comes back for the fan base that the captured at the start of this career, and says, \"I haven't forgotten about myall!\" This is GROWN FOLKS MUSIC, the kind of CD that I've been waiting for YEARS for Kelly to get back to making, and the does it only as the can. I knew the had it in him, and I'm glad the got back to the kind of artistry that we expect from him. good, heartfelt R&B;, meaningful and romantic love songs, some with a cool Michael Jackson\/Marvin Gaye\/Jackie Wilson\/Sam Cooke\/Otis Redding kind of vibe to them. I could go on in naming artists, but I will just say that just about any significant R&B; male artist that has made any real impact in the industry in the past fifty years is pretty much represented there, but channelled through the genius of R. Kelly! LOVE LETTER does have an old school feel to it, so I guess that's why it appeals to me, but yet it's fresh and contemporary. Love the man for hate him, but you cannot deny this talent. This is why the IS King of R&B;, for real. Youngun's, take note, because THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE. I don't even have a favourite because all of the songs are on point. Plus there is a hidden track - Kelly's version of the hit song the wrote for MJ: \"You Are Not Alone\". It's a beautiful tribute to this \"hero\" and friend as the says in the intro of the song. For those of you who enjoyed the earlier works of Kelly, this is a CD you should definitely own. Get it, you won't be sorry! Happy New Year! P. S. - I have to add that the music for \"Music Must Be A Lady\" sounds like an EXACT duplicate of the Marvin Gaye song \"Just To Keep You Satisfied\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) from the LET'S GET IT ON album. I'm surprised that no one else noticed this, but I'm guessing that the majority of reviewers there karen't as familiar with Marvin's music as they claim to be. Let's hope Kelly worked this way around the legalities of using this tune to base this song on.","overall":5,"summary":"Back to the love songs like the Kelly we once knew!","unixReviewTime":1293667200,"reviewTime":"12 30, 2010"}

Honestly, my favourite song is \"Ignition\", everything else is nonsense, Kelly tried to be a chef, singing songs about changing clothes at string clubs and \"repeating\". I mean, what's going on there? Why is a forty-year-old going through a life crisis? This is definitely a closure for me. Kelly uses car repair? ? What. He can use it, the does't need it! I thought, well, that's it, this guy is gone. This is almost enough to make me forget about Kelly\u2019s outstanding tools over the years. I have no doubt abandoned the part of producing high-quality music, as it seems to work hard to adapt today the \"artists\" and electronic junk computer they call \"music\"! And those are the allegations. Well, I doubt anyone will never forget this. But I always believe that music should express itself. For the last few games of Kelly, they did't talk much, though it was't something I wanted to hear. But in the LOVE book, fans were caught at the beginning of the show and came back and said, \"I haven't forgotten myall!\" This is GREAT PEOPLE'S SONG, I've been waiting for Kelly to are-create the CD, and only you can do this. I know you have it, and I'm glad you brought back the kind of part we were expecting from him. Yes, R&B comes from the heart; meaningful and romantic love songs, some with the cool feel of Michael Jackson \/ Marvin Gaye \/ Jackie Wilson \/ Sam Cooke \/ Otis Redding. I would go on to call them artists, but I will only talk about all the important R&B; The male artists who have had a real impact on the industry for the past fifty years are almost represented there, but led by the expertise of R. Kelly! Love letters have an old-school feel, so I think that\u2019s what appeals to me, but it\u2019s new and modern. You love this person and hate him, but you can\u2019t deny this talent. That\u2019s why the king of R&B; really. Youngun, please pay attention, because it is done this way. I don't even have a favourite song because all the songs are good. Additionally, there is a hidden song-Kelly's hit song written by MJ: \"You're Not Alone\". As mentioned in the introduction to the song, this is a good tribute to this \"hero\" and friend. For those of you who like Kelly's work early, this is the CD you should have. You will not regret it! Happy New Year! PS-I must add that the music of \"Music Must Be A Lady\" sounds like a complete copy of Marvin Gaye's song \"Just To Keep You Satisfied\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) in LET'S GET IT. I'm surprised no one else has seen this, but I think most critics don't know Marvin's music as well as they say. Let\u2019s hope Kelly has resolved the legitimacy of using this song to make this song this way.","overall":5,"summary":"Back to the love songs like the Kelly we once knew!","unixReviewTime":1293667200,"reviewTime":"12 30, 2010"}

However (and there's no meanness intended there) - you'd have to say that their loss is very much your again - because this scaled-down reissue finally makes Mickey Newbury's extraordinary music available to us all - and at a reasonable price too - eighteen pounds\/thirty dollars for fourCDs worth. Released twenty-three August two thousand and eleven on Saint Cecelia Knows\/Mountain Retreat CEConeR - this reissue comes in a five-way foldout card-pack with cardboard-colored front artwork (instead of the black embossed original) and a curtailed booklet of twenty-four-pages (no map either).

Both \"Better Days\" and \"I Don't Want No Big City Woman\" are PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASEDPACKAGING:A fairly obvious and noticeable absence is 'artwork' - none of the three albums are pictured anywhere - even on the CDs themselves. There's a famous picture of Newbury in front of a plate glass Tiffany Lamp - that multi-coloured Tiffany Lamp theme is used for all four different picture CDs - but of course without the original artwork to reference it - they make no sense. His second and most famous album \"'Frisco Mabel Joy\" (the only one of this LPs to be given a UK release in late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one on Elektra K forty-two thousand, one hundred and five) even enjoyed the privilege of a boxed die-cut front with a lovely dinner sleeve behind it containing the lyrics - but none of that is reproduced there either. Perhaps there's licensing issues? But if you do want to know what the album covers look like and get a feel for this output - Saint Cecilia Knows are-issued the three records and the fourth \"Better Days\" rarities set on VINYL in two thousand and eleven - and all are pictured on Amazon (and available for sale). The shorter twenty-four-page booklet version has liner notes by the Producer and Compiler of the set - CHRIS CAMPION. It also reproduces Kris Kristofferson's original liner notes for Newbury's one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine debut album \"Looks Like Rain\" and an article that first appeared in the AllMusic catalogue of two thousand by BEN-FONG-TORRES. There's some photos of Newbury in the early years - this short stint with the Doo Wop group The Embers - a tour with the American Army in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty - and a gig poster from November one thousand, nine hundred and seventy where this West Coast debut performance is shared with David Steinberg at the newly opened 'The Bitter End' avenue in Santa Monica. The last few pages give detailed musician-credits on all albums and extras (Dennis Linde produced and played on \"'Frisco Mabel Joy\" - Charlie McCoy and Jimmie Haskell are on \"Heaven Help The Child\" etc). But the big news is the sound. SOUND:All of that slightly underwhelming packaging pales into the background once you start to 'listen' - because not only is the music gorgeous - this set has one the most BEAUTIFUL REMASTERS I've never heard. Each of the albums is shockingly clean - none-too-trebled for effect - just there in your speakers with truly STUNNING CLARITY. The transfers were done by JESSICA THOMPSON and STEVE ROSENTHAL and they're to be praised for their work with the tapes. MUSIC:The first LP famously features segues between the tracks of 'rainfall' lifted off the \"One Stormy Night\" LP by The Mystic Moods Orchestra - and the reproduction of it there is so good that you may double take on the weather outside. The remaster especially brings out the Dennis Wilson \"Pacific Ocean Blue\" girly vocals that punctuate so many of the songs with an almost churchlike weariness. I suppose you'd say that overall this musical style is country - but that's too limiting. Singing one moment then talking the next in that richly tonal Oregon drawl of this - there's a shimmering delicacy about the music that makes it both hurting and deeply beautiful at one and the same time. Girls leave, girls stay, hearts lift, hearts break. It's American country-rock music but with a Nick Drake sensibility. Another very real influence is Kris Kristofferson whose similar languid songwriting-style lingers in the background (Kristofferson championed Newbury at the time and has sung this songwriting genius never since). There's even the melodrama of The Walker Brothers in there too - but never too mawkish. Highlights include the beautiful ballad \"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye\" (lyrics from it title this review) and \"I Don't Think Much About Her No More\" (which feature those lovely background vocals I mentioned above). \"The Future's Not What It Used To Be\" was featured on the massive \"Forever Changes\" box set covering Elektra Records and it's huge history. The lyrics of \"Frisco Debut\" feel real - \"might as well be the moon when you're as broke as I. \" and \"when you're cold, there's nothing as welcome as sunshine. \"Writing something as rampantly patriotic and deeply Southern as \"An American Trilogy\" at a time when America was dying inside (Vietnam, Race Riots) might't have occurred to most songwriters of the day - but it did to Newbury - who stunned the Bitter End audience into silence and tears with it in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. Hearing it rescued from the very Vegas version Elvis Presley charted in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two (No. weight in the UK) is an unexpected and genuine pleasure. The remastered sound quality is gorgeous - the strings, vocals - fabulous. The near six-minute \"How Many Times (Must The Piper Be Paid For His Song)\" is beautifully arranged with acoustic guitars and that \"look away Dixie\" vibe to the melody. By the time the got to \"Good Morning Dear\" and \"Song For Susan\" on the threerd album \"Heaven Help The Child\" - the combo of piano, vocals and strings had become almost an artful signature style of this - and so impressive. A slight remake of \"San Francisco Mabel Joy\" finishes the album with rainfall, acoustic guitars and wailing steam trains in the distance - and you're reminded so much of England's Nick Drake and this perfect three albums on Island Records - \"Five Leaves Left\" (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine), \"Bryter Layter\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) and \"Pink Moon\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two) - Newbury's own \"American Trilogy\" should be just as revered - and is just as good. I had thought the fourth disc would be filler - but it's not. The publishing demos are mostly Newbury singing at piano with some light band accompaniment and are very pretty. \"Good Morning Dear\" alone was recorded by huge names like Ray Charles and Roy Orbison. Best of all is the Radio Session for KBHM - which is missy - but with acoustic guitar and voice to the fore - is so wonderfully intimate. And many of the songs like \"Sad Satin Rhyme\" and \"I Don't Wanna Rock\" are not on the other albums. \"Better Days\" itself is as lovely a song as any penned by more famous luminaries - and a genuine previously unreleased gem. To sum up - \"An American Trilogy\" is an embarrassment of riches - and at last its pitched at a price music-lovers can afford.

Maybe there is a licensing issue? But if you really want to know what an album cover looks like and feel the results - Saint Cecilia Knows has released three albums and a fourth album \"Best Days\" released on VINYL in two thousand and eleven - and both are on Amazon (available for sale ). The twenty-four-page booklet contains lining notes provided by CHRIS CAMPION, the producer and editor of the list. It has also released an overview of the original line-up by Kris Kristofferson of Newbury's one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine debut album \"Looks Like Rain\" and BEN-FONG-TORRES 'first appearance on AllMusic's two, zero-page album catalog. There are first photos of Newbury - a short collaboration with the Doo Wop band Embers - a tour with the US Army in nine hundred and sixty at one thousand - and a poster poster in November one hundred thousand, nine hundred and seventy. This West Coast premiere will be in Saint-Muni Share with David Steinberg at the newly opened \u201cBitter End\u201d on the boulevard. The last few pages give details of the music credits of all albums and extras (Dennis Linde produced and starred in \"'Frisco Mabel Joy\" - Charlie McCoy and Jimmie Haskell in \"Heaven Help The Child\" etc.). But the big news is the word. Sound: Once you start \"listening\", all these little packed little things will be covered in the back - because it's not just good music - this set has the best production I've never heard. Each album is very clean \u2014 with the exception of high-quality effects \u2014 right on your speakers, clearly visible. Submissions are made by JESSICA THOMPSON and STEVE ROSENTHAL, and their work on tape will be praised. Music: The first LP is famous for the transition between \"rain\" songs in Mystic Moods Orchestra's \"One Stormy Night\" LP - and it performs very well there, and you can be affected by the weather without the influence of Two. The revised version brings even more of Dennis Wilson's daughter \"Pacific Blue\", which adorns many songs with church-like annoyance. I think you could say that in general this kind of music is country style - but this is very strict. Sing for a moment, then speak for the next moment in the rich tones of Oregon - the music has a pure appeal that makes it ugly and beautiful. The girl left, stayed the girl, refreshed and broke. This is American rock music, but with the feeling of Nick Drake. Another real influence is Kris Kristofferson, who has a style of writing similar to the loneliness that lives in secrecy (Kristofferson was involved in Newbury at the time and has not sung the song of this design trick never since). There\u2019s also a Walker Brothers melodrama \u2014 but it\u2019s never too dull. Highlights include beautiful folk songs \"He Woke Me Up To Speak Good\" (words from this review) and \"I don't think much of him\" \"The future is not what it used to be\" appeared on a large scale \"Eternal Transformation\" set of Elektra records. This is a big flower. The words \"Frisco Debut\" feel real - \"When you're crazy like me, it could be a month.\" And \"When it's cold, there's nothing as popular as sunlight.\" Writing Patriotic and Popular Deep down In the South as the \"American Trilogy\" was dying inside the United States (Vietnam, ethnic turmoil), most songwriters at the time could not have imagined it - but Newbury did - it shocked the audience on Bitter End Silence and the tears were nineteen thousand. . one hundred and seventy. Hearing it delivered in Elvis Presley's Las Vegas version in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two (ranked eighth in the UK) was a real surprise. The revised sound quality has great strings, great voices. For almost six minutes \"How many times (the microphone must pay for this song)\" is carefully tuned with an acoustic guitar, and the song exudes the spirit of \"don't look at Dixie\". When \"Good Morning\" and \"Susan's Song\" from the third album \"Heaven Help a Child\" came out - a combination of piano, vocals and strings almost became this kind of brilliant technique - it was a deep and interesting look. A small portrait of \"San Francisco Mabel Joy\", complete with a raincoat, sound guitar and steam train from a distance - you'll think of England's Nick Drake and these three perfect albums on the Island Record - \"Five Leaves Remaining\" \"(one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine),\" Bright Wright \"( one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) and \"Pink Moon\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two) - -Newbury's \"American Trilogy\" should be equally respected - and equally good. I thought the fourth disk would be filled - but it was't. Most of Newbury\u2019s published demos using on the piano, and the accompanying light band, is very beautiful. Only \"Good Morning Dear\" was written by big names like Ray Charles and Roy Orbison. The best part is KBHM's Radio Session \u2014 which is a young lady - but with a cloud guitar and vocals - is very close. Many songs such as \"Sad Satin Rhyme\" and \"I Don't Want Werwala\" did not appear on other albums. The \"better days\" itself are as popular as a song written by a famous celebrity - and another real treasure that can be unleashed. All in all \u2014 the \u201cAmerican Trilogy\u201d is a shame of wealth \u2014 it was finally founded at a price that music lovers can afford. Even if Newbury is unfamiliar to you - this is one of the times you should take advantage of this opportunity - because quality is a pleasure for a penny. It is a recovery of an amazing time. Very well done for all participants.","overall":5,"summary":"\"...Just Like The Dawn...My Heart Is Silent Breaking...\"","unixReviewTime":1339027200,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2012"}
