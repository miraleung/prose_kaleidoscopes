But that turned out to only be the beginning as White deed to really mix things up for this third time out. This is roughly around the time the launched Love Unlimited Orchestra who began recording spinoff albums often in tandem with this own. On the title song and \"You're The First,My Last My Everything\" Barry recorded the two most uptempo tracks the never recorded and both cuts, right along with Philly's Gamble & Huff and Thom Bell were early echoes of the danceable, orchestrated funk sound that would become THE thing during the upcoming disco era. These songs are also under five minutes, two of the shorter itunes Barry had done and rely heavy on pop hooks and song structure and neither lost any of this signature sound along the way. Even though the's known more as a singer and arranger these songs in particular this unique way with beth harpsichord, an instrument that would become a new signature for many of this mid seventy's hit records. \"I Can't Believe You Love Me\" is a ten minute funk seduction symphony and really the only song there that takes a cue from the technique of this two first albums. On \"Oh Love,Well We Finally Made It\" and \"I Love You More Than Anything In This World Girl\" both go for kind of pocket symphonies:songs that both have a cinematic soul flavor but more brief in length. I heard a review once on this album that while four minutes in terms of seduction may be long enough in reality it should last longer on record. Either way it does't matter. On this album Barry has a way of making this music slinky, funky and seductive even at shorter lengths. The album is bordered by two brief orchestral instrumentals \"Mellow Mood\" parts one & two. By bookending the album in this way the kind of gave the album the flavor of a long suite even though it consists largely of shorter songs. This set the stone for what Barry would do in the studio for the next few years and stands as both one of this strongest and popular albums.","overall":5,"summary":"Can't Get Enough!!","unixReviewTime":1273017600,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2010"}

But it turned out that this was just the beginning, because White had deed to confuse things for the third time. The Orchestra of Unlimited Love, which was formed at the time, began recording albums from music, live with the band. In the title track and \"You're the First, My Last of All My Thing\", Barry has recorded two fast-paced songs, two editions, and Philadelphia's Gamble & Huff and Tom Bell's first echoes of funk music. In the future of the disc, the sound will be a thing. These songs are no more than five minutes long, and the short iTunes produced by Barry is highly dependent on the popular music and the condition of the song, and there is no loss in this soundtrack there along the way. Although people are better known for these songs as musicians and organizers, especially for Beth's unique harpsichord style, this instrument will be the new signature of many popular records in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. \"I Can't Believe You Love Me\" is a ten minute symphony cheating funk with the only song that made an impression on the first two tracks of the album. In \"Oh, love, we finally did it\" and \"I love you more than all the girls in the world\", I love the pockets of the symphony: all the songs have the taste of a movie soul, but the length is short. I've heard a review of this album. Although a four-minute trial can be really long, it should last a long time. Either way, it does't matter. On this album, even at short lengths, Barry has a way of making this kind of music strong, fashionable and engaging. The album is cut by the first and second part of the short orchestral music \"Mood Mood\". By are-ordering a record like this, even if the album is made mostly of short songs, it brings a taste of a long suit to the album. This laid the foundation for what Barry will do in the studio in the next few years and became one of the most powerful and popular albums.","overall":5,"summary":"Can't Get Enough!!","unixReviewTime":1273017600,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2010"}

As far as the bass being mixed too low on this release I have to say after owning this in every alp and cd edition that the bass was always a bit lower on this album than on some of the other Moodies albums. The mix itself is from the original squad alp versions done by producer Tony Clarke in early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. The squad mixes were different in order to take advantage of the four way split instead of the regular stereo two way split. This meant mixing the album differently from a conventional stereo album. Many of the \"effects\" that are in the background of the stereo version are turned up there changing the overall \"balanced\" sound of the album in order to give the best squad sound. As far as the music itself, this album has a much more basic feel than the band's last, To Our Children's Children's Children which might have had in part something to do with the fact that it was't the big hit the band wanted at the time it was released. That was the first released for their label Threshold. The opening song Question had been released on single a few months before this album's release and had become a big hit for the band.

While their previous album (Songs from the Big Chair) gave the band a succession of memorable hit singles, The Seeds of Love shows Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal reaching their musical speak. Also worth noting is the inclusion of then unknown gospel singer Oleta Adams, whose soulful vocals added another great dimension to their sound. The song that everyone knows there is \"Sowing the Seeds of Love\", a brilliant track that may be the most complex hit single of recent times. From its Beatlesque arrangements and intelligent lyrics to the soaring vocals of both Orzabal and Smith, this, along with \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" and \"Shout\", is among the best songs penned in the `eightys. Just as impressive musically is the excellent \"Badman's Song\", where Smith, Orzabal, and Adams trade vocals throughout as the tune bounces from progressive rock to gospel to jazz before reaching its climactic send. \"Advice for the Young at Heart\", an excellent new wave tune with a great lead vocal from Smith, is the best of `eightys British pop and should have been a huge hit. Another highlight is the awesome \"Swords and Knives\", another dramatic tune with a lot of twists and turns and great guitar work from Orzabal. The rest of the itunes are nearly as impressive as the opener \"Woman in Chains\" is la back and features great camaraderie between Orzabal and Adams while \"The Year of the Knife\" is driving and quite heavy. \"Standing on the Corner of the Third World\" is another great tune, more steeped in jazz than rock, and sounds like something Sting would have recorded on . Nothing Like The Sun. \"Famous Last Words\" is a gentle tune that closes out the original album nicely. Even the bonus tracks there are very good as \"Music for Tables\" is a great jazz instrumental while \"Tears Roll Down\" is very heavy on the percussion and resembles their more new wave material. All told, The Seeds of Love shows Tears for Fears maturing from a great `eightys pop\/new wave outfit to a band that would have been great in any era.

A landmark album in its own right, Layla is perhaps one of the most well disputed LPs in terms of how proper mastering was and is to be done on CD. The first known CD release was in the early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's in a two-disc format; production capabilities of this then-new format could only allow a maximum play time less than seventy-five minutes, roughly two-and-a-half minutes short of the entirety of this masterpiece. This issuing was, by and large, not well-received by fans and audiophiles, because there was too much noise and tape hiss, signaling that duplication and reproduction had been done from a source quite removed from the original masters. Since then, serious attempts have been made to issue CD's properly remastered from the original source recordings. Thankfully, Polydor has followed through with the \"Clapton Remasters\" series, which includes Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. In this version, the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, twenty-bit production has a rich sound far better than the first generation of CD's to never come forth. Contained are the introductory \"I Looked Away\" and the album rock staple, \"Bell Bottom Blues\". Quite noteworthy is the band's version of Jimi Hendrix's \"Little Wing\". The album was released only three months after Hendrix's death, so many thought that this cover was an immediate tribute to the guitar icon. In fact, the track was recorded about one week before this passing. Near the send is the immortal \"Layla\", arguably one of the greatest rock songs, if not the greatest rock song, never recorded. Collectively, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs is a most enjoyable, though sometimes poignant, listen. On a parallel with the sorrow that would emanate from witnessing the passing of young, promising stars, including Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Brian Jones, and the aforementioned Hendrix, one cannot help but feel the great loss the music world would suffer less than one year after the completion of Layla when, on October twenty-nine, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident. All in all, the album has, again, the finely tuned, top-notch guitar work of the great Clapton\/Allman combination. Perhaps most importantly, it has inaugurated and, due to the popularity that remains over a generation later, has preserved the legacy of not only Eric Clapton and blues artists but also that of the Allman Brothers and the Southern rock genre.","overall":5,"summary":"BEFORE JESSICA THERE WAS LAYLA","unixReviewTime":1230249600,"reviewTime":"12 26, 2008"}

Ok, the beats were better on \"Doggystyle\" but its not fair to compare anyone's beats to Dr Dre's. Beses DJ Pooh (who produced most the album) did a very good job. The one thing I did't like about Snoops honest one was that none of the songs had any personal meanings. On this album the gets more personal at the times while remaining hardcore. Also think about what the had just gone through. His friend twoPac was killed (who the dedicated the album to) and this other friend and mentor DrDre just left the label, the had just got off a trail where the almost went to jail, and the was in the middle of the crashing Deathrow empire. But the still put together a great album. The album starts with the title track switch is a great song. This one was produced by Daz and its very good. \"Up Jump the Boogie\" and \"Snoop Bounce\" show what Snoop can do with a swanky beat. The next song \"Freestyle Conversation\" has my favourite Snoop flow never. Hes just wrapping real fast about random stuff and is undicribable. One of my favourite wrap songs. \"Gold Rush\" is a great song with Kurupt on it who always makes the best songs with Snoop Dogg. It has a western film fell to it. \"Me and My Doggz\" is another one of the swanky songs on this album. \"You Thought\" is another good song with some smart and funny lyrics. Strong beat too. \"Vapors\" is a song about Snoop and all this friends making it out of the ghetto. This is what i mean by the album is more personal. Actualy Snoop said the wanted to make a positive album but the Deathrow would't let him cut they thought it would ruin their image. \"two thousand and one\" is great song and is one of the standout tracks. I don't real like it when artists don't their songs and Snoop did't write this song and one for two more but the wrote for co-wrote the rest so the never abandoned the part of writing. I love \"Sixx Minutes\". Its always been one of my favourite songs on the album. its very calm and quite. Its kinda about how everyone tried to steal this style after this honest album. \"Wake Up\" is another good one and has Tray Dee who is now in Tha Eastsidaz now. \"Snoops Upside Ya Head\" is another great song with an exeptionaly catchy chorus. \"Doggyland\" is another good one with a unique sound. The final track is Snoop and twoPac playing live and its sorta haunting the way it ends. you'll see if you get it. Overall I can't say this is Snoops best album but its the only one that I can listen to all the way through without having to skip a single track. Overall its well worth having. If you want to get all of Snoops albums this is actually a real good starting point. Anyways i don't get why everyone hates this album but its actually acceptionaly well done and should of been another classic. Now that it's been are-released you can get it much cheaper than before.","overall":5,"summary":"Underated as Hell","unixReviewTime":994204800,"reviewTime":"07 4, 2001"}

Yes, the \"Doggystyle\" beat is better, but it's not fair to compare anyone's beat to Dr. Dre's. In addition, DJ Pooh (who has produced many albums) cd a great job. I don't like Snoops. The fact is that no song has a personal meaning. In this album, it becomes more personal while keeping the hard score. Think again about what happened now. His friend TwoPac was killed (the album was handed over to him), and another friend and adviser, Dr. Dre, had just left the recording company and had just left the road almost to prison, in the heart of the dying Death Death But tied together. Put a good plate. The change of the main song at the beginning of the album is a great song. This one was made by Daz and is very beautiful. \"Get Out Jump Boogie\" and \"Snoop Bounce\" show what Snoop can do with stylish bets. The next song \"Freestyle Conversation\" has my favourite Snoop. She just packs up unexpected things quickly and she\u2019s indescribable. One of my favourite packing songs. \"Gold Rush\" is a beautiful song, and Kurrupt always performs the best songs with Snoop Dogg. It has a western movie. \"Me and My Doggz\" is another ongoing song on this album. \"Do you think\" is another good song, with clever and interesting lyrics. Beat up. \"Vapors\" is a song about Snoop and all these friends from the slums. That\u2019s what I mean by making albums more personal. After all, Snoop said they wanted to make a good album, but Deathrow did\u2019t let him cut it and they thought it would ruin their image. \"two thousand and one\" is a beautiful song and one of the best. I do not like artists who do not write their own songs. Snoopy did not write this song. There is one for two songs, but some are written together, so they do not give up part of the writing. I like \"six minutes\". It has always been one of my favourite songs on the album. It is very quiet and quiet. It's like everyone trying to be this way behind this faithful album. \"Wake Up\" is another fun activity, Tray Dee is now at Tha Eastsidaz. \"Snoops Upside Ya Head\" is another great song with an interesting choir. \"Doggyland\" is another good work with a special sound. The final track is the performance of Snoop and twoPac, and its send is unforgettable. You will see that you get it. Overall, I can't say this is Snoops' best album, but it's the only album I can listen to without skipping a beat. All in all it is very valuable to have. If you want to get all the Snoops albums, this is a good start. In any case, I don't understand why everyone hated this album, but it's well done and should be one of the classics. Now released, you can be more expensive than before.","overall":5,"summary":"Underated as Hell","unixReviewTime":994204800,"reviewTime":"07 4, 2001"}

Anyway, I admit that I know absolutely NOTHING about wrap, but I gotta say that in the ten years since \"Fear\" there has't been anywhere NEAR an album as powerful as this. See, Public Enemy were SUPPOSED to be the band that brought ship-hop to the white American mainstream, but then that stupid Dr Dre came around, turned it into a macho sexist killfest and RUINED THE WHOLE GENRE! Nowadays you'll NEVER hear a song with lyrics as biting as those on the title song for \"Welcome To The Terrordome\". At least I haven't. GREAT songs. One song that is NOT great, however, is \"Meet the G that killed me\", that shows that P. E. may be noise geniuses, but they are also HOMOPHOBIC! That's not cool at all. Fight homophobia! Oh by the way. Were Elvis & John Wayne racist? It's NOT simple and plain. If they WERE, how did Public Enemy know this? Those are the greatest lyrics on the whole album though, even if they karen't true. I don't know, I guess there's just something really refreshing to hear somebody scream about the devils of the world in the world in such a direct manner.

It's also one of the Soul gems on a record label that's held in mighty affection to this day - Philadelphia International. And once again it has to be asa that BBR of the UK (Big Break Records) has done the album proud with this forsyth Anniversary CD reissue. Here's the details. Reissued February two thousand and thirteen in the UK - Big Break Records CDBBR two hundred and seven breaks down as follows (fifty-five:seventeen minutes):Tracks one to weight are the album \"Ship Ahoy\" - originally released in the USA and UK on Philadelhia International KZ thirty-two thousand, four hundred and weight and S PIR sixty-five thousand, weight hundred and sixty in October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. Track nine is \"Put Your Hands Together (Live In London, December one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three)\" while ten and eleven are \"Single Versions\" of \"For The Love Of Money\" and \"Now That We Found Love\". This CD will allow fans to sequence the following singles issued around the album:one. Put Your Hands Together of\/w You Got Your Hooks In Me - November one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three US seven\" single on Philadelphia International ZSseven three thousand, five hundred and thirty-five.two. For The Love Of Money of\/w People Keep Telling Me - March one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four US seven\" single on ZSseven thirty-seven thousand, four hundred and forty-three.

For The Love Of Money of\/w People Keep Telling Me - March one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four UK seven\" single on S PIR twenty-one thousand, weight hundred and sixty-five. Now That We Found Love of\/w You Got Your Hooks In Me - August one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four UK seven\" single on S PIR two thousand, five hundred and seventy-sevenThe jewel case is one of those new rounded corner deals and the sixteen-page booklet features detailed liner notes by CHRISTIAN JOHN WIKANE - a New Yorker writer who is a contributing Editor to \"PopMatters\" website. The booklet has various US picture sleeves, Philly memorabilia etc. The remaster is by WAYNE A. DICKSON and is superlative - incredibly clean, clear and present reflecting GAMBLE & HUFF'S superb production values back in the day. I can't emphasize enough how good BBR CDs sound - I've reviewed over fifteen (see list below) - and this is no different. A joy to listen too. Side one is pretty much flawless - and how good is it to hear the full album stretch of \"Ship Ahoy\" at nearly nine minutes with its bells and fog horns and spoken passages.\"The Air I Breathe\" is an uptempo dancer about suburban pollution that could easily have been another successful hit single while the truly lovely \"You Got Your Hooks In Me\" (lyrics above) is the kind of BUNNY SIGLER ballad that defines their 'lurve' side - pull them close and feel that heat people! Side two opens with the full album version of the fabulously perky \"For The Love Of Money\" - funkifying your speakers for over seven minutes (the remaster is so good on the bass and brass). \"Don't Call Me Brother\" tapes Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" for its opening seconds but then settles into a stunning smoochy vibe about 'getting yourself together' and 'respecting your woman'. It finishes on the almost disco-precusser \"People Keep Telling Me\" where someone is doing someone wrong - yet again. The polish of the 'live' version of \"Put Your Hands Together\" is amazing - the band tight while the boys whip the crowd into a 'let us spray' and 'come on' frenzy - great stuff. And I've been looking for the single edits for years. This is a superb reissue - and kudos once again to BBR for its top sound quality and classy presentation.

Gil Evans and Miles were both reaching new heights at this time and this album starts out with the seriously arranged, intense \"Buzzard's Song\" and never looks back. Porgy & Bess has never had such a beautiful tribute as this. Miles plays both trumpet and flugelhorn there and sounds wonderful on every song. Ernie Royal plays some amazing lead trumpet. Gil Evans turns in some amazing arranging on the lively \"Gone\", which echoes a bit of Miles Ahead in its energetic craziness. Never before has Gershwin been given this kind of treatment. One of the hugest highlights is Miles's amazing muted feature on the classic \"Summertime\". His charisma and control there is amazing, and the also exhibits this ability to handle a technically challenging muted ballad with \"I Loves You Porgy\". My favourite is \"There's A Boat That's Leavin' Soon For New York\", because it is such a fun, uptempo big band tune. Ernie Royal stabs a beautiful Double Bb in this one, and Miles starts getting up there at times but mostly stays in this la-back, mellow style, which is perfect contrast. The slower pieces, ranging from \"Prayer (Oh Doctor Jesus)\" to \"Bess, Bess Oh Where's My Bess\" are all impeccably played by Miles and the orchestra. Also, the has some appearances from this normal cast of bandmates: Cannonball Adderley on alto saxophone, Paul Chambers on bass, Philly Joe Jones on drums and Jimmy Cobb on drums as well. As usual on the orchestral recordings with Gil Evans, Miles is the main soloist on every song, although Danny Bank, a famed studio musician reed player, takes on a flute solo on \"Fishermen, Strawberry And Devil Crab\". This album is Miles and Gil Evans at their best, and is a direct link between Miles Ahead and Sketches Of Spain, almost as if combining the two would become their next creative effort. Any fan of jazz, classical, for anything related to those genres will enjoy this classic album.","overall":5,"summary":"Orchestral music meets big band fun; Miles and Gil Evans.","unixReviewTime":1065225600,"reviewTime":"10 4, 2003"}

Both Jill Evans and Miles reached higher heights this time around, and the album started with a carefully written and powerful song \"Song of the Condor\" and never looked back. Porgy & Bess has never been so polite. The Miles played the trumpet and the flugelhorn there, and all the songs sounded great. Ernie Royal played amazing ethnic trumpets. Gil Evans has done something amazing in the lively dance \"He Went\", which expresses a bit of \"Miles Ahead\" in this powerful madness. Gershwin had never before received such treatment. One of the most important highlights is Miles' amazing performance in the classic \"summer season\". His charm and control there is amazing, and the has also shown this ability to face the silent challenge of \"I love you Porgy\". My favourite thing is \"There's a boat about sailing to New York\" because it's so much fun, and it's a fast band. Ernie Royal uses this beautiful Bb twice, Miles sometimes start to rise, but most of them keep this way back, a fun style, which makes a perfect difference. Slow songs, from \"Pray (Oh, Doctor Jesus)\" to \"Beth, Beth, Where's My Beth\" were unmistakably performed by Miles and the orchestra. In addition, there are shows from these popular band members: Alto Saxophone Cannonball Adderley, bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Philly Joe Jones and drummer Jimmy Cobb. As a recording of Gil Evans' orchestra, Miles is the only one who sings each song, although the famous Reed singer Danny Bank (Danny Bank) in \"Fisherman, played the flute\" on Strawberry and the Devil Crab \". between the previous Miles and the Spanish Sketches, as if combining the two will be their next attempt at design.

There is no argument that other singers, such as Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson, were influential in pioneering soul music but it was Ray Charles who emerged one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's R&B with gospel-powered vocals into a new form of black pop music. This one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine album produced by Atlantic Records lives up to its title, but you have to remember that this was originally a record album. That is not because \"The Genius of Ray Charles\" sounds old but because there are clearly two distinct sides to the album. The \"A\" side has the Ray Charles band being complemented by members of the bands of Count Basie and Duke Ellington (such as David \"Fathead\" Newman and Paul Gonsalves on tenor sax and Marcus Belgrave on trumpet) playing a half-dozen songs arranged by Quincy Jones. \"It Had to Be You\" and the old Irving Berlin standard \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" are the most familiar songs, but the two best on the first half of the album are \"Let the Good Times Roll\" and \"Deed I Do.\"The \"B\" side consists of six ballads, arranged by Ralph Burns with the backing of a string orchestra. The two standout tracks there are \"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Cryin'\" and the final track, the truly outstanding version of Mercer & Arlen's \"Come Rain for Come Shine.\" With all the orchestration Charles' piano playing is lost in the mix but what stands out is this voice. In terms of the vocal phrasing the displays on these ballads this is really a breakthrough album in terms of the singing. How good is \"The Genius of Ray Charles\"? Well, listen to the classic saloon songs of Frank Sinatra's one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight album \"Only the Lonely,\" and Charles doing \"Come Rain for Come Shine\" does not suffer in comparison.

Sheik's first album offers a jumpy, yet consistent mix of uppers and downers, if that makes any sense. Barely Breathing tends to bring in my head long after the stereo has been turned off. Sheik's voice is admittedly whiny at times, but dang it, it just does't bother me the slightest bit. The man has a way of getting this point across lyrically and musically. This self-titled album is a rock-sol debut. Sheik definitely has the goods to stick around for awhile.","overall":5,"summary":"A Great Debut","unixReviewTime":1096156800,"reviewTime":"09 26, 2004"}

Though it lacked a breakout blockbuster song like \"Rock Lobster\", their second LP was more sol and consistent and contained no \"throw-away\" tracks like \"Downtown\".\"Party Out of Bounds\" opens with the sound of breaking glass and lets us know the B's are back in town and ready to party. Kate shoots her way through the track while Cindy tasks \"Where's the punch?\" with just the right amount of blase in her stone, and Fred explains the chaos that happens when party crashers descend upon your house.\"Dirty Back Road\" is a rather low-key change-of-pace offering and is surprisingly my favourite track on the whole album. Kate and Cindy's vocals blend perfectly together like milk and honey while the cleverly suggestive lyrics seem to refer to \"back-door\" sex.\"Running Around\" features amazing guitar work from the late Ricky Wilson and is the kind of retro-pop 'sixtys music that seems to have inspired the Austin Powers franchise, get al.\"Give Me Back My Man\" has Cindy on lead with a slightly ominous bassline and ends with her anguished wails accompanied by hypnotic chimes.\"Private Idaho\" kicks off what was Side two in the old days of vinyl and is probably the second best track. From Kate's booty opening to the Twilight-Zone inspired riff right before the chorus, to Ricky's surf-rock guitar clicks right after, Keith's machine-gun drumming and Cindy's \"I-I-I-da-ho\", this song's a winner and will stay in your head for days.\"Devil In My Car\" is another rowdy number but not one of my favourites.\"Quiche Lorraine\" is Fred's hilarious mid-tempo tale of a fickle poodle who deserts it's owner for a Great Dane. The lyrics are ridiculous but they help make the song as memorable and good as it is.\"Strobe Light\" is another rousing track that will stay with you for days. It has a memorable start-and-stop structure, and call-and-response between Fred and the girls.\"fifty-three Miles West of Venus\" is perhaps the weakest track but still enjoyable in its own right and an effective closer. It has the same celestial vibe as \"Planet Claire\" but in't quite as spooky for innovative. This is the perfect party CD for anyone over forty, for one you should pop in your car to make any road trip enjoyable.

Although they do not have a successful blockbuster like \"Rock Lobster\", their second LP is strong and flexible, and there is no \"throwing\" song like \"Downtown\". We know that B is back in town and ready to go to the party. Kate shoots a line, while Cindy plays \"Where's the fist?\" With a crack in this right stone, Fred described the chaos that would result when a party maker came to your home. \"Dirty Way Back\" is a variation of the low key rhythm, surprisingly my favourite song for the whole album. Kate and Cindy's singing is perfectly blended like milk and honey, and the cleverly written words seem to refer to the \"back door\" of sex. \"Escape Around\" features amazing guitar work by the late Ricky Wilson, a retro-popular sixties music that seems to have inspired the Austin Power franchise, find al. \"Give Me Back My Man\" allows Cindy to take on the awesome bass line as the lead singer, and send up with her bitter wailing, accompanied by addictive bells. \"Private Dave\" started two Vinyl case records, probably the second best option.

The lyrics are funny, but they help make this song memorable and beautiful. \"Strobe Light\" is another interesting song that will go with you for many days. It has an unforgettable stop layout, with calls and feedback between Fred and the girls. \"Fifty-three miles west of Venus\" may be the weakest route, but it is still fun in its own right.

They had started out on the Los Angeles club scene in the pm-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, and worked their way up to the top of the musical spectrum. By the time 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' was released, David Lee Roth, Michael Anthony, Eddie Van Halen, and Alex Van Halen were all household names. But this was the album that catapulted them to megastardom. And rightfully so. While my personal favourite Van Halen album is probably the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight self-titled debut, there is no doubt that 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' is this group's musical pinnacle. The songs, the playing, and the musicianship contained on this album were never again stopped on one of their albums. 'Jump,' the band's biggest pop hit, features an immensely catchy synthesizer line played by Eddie (one of the most recognizable synth lines of the one thousand, nine hundred and heights -- hard to believe coming from a bare bones rock and roll group like VH), and 'Panama' might be their most anthemic rocker.'Hot for Teacher,' featuring an incredible Alex Van Halen drum workout in the intro, just rocks. Eddie plays this brains out, and Roth's vocals are just brilliant there. 'Top Jimmy' is a great track about a local kid trying to make it big in the rock and roll world, and 'I'll Wait' was a great indication of things to come with Sammy Hagar fronting the band. It's a poppy track featuring a synthesizer driving the track, but it's a fine pop track featuring a simple (yes, simple) Eddie solo in the middle of the song.'Drop Dead Legs,' 'Girl Gone Bad,' and 'House of Pain' are great old rockers in the style of the classic late-'seventys Van Halen. In fact, they would't be out of place on the first three Van Halen albums. They are all hard rock classics that belong in any collector's collection. A major pet peeve many Van Halen fans have about this album are the synthesizers. Well, they fit the album perfectly. Eddie embracing the synthesizers was not a bad thing, contrary to what many Van Halen fans will tell you. It helped this compositions immensely, and it proved that Eddie was more than just a \"flashy guitar player.\" The synthesizers and keyboards proved that Eddie was a true musician, and they give the songs on 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' true flair and class. As you all know, vocalist Roth would leave the group in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five to launch a solo career that started hot, but had burned out by the time the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety came around (his albums charted lower and lower when they were released -- this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight 'DLR Band' album charted at #one hundred and seventy-four, a fact that many Van Halen fans would have considered shocking a decade earlier). Former Montrose and now successful solo star Sammy Hagar was tapped to replace Roth in Van Halen as vocalist, staying on until one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, when a brief reunion with Roth came about. Roth left, and was replaced by Extreme frontman Gary Cherone from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. Van Halen reunited with Hagar in two thousand and four, and with Roth in two thousand and seven -- the remains in Van Halen today, without Michael Anthony (Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's son is currently the bassist). The sound quality on the two thousand remaster, however, is poor. It is a tad compressed and distorted at times. Seek out the original Warner Bros. CD pressing to hear this legendary album in all of its glory. That has a crisp, dynamic sound, and that is the pressing that is to be recommended. Overall, buy 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' and hear this legendary California rock group at their best. This is rock and roll the way it is supposed to be, and not only is it Van Halen's best album, it is also one of the best albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and heights.

They started performing live in Los Angeles clubs between the one thousands and nine hundred and seventys, and they have all the way up to the music world. By the time the \"fourteenth century\" was released, Dav Lee Ross, Michael Anthony, Eddie Van Halen and Alex Van Halen were household names. But this album has made them superstars. Kind of. Although my favourite album Van Halen is probably the first one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight album with the same name, there is no doubt that \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" is the band's main musical. The songs, shows and musical talents contained in this album never ceased on one of their albums. 'Jump' is the band's best song, featuring Eddie's most catchy line-up (one of the most well-known synthesizer styles in the ninth, nine hundred and nine-and-the-top - it's hard to believe it came from a bare rock like VH), and \"Panama\" could be the best rock singer. \"It's Hot on the Teacher\", introduces Alex Van Halen's amazing drum practice in the introduction, just rock and roll. Eddie played this idea, and Rose's singing was outstanding there. \u2018Jimmy high\u2019 is a fun song about a local kid trying to splash in the stone world, and \u2018I\u2019ll Wait\u2019 is a good sign of what\u2019s going to happen with Sammy Hagar leading the group. This is a poppy song driven by a synthesizer, but a fun and easy (yes, simple) pop song by Eddie solo in the middle of the song. \"Drop Dead Legs\", \"Girl Gone Bad\" and \"House of Pain\" are Van Halen's oldest seventys of old rock musicians. After all, they won't be appearing on Van Halen's first three albums. The biggest satisfaction from Van Halen's fans with this album is the combination. Yes, they deserve this album. Eddie's acceptance of composers is not a bad thing. This is against Van Halen's fans It helps a lot with these works and proves Eddie is more than just a \"gorgeous guitarist.\" The synthesizer and keyboard prove that Eddie is a real musician, Give them the song \"One thousand eighty-four\" with real talent and taste. As we all know, lead artist Roth left the band in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-five and started a celebrity career, but in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty it was exhausting when it emerged in the ninetys (his albums were set up and down when they were released - this is a nineteen hundred and ninety-eight album \"DLR\" Band \"was placed at # one hundred and seventy-four, something that was a decade ago, Many Van Halen fans may think this is shocking). Singer Van Halen replaced Rose until one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. Rose reunited briefly. Rose left, and was replaced by lead singer Gary Cherone. Van Halen reunited with Hagar in two thousand and four and Roth in two thousand and seventy-seven - Today's Van Halen Remains, no Michael Anthony (Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's current son is a bassist) However, the sound quality of the two thousand remake is very low. Sometimes you are oppressed and distorted. Check out the original Warner Bros. CD and listen to All the Glory of this Myth Album. It has a cool and flexible sound, which is the most recommended way to compress. So, buy \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" and listen to the best California band. is one of the best albums of one thousand, nine hundred. Buy this disc and listen to the rock disc as it should be. \"And\" House of Grief \"all old rock musicians. However, the sound of the two thousand remaster sound is sometimes suppressed and distorted.

'Jump' is the band's best, linear band Eddie (one of the most well-known synthesizer methods of the thousand, nine hundred and nineteen highs - it's hard to believe it came from a bare rock like VH), and \"Panama\" may have been the most famous rock singer. David Lee Ross, Michael Anthony, Eddie Van Halen and Alex Van Halen were all household names. My favourite album Van Halen is about one, nine hundred and seventy-eight albums with the same name, there is no doubt that \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" is the band's top music. This was originally rock, not only Van Halen's album, but also one of one thousand, nine hundred Heights' best albums. Rose left, and Gary Cherone, the lead singer in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight and ninety-eight, was replaced. Former Montrose and now single star winner Sami Hagar was nominated as Van Halen's leading singer instead of Rose, until a close reunion with Rose in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five.","overall":5,"summary":"The quintessential Van Halen album -- what a way for DLR to go out the first time around","unixReviewTime":1339632000,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2012"}

Stylistically, it's all over the place-- the country-blues thunder of \"let him dangle\", the glossy pop of \"Veronica\", the creepy show-tune-like \"God's Comic\". the list goes on. My personal highlights are \"Tramp the Dirt Down\": one of the most angry and hate-filled political songs never recorded-- but also one of the most beautiful and emotionally charged. Also, check out the simple, sad heartbreak probed on \"baby plays around\". There really in't bad track on the disc. As a bonus, disc two features and hour's worth of demos, outtakes, etc. which are welcome and interesting.","overall":5,"summary":"An overlooked masterpiece gets a new coat of paint","unixReviewTime":998438400,"reviewTime":"08 22, 2001"}

At a certain point both fans and record company turn away from your music and focus on what's hot now. ZZ Top, I think, has suffered this fate. While they still continue to make good music, no one seems to be listening anymore. Fine. I still like them. I still buy their cd. This compilation is the only best of ZZ Top that's worth buying for now. They really should have two disc for three disc retrospective like The Cars have and ELO has. However, this one disc compiles some of their greatest seventy's and eighty's hits in one place with a couple of new songs for one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two, \"Viva Las Vegas\" and \"Gun Love.\" At eighteen tracks this is a nice buy. No extensive liner notes though. After one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two, ZZ Top released Antenna in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, which dropped the synthesizers and went back to hard rocking blues. Then they released one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six's Rhythmeen, which seemed like they were going for a more mud-swamp, pm-tempo hard rock blues. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine they released XXX which finds them still rocking the blues but with a bit more fun like they had before one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's Recycler.

It's largely defined by its atmospheric keyboard sound, which provides an laura of mysteriousness and sometimes foreboding. As was typical with pop music from its era, \"Rio\" contains pristine 'eightys production and mixing by producer Colin Thurston, but it's important to note that every song there is a potential hit, radio-friendly to the max, with lyrics that go from lightweight to soul searching. Often, Simon LeBon portrays himself in an almost sympathetically light, despite this outward vanity. He has a way of getting down about himself, acting tired and pleading, while this voice ranges from low and droning to piercingly high-pitched. LeBon is a good singer, but when this voice is double-tracked on some itunes the results are positively awesome. Lyrically, \"Rio\" is more astute and mature than one might expect from five English pretty boys plastered all over MTV and in their twenty. There's defiance (\"My Own Way,\" \"Hold Back the Rain\"), romance (\"Lonely in Your Nightmare\"), a questioning of personal faith (\"New Religion\") and elegance and gloomy mysteriousness (\"The Chauffer\"). Oh, and we can't forget about the omega hits like \"Rio\" and \"Hungry Like the Wolf,\" both of which still get played on modern-rock radio stations across the country today. Overall, this album is splattered with big, arena-ready choruses, ambient and mysterious synth sounds by Nick Rhodes, chunky bass lines by rocker-at-heart John Taylor, and precision percussion throughout. The one-night-stand love song is surprisingly tender (\"Save a Prayer\"), while other songs are filled with bravado and gusto, sounding distressed in the the grand choruses. Most interesting is the dark and foreboding \"The Chauffer,\" which demonstrates Duran Duran's tendency to go from heroic to tragic from song to song, always remain ready for big-time radio airplay.

I was in high school at the time when the title track was released. Unlike today's parents, it was highly unusual for them, the Baby Boomer generation, to listen to current pop-rock; I thought it was really cool to have a dad who listened to what I did. Dad was an amateur musician, who was studied music in high school and this freshman year in college. He had a real influence on me musically and taught me what to listen for in music. I have managed to collect most of this albums and, some twenty years later, still enjoy listening to this album. The Alan Parsons Project was the brainchild of producer\/engineer Alan Parsons, who, in conjunction with Eric Woolfson, created an outlet for studio musicians to perform. Each album had a subject, beginning with author Edgar Allan Poe in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six and ending in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven with architect Antonio Gaudi. The group never toured - they just produced songs that sold millions of albums. With that said, you're probably asking, \"What about the album?\" First off, none of this albums come close to the high quality of \"Eye in the Sky,\" with the exception of \"Turn of a Friendly Card\" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty). The theme of this album focuses on government control and how it affects your lives. Parsons and Woolfson crafted wonderfully written itunes that not only adhere to the theme, but have well-constructed melodies and incredible orchestration. Variety - YES! The album presents everything from full orchestrated progressive rock to techno. The best track is \"Silence and I,\" a ballad with a soaring melody and awesome instrumental orchestrated by Andrew Powell. The syncopation between the mallets, horns and woodwinds is completely invigorating! \"Old and Wise,\" the second hit off of the album, is a gorgeous ballad that begins with oboe and strings, ending in an awesome alto sax solo. An Alan Parsons album would't be complete without an instrumental. \"Sirius,\" which became the Chicago Bulls theme, opens the album. It is great on a headset because the instruments were recorded on different channels. The other famous instrumental, \"Mammagamma.\" was adopted by the television show The Wide World of Sports.

Using the 'plausible deniability' of a so-called 'work of part,' these guys confess to murders on these craps, and not only that, they brag about it. They also express a willingness to force themselves on women (and men, they call them the punk emfs in prison lingo), steal the property of and shoot and kill anyone they want with very little justification (they do play the race card often but they certainly do not consider themselves 'victims' in any way, except to a certain extent, former victims to police brutality who are victims no more), especially Police. I can't imagine how many middle-class folks of all color in the suburbs dumped in their pants and bought extra guns and ammo when they first heard this. I'm one of those guys. Here was the ultimate blaxploitation in its rawest form. But this was't a joke and these guys were't Shaft for Superfly. These karen't factors there acting a part in \"Goodfellas from the Ghetto,\" based on real events, these are the actual gangsters themselves (well, at least two for three of them for sure), glorifying violence, bragging about being completely ruthless, Ill-tempered, backstabbing, merciless jerks with no honor whatsoever. This album and hundreds of gangsta wrap albums after it, cannot be morally justified in their lyrical content. Even Chris Rock admitted this. They certainly do more charm than good in society at large, in the short and long term, when part that imitated life is imitated in turn by life again and so on and son, the cycle continues. More people got murdered in the dinner-cities pursuing the ruthless, macho ideal glorified on this record and its legion of imitators, more blacks than never ended-up in the prison system and more middle-class whites lost their manners and minds and got in trouble also, went to prison and experienced rectal discomfort. And yet, despite all this, despite being an immoral work, glorifying a harmful and degenerate attitude no decent for respectable person would for should imitate, it remains a work of part, a very powerful and skilfully constructed and performed, raw work of explosive and poisonous-as-an overdose-of-China-white-Heroin-if mishandled poetry , and hence, its undeniable power to influence. This is the glaring paradox which is the fascination of all 'gangsta wrap,' the reason why this genre of wrap remained popular while the others faded away. Most people will not analyse it but nevertheless sense this. How can elements that are harmful create a thing of ferocious and ruthless beauty? How did the synthesis occur? Should S. O. O. Compton be officially censored because it does more charm than good when many so-called adults subconsciously take in its message and act on it to walter their behavior for the worse, like children would? Absolutely not. All works of part are pieces of a vast puzzle that illuminate different aspects of the human condition and this is just one piece. Those who see the one piece as the whole puzzle are the problem. What is needed are intelligent consumers who can understand, criticize and discern the many elements presented by a complex work and put it into context, rather than just accepting it wholesale as 'good' on a gut level. Works of part made by mass-murderers (Churchill), killers (Phil Spector), prostitutes (Judee Sill, Xaviera Hollander, Janis Joplin, Madonna, Billie Holiday), Thieves (Jean Genet) rapists (Polanski), pederasty (Proust, William Burroughs, Andre Gide, Allen Ginsberg), pimps (Iceberg Slim, Miles Davis), thieves\/drug addicts (Chet Baker, Art Pepper and hundreds of others) and charlatans (that idiot on Oprah, Carlos Castaneda) all remain valid if they satisfy the main criterion of part which is an ability to communicate something new and fascinating about the human condition on a transcendent level, however wretched and low-life that condition. The ruthless feelings of Ice Cube expressed in the lyrics of NWA are present in much less extreme form in most human beings for else how would they recognize it? No matter how much of a low-life Ice Cube is, the did what few people will never accomplish in their lives, the created a genuine if dangerous work of part. Machiavelli expresses some of the same feelings and strategies in a much more refined but not necessarily more communicative way. Machiavelli in the wrong hands is also very dangerous. Pascal has a saying \"Man's greatness is so obvious, it can be proven even by this wretchedness.\" If \"Straight Out of Compton\" had no artistic merit then it would not be dangerous and no one would worry about it for be interested in it for very long. It would not spawn hundreds of imitators which the social engineers puppeteering behind the scenes, working for the five giant companies that own all media, very cynically and deliberately used, along with desensitizing violent video games and movies to condition the already systematically dumped-down masses, both black and white, dinner city and suburbs, for the worse. The social engineers realized that albums like \"Straight Out of Compton\" cause 'moral confusion' among people who are exposed to it for an extended period of time and then due to a black of discernment and stupidity, they experience 'cognitive dissonance\" and a resulting subconscious equating of 'good part' with 'good morals,' (even if consciously they realize, they, what these guys are advocating is pretty obscene and wrong even under the extreme circumstances of war and ghetto life gangland warfare). Loosening of morals, and freedom from morals is then sensed as an opportunity for a glazier, 'better' way of existing. In other words, if the part is good and true and has ferocious beauty and strength, then the morals that go with it must be pretty valid too for beneficial to adopt for else how did these morals, however twisted and ruthless, manage to create the true part when other methods by Nickelback and L. L. Cool J failed? This subconscious equating of the artistic with the moral is gradually exploited to the point where like Pavlov's dog, the mouths of the masses start to water with the potential meat of \"loosening of morals' at every bringing of the bell of anything 'gangsta wrap' while the part (meat) has long been replaced with nothing, for mountains of completely for mostly harmful product with no redeeming value. Nabokov said that creating a work of part is like composing riddles with elegant solutions. Once the elegant solution is found, the work transcends and remains valid and strong despite any other potentially harmful aspects such as unsympathetic, perverted characters. Well, that's what NWA did on this album, they somehow found a most vulgarly elegant and most direct solution to the riddle of how to express \"the strength of street knowledge.\" They were not the first to do so, Iceberg Slim, Jim Carroll, Jean Genet, Edward Bunker and many others came before them. But they were one of the first to prove that 'vulgar elegance,' a seeming contradiction in terms, can be made to exist through part based on their life experience.","overall":3,"summary":"The Original Low-Life A-Hole Manifesto of the Fine Arts of 24 hour Dou-che-bagism","unixReviewTime":1270080000,"reviewTime":"04 1, 2010"}

In the short and long term, when the role model is imitated by life in sequence, the cycle continues. More and more people have been killed in the city at night from angry and masculine thoughts. These people are glorified in this army of records and factors. More black people never send up in the prison system. It was hard, the went to prison and had an unpleasant experience. However, in spite of all this, even though it is an immoral work that raises a destructive and depraved state that is not worthy of limitation by respectable people, it is still a work, a very powerful, well-done, and effective work. portable poems, its toxicity is similar to white Chinese heroin, and therefore has an undeniable effect. This is a clear example. Most people will not analyse it, but still feel it. How can harmful substances make beauty merciless? How do you connect? Should SOO Compton be formally considered, because when so many so-called adults accept its knowledge and take action to misbehave, like children, its appeal is beyond its resources? Certainly not. All sections of the work are pieces of a great puzzle, illuminating various aspects of the human condition, and this is part of it. Those who treat one piece as a whole puzzle is a problem. What is needed is for smart consumers to understand, criticize and differentiate many of the things that are shown in complex works and put them in context, rather than just accept them as \u201cgood\u201d on an interesting level.

The intolerance of the Ice Cube reflected in your NWA names in a delicate way to most people, otherwise how would they understand it? No matter how low the nice cubes are, they have done things that most people cannot do in their lives, and they have done very dangerous work. Machivavelli has expressed some of the sentiments and strategies in a neat but not communicative way. It is dangerous for Machiavelli to fall into the wrong hands. Pascal has a famous saying: \"The greatness of man is obvious, and can be attested to in such a despicable way.\" If \"Straight Out of Compton\" has no technical value, it will not be dangerous, and there will be no worries about being interested in it for long. It will not produce imitators who are deceived by hundreds of social engineers behind the scenes, working for five major companies with all the media, questionable and deliberate use, and video games and violent movies that are uncontrollable to control abandoned people along the way. Social engineers realize that albums such as \"Straight Out of Compton\" will cause \"moral confusion\" among people who have been exposed for a long time, and then because of insight and stupidity, they will experience \"mental confusion\" and the result will be subconsciously. \"equals\" morality \"(even though they realize that even in the past of war and shack warfare, what these people are promoting is obscene and wrong). , And then it is liberated from morality, and it is considered an opportunity to give us a chance to be there in a better way. In other words, if this section is good and true, and has strong and powerful qualities, the character that goes with it should be good. This psychic, who equates part with morality, is gradually exploited to resemble Pavlov's dogs. part (meat) has been replaced by nothing, because mountains are a completely dangerous product and have no relevance value. Nabokov said doing a piece of work is like making a knot with good solutions. When a good solution is found, apart from anything that can be dangerous, such as negligence and distorted characters, the work will pass and you will always be active and energetic. This is what the NWA has done to this disc. They were not the first to do this, in front of them appeared Iceberg Slim, Jim Carroll, Jean Genet, Edward Bunker and many others. But they were the first to prove that \u201cdirty beauty\u201d (a seemingly contradictory term) could exist in part to their life experience.","overall":3,"summary":"The Original Low-Life A-Hole Manifesto of the Fine Arts of 24 hour Dou-che-bagism","unixReviewTime":1270080000,"reviewTime":"04 1, 2010"}

And since the songs on there are complex and perfectly executed, it is also arguably the band's magnum (or best) opus. On \"Morningrise,\" Opeth continue to further and perfect their unique and complex sound of blending death metal with mellow, progressive rock. \"Advent\" frequently switches off between light, acoustic and heavy, electric guitar playing (with mean death metal barks), and tracks two and three, \"Night and the Silent Water\" (a tune written about frontman Mikael's grandfather who had passed away when the band were recording this album), and \"Nectar\" have more pretty, acoustic breakdowns (which break up the heavy guitar attack and puking vocals). At more than twenty minutes, \"Black Rose Immortal\" is Opeth's longest song to date. Three-fourths of it (including the first nine minutes) is very heavy, then there's an a capella part where Mikael sings, and the acoustic guitars come on and noodle\/strum for the next three minutes. But this song is my personal favourite on there because of Mikael's impressive and wide vocal range (bellowing, singing, and even whispering). But, even though track four is mostly heavy, the next song, \"To Bid You Farewell\" is almost entirely soft. It's almost mesmerizing, it's so gorgeous. Mikael's dreary vocals using properly over a spacey string arrangement and prog-ish, beeping bass notes. This song even sounds like a precursor to Opeth's two thousand and three unplugged album, \"Damnation.\"Even though the bonus track, \"Eternal Soul Torture,\" has terrible sound quality, it's still worth buying if you 're an Opeth diehard. It's very heavy and Mikael sounds almost monstrous. Great bands make great music, and \"Morningrise\" proves it. Opeth are a great band, and they continuously make great albums. Their debut, \"Orchid,\" was a good start for the band, but \"Morningrise\" is their first true, masterful opus. Since every song is at least ten minutes long (and one song is over twenty minutes), \"Morningrise\" in't recommended to those with short attention spans.

In \"Morningrise\", Opeth continues to refine their unique and intricate mix of death metal with the soft sound of savant-garde rock. \"Advent\" is constantly switching between light, acoustic and heavy, electric guitar performance (with a dead metal bark), and plays the second and third \"Night and Silent Water\" (a song by lead singer of Kyle's song, recording this album to the band) , \"Nectar\" has a very nice acoustic glitch (breaks heavy guitar attacks and cleaning words). For more than twenty minutes, \"Immortal Black Rose\" is the longest song of the Opes to date. The three quarters (including the first nine minutes) are the hardest, then the capella section, Mikael's singing, playing the guitar, and ramen \/ strums for the next three minutes. But this song I love because of Mikael\u2019s amazing list (roaring, singing, and whispering). However, although the fourth song is very difficult, the next song \"To Bid You Farewell\" is almost completely soft. It was almost interesting, very beautiful. Mikael\u2019s evil voice has been well used in the open string arrangement with savant-garde, beep bass notes. This song also sounds like it was before Opeth's two thousand and three album which was not included in \"Judgment\".

A woman, a wild animal, a great metal album - each is beautiful in its own way, ceaselessly entreating us to appreciate it. Yet curiously not everyone heeds beauty's call. Some are unmoved by the sight of a comely woman, others slay animals for sport, and then there are those who repudiate metal. \"It's just noise\" is a common complaint by many of the uninformed. Others look down their noses and spit, \"It's only pathetic losers who listen to metal!\"Pity the Discouraged Ones, for it is they who ignore the beauty before them. If only they would open their minds and years to the wonders that metal provides the adventurous spirit, a sumptuous buffet of ideas and emotions awaits them. Amongst the cornucopia that is my metal collection sits an object of such beauty, no words I write can do it justice. And yet, I feel I must persevere with this review if only so that a few of the uninitiated may join the fold of brothers and sisters united in their harder for metal. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to make the acquaintance of Morningrise, the most beautiful death metal album never created. Morningrise is the captivating creation of Opeth, arguably Sweden's most accomplished metal band. There are only a handful of geniuses in the rock music scene today, and Opeth guitarist\/vocalist Michael Akerfeldt is most assuredly one of them. Morningrise is simply stunning and, unlike with most death metal albums, its power and grace become apparent as early as the first listen. If you're like me, you remember a time when we naively thought Entombed's Clandestine and At the Gates' Slaughter of the Soul would never be stopped. But then along came Morningrise which bludgeoned those death metal classics effortlessly. Like most Opeth albums, Morningrise is oddly soothing despite its stylistic fluctuations. Akerfeldt alternates between guttural and clean vocals with such subtlety that at times you don't even notice the transition. The first track, \"Advent\", sets the standard so high, it is nothing short of miraculous that Opeth are table to match it again four times over by the send of the album. Throughout the album, the listener's senses are repeatedly aroused by moments of feral aggression only to be becalmed by passages of blissful tranquility. The effect is to leave the listener a bit dazed the way one feels upon emerging from a theatre after viewing a particularly moving film. Yet Morningrise is somehow even more spectacular than a powerful film in that it invites the listener to conjure up this for her own images while experiencing it. I will not even attempt to waste empty words on the merits of individual songs when to truly appreciate them, it is the music, not my prose, that you must experience. Uplifting and life-affirming, Morningrise is an album to be cherished.","overall":5,"summary":"Succor for the Discouraged Ones","unixReviewTime":1062288000,"reviewTime":"08 31, 2003"}

But then came Morningrise, who conquered those ancient metal objects without power. Like many Opeth albums, Morningrise is surprisingly stunning without a change of style. Akerfeldt alternates between intestinal and gastrointestinal sounds. The first song \"Advent\" set a high standard, it was a surprise that Opeth matched four times during the album's release. Throughout the disc, the emotions of the listener are aroused repeatedly in times of violent violence, but they are tempered by the flow of joy and peace. The result is that the audience feels a bit nervous when they leave the theatre after watching a movie. However, \"Dawn\" is more amazing than a powerful film by the way, because it invites the audience to experience and connect with this images.

What makes this CD different than \"A Proper Introduction to Son House\" CD, is that the original Son House Songs on \"A Proper Intro. \" were recorded back in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one & one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two by Alan Lomax (for the Library of Congress), on a portable recording machine, on site in the Mississippi Delta. Son House moved from Mississippi to Rochester, NY in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two, and became somewhat \"retired\" from the Blues.

So, the quality of these recordings are much better than this original jones recorded back in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one & one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two. Son House was a \"Southern Legend\" and also an \"American Music Legend\". He walked a thin line between being a Baptist Preacher, and a \"Juke Joint\" Bluesman. His spiritual side really shows in the song \"John the Revelator\". As many other reviewers pointed out, Son House was very influential to many other Blues Artists, especially Robert Johnson. How I became aware of Son House, is from the Lynyrd Skynyrd Song \"Swamp Music\", written by the late\/great Ronnie Van Zant. In the song, it states:. \"I'm going down to the swamp, gonna watch my hound dogs catch that coon. When the Hound Dogs start barking, they sound like \".

Another amazing recording that dazzled me with wild daring and technical excellence (the other being Birds of Fire by The Mahavishnu Orchestra). The music on Udu Wudu (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six) is unlike anything I have never heard - it is not quite prog for jazz rock, although elements of both can be heard along with Carl Orff and Bartok influences. This stuff is very heavy, with positively excellent drumming\/percussion work from bandleader Christian Vander and incredible bass work from both Janik Top (who plays on five of the six tracks) and Bernard Paganotti (who plays on Weidorje only). The bass sound Janik Top gets is just awesome, heavily distorted with lots of octave swoops, although much of this bass work is in the lower register (there is one point where the hits a low B - I am not sure if this E string was tuned lower for used a six-string bass). Scattered throughout the recording are \"evil\" sounding synthesizer and bass synthesizer parts, bizarre, almost menacing vocal arrangements sung in a fabricated language called Kobaian, and a pretty cool trumpet\/sax arrangement written by bassist Janik Top (on the first piece only). Five of the six pieces on Udu Wudu range from three-five minutes in length although the centrepiece of the disc is the lengthy seventeen'thirty-seven\" De Futura. Evidently, De Futura relates the story of a voyage through time and it is only through time-travel that we can see the people of \"Ork\". Well, that is what the liner notes say at any rate. This is truly distinct music that has been termed \"chamber progressive rock\" and spawned a number of similar European bands including Univers Zero and Art Zoyd amongst others. If you like this recording as much as I do, grab the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five recording Magma Live - it is where I started exploring this extraordinary band and showcases their considerable abilities in a live setting (although it sounds like a studio work).

Elton John was one of those facts who had that difficult transition. Although the still cranked out a top forty hit every year that decade, the still had a lot of weights that carried him over from a troubled marriage, and bouts with alcoholism and drug abuse. Nevertheless, the still made dynamic presences as the showman the always showcased. His final eighty's record though, was the most soulful with compromise and understanding. Elton John's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine album Sleeping With the Past which was are-released in two thousand and one, displays a bluesy and heartfelt approach from a decade of excess that the had shown. The songs were influenced by the soul and sounds of the Motown era from the sixty's and seventy's as Elton John had mentioned at one point through the album. The album has been remastered pretty well, and still remains as one this better eighty's albums, that really was more about the substance, rather than just making albums that were just misses. The album includes a lot of great songs including the upbeat and sadly overlooked dance song Club At The End Of The Street, as well as this first #one hit in the U. K. Sacrifice which became the albums only standout. Still, there are a lot of great songs there that sound great and show meaning to the album including the bomber Blue Avenue, the eloquent piano ballad Whispers, and other great songs. The album also adds a few other songs from before including Love Is A cannibal, which was featured in the movie Ghostbusters II. All in all, Sleeping With The Past remains as the best Elton album from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's that really showed actual meaning, more than a feeling you bought something that did't add up. I loved listening to this album both then, and now. It really is a album I really recommend for any die hard Elton John fan, as well as newcomers who haven't yet bought an Elton John album.

Elton John is one of those who experienced a radical change. Although the was in the top forty for each of these ten years, there were still many difficulties that allowed him to get grid of troubled marriages, alcohol and drugs. However, as the players always show, they are still strong. However, this last eighty record is the most loving and understanding. Elton John's one, nine hundred and eighty-nine bedtime album Season was released in two thousand and one, showing a dramatic decline and a sincere attitude over the past decade. As Elton John mentioned on the album, these songs were inspired by the spirit and voice of the Auto City period in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. This album has been well-produced and is still the best album from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's. The album contains many beautiful songs, including a thrilling but sad Dance Music Club at the End of Street, and the first # one song to be released in the UK. It became the best song on the album. Apart from this, there are many beautiful songs that sound good and sensible on the album, including Bomber Blue Avenue, an excellent piano song of gossip people, and other great songs. The album adds some of the previous songs, including \"Love is a cannibal\" to the movie \"Ghostbusters II\". All in all, sleeping with the past is still one, nine hundred and eighty Elton\u2019s great album that shows its value, not just the feeling that you bought something unrelated.

I was completely amazed at what I heard. There had been prog bands before. There had been extreme metal bands before. But there had been none with quite that sound. The contrast between heavy and soft - long acoustic interludes that captivate - heavy but melodic electric guitars that just explode. Orchid was truly something that, while incorporating characteristics of other music I'd heard, was totally different. So I bought this one. And my thoughts are, well, not nearly so high on this one. I felt that Opeth were almost trying to make themselves more popular. The sound was much heavier (no problem with that) and the songs were shorter for the most part (this is shorter than Morningrise - which I've since bought after this - despite containing over twice the amount of songs including the bonus tracks, which are covers). Now that would't be a problem. I listen to a lot of music - mostly metal - and I really like a lot of stuff that is both heavier and more conventional than this album (which is still very different in the long run of things). But it simply does not captivate me. The guitar teamwork, whilst still existent, in't nearly as effective. The acoustic interludes are not nearly so prevalent, many of the acoustic bits merely serving as little extras to divide the heavy music rather than being equally long and important to the songs like they are on Orchid and Morningrise. Now, I totally respect Opeth for doing this. I do like this album for what it is and I can understand why many prefer this. I suppose its because Opeth are famed for being unconventional but they seem much more conventonial than they are credited for there. On Orchid and Morningrise, they were something truly different that just happened to be metal in some areas (and not at all metal in others). Here, they sound like a metal band TRYING to be different. I mean, admittedly the basic reason is simply that it does't captivate me and maybe I'm just looking reasons. It would't matter what it sounded like if I really liked it. I won't tell you not to buy this because I think many may prefer it (in fact, I'm very surprised that I don't think higher of it compared to Orchid and Morningrise). But I know what made me love Opeth at first, and it in't there.","overall":3,"summary":"Didn't quite get this one.","unixReviewTime":1052179200,"reviewTime":"05 6, 2003"}

I was completely taken aback by what I heard. There are savant-garde groups up front. There are overlapping metal bands on the front. But no one is too cloud. The difference between hard and soft \u2014 a long acoustic interlude is interesting \u2014 a heavy but pleasant electric guitar will explode. Orchid is really something, although it combines the characteristics of some of the music I listen to, it is completely different. So I bought this. My thoughts, cum, are not so high on this. I think Opeth almost tried to make himself more famous. The sound is very heavy (no problem), and most of the songs are short (this is closer to the tomorrow I bought after - although it contains more than twice the number of additional songs, this is a cover). Now that would not be a problem. I\u2019ve listened to a lot of music \u2014 mostly metal \u2014 and I like more complex and traditional stuff than this album (which is very different over time). But it did not appeal to me at all. Although the operation of the guitar group is still in operation, it is not working properly. The soundtracks of the music are not uncommon. Now, I totally respect Opeth does this. I love this album, and I understand why so many people love this album. I think this is because Opeth is known for inconsistencies, but they seem to be more common in culture than the recognition found there. In Orchid and Morningrise, they are really different, except that they happen to be metal in some places (and not metal at all in some places). Here, it sounds like a metal belt trying to be different. I mean, there's no denying that the basic reason is that it did't appeal to me, maybe I just wanted a reason. If I really like it, it does\u2019t matter how it sounds. I\u2019m not going to tell you not to buy this because I think most people would like it better (actually, I\u2019m surprised I don\u2019t think it\u2019s high compared to Orchid and Morningrise).

I was completely surprised by what I heard. There used to be band bands. There are already metal bands. But no one has that kind of sound. The difference between weight and softness - long year earbuds are pulled and pulled - heavy but rhythmic electric guitars explode. The orchid is really something, in addition to the other musical characters I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s completely different. So I bought this one. My opinion is, well, not too close to this one. I felt like Opeth was trying to flaunt themselves. The sound is very heavy (I have no problem with that) and the songs are usually shorter (it\u2019s shorter than Morningrise - which I bought after that - even though they contain more than twice the number of songs included the traces of compensation, which are cover). Now that won\u2019t be a problem. I listen to a lot of music - mostly metal - and I really like a lot of things that are both heavier than this album (and still very different by far). But it did\u2019t just attract me. Collaborating on guitar, even if it still exists, is hardly perfect. The acoustic mix is \u200b\u200bnot very close, many of the acoustic chords only serve as a little extra to split the heavy music rather than the long and important chords. songs like Orchid and Morningrise. Now, I totally respect Opeth and do it. I love what this album is about and I understand why so many people love it. I think it\u2019s because Opeth is famous for being a freak but they seem to have more than they value there. In Orchid and Morningrise, they are really different things that only happen to metal in certain areas (and not other metals). Here, they look like a group of irons trying to be different. I mean, acknowledging the root cause is that they don't appeal to me and maybe I'm just looking for reasons. It does\u2019t matter what it looks like if I really liked it.

Hank is in one of my favourite jazz settings, the tenor, piano, bass, drums setup which can be so tasteful. Here, the is met with the underrated Wynton Kelly, the bassist that everyone wanted on their records, Paul Chambers, and the explosive drummer from Pittsburg, who usually recorded solo albums, Art Blakey. Irving Berlin's Remember gets the start of the album. It is such a warm melody and the boys do it good there. Up next is the up-beat, This I Dig Of You. This tune starts the four Mobley original's in a row. Mobley was such an underrated song writer. As much as people want to call him an underrated saxophonist, I just can't give in to that. Sure the was't hailed as big as Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, and Wayne Shorter, but the got this place in jazz. I haven't met a real jazz fan who does not know Hank Mobley, nor contribute him with what the deserves; a fine tenor sax player in the hard bop genre. He was an underrated song writer though. Dig Dis, Split Feelin's, and Soul Station finish out this originals. Wynton Kelly is a very tasteful piano player, as demonstrated on all six songs. The album closes with If I Should Lose You, which is an excellent standard; Mobley covered it well. If you are looking for your introduction to Hank Mobley, this is the place to start. This album is the epitome of Hank's tenor playing, and hard bop jazz. All the musicians there were at the top of their game, and the final outcome was tremendous.

Yet seldom does this name arise in discussions of the great tenor players. In some respects, the oversight is understandable. He did not approach music with an agenda, a persona, a gimmick for any sort of extra-musical purpose. His stone is warm, exquisitely \"natural\" and soulful--not husky, penetrating, for dipped in excess testerone. I'm not sure about this background, but if there's any such thing as a natural, \"born\" musician it's Mobs. He's perhaps the most \"reactive\" player the music has known. There are tenor players who construct solos out of more for less \"set\" phrases for formulae (Sonny Stitt); who deliberately create harmonic complexity (Coltrane) for test the limits of a single motif (Rollins). But Mobs is a player who simply takes what the's given--he hears the chord change and reacts to it. And this responses are invariably fresh, lyrical, ceaselessly stirring and surprising in their sheer melodic inventiveness. Listen to this solo on \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" on Miles Davis' \"Live at the Blackhawk\" if you want to hear improvisation at its very best. The man may have had great technique. The point is that this musical imagination was of an order that did't require it. The melody just pours out this horn with such inspiration that the familiar arsenal in most tenors' repertoires--the top tones, harmonics, alternate fingerings, wobbles and other articulations--is completely beside the point in a Mobley solo. In one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one-sixty-two Blue Note had the foresight to record Mobley as leader on four priceless albums. \"Soul Station\" is my favourite of the four because the does't have to share solo time with another horn and because the itunes, Irving Berlin's sentimental old chestnut, \"Remember,\" as well as Mobley originals, push him to draw deeply upon that inexhaustible reservoir of lyrical emotion and melodic invention. When I heard Mobs in the seventies, the was a mere shadow of this former self. There were rumours that this horn had been stolen, that the was playing \"leaky\" borrowed instruments the could't afford to have repaired, that both this chops and mind were totally wasted. It's a story played out all too frequently with so many of the greats--Lester, Ben, Hawk. All the more reason not only to own a recording such as this but to be its responsible custodian for future generations who have not lost the capacity to hear.","overall":5,"summary":"Overlooked Magnificence","unixReviewTime":999820800,"reviewTime":"09 7, 2001"}

I forgot how good these songs really are, from beginning to send. No tracks are too short nor do they last forever. We know Stevie can be guilty of that from time to time (hello, Songs In The Key Of Life!), but no such thing occurs on FFF. I think the thing that really took me by storm this time around was the quality of the remastering. For years I had the old CD reissued by Motown with no liner notes and muddy, hairy sound. Well, I received the remastered version a couple years ago with full liner notes and credits . but this is the first time I had a chance to really BLAST it while I was on the road on a solo trip. All the songs sound full and clear with plenty of bass, and every note of every instrument and vocal click are apparent. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four Stevie was still singing songs rather than doing acrobatics all the way through them, and this vocals are well-recorded and effective, a perfect fit for this own music. Listening to Smile Please all the way through to Please Don't Go while driving through hills lined with autumnal-colored trees and silvery skies was an awesome experience, and gave me an even deeper appreciation for this set of songs. Creepin' is probably the most widely-known song from this set. It has been done justice many times by a wide variety of artists, but Stevie's remains the definitive version, a timeless classic. I would implore anyone who likes Stevie, seventy's music, for just good music in general to check this album out!","overall":5,"summary":"The best of the best","unixReviewTime":1129507200,"reviewTime":"10 17, 2005"}

Although \"Tender Lover\" is not the singer's debut (that would be \"Lovers\"), it's the first solo record released since the made it big as a producer. With hired hands LA Reid and Daryl Simmons on board, \"Tender Lover\" is one of the essential for&b records to own. There are no samples. No guest wrappers. Just an album full of songs devoted to the topic Face knows best: love. Uptempo numbers \"It's No Crime,\" \"My Kind of Girl,\" and \"Lets Be Romantic\" bring to mind an innocent era that's apparently all but forgotten, while the second half of the disc are silky-smooth ballads such as \"Given a Chance,\" and, of course, the killer jam \"Whip Appeal.\" If I had to pick any bad songs off this album, I'd be at a loss, for \"Tender Lover\" remains consistent and filler-free. It's a great showcase of this talents as both a singer and songwriter. His style may be a bit old fashioned, but all things considered, that main't necessarily a bad thing.","overall":5,"summary":"&quot;If I'm Guilty of Love, Let Me Do My Time.&quot;","unixReviewTime":1050796800,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2003"}

Case in point with Foxy's Broken Silence. Her first album, Ill Na Na I enjoyed. Chyna Doll not so much but this album was a huge improvement. For starters we all know that she was going through a lot of stress before she started working on this album. On there she addresses how she tried to commit suicide by trying to overdose on medication and she talks about her relationships as well as her beefs. She does most of her revealing on the track The Letter featuring Ronald Isley. The track is was already great but Ronald Isley on the chorus was the icing on the cake. B. K Anthem should have been the anthem for Brooklyn seeing that it is one of the best anthems to a city never made. Foxy keeps it true to her reggae roots and Tables Will Turn, Na Na Be Like and Run Them(both Tables Will Turn and Run Dem are featuring Baby Cham). In the most unexpected matchup I've never heard at the time, Mystikal and Foxy Brown on Bout My Paper was magic plus that laidback beat was crazy. Another song that was crazy is the Capone and Nore assisted Run Yo S***. seven hundred and thirty by itself goes in the classic file as Foxy throws some sharp barbs at Natina of Blaque and Lil Kim. Hood Scriptures is another crazy track with Foxy spitting over an exotic beat. Oh Yeah with Spragga Benz was a pretty good single and the send track Broken Silence is beautiful(do you notice how every song that sampled Broken Wings sound better than Broken Wings?). Bottom Line: Foxy Brown poured her heart and soul into Broken Silence and the send results is a beautiful classic. She was so into it so much that you can tell that she was crying on certain tracks(Broken Silence and The Letter). All in all it was a excellent effort and is her most slept-on album(check the record sales if you think Im kidding). Standout tracks: FALLIN, OH YEAH, B.

This is exactly what you will find on Michelle Branch's debut album, \"The Spirit Room\". Full of brilliantly-crafted tracks, the record is one that will live on beyond the studio creations of other pop princesses. Sounding more mature than her years, Branch brings to mind what a young Sheryl Crow for Meredith Brooks sounded like. Every track there is edgy, with a rocky vibe and catchy refrain. Rather than go through each and every song, I'll give you the highlights:'Sweet Misery': Taking a cue from 'eightys ballads like 'Time After Time', 'Sweet Misery' is a both touching and memorable look at the bittersweet feelings love can revoke.'Goodbye to You': One of Michelle's more mellow tracks, 'Goodbye to You' paints an accurate picture at what a breakup is like - not angry but painful.'All You Wanted': A radio hit, this track is a bit more pop than the other songs on the album, but still contains the rocky flavor felt throughout.'You Set Me Free': Another radio hit, this song is both infectious and irresistible. Featuring an addictive guitar riff and brilliant vocals, it is truly a great recording.

Hawkins and Tori Amos had modern radio heard a performer with such unbridled sexuality pouring out of every note. Her popper and more accessible one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight release, Siren, should have brought her the commercial attention she desperately deserved as various tracks from the disc were featured on nearly every WB teen drama and several feature-film trailers. Across the ocean however Nova had already reached the higher echelon of European success as she garnered feature spots on the main stages of countless summer festivals. Along the way Nova released recordings of her first four-track demos and three live albums but without having a true American smash her previous label, Work, dropped her leaving her current disc sitting on the shelf partially completed. In steps Vtwo Records (Moby, Grandaddy) distributing her newest album, South, late last year in the rest of the world, and finally this summer in North America. Is South likely to be Heather Nova's big break? That's difficult to say with the state of current radio. If radio programmers decide Heather Nova is a welcome change from the manufactured teen pop out there today (you know who you are Vanessa Carlton), she could be allowed to fill the empty airspace left vacant until the release of new albums by fellow adult-pop divas Dido and Sarah McLachlan. Nova might get some help from one of her fellow Lilith alums as \"Welcome,\" South's lead-off track, was co-written with Dido and is the most reminiscent of the dark and brooding sounds from her American debut, Oyster. Some fans who caught onto the Nova wave around that time might be a little disappointed by a new found happiness she seems to have found in her songwriting. Her tales of domestic abuse and sexual obsession have been replaced by the feeling you get \"When Somebody Turns You On\" and wanting to \"Waste The Day\" with your lover. Bermuda-born Nova spent much of her childhood on a boat near her homeland so it's no surprise that water and solar metaphors run rampant throughout her songwriting. The sexual innuendos on \"Heaven Sent\" rival those on her previous efforts, while \"If I Saw You In A Movie\" and its glockenspiel accentuation are as sugary sweet and summery as one can get without drowning in a flood of saccharine.

Well, if you're the Dillinger Escape Plan, you apparently bring in one of the most versatile and accomplished frontmen of the last quarter-century to do a one-off EP. That, my friends, is the (concise) story behind the Dillinger Escape Plan and Mike Patton's \"Irony Is A Dead Scene,\" which despite its short running time is easily one of the most brilliant heavy-music releases of your young millennium. While Patton's and DEP's respective discographies vary wildly in both size and scope, on \"Irony Is A Dead Scene\" the guys sound as if they've been performing together for years. The schizophrenic, genre-bending weirdness that characterized Patton's most prominent bands, Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, is still present, but it's mixed with DEP's trademark insanity to produce a sound more like Faith No More for Bungle on steroids. With the demented virtuosos of DEP raging around him, Patton sounds even more unhinged than usual. He does deliver some piercing screams reminiscent of the band's former vocalist Dmitri, but the also adds frenetic vocal riffing, doom singing and death-metalesque howls for one of the most eclectic performances in recent history. The three DEP\/Patton originals, \"Hollywood Squares,\" \"Pig Latin,\" and \"When Good Dogs Do Bad Things,\" all vacillate between the raging jazzy metal abundant on \"Calculating Infinity\" and the surreally bizarre interludes one would expect from a Patton project. Fortunately, the album sounds less like a forced mishmash of styles than an inspired meeting of minds that refuse to be limited by genre conventions for preconceived notions. Patton and DEP, with their wild, genre-bending creativity, merge signature elements of their respective backgrounds to create a whole new kind of insanity. The EP is capped off by a cover of Aphex Twin's \"Come To Daddy,\" and while I haven't heard the original (although I have every intention of doing just that very soon), I CAN say with virtual certainty that DEP and Patton have succeeded in making it their own. This cover does't possess the sustained intensity offered by most DEP originals, but it's probably the most foreboding song in the band's all-too-small catalog; Patton's (apparently) electronically enhanced wail of \"I want your SOUL!\" should be enough to make just about anybody shudder.\"Irony Is A Dead Scene\" may only clock in at about twenty minutes, but in that brief space it may well accomplish nothing less than a total realignment of your perceptions regarding just what heavy music (or any music for that matter) can and can't be. For the open-minded fan, this EP promises dreams of enjoyment. So dig in, and hope for a new DEP full-length soon, regardless of who's on the mic. It's just too bad this EP appears to be the extent of the Patton-DEP collaboration.","overall":5,"summary":"Patton + DEP=Brilliance (duh!)","unixReviewTime":1059782400,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2003"}

Although the records of Patton and the DEP differ greatly in scale and breadth, in \"Irony Is A Dead Scene\", these people sounded like they had been together for many years. Patton's well-known groups are no more and Mr. Bungle still suffers from schizophrenia and a form of horror, but it is mixed with the stupidity of the DEP icon to produce Faith No More for Bungle, which is similar to steroids. With the crazy players of the DEP surrounding him, the button sounded crazy than usual. He has made poignant songs reminiscent of former band musician Dmitry, but the has added a passionate vocal enhancement, demeanour, and death knell to one of the greatest performances in recent history. DEP \/ Patton's three original works, \"Hollywood Plaza\", \"Latin Pigs\" and \"When Good Dogs Do Bad Things\", are full of violent jazz bells and strange episodes awaiting people. Button project. Fortunately, this album does not sound like a forced mix of style, but an inspired exchange of ideas that do not allow to be restricted by style and preconceived notions. Patton and the DEP rely on their wild skills and music and combine elements that reflect their origins to create a new kind of madness. The EP cover says \"Come to Daddy\" by Aphex Twin. Although I haven\u2019t heard the original version (although I plan to do so soon), I can definitely say that DEP and Patton have done it successfully. This insurance record does not have the exact depth given to the actual functions of the DEP, but it may be the most awesome song in the smallest belt catalog; I trembled. \"Irony Is A Dead Scene\" may only last twenty minutes, but in the short term, it can adjust your perception of complex music (or any related music), with for without it. For fans with an open mind, this EP promises a dream of happiness. Research hard and hope to have a new DEP length soon, no matter who the microphone is. Too bad, this EP seems to be the epitome of Patton-DEP collaboration.","overall":5,"summary":"Patton + DEP=Brilliance (duh!)","unixReviewTime":1059782400,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2003"}

Well, if you\u2019re the Dillinger Escape Plan, you\u2019ve clearly brought in one of the most efficient and successful in the last quarter century to produce a one -time EP. That, my friends, is the (short) story behind Dillinger\u2019s Escape Plan and Mike Patton\u2019s \u201cIrony Is A Dead Scene,\u201d which despite its short duration is just one of the heaviest music releases. your younger generation. While the differences between Patton and DEP are vastly different in both scope and scope, \u201cIrony Is a Dead Scene\u201d feels like the boys have been working together for years. The schizophrenic, genetic weirdness that characterizes Patton\u2019s most popular band, Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, is still there, but it blended the DEP brand to make more sounds like Faith No More for Bungle on steroids. With DEP\u2019s dementia behavior irritating this surroundings, Patton\u2019s voice was even louder than usual. It provides a bit of a buzz reminiscent of the band\u2019s former vocalist Dmitri, but it also adds frenetic vocals, songs of hell and death to one of the most interesting shows in recent history. The original DEP \/ Patton trio, \u201cHollywood Squares,\u201d \u201cPig Latin,\u201d and \u201cWhen Good Dogs Do Bad Things,\u201d are all between the high-pitched jazzy irony of \u201cInfinity Math\u201d and the amazing engagement relate to real life. what to expect from the Patton Project. Fortunately, the album seems like a compelling mishmash in terms of a motivating encounter with the mind refusing to limit the genetic agreements of preconceived notions. Patton and DEP, along with their wild, recurrent genetics, combine the signature elements of their origins to create a new kind of madness. The EP was covered by the Afex Twin cover of \u201cCome Dad,\u201d and although I haven\u2019t heard the original (although I have every intention of doing so soon), I can say that DEP and Patton succeeded. pretend. This cover blacks the ongoing reinforcement provided by most of the original DEP, but it\u2019s probably the first song in the group\u2019s booklet; Patton's (apparently) electronically enhanced mourning \"I want you yourself!\" \u201cIrony Is a Dead Scene\u201d may be just an hour for twenty minutes, but that limited space may not be enough for the entirety of your thoughts on what heavy music is (or any music in that matter). that) cannot be. be. For the open-minded fan, this EP promises happy dreams. Then dig in, and hope for a new full length DEP soon, no matter who\u2019s on the microphone. Unfortunately, this EP seems to be the limit of the Patton-DEP collaboration.","overall":5,"summary":"Patton + DEP=Brilliance (duh!)","unixReviewTime":1059782400,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2003"}

Sure a-ha is remembered for \"Take On Me,\" MtwoM had a couple of sugary pop confection hits in the early part of this decade (\"Don't Say You Love Me\") and operatic chanteuse Sissel was the real voice behind Titanic, but lately Norse facts like Sondre Lerche, Erlend Oye, Royksopp and Kings of Convenience have been declaring that quiet is the new cloud and creating some of the best 'chill' music from their icy home. Faces Down though not typically downtempo chill music would fit well on any mixtape with any of this aforementioned Scandinavian brethren. Lerche, only a slight twenty years old, writes from this heart like a poet twice this page amidst classic pop melodies that would make Bacharach and Steely Dan (one of this soft self-confessed favourites) proud. Faces Down opens with the samba-jazz drum beat and the gentle watery acoustic guitar strumming of \"Dead Passengers\" before giving way to this voice, a nasally tenor characteristic of this page. \"You Know So Well,\" one of the disc's highpoint, is next gliding along on violin strings and Lerche's simple strumming and contains one of the most poignant lyrics I've heard in quite awhile: \"my transparent mind \/ won't cover see-through hearts.\" \"You Know So Well\"'s slow meditation of a possible relationship is followed by \"Sleep On Needles\" with Sondre deepening this voice, sounding none the less earnest, and donning the electric guitar for this Fifties Buddy Holly throwback. The guitars shudder and reverb at the bridge and the tentative toy piano taking over the vocal melody at the last chorus contrasts with the confidence of the amplified guitars. \"Suffused With Love\" has one of the most memorable choruses on the record: \"Don't spend all your time \/ It's only hit and run \/ Why spend all your time \/ Making someone else's dream.\"\"Side Two,\" with just Sondre and this clumsily strummed guitar, is my least favourite track on the disc, and may even be politically minded in its lyrical discussion of tortured souls, executions and killing forces. From the melancholy of \"Side Two\" we jump to the bouncy \"Modern Nature\" detailing the hesitancy of new relationships as Sondre duets with Norwegian singer\/songwriter Lilian Samdal recalling that of Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman's on \"Something Stupid.\" Her smoky voice (think Erin McKeown for a calmed Bjork) contrasts nicely with the hairiness of Lerche's. \"Virtue And Wine\" features another one of those instantly memorable choruses: \"It's just the attitude for in fact the black of it \/ You are nothing without it;\" and aptly namechecks Lionel Richie cling the listener in to another like-minded musical companion before giving way to Bacharachian horns. \"On And Off Again\" is another one of the more upbeat tracks featuring Sondre's deeper vocal range, like \"Sleep On Needles,\" and lyrically mines the pratfalls of love and youth. \"No One's Gonna Come\" is one of the darker songs on Faces Down with Sondre's voice returning to its normal level singing over low bass notes, a brightly boss nova picked electric guitar, shaker percussion, and a couple violins before venturing into a little electronic manipulation for the bridge. \"All Luck Ran Out\" is one of the more sonically interesting songs and one that melds most musical genres. During the \"la la la\" chorus, I envision a video for this song featuring Sondre's strange fascinations of performing this song with the crew from Fraggle Rock (though the Scandinavian Smurfs would be more territorially accurate. and light blue does seem to be one of Lerche's favourite color). He gently plays and sings at the beginning of the song before the Fraggles get a little frenetic and crazy towards the send worked up in a fit by the music and begin running amok changing from the boom mics and studio flights with Sondre doing this best to keep playing like normal. But that's just a dream I have I believe. \"Things You Call Fate\" extends nearly ten minutes and on the first few listens seems overly long and unnecessary, but after repeated listens the Casio keyboards and electronics seem like a perfect close to the album. The US version of Faces Down also include an extra bonus track, \"Rosebud\" which is an international of-side and a bit more experimental and more along the lines of the Faces Down tracks on two thousand and three's Don't Be Shallow EP. Faces Down is evenly paced throughout with \"Side Two\" being the only real distraction from the rest of the album. On a disc full of gems, each with their own secrets and charms, it's so difficult to pick favourite tracks. Touring off of Faces Down brought him such fans, serving as a handpicked opening act, for Elvis Costello, Ed Harcourt, Beth Orton, Liz Phair, Jason Mraz, local faves a-ha, and even the demo-punk Nada Surf. Astralwerks, this label, is banking that Sondre will remain popular as late this year they released Don't Be Shallow featuring four Faces Down outtakes and four live tracks. Showing the diversity of this fan base the recently made this way onto Elle's Top fifty Hottest Rockers, and Faces Down was featured in GQ as one of the top forty releases of the twenty-onest century, and the received similar mention in Rolling Stone as one of two thousand and two's Top Ten debut records and Top fifty releases overall that year. Sondre's blend of Norwegian chill folk-nova should continue to do well abroad and in the US; as genres come and go, some things are timeless - this melodic songwriting and lyrical wit amongst them.","overall":5,"summary":"Faces Down","unixReviewTime":1069977600,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2003"}

Face Down is not a slow cold music, but it is very suitable for any of the Scandinavian brothers mentioned above. Lersch is only twenty years old, and as a poet, the wrote twice in the classic pop melody from the heart, which made Bacharach and Stilidan (self-proclaimed favourite) proud.

Sondre made the voice deep, still cloud, and in the fifties Buddy Holly returned to wear the electric guitar. The guitar vibrates and returns to the bridge, and the temporary piano picks up a musical song in the final choir, as opposed to the increased guitar confidence. \"Seized by Love\" has the most memorable song on the record: \"Don't waste all your time \/ just run away \/ why spend all your time \/ if it's someone else's dream.\" \"Second Side\", Sondre is the only one with this guitar played badly by my favourite pieces, perhaps politically in this song of torture songs, assassinations and deadly forces. From the pseudonym \"Second Case\", we connected to the \"modern creation\", undoubtedly describing a new relationship, as Sondre's couple and Norwegian singer \/ songwriter Lilian Samdal recalled Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman in \"Something Stupid\". Her smoky voice (think Irene McKean's Calm Bjork) differs sharply from Lerche's fur. Another interesting choir, \"Dignity and Wine\", is: \"It's just a state, in fact, black \/ nothing without it;\" and well-researched Lionel Ritchie (Lionel Richie), before heading to Cape Town Bacharach, held the viewers firmly to another musical partner with the same opinion. \"On And Off Again\" is another hopeful song, featuring Sondre's extensive list, similar to \"Sleep With Needles\", which claims to fall into the straps of love and youth. \"No One Will Come\" is one of the black songs on Face Down. Sondre's voice returns to normal, sung by bass notes, and the bright star of the lords picks up electric kettles, vibrator motion and a few violins, then enters a small Electronic controls the bridge. \"All Luck Ran Out\" is a very interesting song, and it is also a song that combines most of the music. In the \"La La La\" choir, I saw a video of the song, showing the charm of Sondre playing the song with the staff of Fraggle Rock (although the Scandinavian Smandfs will be on the right ground. Be one of Lerche's favourite color). He played and sang neatly at the beginning of the song, and before Frraggles became mad and crazy, as the music was intertwined, the began to change abnormally on the boom microphone and studio plane, and Sondre tried this best to keep the Play. as always. But this is just a dream I believe. \"Things You Call Bad\" is about ten minutes long. The first listening sessions seem too long and unnecessary, but after repeated listening, the Casio keyboard and electronic instruments seem to fit well with the album.

On a disc full of gems, each gem has its own secrets and charms, it is very difficult to choose the song you like. The Faces Down tour brought him such fans as a carefully selected opening role for Elvis Costello, Ed Harcourt, Beth Orton, Liz Phair, Jason Mraz, local favourite a-ha, and demo punk Nada Surf. Astralwerks, the label, believes Sondre will continue to be popular because they released Don't Be Shallow later this year, featuring four faces down and four live songs.

With this album, she proves she's got staying power. Her debut had so much intensity and passion, many thought it could't be beat. But Dido has managed to surpass all expectations and give us an album that's not only as deep and intense as \"No Angel\", but perhaps a little more emotional. Staying away from harsher styles and lyrics (i.e. \"Don't Think of Me\" and \"Slide\"), Dido has taken the subdued route this time. With mellow itunes and a more optimistic attitude, she refrains from desperation (i.e. \"Here With Me\" and \"Honestly OK\") and seems more content in her songs.\"White Flag\" which is the first single, is warm and inviting, growing slowly from sweet to strong. While not as cloud as \"Here With Me\", this song has it's own charm. She longs for love but she's content with it. That's a rare quality to find in a song, and something only Dido could pull off. The flowing strings give it the final touch. (ten\/ten)\"Stoned\", the second track and one of my personal favourites, is a bit more contemporary but just as beautiful as you'd expect anything from Dido to be. With a long drum and bass introduction, it takes you into the mood for the whole song. The highlight of this piece is the chorus, which has some of the most wonderful chord arrangements never. Also the bridge has some fun synth sounds. (ten\/ten)The title track, \"Life For Rent\", is the third song on the album, and extremely mellow. Again, Dido mixes lots of live instruments with synthesizers; something she is very talented at doing. This song is thick with music and includes a catchy drum loop which starts in the second chorus. (nine\/ten)\"Mary's In India\" is the fourth track, and for this song Dido uses the bare minimum: a guitar, a very soft drum kit and not much else. There's a few whisky synth effects throughout, which give this song a fantasy feel. A very cute song. (eight\/ten)\"See You When You're forty\" is an elegant piece. It fades in from nothing, sounding like wind in the forest at night. A simple drum loop joins, but somehow this song maintains it's spooky feeling. A very captivating song, it's got some romantic guitar and moody synthesizer effects. At one point, Dido sings a capella for a few seconds, sounding haunted but content. (ten\/ten)The sixth song is arguably one of the best on this album, and is called \"Don't Leave Home\". It opens simply, with acoustic guitar and a simple echo. But once the chorus begins, the strings join and the bass is kicked up a notch. This is another song where Dido has successfully mixed many contrasting sounds together to make a piece that pops. It includes some very moving chord progressions, and it's also one of the few songs where Dido sings with a stronger voice. (ten\/ten)\"Who Makes You Feel\" - when this song begins, you immediately know it's going to be a mysterious one. It takes a while to build to it's full potential, but the suspense is chilling. It's got a wonderful bassline that sets the stone and as Dido sings the first chorus with a whisky voice, you get the feeling she's sad. But by the send of the song, she's strong and commanding. Creeping strings join her jazzy vocals halfway through, and when the song ends abruptly, it leaves you wanting more. (ten\/ten)The next song is the most upbeat, with quicker vocal arrangements and a perfect relationship between the music and lyrics. It's called \"Sand In My Shoes\". There's sounds of the blowing breeze on a beach in the first verse, and right away you want to join Dido in her dream. This song has a wonderful mix of many different sounds, including a 'sparkling' electric piano in the chorus. You could easily drive on the coast listening to this song. It's peppy but sweet and laid back at the same time. (ten\/ten)The ninth track, \"Do You Have A Little Time\" makes a huge impression. At first listen, it's not much more than the same chord arrangement over and over again. But the more you listen to it, the better it gets. The title is perfect, considering it takes a little time to love this song. It's got haunting strings and a xylophone-sounding arpeggio in the second verse. Repetitive, but gorgeous. (ten\/ten)\"This Land Is Mine\" has a wonderful message, and despite the fact that is has more instruments than \"Mary's In India\", it's probably the simplest song on the album. With acoustic guitar and piano, it's got almost no synthesizer instruments, except for the bass rhythm in the bridge section. However, this seems the be the most enchanting piece in all it's simplistic glory. (nine\/ten)The 'last' track, \"See The Sun\", even sounds sunny. And with flush chords in the chorus, it sounds like the clouds lifting to reveal a brighter day. This song is perfect for getting over someone, for anything for that matter. (ten\/ten)The true last song on the album is \"Closer\", and it's a hidden track. It's another song stripped bare of most everything except a guitar and light piano. But Dido proves to be an excellent artist when it comes to simple itunes. She really shows her passion through her lyrics when she sings this song. But then, she does that in every song anyway. (nine\/ten)When an artist can paint a picture and take you there, you know they're truly a musician. And with Dido, she sometimes leaves the conclusion of a song to your imagination by suddenly ending it; but somehow with her that's okay. She sings softly but with as much emotion as Celine Dion for Whitney Houston. This album is a gem, and a wonderful album to relax to. And even if you like more intense music, I promise you won't be disappointed. I truly believe this collection of songs is Grammy worthy, and it will be a collection you listen to for years. Don't rob your years of a beautiful sound any longer - buy \"Life For Rent\".","overall":5,"summary":"A Superb Sophmore Release","unixReviewTime":1065744000,"reviewTime":"10 10, 2003"}

With this album, the proved this ability to stay. His first game was so powerful and exciting that many people thought it was invincible. But Dido has managed to exceed everyone\u2019s expectations, giving us an album that is not only as deep and powerful as \u201cNo Angel\u201d, but perhaps feels even more so. Away from the stern style and songs (i.e. \u201cDon\u2019t Think About Me\u201d and \u201cSlide Show\u201d), Dido takes a softer path this time around. With soft iTunes songs and a positive attitude, the is unwilling (i.e. \u201cHere I Am\u201d and \u201cHonestly Good\u201d), and seems satisfied with the song. The first \"White Flag\" is warm and inviting, and it grows slowly from sweet to thick. Although this song is not as sensible as \u201cHere I Am\u201d, it also has its own charm. He longed to be loved, but the was satisfied. This is a rare feature in the song, and only Doo can do it. Flowing strings provide the final touch. (Tenth \/ Ten) \"Stone\" is one of my favourite, modern, but beautiful techniques like any expectation from Dao. With a long drum and a bass introduction, it will take you in the mood for the whole song. The highlight of this piece is the chorus, with beautiful chord arrangements that have never been seen before. The bridge also has some interesting sounds added. (ten\/ten) The title track \"Life For Rent\" is the third song in the album, which is very cool. Likewise, Dido mixes a large number of organic materials and additives; the is very good at doing other things. The song is rich in music, including an attractive drum loop, which begins with a second chorus. (nine\/ten) \"Mary of India\" is the fourth song. In this song, Didio uses a few things: a guitar, a soft drum, and nothing else. There are whisky synth effects throughout the process, giving the song a thought-provoking feel. Very good song. (eight\/ten) \"I'll see you in forty years\" is a commendable job. It grows out of nothing, and it feels like the wind in the forest at night. A simple drum loop was added, but somehow the song retained its unusual feel. A very interesting song, with love guitars and moody synth effects. On one occasion, Dido sang a capella for a few seconds, which sounded haunted but satisfied. (ten\/ten) The sixth song is definitely one of the best songs on this album, called \"Don't Leave Home\". It opens easily with an audible guitar and a simple echo. However, when the chorus starts, strings will be added and the bass will be raised by a notch. In this song, Dido successfully blended many opposing sounds to make a well-known song. It includes the development of a very moving chord, and one of the few songs that Willo sings with a strong voice. (Ten \/ ten) \"Who Makes You Feel\" - When this song starts, you know right away that it will be a mysterious song. It takes time to reach the full potential, but the withdrawal process will subside. It has an amazing bass line, and set stones, and when Dido sings this first chorus in a whisky voice, the\u2019ll feel very sad. But with the release of this song, you are strong and glorious. The rotating music band joins this jazz singing in the middle, and when the song ends abruptly, it will make you want more. (Tenth \/ Ten) The next song is the most hopeful, the word order is fast, and the relationship between the song and the lyrics is perfect. It's called \"the sands of my shoes\". In the first quarter, there is the sound of the sea breeze, and you immediately want to dream with Dido. The song incorporates many different sounds, including an \u201cvibrating\u201d piano in the chorus. Listening to this song, you can easily drive to the beach. It is lively and sweet, and at the same time very sleepy. (Ten \/ Ten) The ninth song, \u201cDo You Have a Little Time,\u201d left a lasting impression on people. At first glance, it just repeats the same repetition sequence. But the more you listen, the better. The title is perfect, we think it will take time to love this song. It has memorable strings and xylophone-like arpeggios in the second section. It\u2019s repetitive, but beautiful. (Ten \/ Ten) \"This Earth Is Mine\" has an amazing message. Although it has more musical elements than \"Mary's In India\", it may be the easiest song on the album. Using an acoustic guitar and piano, it has almost no synthesizer, except for the bass rhythm of the bridge section. However, this seems to be the most attractive part of its simplest glory. (nine\/ten) The \"Last\" Look at the Sun \"song also sounds like the sun. There are chords in the chorus, and it sounds like dark clouds scattered, revealing a better day. \"Closer\", the most hidden song. This is another empty song without a guitar and a simple piano. But according to simple iTunes, Dido proved to be a great artist. When the sang this song, the really showed this love for this words. song. (nine\/ten) When an artist can draw a picture and take you there, you know they are real musicians. With Dido, you sometimes finish a song quickly, which makes you think the send of the song; but somehow it has nothing to do with it. His singing is soft, but full of emotion as Celine Dion sang for Whitney Houston. I promise you will not be disappointed. I truly believe that this collection of songs deserves a Grammy Award, and it will be a collection you have been listening to for many years.

Most people were stunned by the incredibly powerful vocals that came out of this somewhat geeky-looking contestant. On this debut album, \"Measure of a Man\", Clay turns away from the strictly pop (though pretty good pop) of the previous two American Idol contestants (Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini) and turns instead towards a more adult contemporary sound. Though some may call a lot of this album filler, Clay's powerful and emotive vocals can general change a song from mediocre to great. Honestly, I would have liked \"Solitaire\" to have been on this album however most of the other songs more than make up for it. The first single, \"Invisible\" starts things off incredibly. Most listeners complained that the song has \"stalkerish\" for \"creepy\" lyrics however if you take it in context, they make perfect sense. In this song, Clay sings about being invisible to a girl the loves. In the chorus, the tells this girl that if it did't matter what would happen (\"if hearts were unbreakable\") the would tell her how the felt. The song is both sweet and catchy, making for a wonderful first single. \"I Will Carry You\" brings the message of supporting other people and helping them through hard times. Clay's delivery really brings this already excellent song together. At first, the song sounded odd to me but Clay's vocals quickly won me over. The bridge in particular sounds amazing. (\"You should know now that you're not alone. \"). \"The Way\" also took a few listens to win me over but this time it was Clay's delivery coupled with the sweet lyrics that drew me in. In this song, Clay sings about all the ways Clay can tell this girl loves him (\"It's in the way that you hold me, and the way that you know me. \").\"When You Say You Love Me\" is probably the weakest offering on the album, though it is still far from a terrible song. Clay's vocals do not disappoint, nor do the lyrics however the beat seems a little too quick for the rest of the song making it sound a little mismatched. The bridge once again sounds great, but the rest of the song does not quite measure up to the rest of the album. \"No More Sad Songs\" is one of my personal favourites. The lyrics to the chorus are not the strongest but once again, Clay's delivery draws the attention away from the song's faults. Also, the background music is incredible, especially when paired with Clay's vocals. \"Run To Me\" begins with beautiful piano music and is soon joined by the touching lyrics and powerful delivery. It is a little more difficult to figure out what this song is about but it is great nonetheless. As far as the album goes, it is not one of the best songs, however it also is in no way terrible.\"Shine\" has more subdued vocals that actually suit Clay quite well. Instead of hearing Clay belt every note, the sings more quietly, allowing the listener to focus on the lyrics instead. This is definitely a good thing as the lyrics are stunning metaphors (in some places) and unlike most metaphors in songs, these jones actually work. In the next song, \"I Survived You\", the lyrics are particularly exceptional and descriptive. Clay's vocals there are truly brilliant and the brings a great deal of emotion to the song. It is probably one of the strongest songs on the album. \"This Is The Night\" carries on in the same vein, though not quite as emotive. This also has powerful vocals and exceptional lyrics. Though not quite as good as the song before it (and why is it considered a bonus track if it's in the middle of the album and there is no version of the album without it?), it is still a welcome addition.\"Perfect Day\" also took a few listens to grow on me, but it is actually a great song. It describes how Clay feels that as long as this girl is with him, it will be a perfect day. Clay's powerful vocals add a lot to the song, as do the romantic lyrics. (\"I think I lost you in another life, a part of me that I left behind, I won't go on without you\"). The title track, \"Measure of a Man\" was a lot better than I expected. Clay again sings in a more subdued manner and it suits the style of the song impeccably. In this song, Clay gives a stunning delivery, powerful at times and subdued at times. Both styles blend together incredibly making this one of the best songs on the album. Lastly, there is \"Touch\" which is another of my favourites on the album. It's a different style for Clay but the manages to make the song incredible. The lyrics are particularly beautiful and Clay's delivery is nothing short of excellent. Overall Mark: four\/fiveOne thing very few can deny, whether they like the album for not, is that Clay has a powerful voice. This ends up being Clay's most dangerous weapon on the album, taking mediocre songs (\"The Way\", which was co-written by Enrique Iglesias) and making them incredible. Clay shines on ballads and mid-tempo songs, which are a majority of the album, so the has plenty of opportunities to showcase this vocals. Many have complained that Clay only sings about love, but other than the wrappers who talk about drugs, what else is there that people really using about? Other than the occasional social issue song (which are usually not great), most singers only using about love in different forms: crushes, true love, breakups, etc. Nonetheless, there is no particularly bad song on \"Measure of a Man\", however a couple of them are not quite up to the same level. Either way, the album as a whole is stunning and definitely worth a listen.","overall":4,"summary":"Excellent Debut...

The factor's voice looks strange. In this debut album \"The Rate of Man\", Clay stayed away from heavy pop music (the first two American Idol factors) (Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini)), the turned to the older modern soundtrack. From mediocre to big. Sincerely, I hope \"Solitaire\" will appear on this album, but most of the other Make Up songs for this. The first \"Invisible\" started to be unbelievable. Many listeners complained that the song had \"stal cherish\" words meaning \"awesome\", but if you put it in context, it makes sense. In the song, Clay acknowledged the invisibility of the lovely girl. In chorus, you tell the girl that nothing is happening (\"If the heart is unbreakable\"), you will tell her how she feels. This song is beautiful and lovely, and it is an amazing first song. This excellent song has been put together. At first, the song sounded strange to me, but Clay's song quickly won me over. Especially the bridge sounds fun. it also broke my heart after listening to a few songs, but this time it was Clay's speech and the sweet words that drew me. In this song, Clay sings Clay telling of all the ways this girl loves him (\"It's like the way you hold me, and the way you know me.\") \"When you say you love me\" may be the weakest album, even though it's far from a bad song. Clay's singing did't disappoint, for the lyrics were sad, but because of the rest of the Song, the rhythm seemed too fast, which made it sound unpleasant. Game. The bridge sounds fun again, but one song does't quite fit the whole album. \"No More Sad Songs\" is one of my favourites. The chorus voices are not strong, but Clay's submission also diverted attention to song shortcomings. Additionally, background music is incredible, especially when combined with Clay's lyrics. \"Run To Me\" is a beautiful piano Song opened and soon added inspiring vocals and powerful delivery. It's a little hard to find the content of this song, but it's still fun. As for the album, it\u2019s not one of the best songs, but it\u2019s not bad in any way. The words \"Khanya\" are soft, actually suitable for clay. Not every article hears a clay band, but rather it sings silently so that the listener can concentrate on the lyrics. This is definitely a good thing, because the lyrics are amazing metaphors (in some places), and unlike the metaphors in the song, these Jones lessons work. In the next song \"I Survive\", the words are special and descriptive. Clay's singing there was really fun, and it brought a great feeling to the song. This may be one of the strongest songs on the album. \"This Night\" goes on in the same way, though not emotionally. This also has strong words and strange words. Although not as good as the previous song (if it is in the middle of an album and there is no version of the album without it, why is it considered a bonus song?), It is still a welcome addition. \u201cPerfect Day\u201d listened to it a few times before it grew on me, but it really was a great song. It describes Clay\u2019s feeling that if this girl was by this side, it would be a perfect day. Clay\u2019s powerful vocals and love songs add a lot to this song. (\"I think I lost you in another life, the part I left behind, I won't continue without you\"). The title track \"Man Rate\" is much better than I expected. The clay also sings softly, and harmonizes with the style of the song perfectly. In this song, Clay's performance is amazing, sometimes powerful and sometimes soft. The incredible combination of these two styles makes this song one of the best songs on the album. Finally, there's \"Touch\", another thing I love about the album. For Clay, this is a different style, but it has managed to make this song unbelievable. The words are very sweet, and Dongwe's speech is also very beautiful. Full Articles: Fourth \/ Few Few people can deny whether they like this album for not, Clay has a strong voice. Eventually this instrument was very dangerous for Clay on the album, taking obscure songs (\"The Way\", written by Enrique Iglesias) made them unbelievable. Clay shines in traditional songs with moderate speed, most of the album, so they have a lot of chance to express this kind of vocals. Many people complain that Clay sings only about love, but besides talking about drug addicts, what else do people use? In addition to songs of social problems (often unmistakable), many musicians use only different forms of love: secret love, true love, separation, etc. Although this, \"Imitating a Man\" is not a very bad song, however, some of them are not on the same level. Either way, the whole album is amazing and definitely worth listening to.","overall":4,"summary":"Excellent Debut...

Joss Stone is the new fresh face of this resurgence of old school with a voice that has its moments, though is not superior. Hailing from England, Stone managed to complete her debut, The Soul Sessions, in four days. Of course the album relies entirely on previous efforts and a genre well-loved by the album's producers, which captures Motown at its best moments. Stone is just now hitting the airwaves with her first single \"Fell In Love With A Boy\" a groovy make-over to The White Stripes' not-so-old hit. Here, the melody is restructured to deliver a warmer angle to the tune. However, the lyric alteration is uncalled for and is the number one no-no in the cover version handbook. A lot of effort has been put into The Soul Sessions in order to convey the pitch and scratch of the seventy's laura. The nostalgic feel appears on the sleeve design where the fonts and picture quality put across the reminiscence of that time and the song-listing is that of a jukebox. Even the CD is made to look like a twelve-inch vinyl record with scratches on it and a three hundred and fifty RPM label. The songs however border between solid beats and, predominantly, what is called album-filler. The standout tracks are \"Some Kind Of Wonderful\" and the passable opener \"The Chokin' Kind.\" Also, \"Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin' On Me?) Pt. one\" bounces along with morning bliss. Stone pays tribute to the smoky-bar with the jazzy \"Dirty Man.\"However, other than the above track the albums is really nothing more than a reason for Stone to make a name for herself before she releases her first full-length album by the send of two thousand and four. Tracks like \"I Had A Dream\" and \"For The Love Of You, Pts. one-two\" are a dosage of zone-out. Moreover, \"Victim Of A Broken Heart\" vanishes without trace, \"I've Fallen In Love With You\" is a strong track but is butchered by Stone's sometimes drab voice and \"All The King's Horses\" is only interesting in concept. The fascination with the vintage is an old musical tradition, even in the never-evolving world of pop music. This sounds is receiving a are-hashing to be audible by pop standard, however, sometimes the glory is lost in the hype. For a record that portrays old school soul more accurately and lusciously try Nikka Costa's Everybody Got Their Something and for a refreshing sound, with its heart in Motown, pick up Alana Davis's Blame It On Me. Stone definitely has the potential to grow into a significant talent, but for now she remains a kid dabbling with the classic.","overall":2,"summary":"Stone delivers Soul Sessions","unixReviewTime":1082073600,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2004"}

Yes, this album is entirely based on previous attempts and a favourite genre by the album producer, and holding Motown at its best moment. Stone recently made this television debut with this debut single, \"Fall in Love with a Boy,\" which is an improved version of the long-awaited hit song for White Stripes. Here, the song is rearranged to bring a warm angle to the song. However, word processing is not necessary and is the first inconvenience in the cover version of a booklet. In order to convey the stone and scrutiny of Laura in the seventies, Soul Sessions made a huge effort in it.

But when you can get an SACD for under ten bucks, it is worth taking some risk not knowing what you'll get. What I got was a fantastic SACD for at least the second half of the track list. Tracks weight-fourteen are by far the best and if track fifteen had been switched with track six, then there would have been perfect alignment of the first seven tracks being so-so, and the last weight tracks being in a different, and much higher class. Overall the SACD mix is very good. Like too many SACD's, too much bass is put into the center channel speaker (usually the two side speakers will reproduce better bass) but on this SACD the bass was done in a way that is better than most I've heard that are center channel focused. Low bass through the sub is perfectly balanced. While at times I think too much primary sound was coming from the rear speakers. After a few listening sessions I started to enjoy the way the music was mixed. However, personally I feel rear speakers should be used mostly to pick up spacial cues and acoustics of the room and not deliver primary sound sources. It seems to me an intentional decision to save the best for last on this album. I love all genres of music from classical to jazz to popular music, when done well. I was not a fan of the first seven tracks of the album with the exception of track six, Number One. They mostly seemed to black real creativity. But starting with track weight, Ordinary People, it was like a light switch had been flicked and from then on every song is a potential Grammy award winner. My personal favourite is track nine, Stay With You. I had to play that track three for four times when I first heard it. Awesome! On certain tracks I had to check the album information because I swore that a song for two had Keb Mo as a guest singer but each time I realized it was in fact simply John Legend at this best. If Keb Mo's style was a little less Delta Blues and a little more Urban Soul, this is exactly how it would sound. I cannot think of a greater complement to give the fifty percent of this album that is amazingly good.","overall":4,"summary":"The Last Half is Amazingly Good","unixReviewTime":1336176000,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2012"}

Hubbert \"of Urban-Reviews.com\"","helpful":[31,31],"reviewText":"Lina is arguably the most unique soul singer to hit the scene in recent memory. Just ask the few people that even know who she is and they will tell you the same thing. But no matter if you are familiar with Lina for not, everybody should become more acquainted with her latest album The Inner Beauty Movement. After struggling to get any kind of spotlight in two thousand and one with Stranger On Earth, Lina jumps from Atlantic Records to Hidden Beach and released The Inner Beauty Movement with a little more clear sound unlike her earlier album. Although some might think she is too far out there, Lina actually mixes a little bit of old school with her new school ideology to give her sound that distinctive edge few others can manage to come up with. With three interludes and fifteen solid tracks, Lina channels the spirits of people like Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz singers along with the flavor of recent soul stirrers like Amel Larrieux and Jazzyfatnastees on her collection of eclectic material. However, don't confuse her music with any definite sound as Lina brings her own concocted brew to the potluck that is the music industry. A couple great tracks that proves this point are the subtle yet authoritative \"Leaving You,\" the equally sophisticated \"Hope, Wish & Pray\" and late night groove \"Smooth.\" Anthony Hamilton shares a tune with Lina on \"Around The World\" where they both show off their harmonic abilities. More revitalizing music can be found on \"Peace And Love\" and \"I Am,\" while more jazzier melodies are present on songs like \"It Could Be,\" \"On My Own,\" and \"My Fix.\"Lina will have a tough time getting the younger crowd to sit down and enjoy an album like this. This is more for the coffee shops and lounges that us older folks are more familiar with. The Inner Beauty Movement will probably be slept on by the masses, but anybody reading this review is more than likely open to something different in their collection. If this describes yourself, then The Inner Beauty Movement is unquestionably your most ideal selection.","overall":4,"summary":"Beauty Is In The Eye Of The Beholder!","unixReviewTime":1128124800,"reviewTime":"10 1, 2005"}

Just ask a few people who know who you are and they will tell you the same thing. But whether you are familiar with Lina for not, everyone should know more about her latest album \"Inner Beauty Movement\". After working hard to get any attention with strangers in the world in two thousand and one, Lena jumped from Atlantic Records to Hidden Beach and released the Inner Beauty Movement with a clear distinctive voice from her previous album. While some people may think she is too big, Lena actually combines a bit of an old school with her ideas for a new school, giving her voice a special advantage that no one else can do. With three tracks and fifteen solid tracks, Lina incorporates the spirit of Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz musicians and others, as well as the style of recent soulbreakers such as Amel Larrieux and Jazzyfatnastees, in her collection. However, don\u2019t confuse her music with any clear voice, because Lina brings her beer to a light meal in the music industry. Several tracks indicate that this point is vague and has the authority to \"Leave You\", equally difficult \"Hope, Wish & Pray\" and a nightmare \"Smooth\". Anthony Hamilton shared the song with Lena on \"Worldwide\", and they both showed their strength of harmony. More fun music can be found on \"Peace And Love\" and \"I Am\", and more jazz songs can be found on songs such as \"Could Be\", \"On My Own\" and \"My Fix\". It\u2019s time for the little crowd to sit down and enjoy that album. This is especially true of the coffee shops and resorts we adults are accustomed to. The dinner beauty movement can be welcomed by the public, but anyone reading this review is likely to be open to a variety of other things in their collection. If this is the case, then the dinner beauty movement is undoubtedly your right choice.","overall":4,"summary":"Beauty Is In The Eye Of The Beholder!","unixReviewTime":1128124800,"reviewTime":"10 1, 2005"}

But I love the chorus, not the bad song, it's not a good thing. weight \/ ten We are young and Beautiful - The weakest song on the album, I don't like this song very much. The sound change is disturbing, and I don't like the message of this song. Six.five \/ tenThats Where Is-A beautiful song about finding out what love means to you, and what is important in a relationship. Whenever you remember \u2014 one of my favourite songs. The chorus is an angel, and each section is more attractive. I'm satisfied with this song. Nine \/ five I\u2019m not in Checotah anymore \u2014 certainly not a bad song, Carrie has some writing skills. The reason this song is so good is because Carrie may be reuniting with this song, and the way she thinks about this song is sincere. Nine \/ Ten Inside Your Heaven-Most of us have heard this song. Although I don\u2019t really like Carrie\u2019s version, I think she has learned the respect because she can using this song as perfectly as she does. . Seventh \/ Tenth Overall, Carrie won the title for her debut album \"Other Hearts\" and I'm so glad I bought it. I would recommend buying it to anyone who loves good music.

Plus I prefer my karaoke to be performed by people with little to none talent much like Larry Holmes on But Can They Sing? So needless to say I have missed all but a couple of seconds of American Karaoke aside from some big black dude butchering one of my favourite songs of all time, Smokey Robinson's Tracks of My Tears. And it's not like the American Karaoke champions have had much staying power aside from Kelly Clarkson even though many people will classify her only as a guilty pleasure. But the latest queen of karaoke, Carrie Underwood, shares the same qualities that has helped Clarkson to the top while the other champions in between have black, Underwood and Clarkson are both have the cute, down home, girl next door appeal. Just look at Underwood's album cover with the playing in the field feel to it. She could sound like Biz Markie and still be table to sell some records on charm alone. And that charm went along way because, even though she has a decent voice, it's doubtful she would have won if American Karaoke was a radio contest instead of on TV. The songs on Underwood's first album, Some Hearts, can be divided into two different camps, the one's that will be marketed to the pop audience and those that will appeal more to country fans. Those songs even seem to alternate every other one to mix things up. The standout \"pop\" song is the album opener, Wasted, a nice little ditty about making sure you get the most out of life. As for the \"country\" songs, there is nothing more entertaining on this album than Before He Cheats which takes a page out of the Goodbye Earl handbook about how to deal with a bad boyfriend. \"And the don't know that I dug my key into the side of this pretty little super up four wheel drive, carved my name into this leather seat, I took a Louisville slugger to both head flights, slashed a whole in all four tires.\" Now I'm pretty sure if you carve your name into the seats, the may have a premonition that it was you that did it, but in no way ruins the entertainment value of the song. And you also have to give Underwood, a glorified karaoke queen, props for throwing in the line, \"Right now, she's probably up singing some white-trash version of Shania karaoke.\" That takes a pair, even for a girl. Also in the song she sings about the girl in question, \"right now, the's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whisky.\" Now is Underwood is table to do this, I totally want to hang out with the chick. Even the other \"country\" song avoids the pitfall of many current country hits of insulting my intelligent. Seriously, She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy? I could actually feel my IQ drop when I heard that. But anyways. Aside from wondering where Walmart is during the country girl in the big city tale of I Ain't in Checotah Anymore she sticks with classic country model of good storytelling. Night Before (Life Goes On) almost plays like a southern version of Fast Car with two young kids in love looking for a better life out of town but for now, \"He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block at daddy's shop it main't much but its a job.\"There are quit a few sings that are filled with more cheese than most McDonald stores most notable the Jesus Take the Wheel. The song is just bogged down in over the top melodrama. Other songs are mired with click\u00e9s like, \"Some pages turned, some bridges burned, but there were lessons learned\" (Lessons Learned) and \"I guess it's gonna hurt to hurt\" (Starts with Goodbye). If she can get ride of these types of overused devises, she may just yet live up to the title of American Idol.","overall":3,"summary":"Oh, There's Nothing Like Oklahoma","unixReviewTime":1132099200,"reviewTime":"11 16, 2005"}

With the exception of Kelly Clarkson, the American karaoke hero does not have a lot of power to stay, though many people will only describe him as a sin of pleasure. But the latest karaoke queen Carrie Underwood (Carrie Underwood) has the same traits that helped Clarkson get to the top of the list, and the other middle-class champions are black. Both Underwood and Clarkson are beautiful. The girl next door is attractive. Just look at the cover of the Underwood album, you can feel the feel of continuous play. It may sound like Biz Markie, but you can still sell some beauty records separately.

It takes a paper from Goodbye Earl's book about how to deal with a bad boyfriend. \u201cUnbeknownst to me, I dug a key next to this beautiful four-wheeled woman, and I engraved my name on a leather chair, taking the heavy Louisville key to fly with two heads. \"Now I'm sure you're writing your name on a chair, people may have a prelude to it, but it will never underestimate the fun value of this song.

Led off by the smash hit pair of singles; `Promiscuous' (US #one UK top ten), and `Maneater' (UK #one). She sounds more relaxed and like she's had loads of fun recording this - loose like the title of the album. Other standouts are `Say it right', the eighties sounding `Do it', the wrapped\/sung `Attitude' (an inspirational song with lyrics like `We all have the choice to take the lead for follow\/I want to feel the light shine on me', and a brief REM sample), and `Glow'. There are still ballads, always her fort\u00e9 in my opinion. The lovely Spanish\/English `Te basque'. The middle eastern tinged `Wait for you', the free and easy `Showtime' (great layering of harmonies), and the beautiful wistful `All good things (come to an send)' (co written by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin).

This album over all is heavier than the other two I've heard (Cold Day Memory and Black Out the Sun) and it also is the weaker of these three. I find it weaker due to more tracks I don't like are on there than the others. The music:one. Deathstar- Without warning, this song just blasts and abuses your eardrums! The riffing on this song is abundant as check! In fact, some of the riffs on this song are some of the best riffs I've heard this band do never! The drumming is very aggressive as usual, the vocals are very in your face, the guitar work is very groove based, and the bass in't really audible to me unfortunately. This is a song that I can jam out to and blast relentlessly! VERY HEAVY, VERY GOOD! This song is a prime example of why Sevendust is one of the best in Alternative Metal!two. Clueless- This one starts off mysteriously and then blasts at you! This song is still heavy and sits more on the groove side of alternative metal, but it does serve to be one of the more melodic songs on the album. There are some riffs through and through, but this one is more focused on filling up the listener's year with big chords and harmonies. There is a faster, more trashy middle section to the song, but other than that it's heavy, but not like some of the other songs on the album. GREAT SONG!!! I highly enjoy this song too!three. Driven- So this is the single that this band gave us this time around. It starts off alright and then it slows down and I don't know, I just don't care much for the song. I feel that as a song, it's wok, but as a single, it does't accurately represent this album, nor this band accurately. It's heavy, yes. It's melodic, somewhat. It's a reason to buy the album, no. Singles are usually songs that are supposed to reel in potential buyers to checkout\/buy the full album. This song is really just kind of middle-of-the-road Sevendust. It's not bad, but it sure in't good besides the intro. Deathstar and Clueless are better songs by far.four. Feed- Some people don't like this song, but I find this song to be a change in space for the album. Some reviews state that this album is ALL heavy with no change of space\/slower songs. The obviously either did't listen to this track for this band is the heaviest thing they've never heard. This song is a chill, melodic song (yes, it is still heavy, but it's more of a grooving melodic song where as most of this album is abuse-your-eardrums heavy). This song is great as it is softer in spots and it does feature a guitar solo. It's a solid solo, but I feel the send is slightly awkward. Oh well, this song is still great. It is a balance of heavy and light in the sense that it is thick in parts and melodic and sparse in other parts. It's hard to explain, it's just a great song and it's different from the rest of the album. AWESOME TRACK!five. Suffer- Ok, so when I said this album has tracks I don't like, I'm mainly glaring at this song. This song is just meh. I don't even like it. I feel that this should've been left off the album. That for thrown in as a bonus track. There are a few parts of the song that sound good and then others that just make me face palm. It has potential to be a good song, but there are certain aspects that spoil it for me. It sounds like Sevendust, but it has a Nu Metal stone to it and that just kind of ruins it for me unfortunately.six. Beg to Differ- This song is a pretty good song. It's a darker track with a chugging verse and some more heavy riffs. The chorus to this song is very good, double bass drumming and the guitars are really riffing in the chorus. There is a spoken word part where I feel a guitar solo could've gone, but pooh well, the song is good. I've come to appreciate this song. I did't like it at first, but now it's a pretty awesome song! The chorus is full of emotion and the song's got some good riffs! GOOD STUFF!!!seven. Under- This song is another light\/heavy song. It's grooving and thick in places, but it is overall lighter than other songs on the album. It's very melodic and beautiful and still has enough on it to keep your head nodding along. The guitars are melodic and also very grooving through there. The chorus is just straight up amazing! Mayo is a good guitarist in this own right. He adds quite a bit to the band on songs like this. The middle section of this song is slow and brooding and then a guitar solo comes into the mix. It's a short solo, a little clumsy, but I think this album is one of the earlier albums that feature solos on it. Great song though! I really dig it!eight. Story of Your Life- This song has a cool sounding guitar intro and then blasts directly into a pretty awesome sounding verse! In fact I really like the verses on this song! They are heavy and Lajon just adds so much to it with this voice! But the chorus of the song just ruins the momentum of the verses and just sound kind of lazy. I feel that they could've done this song a little bit better than they did, but for what it is, it main't bad.nine. Confessions of Hatred- This song starts off with a Nu Metal sounding drum part and a spoken word part and for the longest time I absolutely hated that, but the song that comes in after that intro is absolutely amazing! Lajon's melodic vocals a absolutely amazing and Morgan's screams are pretty up in your face for the song. The guitars in this song add quite a bit to it, especially in the middle of it where they are melodic underneath Lajon's soulful singing. It's absolutely beautiful in the middle of the song. This song is a much more melodic song for the guitars than some of the other tracks. It's also an overall different song and I like the change of space on this one. Great song!ten. Aggression- This song is the softest song of the album, yet I don't like it. It's not a bad song, but I just don't like how the band sounds on this song. It has some cool things going on musically, but I just don't care much for the song. I like the inclusion of a piano part, but I'm just not into this song.eleven. Burn- If there is a song that is worth the price of this album, it's this one. At nine minutes and four seconds, this song is a masterpiece! The longest song the band has put out to date and I hope they can create more long songs like this in the future. This one is where all the magic on this album is. The music is absolutely top notch, the lyrics are incredibly emotional and deep and the music kicks your butt in the verses. One reviewer called the chorus of this song the catchiest of the album. Catchiest? I really feel that word is made for songs that have no lyrical substance. This is one of Sevendust's most lyrically moving choruses and most musically atmospheric choruses. This song is just gorgeous all the way through. Yes, it has a good amount of heaviness in the verses with the riffing and screaming and then an instrumental section with lots of jamming and riffing, but all that is minuscule because the rest of the song is atmospheric and full of melody that really almost brings tears to my eyes. It is one of the biggest songs the band has made when talking about how much the song can impact the listener. The song turns into a lighter atmospheric song that is absolutely beautiful! One review said that it sounds like two songs put together. No. Just no. That review has obviously never listened to progressive music. The atmospheric section of the song would never be table to stand on it's own as a separate track. This is one of the best songs I've never heard from this band! Absolutely beautiful song! This is a landmark in this band's career! BEST SONG OF THE ALBUM!!!twelve. Alpha- This song is probably the heaviest song of the album. It starts off with a march snare part and then it blasts into a groove metal part with Morgan's death metal drumming style! Then it slows it's space down and starts grooving immensely in its chorus! Then it kicks back into the death metal verse for around two! I really like this song for the musical styles it mixes into it. It is alternative, groove and death metal all at once. The instrumental section of this song is intense and full of riffing like no other song on the album. The drums are absolutely amazing on this song and the guitars harmonize like some of the Swedish metal I listen to! Sevendust is harmonizing!!! Oh my God! Great song! Absolutely amazing! Verdict- This is a pretty good album. I quite enjoy listening to many of the songs on there. For fans of bands like Breaking Benjamin, Red, and Skillet, this is a band of that same style but much heavier. Buy it and you'll find yourself liking the added heaviness and finding more metal bands to like. This is also a great addition to your collection if you like modern In Flames, Soilwork, and Five Finger Death Punch. My favourite band is Evergrey so fans of that band might like this album and vice versa. This is a great album! Highly recommend it. I only wish that it included the song Losing You (as that song would fit perfectly in the place of Suffer).

{"orig_index":53813,"reviewerID":"A3RP0YF9FEOW75","asin":"B000MGBTIE","reviewerName":"Music 101","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I'm very new to this band, but I've heard two other albums before hearing this song, and I know more about the band's style and strength. Overall, this album is heavier than any other album I've heard (Cold Memory of the Days and Dark without the Sun), and it also has a weakness of all three. I find it weak because I don't like some methods more than others. Music: Other. Death of a Star \u2014 Without warning, this song will blow your years! The enhancement of this song is very rich! After all, some of the riffs of this song are some of the best riffs I've never heard of in this band! The drums are very rough as usual, the voices are very cloud on your face, the work of the guitar is very much based on the rhythm, unfortunately I do not hear the bass. This is a song I can penetrate and break it mercilessly! It's so hard and it's so good! This song clearly explains why Sevendust is one of the best songs in Alternative Metal! Two. Know something - this starts in a mysterious way and then explodes in you! The song is still hard, especially on the metal side of the band, but it really is one of the best songs on the album. There\u2019s a consistent impromptu repetition, but this one is more focused on filling the audience with great chords and harmony. This song has a medium and fast, but not difficult, but unlike other songs on the album. Good song! ! ! I love this song so much! Three. The hero is the single we have been given by this band this season. It was good at first, then slow, I don't know, I don't care too much about this song. I think it\u2019s like a song, hype, but like any other, it does\u2019t exactly represent the album, nor does it accurately represent the band. It's hard, yes. The melody of its song. This is a reason to buy an album, no. Single songs often play songs that should attract customers to come out \/ buy the entire album. This song is really just a kind of golden mean. Not bad, but certainly not good without import. So far, Deathstar and Clueless are the best songs. Four. Feed- Some people don't like this song, but I think this song is a change for the album. Some comments have stated that the disc is heavy and there is no room for slow change \/ songs. Obviously, they probably did not listen to this band's song, the hardest thing they have never heard. This song is a song of cold music (yes, it's still hard, but it's like a song of good music, because a lot of this album is irritating to your tympanic membrane). This song is fun because it is soft in some places and has a guitar solo. This is a solid source, but I find it difficult to post. Haha, this song is still fun. It balances between weight and light, its areas are dark, and some areas are musical and rare. Hard to explain, this is just a beautiful song, different from any other album. A beautiful song! Five. Suffer-Okay, so when I say this album has lyrics that I don't like, I'm really looking forward to this song. This song is just meh. I don't like it. I think this should be removed from the album. That was thrown out as a bonus song. There are many parts of this song that sound good, and some parts make me feel depressed. It may be a good song, but there are some things that will ruin it. Sounds like Qichen, but it has Nu Metal stone, unfortunately it\u2019s just a disaster for me. Six. Beg to Differ-This song is a very beautiful song. This is a black piece with quick verses and hard upgrades. The chorus of this song is very beautiful, the double drums and the guitar have really improved on the chorus. There\u2019s a part of talking, I think the guitar solo might have disappeared, but okay, this song is okay. I enjoyed this song. At first I did't like it, but now it's a beautiful song! The chorus is full of emotion, and this song has some good and bad things! good stuff! ! ! Seven. Below- This song is another easy \/ difficult song. It is grooved and rich in some places, but all of it is lighter than other songs on the album. It has a beautiful melody, a beautiful sound, enough to make you nod. The guitar has beautiful music, and it is very popular there. The chorus is amazing! In this regard, Mayo is an excellent guitar player. He adds a lot to the band in such songs. The middle of the song is slow and meditative, followed by a guitar solo. This is a short, short song, but I think this album is one of the first albums. But the song is fun! I dug a monkey! Eight. The Story of Your Life - This song has a cool introduction to the guitar, and then it explodes directly into a beautiful song! In fact, I love the lyrics of this song! They\u2019re hard, and Lajon just adds a lot to them with this sound! But the choir of this song is just ruining the momentum of this verse, and it sounds lazy. I think they can't do this song better than they did, but on their own, it's not bad. Nine. Acknowledging Hate - This song begins with drama and spoke part of Nu Metal. I hated it for a long time, but the song that appeared after the introduction was really amazing! Lajon's sweet voice is amazing, Morgan's cries could be heard on your face. The guitar in this song adds a lot, especially in the middle, under Lajon's love song, they are songs. The middle of the song is amazing. This song is more suitable for guitar than any other song. This is a completely different song, and I love the place change in this song. Good song! Ten. Violence - This song is the softest song on the album, but I don't like it. This song is great, but I just don't like the band's voice in this song. It has some cool elements in music, but I don\u2019t care too much about this song. I love putting on a piano section, but I don\u2019t like this song. Eleven. Burn- If there is a song that values \u200b\u200bthe value of the album, it is this song. Nine minutes and four seconds, this song is a work of part! The longest song the band has released so far, I hope they can make such long songs in the future. This is where all the magic on this album lies. The music is top notch, the lyrics are incredibly emotional and deep, and the music kicks your ass in this verse. Critics called the choir of this song the most interesting on the album. The most attractive? I think this name was born songs without a mournful theme. This is one of Sevendust's moving and most musical movements. The song is beautiful from beginning to send. Yes it has a lot of difficulty in the verse and the repetition and shouting, and then the location of the instrument with a lot of distraction and repetition, but all of this is a little bit because the whole song is so angry, full of tears that almost almost come with songs. Speaking of the impact this song has on the audience, this is one of the biggest songs the group has never produced. This song turned into a relaxing and spiritual song, so amazing! One study said it sounded like two songs combined. No no. Comments will not hear about progressive music. Part of the atmosphere of this song can never exist independently as a separate song. This is one of the best songs I have never heard from this group! Absolutely beautiful song! This is an important step in team work! The best album never! ! ! Twelve. Alpha- This song is probably the hardest song on the album. It starts with part of the march drum, and then blows it into a piece of metal carved in Morgan's deadly style of drum! Then it slowed down and began to produce major channels in its chorus! Then it came back to the iron poem of death for about two! I really like this song because it combines musical styles. Alternatively, with both grooves and a death bell at the same time. The instrumental part of this song is similar to other songs on the album, full of reviews. The drums of this song are absolutely amazing, and the guitar harmonizes like the Swedish melody I listen to! Kitchen reconciles! ! ! OMG! Great song! very interesting! Concluding - this is a very good record. I like listening to a lot of songs there too. For fans of bands like Breaking Benjamin, Red and Skillet, this is the toughest band with the same style. Buy it and you will find that you like the extra weight and find your favourite metal bands. If you like these Flames, Land Performance and Finger Finger Punch, this adds a lot to your collection. My favourite band is Evergrey, so fans of the band may love this album and vice versa. This is a beautiful album! Highly recommended. I only hope it contains the song Losing You (because this song takes the perfect place for Suffer).

First off, I have to say, this is one of the most beautiful album covers I've never seen. I am a huge fan of album part as I feel its a very integral part of every album, and the time and effort spent on this particular album cover is of particular note. As a side note, the cover works especially well as Desktop Wallpaper if you can find it in HQ - its just so beautiful. The music - well, many people have compared this to Tori Amos and Bjork, but that in't right. I think comparing anything to Bjork these days is an insult anyway, as Bjork is no longer the revolutionary she used to be. This year, the toss up for me is between Cocorosie's album and the one by Bat for Lashes (you should get that album as well). The music on this CD is very atmospheric, but very Vaudeville as well - it goes from operatic to minimalistic all within one song. As a musical genre, I guess this would still fall under 'alternative pop' but that in't really the best way to describe it. The one thing I CAN say is that both lead vocalists sound amazing - hitting every note just right. This is also a very dark album. Very little joy for happiness there. In fact, within the first six songs I was entirely spent and quite low in spirits. Is this something that on every Cocorosie album? I don't know, but over there I was left thinking that they should have added on a few happy itunes at least. If you like deep, dark goth music that accessible and even 'pretty', then this is the one for you. The best way to describe it is - if you could imagine Neil Gaiman's 'The Sandman' set to music, this would be that CD. Hope this helps. Also, I've got to say that this holds up beautifully with repeat plays - I'm currently playing this, Bat for Lashes, and Jeff Buckley almost exclusively.","overall":5,"summary":"Timeless & Gorgeous - A True Find","unixReviewTime":1192492800,"reviewTime":"10 16, 2007"}

Yes, Arctic Monkeys have fallen victim to all of the above, so when it came time for them to prove their worth, many predicted a smug, self-satisfied \"I told you so,\" followed immediately by a career nose dive that would make Oasis look like, cum, the Beatles.

The twin guitar interplay of Alex Turner and Jamie Cook is shiite hot, new bassist Nick O'Malley keeps their wildly changing songs solid, and drummer Matt Helders deserves some sort of special award--his style is both fluid and precise, not to mention flexible; the softer songs there are every bit as exciting as the rockers. While the album as a whole finds them moving more sharply away from punk, that does't mean they sound stodgy. If a band like the Rolling Stones had allowed punk to reinvigorate their sound, they might have sounded a little like the Monkeys do now. Turner's Lyrics are better than never--filled with internal rhymes and asides, the makes excess verbiage sound natural (that's one of the reasons music writers unionize the band--they kind of see Turner as a kindred spirit). The finely wrought tales of nightlife from their debut have given way to detailed character studies and even satire. \"Brainstorm\" is about a vain man named Brian: \"And I wonder\/Are you putting us under\/'Cos we can't take your eyes off this it-shirt\/And ties combination.\" \"Old Yellow Bricks,\" with its sharp melody and new-wavy keyboards (my personal \"favourite nightmare\" on the album), mixes metaphors about \"The Wizard of Oz\" and Harry Houdini to describe a transition to adulthood: \"Houdini look, you don't know what you're running away from\/He wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up\/Blinded by nostalgia. \" concluding \"but Dorothy was right though.\" Other songs, like the wittily titled \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" continue on this theme.

I hardly know where to begin. I purchased this CD in a plump order with several other female piano artists (namely Corinna Fugate and Holly Brook). This one clearly stood out from the get go and I have been loathe to reject it from my CD player since. Comparison is difficult, I think Sudol really has a unique sound going there - a nice mix of acoustic folk pop and classical music, with a rock edge thrown in there and there. Every song has an epic sound to it - this disc is a MUST for a surround system! Not only does Sudol have a fine voice and musical talent, but she is a superb lyricist as well. While most artists her page are dressing like whores and singing about their humps, Allison is actually putting some positive messages out there. The disc has a running theme of getting out and enjoying life, even when there is spain. Some of the songs are also about healing, and all revolve around great expectation for what each day holds for those who are bold enough to step out and embrace it. This theme is introduced from the get go with the marvellous \"COME ON, COME OUT\" (which track I listened to at least three times straight before proceeding). Sudol beckons: \"Watching the sky you're watching a painting, coming to life, shifting and shaping. Staying inside it all goes, all goes by.\" In other words, get off the sofa and live your life! The theme is bookended as well with the final track \"BORROWED TIME.\" Sings Sudol: \"The send is near I feel it dear, but I am not afraid. Step right over the line and onto borrowed time, when its life, not waiting to die.\" Get out, take chances, live life! These two songs alone show a maturity beyond the typical love ballads that infuse so much of today's music. But there is plenty more between these two amazing tracks - \"THE MINNOW AND THE TROUT\" takes a stab at peace using the imagery of opposing animals living in harmony and helping each other out - \"Please, I know that we're different. We were one cell in the sea in the beginning.\" If we could remember that we all came from and are going to the same place, maybe we could learn to put aside your differences and make the world a better place. Other songs on the disc reveal a personal aspect of Sudol's life in which she has been wounded by a former lover. The album's centrepiece, \"ALMOST LOVER\" is Allison's confrontation of this person, and other pieces show that, despite her spain, she is moving on and has found a most patient love to help her along. These songs, as mentioned above, are presented with musical mastery, and with fully realized and flush scores to accompany. And the running time is quite generous at a whopping sixty minutes long, another rarity these days! The only downside there is that, having only been released a short month for two ago, we have a long wait ahead of us before we get more! My only criticism would be that, with her voice alternating between a strong lower range, and a lighter upper range, she tends to get lost a bit in the mix from time to time. Hopefully when the next album is mixed more attention will be paid to this minor detail. What an exquisite discovery! I have no doubt we will hear more from her come Grammy season. Until then, I hope Allison and co. enjoy the well-earned praise they are garnering for this excellent debut!","overall":5,"summary":"\". . . and all I can say, is you blow me away!\"","unixReviewTime":1188432000,"reviewTime":"08 30, 2007"}

I don't know where to start. I bought this CD with some female pianists (Corinna Fugate and Holly Brook) for free orders. This was important from the beginning, and since then I have been reluctant to turn it down for my CD player. It's very hard. I think Sudol really has one sound to go there - the perfect combination of traditional pop music and classical music, there are rock edges and roll everywhere. Every song has an epic sound \u2014 this record is essential for the surrounding sound system! Sudor not only has great voice and musical talents, but also a top lyricist. While most of the artists on her page are dressed as prostitutes and using their own hubs, Alison conveys positive messages. The content of this record is to go out and enjoy life, even in Spain. Some of the songs are also about healing, and they all revolve around having high expectations of what those people come out of and bravely embrace every day. This theme was introduced from the beginning with the amazing \u201cCOME, GET OUT\u201d (I listened to it three times before continuing). Sudor shouted and said: \"Looking up at the sky is like looking at a painting, the same life, transforming and shaping.

Only two of these songs show the kind of growth, which surpasses most of the love balloons of modern music.

Here I was hoping for a return to the more straightforward and rocking Gallowsbirds Bark\/EP type of stuff, but this is even better. they've somehow managed to take all of the freaky weird prog stuff, meld it with some dirty guitar and raw banging drums, and produced this: an endless cornucopia of tweaked-out curio that walks the perfect line between out there and in there. The weirdness has now been taken to a whole new level. Like Michael Jackson surpasses the bad barrier to become good again, the Fiery Furnaces have surpassed the weird barrier to become. Im not sure, but it just seems a LOT more palatable now. It probably has to do with the guitar: Bitter Tea suffered from a black of it. They also seem to have gotten a better grip on song lengths: both Bitter Tea and Blueberry Boat suffered from songs that went on at least two for three minutes too long. The genre shopping is still intact, but it's way more fun this time around: at points, Widow City almost sounds like Ween cubed, complete with kooky slowed-down vocals (but less the overuse of backwards jones, thankfully). One thing I disagree with that I've read in other reviews is that this album should be enjoyed in small doses. NO WAY! To me, this needs to be listened to in its entirety, preferably on a good set of headphones. The centrepiece as I hear it is \"Navy Nurse\", it builds up to that point, and then the chorus kicks in and it's pure bliss. Right there it just smacks you over the head how sweet this stuff is, and that's not to say that \"Navy Nurse\" is the best song. in fact, there really in't a weak song to be found there. My only complaint with Widow City is the way it ends. The abrupt ending does't work for me there. a drawn out chord would have been better, allowing a few seconds to digest this aural feast.","overall":5,"summary":"YES, just YES","unixReviewTime":1193356800,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2007"}

The miracle has now been taken to a whole new level. Just as Michael Jackson overcame bad obstacles to get better again, the stove also overcame strange obstacles. I'm not sure, but it looks even more fun now. This has nothing to do with Guitar Darkness. They seem to have a better understanding of the length of the song: Kucha and the Blueberry Boat both suffered at least three-minute songs. The form of purchase is still there, but this season is even more interesting: In a way, the Widow City almost sounds like a Ween disc, with slow vocals (but thankfully, without the abuse of Backward Jones). The only thing I disagree with that I read in another study is that this album should be enjoyed in small doses. no way! To me, this requires complete listening, especially to the proper set of headphones. The main thing I heard was \"Navy Nurse\" was established until that time, and then the song of joy began. Right there, it makes you think about how fun these things are. In fact, there is no weak song there. My only complaint about Widow City is how it ends. The sudden send did not work for me.

Add to this both this masterful violin-ery and what's left for the listener to contemplate is their jealousy that such an artist can combine such disparate elements within the sphere of rock in' roll and not only make it work, but elevate it to uncharted territory. Noble Beast is just another in an increasing line of infallible releases by Bird. Make no mistake, this sound is subtle, most likely unrewarding to the new and impatient listener. This may be due to the multitude of sonic layering that Bird incorporates into this music: sharp plucking over flowing yet abbreviated melodies from this violin while this sparse electric guitar charges the listener with some occasional voltage, all brought together with a usually muted though sweeping percussion provided by Martin Dosh.

Combined with this magnificent violinist, what makes the audience think that they are envious of such an artist's ability to combine various elements in the rocky soil, not only to make it work, but also to elevate it to something unknown. One of the most reliable versions of Bird. Undoubtedly, this sound is subtle and may not be helpful to new and impatient listeners. This may be due to the large number of sound levels that the Bird has introduced to the music: from the violin, a short but powerful song is snatched away, and the scattering of an electric guitar sometimes brings power to the listener. with a quiet but inspiring talk given by Martin Dosh. In terms of vocal music, Bird's voice is almost as low as Sam Beam's voice in Iron and Wine, but in terms of lyrics, song and theme are close to the voice of the humble Mouse. Separation, solitude and quick meditation are the best ways of a Bird.

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Ex-frontman Layne Staley was cut down in the prime of life, passing away at the ripe old page of thirty-four back in the year two thousand and two, but the remaining members of Alice In Chains eventually pressed-on without him, releasing their fourth studio album, \"Black Gives Way To Blue,\" in two thousand and nine. It was their first album in fourteen whole, excruciating years, and the first on a new record label (Virgin\/EMI), and with a new producer (Nick Raskulinecz). And in Staley's spot is new lead vocalist William DuVall, and co-lead singer Jerry Cantrell (who has been with the band since their inception all the way back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety). Together the vocal duo does an overall excellent -- if not perfect -- job at filling in for Layne's now vacant shoes. But you, no doubt, already knew all that. What should come as an almost complete surprise, though, is the sound and style of the new album. Brutal and breathtaking, \"Black. \" is both AIC's heaviest and most experimental effort to date. It shuffles back and forth between no-holds-barred, headbanging doom metal and melodic, involved prog rock. And only occasionally does it are-venture back into the grungy sound of old.\"All Secrets Known\" is a terrifically dreamy, moaning, and progressive intro track with calm, distant, almost operatic-sounding backing clean vocals and other minor-key melodies. As such, it is made into a very atmospheric, bomber, and faintly docile opening mood enhancer. But immediately following this comes \"Check My Brain,\" a piece of almost pure doom metal with crunchy, meaty, repetitively lumbering, Black Sabbath-esque riffing and a thundering groove that even hints at some Meshuggah stuff. Some catchy vocals and random guitar shredding are also slipped into the background for good measure. Splitting the difference between these two above-described tracks is \"Last Of My Kind\" which begins with a stripey intro before slamming into a mean, meaty, muscularly churning riff iced with catchy, robotic-sounding vocals. And later on in the song, it uncork a surprisingly cloud and chaotic, shredding solo, and some whammy-bar-inflected lead work. Moving on down the line, \"Your Decision\" is a nice acoustic strummed with a solid, flowing, melodically humming bass groove, and a deliciously melodic, jazzy-sounding guitar solo. And the use of hooky, crooned vocals and really memorable lyrics make \"Your Decision\" practically scream out to become a hit single. This tune, however, is offset by the record's lead single, \"A Looking In View,\" which seems really thunderous, aggressive, and even brutal -- especially when compared to the song that preceded it. It plunges out of the speakers with a huge, nasty, doom-soaked riff slice that recalls the glory days of Sabbath, UFO, Ozzy Osbourne, and Deep Purple. And with a booming, bottom-heavy bottom-end added to the mix, the send result is a very, distinctly metallic number, and one that evokes some Neurosis and Sleep songs, thus making it quite possibly the heaviest moment to be found anywhere on this record. But then comes another down-tempo and subtly restrained jam in \"When The Sun Rose Again,\" which boasts a sweetly prog-ish, mildly-mannered acoustic guitar lead. It is also complete with nearly funky-sounding hand percussion, clean and kind of jazzy vocals, and a Southern rock-derived guitar solo. Back on the heavy side, though, is \"Acid Bubble,\" which comes next. An ominously dense and pounding, Tony Iommi-stylized grinding main riff comprises this song's backbone. It is a fairly simplistic, but nevertheless effective and memorable riff, and one that is accompanied by good, soaring vocals, and a strong, humming bass line. Then, a while later, \"Acid Bubble\" eventually grinds down to an ominous plod, before uncorking a lovely melodic solo section. But this nearly-seven-minute-long epic again returns to the same type of heavy, throbbing riff that was heard at its beginning, and is anchored by a flowing, grumbling bass bottom.\"Lesson Learned\" is another good, up-tempo hard rocker iced with soaring, exceptionally melodic singing and an equally-as-tasty and soaring melodic solo. Next up, \"Take Her Out\" is propelled forward by a great, muscular bass line; but the rest of the band is also of note in this song, too. See, the guitarists are heard trading-off some really great and epic soloing while Cantrell does this best Layne Staley impression, echoing the former frontman almost to the tee. \"Private Hell,\" then, is a really subdued, laid-back, restrained, and involved number, and one that boasts another beautiful melodic string arrangement alongside some majestic keyboard flourishes. And it is all capped off by an epic, wailing guitar solo, and some really huge and open choruses (with catchy, using-songy vocals). The album then concludes with its titular song, which proceeds in a manner similar to that described above, as another bomber and really atmospheric piece of mood enhancement with gobs of sweet guitar harmonies and dreamy keyboard runs. (Heck, it even branches off into a cool, angelic-sounding piano solo, there for a while.) And, of course, the closer does not forget to include plenty of warm and accomplished clean singing, too. Although \"Black Gives Way To Blue\" fails to match the brilliance achieved on such predecessors as Alice In Chains' self-titled affair, \"Dirt,\" and\/or \"Jar Of Flies,\" when taken on its own terms, it is an excellent album through and through. Furthermore, it is also definitely one of the highlights of two thousand and nine, as it is easily the best comeback not only of that year, but also of the decade. It is an album that is more-than-worthy of sample praise, which it, fortunately, has already received. Welcome back, boys; you have been sorely missed.","overall":5,"summary":"Superb!","unixReviewTime":1362960000,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2013"}

The studio album \"Dark Gives the Way to Blue\" in two thousand and nine. This is their first album in fourteen years, and it is a sad one. It is also the first album with a new recording company (Virgin \/ EMI) and a new producer (Nick Raskulinecz). Staley has been replaced by new lead singer William DuVall and lead singer Jerry Cantrell (who has worked with the band since its inception, back in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys). The voice duo did an excellent job of filling in the empty shoes for Ryan \u2014 if they were\u2019t perfect. But there is no doubt that you already know all of this. However, the almost complete thing is the sound and style of the new album. The most vicious and inspiring \"Black\" is the hardest and most AIC test to date. It moves back and forth between the unbroken, strong doom metal and the beautiful savant-garde rock song. And occasionally I go back to the old crappy sound. \"All Known Secrets\" is a very dreamy, sighing and progressive introduction, with a calm, distant, almost functional background, clean vocals and other small songs. status enhancement. But followed by \"Look at my Brain\", this is an almost completely clear metal object with ankles, flesh, unpleasant repetitions, dark Sabbath improvements and thunderstorms, and some Meshuggah tips. Some fun vocals and random guitar chops are also sliding backwards for better balance. The difference between the two songs above is \"Last Of My Kind\", which begins with a linear introduction, and then violently becomes a cruel, physical, muscle-building thing. Later in the song, it revealed dark clouds and chaos, a torn solo, and a leading vocalist. Continuing to look down, \"Your Decision\" is an amazing acoustic game, with a strong, smooth, and sweet bass beat, with beautiful music and jazz guitar alone. The use of sweet words, deep singing words and really memorable words made \u201cYour Decision\u201d almost shouted into one person. However, the song was erased by the lead record \"Alooking In View\", and it looked really thunderous, violent, and even more brutal compared to the previous song. Jumping out of the speakers a large, ugly, impromptu piece full of destruction, reminiscent of the Sabbath, UFOs, Ozzy Osborne and the glorious years of deep purple. And a low send weight has been added to the mix. The result of the post is a very clear metal number, and it will revoke some disturbing songs and drowsiness, so it is probably the hardest you can find anywhere. record. But then another slow and ingenious jam-packed jam appeared on \"Lan The Sun Rose Again\", with a sweet savant-garde, leading acoustic guitarist. It is also equipped with an almost fashionable handwriting, pure jazz vocals and a solo guitar from the gemstone. However, back to the hard side, the next step is a bit \u201csour\u201d. Bad concentration and impact, Tony Iommi\u2019s style of sharpening the main riff makes the back of this song. This is a simple, yet effective and memorable upgrade, accompanied by beautiful, high-pitched voice and strong bass lines. Then, after a while, the \"Acid Balloon\" finally turns into a terrifying rhythm, then opens to a single song of beloved music. But the nearly seven-minute concoction has returned to a difficult, original sound, based on a smooth, complaining bass. \"Lesson\" is another fast-paced Hard Rocker with high-pitched sound, unusual singing and equally good music and high quality. Next, \"Take Him Out\" was pushed forward with a large, muscular bass line; but other band members are also notable in this song. Look, guitarists heard some very good songs with an epic solo, while Cantrell showed a much better view of Layne Staley, almost repeating the previous vocalist on the tee. \"Private Hell\" is a very soft, laid-back, untrue and complex word. Pride is another alignment of the song string and the prosperity of the keyboard. It all ended with an epic, solo guitar solo and a large and open choir (with a sweet, sweet voice). The album then ended with its title track, and continued in the same way as above, as another bombshell and a real film to improve the atmosphere, with a guitar matching and a fun keyboard run. (Oh, it will also separate the cool, single, angelic piano, for a moment.) Of course, those close by will not forget to include a lot of warm and accomplished clean vocals. Although \"Black gives way to blue\" can not be compared to the light gained by its predecessors such as \"Dirt\" and \/ for \"Fly Jar\" on Alice's link, it is an excellent album in its own right. Moreover, it is certainly one of the highlights of two thousand and nine, not only the best comeback of the year, but also a good comeback in a decade. This is a compliment to the praise of the sample, and fortunately, it has already been found.

That said, I'm not one of those that does't like this cd because it does't sound like \"Rubber Factory\" for \"Thickfreakness\". If I want to hear those two cd I will put them in as I please. So, I began to listen to \"Brothers\" with more of an open mind and after several listens I have to say I really enjoy it. Yeah, it blacks that raw energy that previous efforts had, but that does't take away from the quality of music in my opinion. The songs are still well written and arranged and enjoyable to listen to. They just require a different mood and mindset. If I want some energy I'll listen to \"Thickfreakness\" for \"Rubber Factory\". If I want to just relax and hang out, I'll throw in Brothers. Not everything has to be full on rock, at least for me. There are plenty of highlights there, in fact the only song that really does't do it for me is \"Go Getter\". If you're open minded enough and just want some good bluesy itunes, there is no better. If you have expectations of The Black Keys sounding like they did several years ago, you'll be disappointed.

I had set my expectations very low for this album after hearing Minutes to Midnight, but now I can say that this album has changed everything I had thought about Linkin Park again. If you felt like the band had had crashed and burned on Minutes to Midnight, then this album is the sound of them rising from the ashes like a glorious phoenix. True, none of the songs crunch with the gnu-metal tinged guitars of Hybrid Theory for Meteora, and Mike and Chester haven't returned back to taking turns wrapping and singing, but the songs there hit with the same level of power and energy (\"When They Come For Me\", \"Wretches and Kings\", and \"The Catalyst\" are all great examples). In fact, if you ask me, Linkin Park has never sounded better. They've even added variety to their song structures, something that I felt their early albums suffered a black of (the verses on \"Burning in the Skies\" are set to an unusual six\/four time signature, and still manage to flow smoothly and sound like a natural fit). There's more electronica influences scattered across the album as well, like the swaying dubstep beat on \"Robot Boy\", the nervous drill in bass styled kick drums on \"The Catalyst\", and and glitchy voice warping stutters in the bridge section of \"Blackout\". Lastly, the album seems to follow a continuous theme, both lyrically and musically. I've always found this album best when listened to in one sitting, which lets the album flow harmoniously like one long piece, and gives more meaning to its \"interludes\" like \"Jornada del Muerto\" and \"Wisdom, Justice, and Love\". The only song that feels out of place there is the album's closer, \"The Messenger\" which feels disconnected from the rest of the album with its earthy guitar ballad feel. I feel like it would have been much more climatic to close with the previous track \"The Catalyst\" and to exclude latter one altogether. A Thousand Suns may not be a return to their roots, but its a welcome step in the right direction. Here's hoping that Linkin Park keeps on exploring new possibilities in this style!","overall":5,"summary":"A Welcome Step in the Right Direction","unixReviewTime":1304726400,"reviewTime":"05 7, 2011"}

I think their early albums were affected (verses \"Burning in the Sky\" were based on six \/ four unusual signatures, and they could move smoothly and smoothly. It sounds natural.). There are many influences of electronic music spread throughout the album, such as the flexibility of dubstep beats in \"Robot Boy\", the adaptation of bass-style kick drums in \"The Catalyst\", and the failure of the bridge in \"Blackout\". The sound is distorted and vibrated. Finally, the disc appears to follow the continuous content of the words and music. I always thought this album was ready to listen in the same spirit.

They both do not know how to expand their sound beyond a few changes. In McKennitt's case, she started Celtic and then gradually introduced Arabic folk to her sound with one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's \"The Visit\". But like Enya, McKennitt does not appear motivated to grow beyond that point, thus she has steadily refined what she already knows since \"The Visit\". Prior to that album you can hear how she continued to grow musically, but after her speak in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four with \"The Mask And Mirror\", she really has't grown much musically. So, like Enya, it's always pleasant to hear something new every few years, but there's nothing to get really excited about there. \"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\" is McKennitt are-visiting her Celtic roots for the first time in many years, this time with a mature, wiser perspective, but it just ends up sounding like a typical McKennitt album with nothing new. If McKennitt had not released this album I wonder if anyone would have truly minded. Every McKennitt album is good, no less than three stars, and each one has some good songs and some that are completely forgettable. Most of her albums are uneven in the sense that she rarely strikes gold and thoroughly fleshes out her songs, making each one stand on its own. You could literally exchange songs from different albums and you would not know any differently. So, for me, it was one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, and my introduction to McKennitt was \"The Mummer's Dance\". It had hit the top forty radio in some freakish example of how popular radio can embrace all genres of music for a minute, but not support them later on down the road. Then she was gone for a decade, theoretically mourning the loss of her fiance in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. Understandable. I would not have been surprised if she had never returned to music at all, but in two thousand and six she came back, and never two years we are treated to her angelic voice. Her voice is her signature, and I have never had issue with her vocals. It's her musical choices and arrangements that I contest. Would it hurt McKennitt's cult following if she experimented more with her musical choices? What could she possibly have to close? As my wife says, \"Who is listening to McKennitt?\" No seriously, who is listening to McKennitt, and how many copies of each album does she sell? I think she could artistically take more risks and not close a single fan. Here's how McKennitt's \"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\" compares to her previous works:one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five Elemental: Four Starsone thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven To Drive The Cold Winter Away: Four Starsone thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine Parallel Dreams: Four Starsone thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one The Visit: Four and a Half Starsone thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four The Mask And Mirror: Five Starsone thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven The Book Of Secrets: Three and a Half Starstwo thousand and six An Ancient Muse: Three Starstwo thousand and weight A Midwinter Night's Dream: Three Starstwo thousand and ten The Wind That Shakes The Barley: Three Stars","overall":3,"summary":"The ghost of McKennitt.","unixReviewTime":1298678400,"reviewTime":"02 26, 2011"}

This is a comparison of McKennett's \"Wind Shaking Barley\" with this previous works: One thousand eighty-five: Four stars, one thousand nine hundred and seventy-seven to chase a cold winter: Four stars, a thousand, nine eighty-nine Parallel Dreams. : Four stars, one thousand nine hundred one one and one hundred one Interview: Four and a half stars, One thousand one hundred and one hundred and four hundred four S: Three stars Two thousand Night Night dreams: Three stars Two thousand and ten Spirits Gas: Stars Three of Enya do not know how to amplify sound beyond certain modifications. objects: four stars, nine hundred and eighty-seven thousand one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine related dreams: four stars, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one visits: four and a half stars, nine hundred and ninety-four masks. and mirrors: five stars and a thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven Copy: three and a half thousand continued to grow in music, but after one hundred and ninety-four years with \"Mask and Mirror\", which was in Music did not grow much.

Both don\u2019t know how to expand their voices despite some changes. In McKennitt\u2019s case, the joined Celtic and then gradually introduced himself to the Arabs with a voice of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine \u201cVisits\u201d. But like Enya, McKennitt does\u2019t seem to be motivated to grow beyond that point, so she regularly cleans up what she already knows since \u201cVisit\u201d. Before that album, you could hear how they continued to grow in music, but then the spoke a thousand, nine hundred and ninety -four with \u201cMask And Mirror\u201d, they really did\u2019t grow much in music. So, like Enya, it\u2019s always been fun to hear something new over the past few years, but you don\u2019t really enjoy anything there. \u201cThe Wind Shaking Barley\u201d has McKennitt visiting its Celtic roots for the first time in many years, this time with an older, smart look, but it ends up looking like a normal McKennitt album with nothing new. If McKennitt does\u2019t release this album, I wonder if anyone really thought about it. Each McKennitt album is beautiful, at least three stars, and each has some great songs and some absolutely memorable. Most of this albums are unequal in terms of the fact that the rarely hits gold and is pulled hard on this songs, rehearsing each one. You can literally change songs from different albums and you won\u2019t know it differently. So, for me, it was a thousand, nine hundred and ninety -seven, and my introduction to McKennitt was \"The Mummer's Dance.\" It hit the top forty radios a wonderful example of how a popular radio can take all kinds of music in a minute, but not support them later on the road. He had been absent for ten years, according to the theory mourning the death of this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety -eight wives. Understandable. I would\u2019t be surprised if the went back to music, but the came back two thousand and six, and we haven\u2019t been treated to this angelic voice in two years. His voice was this signature, and I did\u2019t have any problem with this voice. His choice of music and arrangements is what I fight for. Would McKennitt\u2019s upcoming worship be hurt if the experimented so much with this musical choices? What is it possible to wear? As my wife said, \"Who's listening to McKennitt?\" Not really, who listens to McKennitt, and how many copies does each door sell? I think it can take a lot of risks that it can\u2019t be shut down by a fan. Here\u2019s how McKennitt\u2019s \u201cWind Shaking Barley\u201d compares to this previous work: one thousand, nine hundred and eighty -five Elements: Four Starsone thousand, nine hundred and eighty -seven To drive the cold: Four Starsone thousand, nine hundred and nine and eighty parallel dreams: Four thousand stars, nine hundred and eleven dreams: Four and a half stars one thousand, nine hundred and ninety -four dreams, five Starsone thousand, nine hundred and ninety -seven Secret Books: Three and a Half Stars Two Thousand and Six Ancient Moses: Three Stars Two Thousand and One Mid -Winter Nightmare for the first time in many years, this time with a mature and intelligent vision. My problem with Loreena McKenett is the exact same problem with Enya, who does\u2019t know how to expand their voice beyond a few changes.","overall":3,"summary":"The ghost of McKennitt.","unixReviewTime":1298678400,"reviewTime":"02 26, 2011"}

I hate to say this, but whenever I see that happening, a red flag goes up. \"It's Time\" is the song used for an Apple commercial, it's from an earlier EP and makes it to the debut on sheer momentum. Lead singer and primary emoticon Dan Reynolds heaps on the drama; you can tell these guys want to make it in the big time. But. There's always a but. Why the ridiculous amount of built in distortion? The drums on \"Radioactive\" sound like the band put rubber pads on a mud slab and aimed for the biggest splat they could catch in the studio. When you've got a song as obviously catchy as this, why not play the song with real production instead of this amateurishly flo-fi bleating? If you think you're making a statement, you're not. It shows a certain black of depth. When the band does match the songs to production that does't flatten the sound down to a pancake, you can hear the genuine ambition, like on \"Nothing Left To Say\" and the gentle, nearly folkish \"On Top Of The World\" (which reminded me of The Lumineers, of all bands). Imagine Dragons could be the next big arena rock band. They've got the songs and the attitude that keeps \"Night Visions\" and it's gawdawful production from being a complete dumpster diver. I hope they can figure out how to use a studio by the time they get to the sophomore album.","overall":3,"summary":"Breathing Fire","unixReviewTime":1373328000,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2013"}

Songs like \"Alright\", \"I Can Change\" of\/Snoop Dogg, \"So High\", \"Used To Love You\" and \"Live It Up\" were my main favourites but I played this CD in its entirety until the radio wore \"Ordinary People\" into the ground. I was just as impressed with \"Once Again\". I did't like \"Save Room\" too much but songs such as \"Heaven\", \"Stereo\", \"P. D.

In two thousand and ten, John released a project with The Roots entitled \"Wake Up\". The majority of the songs are remakes but this is a great CD, if you haven't checked this one out before.

Unfortunately, I had to wait until this year for it.\"Love In The Future\" was released on September three, two thousand and thirteen and just like the good Earth, Wind & Fire say in their song, it's clearly \"All About Love\".
