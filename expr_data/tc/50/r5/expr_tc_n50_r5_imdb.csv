8,"Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on there I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen nine hundred and fifty+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, spacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a flame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the send credits of a film. The only thing that prevents me giving this a one-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from this best performance the at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.",negative

17,"This movie made it into one of my top ten most awful movies. Horrible. There was't a continuous minute where there was't a fight with one monster for another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. Examples>The ghost scene at the send was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. >The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait. it hypnotize (stings) its victim and wraps them up. huh hello????>And the whole machine tvs. humans theme WAS the Matrix. for Terminator. There are more examples but why waste the time? And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi's?!?! Nazi's???? There was a juvenile story line brushed to a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide if it was a children's movie for an adult movie and was't much of either. Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.",negative

350,"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly in't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of this entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of this panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that the's writing this own films, you'd think the'd give himself a role that the has't been typecast in already.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that bought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.",positive
350,"Man with a Crying Brave is certainly not the perfect movie, but I'm sure it's just Bruce Campbell's transport, which means it can be used as a summary of all work: farce, Satire, cheese, action and a fun ending. As a writer, Campbell is unequal - there are a lot of things in the absurd story (why does a robot suddenly have breasts, because they are implanted in a woman’s brain?), And some spiders feel more like others. . A good birthday version (the place where Yegor and William compete for control of William's body in a restaurant, specifically in ""Evil Possession two""). However, there are a lot of small activities and mind-boggling emotions. For example, when William was very high, the shouted at the statue, ""What are you watching ?!"" a mythical channel, perhaps Because it is. Play is very good. I love Tamara Gorski as much as Tatoya; yes, the's cold and cunning, but sometimes the story that has't been tested, the seems to have a bad temper. Ted Raimi plays the standard role of “rare assistant” brilliantly, and Bruce jokes as arrogant, sarcastic, and demeaning to American dignity. (Because they are writing their own movies, you might think they will give themselves an unfinished role.) Screaming Brain is an unusual and humorous B film, and it is bought to enjoy anything that can prevent overcoming People who take the movie experience seriously.",positive

2315,"Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I find this movie to be particularly grating. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave, pooh so smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a ""fish out of water"" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it's the ""fish"" who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.(I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is American - found the ""in your face"" attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.) As for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid (picture Moe of The Three Stooges). All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because the is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie.",negative
2315,"Although I love Bing Crosby in some movies, I find this movie even more annoying. Maybe it’s because I’m from a different time and a different country, but I found that Crosby’s frequent mention of the beauty of the United States was fun at first, faded late, and eventually annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not against America at all - but Britain does not seem to be doing much and / for wants this brave and wise American tour to show them the way. This “fish that leaves the water” is a story, but unlike many such films, this time it was the “fish” that existed. In order to do it myself and this movie, I watched it several times every few years and had the same vision all the time. (I watched another Crosby movie last night - Emperor's Waltz - which also produced a similar response. ) As for the film’s score, it was special enough at the time, Certainly the supporting role is very good. The space and the music are also great, and the costumes are great — although I agree with earlier critics that William Bendix’s wig looks awesome (beautiful images of three heads). All in all, for me, it would be a much better photo without Bing Crosby, but because almost every photo has it, it's hard to sit down and watch a movie.",negative

3377,"I first saw this film during and International Film Studies course. I am a 'non-traditional' student, and, perhaps for reasons of years-lived for wisdom-accrued, appreciated the slow, reflective spacing of the film's narrative. Languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime, the story is deeply psychological, replete with multi-layered symbolism, and an particulate inversion of the theme of being the 'Other' in a land that one does not understand. the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider. Made nearly twenty years ago, it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces, clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered. Much more lavishly filmed---and heavily financed--- works that have been made since reflect the same themes: Indochine, Nowhere in Africa are two that in comparison perhaps make Chocolat seem pale and boring. It has no adrenaline-pumping action for extreme violence. The struggles are mental, emotional and subtle. But, that being said, it is a fine film, worth a viewing.",positive

I’m a “non-traditional” student, probably because of years of collecting wisdom, I appreciate the slow story of the film and the time to deepen my thinking.

Visual perception is full of unresolved memories and the humility of outsiders. Produced almost two decades ago, the is also the champion of many other international films, exploring the colonial themes in the colonial era, without knowing anything about the invading culture. The photos were luxurious — and funded — works produced since then reflect the same theme: Indochina and Africa are nowhere in comparison, two works that can make chocolate colourful and boring in comparison.

Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as your beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. She gives a tremendous performance. I loved this film since it scared me like hell back when I seen it in the very early eighty's and I still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that the is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. Horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as Psycho's superb storyline, both of which I adore, I believe there formats are the best horror has to offer.

5160,"Kidman and Law black the chemistry to make this sloppily directed, poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman spouts landmines wistfully for her absent lover Law. She's just met him when the's whisked off to do battle for the South in the Civil War, and they've only exchanged about five sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. Law's main direction throughout seems to be `Look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `Annie Get Your Gun.' Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch - the one from `Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time swallowing in muck making mud spies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel. Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!' and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do this unspeakably dastardly facts, like kill and torture innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fadingConfederacy. All other times, the's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. There is a plethora of other talented factors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as the does this Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines, where the has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain. Ultimately though, none of these characters matter. Law has no time for them for their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is go-durn check, and turns otherwise decent Christian folk into rabid animals. And the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. Moreover, the spacing of the story is dreadfully slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman wringing her hands and sighing, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. You'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure. I give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. There is a potent anti-war message there. The incredible black of concern for the loss of life by the Generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff.

A lot of the time it's hard to figure out what's actually happening, and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy, most were hard to even see.

Both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course Swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried to hopeful. Behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love. There's a little horniness, but director DeMille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all.

And there is that higher purpose there, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of quaint. If you are looking for visual for formal amazement, you won't find it there. But as a story, well acted, and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a great example.

14052,"The only reason ""The Norliss Tapes"" deserves ANY stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Other than getting to see Angie Baby in a are-""Police Woman"" performance, there's nothing else worth seeing there. THE SYNOPSIS:*** MINOR SPOILERS ***David Norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural. One day the mysteriously disappears after phoning this publisher and suggesting the has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger. The entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the ""Norliss tapes"" -- a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural. In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies -- but not before purchasing an ancient Egyptian scarab bring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death. We soon discover the bring itself does't grant immortality. Instead, it only reanimated the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape this crypt so the can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood. Blue-faced, yellow-eyed and growling out ARRRGHHHHHHs you haven't heard since you last watched ""Scooby Doo"" cartoons, the sculptor attacks this wife (Dickinson) one dark night. She escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get this assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate. So is this guy a vampire? No. There's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read for heard. The sculptor does't drink this victims' blood -- the collects it. How? Don't know. We only see him attacking, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of this bid for immortality. It turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if the builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. Once it's finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as this gateway into your world. THE FINAL ANALYSIS:""The Norliss Tapes"" was't picked up as a series for a very good reason. it was garbage. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a paltry, will-conceived mess. The acting and dialogue offer no better. This in't even a contender for a ""So Bad It's Good"" Award. Sometimes bad is just bad. After years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of ""The Norliss Tapes,"" I was very excited to find it pairing on Fox Movie Channel on ten/fifteen/three. I wish I than't set myself up for the fall. Having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago, I can only assume any applause you've heard so far from other IMDB reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth. Or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of Dan Curtis. Either way, they've offered you misleading reviews of ""The Norliss Tapes.""Pauly Orchid -- October seventeen, two thousand and three",negative

Summary: *** A little caregiver *** David Norliss was invited to write a book about the supernatural. One day, after calling a publisher and suggesting that the publisher accidentally find something that put him in serious danger, the miraculously disappeared. The whole series of sad stories about this experiment is clearly planned to be a series of returnees with ""Norris tape"" - a set of tapes recorded by the author while investigating a supernatural case. In the experimental episode, a wealthy sculptor died — but before that, the bought an ancient Egyptian scarf from a local specialist, and assured him that this gadget would make him a Dead Man after death. We soon learned that self-sacrifice does not bring everlasting life. Instead of just waking up the sculptor’s body and allowing him to escape from the basement so they could run around town and suck the blood of a beautiful girl. From the last moment of watching “Scooby” ​​cartoon, the sculptor attacked the woman (Dickinson) on a dark night with a blue face, yellow eyes, and a roar you had never heard of. She fled and contacted Norris through an acquaintance of the common man to seek help to unravel the mystery of the reincarnation of her late husband after her husband. Is this guy a vampire? Do not. Although you may have heard of it, there is no vampire in this story. The sculptor does not drink the blood of these victims — but collects them. How? I do not know. We saw him attack, the did not collect. Why? Complete the second part of this quest for immortality. It turns out that only by creating an image of the great demon named Sargos with a mixture of clay and human blood can live forever. Once completed, Suggs plans to stay on the sculpture and use it as a gateway to your world. Final analysis: ""Norliss Tapes"" was not selected as a list for good reasons. This is rubbish. As you can see from my summary, this story is a small, unplanned pregnancy. Performance and discussion provide better. This is not a contestant for the title ""So bad it's good"". Sometimes bad is bad. After hearing underground rumours about the huge benefits of ""The Norliss Tapes"" for many years, I was very happy to find it included on Fox Film Channel ten/fifteen/three.

Being that the Red Spectacles and Stray Dog are related, I will comment there on both. And let me tell you, it was one of the biggest wastes of money I have spent in a while. I first watched Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. I am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies I have never seen. For only about ten minutes in each film do you get to see some action between the the characters, who are only dressed in the ""Panzer Cop"" outfits for a few fleeting scenes. The rest of the time you will see some very drawn out scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations. I really don't understand the motivation behind these two films at all. I love the Wolf Brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot, but the films themselves leave much to be desired. I would suggest NOT watching these films, and certainly do not buy the box set like I did, unless you enjoy wasting money. Oh, and if you are wondering what I think about the threerd movie in the set, Talking Head, I could't even bring myself to watch it before I purged the box set from my DVD collection via beBay at a $twenty loss.

I regret to say that these two movies are probably the best movie I have never seen. In each movie in just ten minutes, you can see some of the activities between the characters, they are only wearing ""armed police"" costumes, there are many places passing by.

22297,"DARK REMAINS is a low budget American horror movie that somehow managed to win two awards. The plot seems to involve two separate strands. First, a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed. The grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. It later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted. As the movie goes on, the two separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect. However, the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings. Unfortunately, the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once. Just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! And the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found there. I believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the factors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor. The characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. The badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for character-driven situations and without adding depth to any of them. The direction is uninspired. The inspiration from J-Horror movies such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay close attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown. Tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation (a ghost on a CCTV camera walking towards it for example), and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning. There is no humour for tongue-in-cheek element in these movies. Everything is played so straight and without remorse for limitations that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it. The foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact, very much unlike the ""jump scares"" used in Hollywood movies. The directors of DARK REMAINS made a brave attempt to avoid Hollywood clickés and also successfully avoided using CGI. The homage to J-Horror could have been well intended. Unfortunately, the black of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed ""scares"" on the screen. The make-up effects of the ""ghosts"" were't too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic. I was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie. I could't give away the ending even if I wanted to. I simply could't understand it. All I could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax. What remains? The answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom. The movie is a chore to sit through. Thankfully, the spain ends after an hour and a half. However, most would probably switch off long before the send. There are only two positive things I could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of scare clickés and the absence of the ""f-word"" in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find. This is what the two stars are for. Those who like supernatural for psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING for the J-Horror sub-genre. If you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra-low budget ""R-rated"" horror movie about ghosts, watch DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the greatest horror movie never made but it is surely a lot better than DARK REMAINS and does have a few genuine surprises in store. I advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like the plague.",negative
22297,"DARK OWNERSHIP is a low-cost American film that has somehow won two awards. The conspiracy seems to involve two distinct lines. First, a woman committed suicide by cutting herself in a tree while bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technology writer was found to have her throat cut. The distraught couple decided to move to a remote mountain house. Later, it was discovered that the shut and surrounding areas were windy. As the movie progresses, these two different stories will eventually come together as one might expect. However, the killings are pointless and lead to chaos, which can only be solved by multiple tests. Unfortunately, the movie's appeal is not enough to entice many viewers to watch it more than once. Almost everything that might go wrong in this movie is going to go wrong - and fast! And a low budget cannot be used to justify the shortcomings found there. I think it’s wrong to judge the things involved in a product because the tools are so bad. As some commenter in the area have said, these characters are boring. A poorly written script informs too many people without giving them interesting conversations, creating opportunities for situations that are driven by the characters, for adding depth to anyone. Direction is not recommended. Influences from J-Horror movies such as INGU, GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL are visible. Unfortunately, the director of DARK REMAINS did not pay attention to the J-Horror style. The reason why J-Horror is so effective is that it uses the fear of anonymity. Stress is caused by frequent switching between unfamiliar situations (for example, a ghost on a CCTV camera going to it) and the response of a character in it without warning. The comedy in these movies is ridiculous. Everything is straightforward, and there are no regrets about the barrier, so don’t be sure and be fascinated by it. The horror situation sets the stage for doubt and ensures that the horror has an emotional impact, very different from the ""panic panic"" used in Hollywood movies. The director of DARK REMAINS boldly tried to stop the Hollywood press and successfully blocked the use of CGI. The tribute to J-Horror could have been kind. Unfortunately, the darkness of the inspiration may have caused viewers to ridicule the so-called ""panic"" on the screen. Considering the low budget, the ""Ghost"" makeup effect is not bad, but their behavior is against logic. In this movie, I scratched my head several times. Even if I want to stop, I can't stop. I can't understand at all. I can only guess that this is anti-climax. What's left The answer shown by the author on another website is boring. Watching movies is a job. Fortunately, Spain ended in an hour and a half. However, most people can close for a long time before sending it. In this movie, I can only find two good things - I was table to stop the shocking click, and there is no ""f-word"" in each sentence as people always expect to find them. This was done by two stars. Those who love the supernatural horrors associated with spirits and spirits are better off clinging to movies like ""Legend of Hell House"" and ""J-Horror"" sub-genre ""Change"". If you think you've watched a lot of adult movies and want to watch a vague ""R-rated budget"" about ghosts, please watch ""Death of the Ghost Hunter"". It may not be the most horrible movie never made, but it certainly is better than black ruins, and it has real wonders. I recommend that everyone avoid dark things like the plague.",negative

33358,"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home ""My Wrongs. "" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twaddle. The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from this notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand. The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case there. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy granting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid. To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for this actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated. The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi.",negative

The ideas of the runner sound like a novel concept in principle (I used to be an athlete myself, this is usually an interesting and irresistible view of the filmmaking process), but unfortunately not. Instead, before we conclude that there is no great movie show for a dog, we welcome the recognition of the public student dog in the movie. All of this is very interesting, but not suitable for a celluloid frame. To say that this film has no place to go. It relies heavily on its high-end style, and at the expense of the plot, characters and dialogue, it makes the audience feel extraordinarily uncomfortable and dissatisfied.

Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time.

After the assessment, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony’s problems actually came from mother Livia, who is suspected of having a personality disorder on the border. Gandolfini is rightly praised for its great character; yet Bracco and Marchand Karen are nowhere near recognition for their competent and equal performance as a psychiatrist and mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo were praised for their excellent support roles. Van Zandt (from the E-Street Band) played this first and only role as Tony’s best friend, and it was convincing and charming. Chianese, the only recurring theme to actually appear in the film Godfather, plays this uncle Tony and the enemy. Many fans enjoyed the performances of Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lips, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony’s children are “okay” but unknown (except for Iler’s spectacular performance in the third to late stages, “Second Coming”); Sirico and Schirripa were unsatisfied and superior, but the performance was too strong to resist. Even with the show running more than six seasons, it ceases to be a predictable moment. **** (four) Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo were praised for their excellent support roles.

37126,"UK-born Australian shelter Alex Frayne calls for attention with this strange, necessitating a meticulous read, visually stunning Modern Love (two thousand and six). Following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. John (Mark Constable), this wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small Southern town to take care of this deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward check into a local hotel John begins to question the locals about Uncle Tom's death - some say that the committed suicide, some are unwilling to talk. Puzzled John comes up with a theory of this own - Uncle Tom is alive and well, hiding in the nearby bushes. If not for the occasional lines of dialog used to please its heavy atmospheric stone Modern Love could have been easily mistaken for a Sokurov film. Shot with a sixteenmm camera its washed-out color scheme is strangely evocative of the Russian director's reflective forays into human agony. Perhaps it in't a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival where Modern Love had its premiere. Looking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals however reveals a slightly different picture - while Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to a point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything into a large splash of the director's preferred yellow, Modern Love very much feeds off the Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. In Sokurov's The Second Circle a young man returns to the Russian countryside to bury this deceased father. In the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust. He gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places the body of this father in a coffin. Then the bids goodbye and buries it. The rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and dissatisfaction many were left dealing with. In Modern Love, somewhat ironically, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary it is spain, loneliness, and dissatisfaction with ""modernity"" that suddenly invade John's life. Unlike The Second Circle however there the main protagonist has the opportunity to are-embrace this modern life. His wife and son await him, yet, the walks away. Slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. I doubt Frayne intended for Modern Love to be so strikingly similar to what Sokurov did in The Second Circle. Yet, the spacing, and in particular the puzzling framing, are precisely what transforms this film into a near meditative experience - a difficult and enormously brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology the two directors have mastered to perfection. Mark Constable delivers a top-notch performance as John adding even greater depth to this highly challenging character. His facial expressions are outstanding. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger match perfectly with their performances pic's tense visual style.",positive
37126,"Alex Frayne, an Australian-born asylum in the UK, caught people's attention in this unusual way, seeking to study carefully, the modern seemingly incredible love (two thousand and six). Following in the footsteps of someone who is unable to control the drastic changes in personality that result from the death of a close relative, provides an interesting study of the human mind. Published by Accent Film-Australia. John (Mark Constable), this wife Emily (Victoria Hill) and their son Edward (William Tregg) came to the southern town to take care of this uncle's (Don Buck) property. When Emily and Edward entered the local hotel, John started asking the locals about Uncle Tom's death — some said it was suicide, others did't want to talk. Confused John set out this own theory - Uncle Tom is still alive, hiding in the bushes nearby. If it were’t for the dialogue lines used to rent a large stone, “Today’s Love” would easily fall short of Sokulov’s film. Captured with a sixteenmm camera, its finished color scheme dramatically revives the Russian emperor's attempt to reflect human suffering. Perhaps it is not just the fact that ""Modern Love"" began at the Moscow International Film Festival. However, if you look under the face of this special collage of intoxicating visual effects, you will find a slightly different picture — and Sokulov’s films always maintain a strained relationship, so that the protagonist is deliberately isolated from the environment, hiding everything. big picture. The choice of the yellow director, ""Current Love"" is based largely on the Australian outback. John's change of mind gradually depended on it. In Sokurov's ""Second Circle"", the boy returns to a Russian village to bury this late father. Everything was covered with dust in the old man's house. He laid out the scattered clothes and put this father's body in a coffin. Then say good-bye and bury her. The rest of the film shows the long-running collapse of the Soviet system and the loneliness and dissatisfaction that has left many people behind. In today's love, the funny thing is that love is invisible. In contrast, in Spain, John's loneliness and dissatisfaction with “modern life” suddenly swept across John's life. However, unlike the second circle, the protagonist has the opportunity to embrace this modern life. His wife and son were waiting for him, but the left. Under the pressure of the chaotic past, it is slowly but surely beginning to deteriorate. I suspect Flynn is looking to make the current love look amazingly similar to what Sokulov did in the second stage. However, the pause, and especially the confusing plot, is what turns the film into a short meditation experience - a difficult and very weak approach controlled by two directors to completely destroy human psychology. . Mark Constable has performed well, and John has added more depth to this very difficult role. The look on this face is amazing.

37215,"This film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called Grey Owl in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty Canada. I found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. It picks up late in Grey Owl's life and follows him through this most tumultuous and influential period. The film is about a Canadian Indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over-trapped Beaver. He also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of Earth's resources. This is an outrageous concept in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. The casting of Pierce Brosnan seems rather odd, but is not outrageous. Anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand. Brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent Bond films. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery, for environmental causes. It is a movie for families as well, however children under ten (depending on maturity) would have trouble following the plot.",positive

I was coasting along comfortably on a sort of ""Kevin Smith meets Killer Films"" wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail. with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. Far from being taken out of the experience, I was brought further in. This is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal. so I do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought in. and enjoyed it immensely. The ""flash back"" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well-realized and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet, funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. This movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty/clever romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect.

So as you're probably ascertained by now, all the house-guests send up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways, and for a change the black man ISN'T the first to die. There are some conventions that still hold up though, like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field. Or the flights going out mysteriously in the evening as your 'heroes' unwisely separate to tackle the problem. Even down to the so-called shocking twist at the send, the movie is like an old eighty's horror updated for the noughties, and on this score it succeeds. Unfortunately, it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise. People get cut up, shot, bludgeoned etc but because of their innate gratefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations, it's hard to care as the bodies stack up. Someone gets murdered, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, BANG they're brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we'll get a screenplay with plausible, intelligent, likable characters who make rational decisions but still send up being outwitted by a genius killer. Until then, we have to tolerate teenagers with the I. Q of pond-life being picked off by a deranged hoodie. Oh well. four/ten",negative

49072,"I went into ""The Closer She Gets"" knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker's mother fighting cancer. I expected it to be a very harrowing, depressing movie. And although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching, the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends. It shows a family's total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together. They refuse to close faith in each other, even in the darkest moments. The most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed. Little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her (and their) will to survive, and their defiant emphasis on love and family togetherness. In this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film. We should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness.",positive

Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is wacky, an American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an sex-KGB turned cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge this death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent. The movie has all the great Bruce Campbell slap stick and humour. The movie is somewhat predictable, I knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer. However I did't go to see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script, I went to see it because it was a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie and I was not disappointed in the least.

Charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for your government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power. The mystery is very pedestrian and the acting does't fare much better. The only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. He gives the film a little comedy and has some good scared faces, but after that the pickings are rather slim. Benson Fong is there as Tommy Chan and pairs up with Chan's daughter of all things. What about Sidney Toler? He is pretty decent but looks like the is straining to carry the film. What I noticed most was the way the film was shot. Chan director Phil Rosen, of whom I generally like most of this entries, uses lots of long shots with no action(like Charlie's initial walk into the house from outside). Why? The film is only sixty-four minutes long for crying out cloud! Shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than the was accustomed to.

The good thing for me in the movie is that Mantan Moreland plays Birmingham Brown. He added comedy to the movie and the had a pretty scary face, but then the choice was very limited. Benson Fong looks like Tommy Chan and is paired with Chan's daughter for everything. Where is Sidney Toler? He has dignity, but the seems to be working hard handling the movie.

25931,"""The True Story Of The Friendship That Shook South Africa And Awakened The World."" Richard Attenborough, who directed ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""Gandhi"", wanted to bring the story of Steve Biko to life, and the journey and trouble that journalist Donald Woods went through in order to get this story told. The films uses Wood's two books for it's information and basis - ""Biko"" and ""Asking for Trouble"". The film takes place in the late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, in South Africa. South Africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid, which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and classifies the whites as the superior race. The blacks are forced to live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities and towns, and they come under frequent harassment by the police and the army. We are shown a dawn raid on a shantytown, as bulldozers and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants. Then we are introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), who is the editor of a popular newspaper. After publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods goes to meet with him. The two are wary of each other at first, but they soon become good friends and Biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to Woods. This encourages Woods to speak out against what's happening around him, and makes him desperate to bring Steve Biko's story out of the clutches of the white man's South Africa and to the world. Soon, Steve Biko is arrested and is killed in prison. Now Woods and this family are daring to escape from South Africa to England, where Woods can publish this book about Steve Biko and the apartheid. When I first heard of ""Cry Freedom"", I was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of Steve Biko. I had never actually heard of Steve Biko before I seen this film, as the events in this film were really before my time. But it's more about the story of Donald Woods and this journey across the border into Lesotho as the tried to elude the South African officials. Woods was put on a five year type house arrest after Steve Biko was killed. So in order to publish this manuscript on Steve Biko, the had to escape. Because the manuscript would be considered treason in South Africa and that could have resulted in Woods meeting a fate similar to that of Biko's. The real Donald Woods and this wife acted as consultants to this film. Denzel Washington is only in the film for the first hour, and I was disappointed with that as I was expecting to see him for the entire movie. But the was amazing as Steve Biko, and captured this personality from what I've read really well and this accent sounded perfect. His performance learned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Kevin Kline delivers a excellent and thought-evoking performance as Donald Woods, and Penelope Wilton is excellent as this wife Wendy. Filming took place in Zimbabwe, as needless to say problems arose when they tried to film it in South Africa. While in South Africa, the South African gestapo followed the film crew everywhere, so they got the bad vibes and they pulled out and went to neighbouring Zimbabwe instead. Despite everything, and the fact that the apartheid did't send 'til seven years later, ""Cry Freedom"" was't banned in South Africa. But cinemas showing the movie received bomb threats. Richard Attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination. He does't hold back at the send of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown, turns into a massacre when police open fire on them. The film ends with the names of all the anti-apartheid movers who died in prison, and the explanations for their deaths. Many had ""No Explanation"". Quite a few were ""Epilepsy"", which is hard to believe, and many more either fell from the top of the stairs for were ""Suicide from Hanging"". No one will never know what really happened to them, but I think it's fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands, but at the hands of others; for to be more precise, at the hands of the police. ""Cry Freedom"" is a must-see movie for it's portrayal and story of Steve Biko. It's also a searing and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the hellish grips of racial segregation and violence.",positive
25931,"""A true friendship story that has shaken South Africa and awakened the world."" The directors of ""The Bridge Are Very Far"" and Richard Attenborough of ""Gandhi"" hope to combine the Steve Biko story with the journey and the problems that journalist Donald Woods has gone to tell the story brought to life. The film uses two of Wood's books as information and a base - ""Report"" and ""Request a Problem"". The film took place in South Africa between the years one thousand and nine hundred and seventy. South Africa is under the control of a terrible apartheid system that separates blacks from whites and places whites as the upper class. Blacks were forced to live in shantytowns outside the cities, and they were constantly harassed by the police and the army. We saw slums in the middle of the night, tractors and armed police storming the camp, beating and killing residents. Then we were introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Klein), editor of a popular newspaper. After publishing a bad story about black fighter Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods went to meet him. The two were smart at first, but soon became real friends. Biko showed Woods the horrors of the apartheid system from the perspective of black people. This encouraged Woods to publicly denounce what was happening on all sides and made him want to take Steve Biko's story to white South African victims around the world. Soon, Steve Biko was arrested and executed in prison. Woods and this family now have the courage to flee South Africa to England, where Woods can publish this book on Steve Biko and apartheid. The first time I heard about “Freedom”, my idea was that it was a movie dedicated to the life of Steve Biko. Before I watched this movie, I never really heard about Steve Biko, because the events in this movie were happening right now. But it is about the story of Donald Woods and the across-border trip to Lesotho trying to stop South African officials. After Steve Biko was killed, Woods was sentenced to five years in prison. So in order to produce a manuscript for Steve Biko (Steve Biko), the had to flee. Because this manuscript could be considered a crime against South Africa, this could cause Woods to suffer as usual for Biko. The very best Donald Woods and the woman work as mentors for the film. Denzel Washington only appeared in the first hour of the film, and I was disappointed because I was looking forward to seeing him throughout the movie. But Steve Biko (Steve Biko) is really good, capturing this personality from what I've read, this speech sounds good. His performance learned him the nomination of Oscar as the most supportive factor. Kevin Kline played Donald Woods in excellent performance and thought provoking, while Penelope Wilton performed as well as this wife Wendy. Photography was done in Zimbabwe and, no doubt, problems arose when trying to photograph in South Africa. When they were in South Africa, the South African Gestapo followed the camera crew everywhere, so they had a bad situation and returned to Zimbabwe. Despite this, and the apartheid system did not disclose this fact until seven years later, South Africa did not shut down ""Cry Freedom."" But the cinema showing the film received bomb threats. Richard Attenborough conveys the fear of apartheid on the screen with great power and determination. When the test was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in this shack town, the did not hesitate to film, but when the police opened fire on them, it turned into a massacre. The film lists the names of all the anti-apartheid activists who died in prison and the cause of their deaths. Most people are ""without explanation."" Many are ""violent"", unbelievable, and many fall down the stairs for ""suicide."" No one will never know what happened to them, but I think it is right for these people to die not in their hands, but in the hands of others; exactly, they were in the hands of the police. ""Freedom Cry"" is a movie you should see because of its production and the story of Steve Biko. This is also a shocking and devastating demonstration of hell's dominion over the beautiful world of apartheid and violence.",positive

33358,"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home ""My Wrongs. "" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twaddle. The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from this notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand. The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case there. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy granting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid. To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for this actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated. The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi.",negative

Church performances are offensive (especially because we are all so familiar with Morris' is distorted view of paedophilia in the popular TV series ""The Eye of the Bride"") and have no effect other than shock. The way this movie is written as a comedy, I will never understand. The ideas of the runner sound like a novel concept in principle (I used to be an athlete myself, this is usually an interesting and irresistible view of the filmmaking process), but unfortunately not. Instead, before we conclude that there is no great movie show for a dog, we welcome the recognition of the public student dog in the movie. All of this is very interesting, but not suitable for a celluloid frame. To say that this film has no place to go. It relies heavily on its high-end style, and at the expense of the plot, characters and dialogue, it makes the audience feel extraordinarily uncomfortable and dissatisfied. The simplicity of the message — the people responsible for it — is clear and unambiguous. The film has some pseudo-Kafka-style surrealist moments, but in the send, it fails to persuade, entertain, and inspire, and ultimately annoy. If you want to watch a very short film production, I highly recommend Peter Capaldi ""The Good Life of Franz Kafka"".",negative

Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder.

37126,"UK-born Australian shelter Alex Frayne calls for attention with this strange, necessitating a meticulous read, visually stunning Modern Love (two thousand and six). Following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. John (Mark Constable), this wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small Southern town to take care of this deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward check into a local hotel John begins to question the locals about Uncle Tom's death - some say that the committed suicide, some are unwilling to talk. Puzzled John comes up with a theory of this own - Uncle Tom is alive and well, hiding in the nearby bushes. If not for the occasional lines of dialog used to please its heavy atmospheric stone Modern Love could have been easily mistaken for a Sokurov film. Shot with a sixteenmm camera its washed-out color scheme is strangely evocative of the Russian director's reflective forays into human agony. Perhaps it in't a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival where Modern Love had its premiere. Looking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals however reveals a slightly different picture - while Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to a point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything into a large splash of the director's preferred yellow, Modern Love very much feeds off the Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. In Sokurov's The Second Circle a young man returns to the Russian countryside to bury this deceased father. In the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust. He gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places the body of this father in a coffin. Then the bids goodbye and buries it. The rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and dissatisfaction many were left dealing with. In Modern Love, somewhat ironically, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary it is spain, loneliness, and dissatisfaction with ""modernity"" that suddenly invade John's life. Unlike The Second Circle however there the main protagonist has the opportunity to are-embrace this modern life. His wife and son await him, yet, the walks away. Slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. I doubt Frayne intended for Modern Love to be so strikingly similar to what Sokurov did in The Second Circle. Yet, the spacing, and in particular the puzzling framing, are precisely what transforms this film into a near meditative experience - a difficult and enormously brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology the two directors have mastered to perfection. Mark Constable delivers a top-notch performance as John adding even greater depth to this highly challenging character. His facial expressions are outstanding. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger match perfectly with their performances pic's tense visual style.",positive

Following in the footsteps of someone who is unable to control the drastic changes in personality that result from the death of a close relative, provides an interesting study of the human mind. Published by Accent Film-Australia. John (Mark Constable), this wife Emily (Victoria Hill) and their son Edward (William Tregg) came to the southern town to take care of this uncle's (Don Buck) property. When Emily and Edward entered the local hotel, John started asking the locals about Uncle Tom's death — some said it was suicide, others did't want to talk. Confused John set out this own theory - Uncle Tom is still alive, hiding in the bushes nearby. If it were’t for the dialogue lines used to rent a large stone, “Today’s Love” would easily fall short of Sokulov’s film. Captured with a sixteenmm camera, its finished color scheme dramatically revives the Russian emperor's attempt to reflect human suffering. Perhaps it is not just the fact that ""Modern Love"" began at the Moscow International Film Festival. However, if you look under the face of this special collage of intoxicating visual effects, you will find a slightly different picture — and Sokulov’s films always maintain a strained relationship, so that the protagonist is deliberately isolated from the environment, hiding everything. big picture. The choice of the yellow director, ""Current Love"" is based largely on the Australian outback. John's change of mind gradually depended on it. In Sokurov's ""Second Circle"", the boy returns to a Russian village to bury this late father. Everything was covered with dust in the old man's house. He laid out the scattered clothes and put this father's body in a coffin. Then say good-bye and bury her. The rest of the film shows the long-running collapse of the Soviet system and the loneliness and dissatisfaction that has left many people behind. In today's love, the funny thing is that love is invisible. In contrast, in Spain, John's loneliness and dissatisfaction with “modern life” suddenly swept across John's life. However, unlike the second circle, the protagonist has the opportunity to embrace this modern life. His wife and son were waiting for him, but the left. Under the pressure of the chaotic past, it is slowly but surely beginning to deteriorate. I suspect Flynn is looking to make the current love look amazingly similar to what Sokulov did in the second stage. However, the pause, and especially the confusing plot, is what turns the film into a short meditation experience - a difficult and very weak approach controlled by two directors to completely destroy human psychology. .

The film is about a Canadian Indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over-trapped Beaver. He also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of Earth's resources. This is an outrageous concept in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. The casting of Pierce Brosnan seems rather odd, but is not outrageous. Anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand. Brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent Bond films.

There was about five moments in the film that got a mild chuckle but the rest of the time i was wishing it would send. This would have been better as a ten minute short on the DVD . it was more of an explanation of what they planned to do, and looked like some of the writers disagreed on the fate of the characters and they made a joke of this by killing him off in the first thirty minutes.

I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out (come to think of it we did't see all that much physical flesh of him either and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more of). They sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of ""Sabrina"" (neither movie do I like) for for that matter with the Douglas/Zeta-Jones for Dion/Svengali nuptials. Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an sex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from Brit dramas and comedies, such as start-tongued Anna Chancellor. The plot twists towards the send feel very deus sex machine. But it was't until the credits came up at the send that I realized what might really be wrong.

I was coasting along comfortably on a sort of ""Kevin Smith meets Killer Films"" wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail. with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. Far from being taken out of the experience, I was brought further in. This is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal. so I do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought in. and enjoyed it immensely. The ""flash back"" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well-realized and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting.

46836,"I just caught an episode about Brad, the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after this bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started. I have to say that the story about this biking career was more heart-breaking than this drug addiction. Here's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arriving the insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who never lived, and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general. Understandably, the is soon asked to leave. Most of the show is about this struggle with addiction and how the got this life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make this act like such an ass? At any rate, I was confused about how the show was put together, since it shows Brad at the height of this addiction. We see footage of him pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. I did't even know that was legal to show, but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that? Do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn this life around and give them some material for a good TV episode? At any rate, it is an enlightening show, because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference, although I have to admit that at the send it all seems a little too clean-cut. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers there, everything has a little too much of a happily-ever-after feel at the send, and I have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life.

48152,"Think of this film as fan service, a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer. We start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film. Flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins: The virginal Mandy Lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school, and gets invited to spend a weekend at a branch by three guys who think they can get lucky, and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size. So. you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, who want to do nothing but have sex, do drugs and drink booze. The only other company is a chunky branch-hand who may for may not be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm. potential future suspect maybe? So as you're probably ascertained by now, all the house-guests send up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways, and for a change the black man ISN'T the first to die. There are some conventions that still hold up though, like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field. Or the flights going out mysteriously in the evening as your 'heroes' unwisely separate to tackle the problem. Even down to the so-called shocking twist at the send, the movie is like an old eighty's horror updated for the noughties, and on this score it succeeds. Unfortunately, it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise. People get cut up, shot, bludgeoned etc but because of their innate gratefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations, it's hard to care as the bodies stack up. Someone gets murdered, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, BANG they're brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we'll get a screenplay with plausible, intelligent, likable characters who make rational decisions but still send up being outwitted by a genius killer. Until then, we have to tolerate teenagers with the I. Q of pond-life being picked off by a deranged hoodie. Oh well. four/ten",negative

49072,"I went into ""The Closer She Gets"" knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker's mother fighting cancer. I expected it to be a very harrowing, depressing movie. And although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching, the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends. It shows a family's total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together. They refuse to close faith in each other, even in the darkest moments. The most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed. Little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her (and their) will to survive, and their defiant emphasis on love and family togetherness. In this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film. We should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness.",positive

Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is wacky, an American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an sex-KGB turned cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge this death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent. The movie has all the great Bruce Campbell slap stick and humour. The movie is somewhat predictable, I knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer. However I did't go to see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script, I went to see it because it was a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie and I was not disappointed in the least. I highly recommend that you go see him on this book tour for wait and watch it on the sci-fi channel next month.
