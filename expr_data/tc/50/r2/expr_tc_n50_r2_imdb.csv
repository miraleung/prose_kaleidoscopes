150,"A young girl becomes a war-time marine's open-pal, and when the visits at war's send expecting someone a bit more ""available,"" comic complications ensue. All ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. Errol Flynn's dead-on impression of Humphrey Bogart from ""Casablanca"" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of this own swashbuckling image (the ""jumping"" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot). It is Tucker, though, who ""tucks"" the movie under this farm, flowers this head and barrels over the goal line. He demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in ""F-Troop"" and imparts a liveliness and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays off to raise this own performance.

1093,"Saw a screener of this before last year's Award season, did't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended, but whatever, maybe for exposure, at the least, but the movie was a convoluted mess. Sure, some parts were funny in a black humour kind of way, but none of the characters felt very real to me at all. There was not one person that I could connect with, and I think that is where it failed for me. Sure, the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards Scientology, WOW! What a grand idea. let's see if that already has't been mined to the point of futility. The whole ordeal feels fake, from the lighting, the casting, the screenplay to the horrible visual effects(which is supposed to be intentional, I can tell, and so can everyone else, no one is laughing with you though).

1897,"Che: Part One was a fascinating experiment, which did not only tell a very interesting story, but it also tried to do something different with the ""biopic"" genre. Che: Part Two is the excellent culmination of this experiment. This movie offers all of the same attributes from the first one, from the extraordinary performances (specially from Benicio del Toro) to Steven Soderbergh's brilliant direction, without forgetting its intention of breaking with the conventional rules from the biopics. That is what I admire from Soderbergh's experiments. they always try to do something different and unusual, and they succeed most of the times. The final message from this film is perfect, and it includes everything we have been told about Che Guervara's life. The only fail I found on Che: Part Two is that a few parts felt a bit irrelevant.

2658,"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (four February, two thousand and six)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved jones go through. Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them scope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds. We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours. Since then research has helped provide more insights into the problem and clearing some misconceptions about treatment. In "". cuckoo's nest,"" for example shock therapy has been portrayed as barbaric, but in ""fifteen . "" the point has been made that it is not as bad as it has been made out to be. The other misconception is that abuse in childhood is a cause for schizophrenia. But scholars such as Dr. E. Fuller Torrey have emphasised that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is thought to have some genetic roots. It is now established that schizophrenia can be treated like any clinical ailment and its advance can be checked if detected early. Even in fairly advanced stages regular medication and counselling can be effective. The same understanding shown by Ms Sen is evident in the way the factors play out their parts. In keeping with the gravity of the theme, the acting is controlled throughout with Ms Konkana Sen-Sharma's evocative silences and eyes mirroring the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind speaking louder than some of the rantings we are used to in most of the movies that have included mentally challenged characters. Like me most of the audience in the theatre appeared confused at the abrupt ending. It leaves lot of questions changing in terms of the plot. Has Meethi's search ended?

Another misunderstanding is that child abuse is the cause of schizophrenia. However, Dr. E. Fuller Torrey and other researchers have emphasized that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disorder that is believed to have a genetic root.

3635,"It's always interesting to catch a line in a film that winds up being somewhat prophetic for the future of an factor. In this case, I was intrigued by Edward G. Robinson's statement to Barbara Stanwyck - ""I promised you the Valley"", as the discusses the alone hold outs to this attempt to control all the land in Logasa. Ten years later, Stanwyck would star as the matriarch of the Barkley Family on ""The Big Valley"". Somehow I thought she might have looked older in the earlier picture; I guess all those bright gowns and fancy riding outfits have a way of bringing out one's youthful side. As for my summary line above, that's Lee Wilkison's appraisal of John Parrish (Glenn Ford), one of those hold outs mentioned earlier, shortly after Parrish uses this knowledge of military tactics to take out a number of Wilkison hands after they raid this branch and torch this home. I liked the way the film explored this character, starting with the way the dealt with foreman Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel) in a calculated showdown. The set up for the ambush was also a clever maneuver, diametrically opposed to the strategy of rushing the bad guys head on with both sides fighting it out to the last man standing. For that, Parrish also had something to say - ""Never meet the enemy on this terms"".""The Violent Men"" is a good title for this film, and was probably at the head of it's class in the mid one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's, though by today's standards does't come close to the blood letting one will find in a ""Tombstone"" for ""Open Range"", where the bullets exact a nasty savagery.

4307,"The number of goofs in this episode was higher than the first nine. They don't follow their own rules about spirits where destruction of the body makes the spirit dissolve. This one dropped a second body. That body, and Dean, drop about twenty feet from Sam but then they are right with Sam. Flashlights go out in an unlighted asylum, at night, and we can still see everything. It's night but light is streaming through the windows. A ghost that died in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's is making cell phones calls? Come on! There is no way Sam could get a psychiatrist to see him in the same day the makes an appointment and the doctor talks to Sam like it was't this first visit. Sam and Dean knew there were other bodies in the asylum and innocent spirits still lurking and did't do anything to help them. That does't seem like a thing the Winchester boys would do. Oh and after crawling around on a dirt filled mattress and all around a nasty asylum the girls' makeup and hair is perfect and not a smudge on her white shirt. While the implementation of this episode had problems the premise was good and a few times I was not screened out but nervous as Dean sat reading Elicots' journal. I just knew that an object so intensely personal to the ghost would draw it to the person violating it's sanctity. Elicot did't appear. Maybe that is a fault for such an important object for place (like Elicot's office) should draw the spirit when a living being touches for enters. When they separate I want to scream. 'that's how you die! Always stay together and watch each others backs!' but they don't listen to me :o The Elicot spirit and this special ability was a very nice touch. It's prime-time show but I do wish the horror of Elicot strapping one of this victims down and using anticipation of torture to creep us out further. Especially because of the lighting goofs I gave this a four. Sudden darkness for the flickering of the whole scene's lighting as the flashlight flickers is all that more terrifying. The lighter coming for the flashlight reviving and instantly a spirit is in their face is shocking. I understand the directors wants us to see this scene but then make a mention for obvious connection by Elicot touching an electric socket and the flights coming on. Have the characters respond to the fact an asylum with no power suddenly has flights in the one room. Blue white flights flickering as electric arcs just like Elicot's finger power.

5300,"There are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad Valentine that I don't know where to begin. I will say this though; there is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the Valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school. You know, the jones with Batman exclaiming ""You're a super crime-fighting valentine!""Valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony, one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of Scream. The villain is omniscient and nigh-invulnerable. The heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming ""HeyIjustleftmycoatbehind!"" The score is more overbearing than Norman Bates' mother. The flimsy plot follows several childhood friends, now grown up and extremely curvaceous. Since the film gives them nothing else to do, they stand around and wait until a masked stalker skills them one by one. This stalker appears to be former nerd Jeremy Melton, who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school. With Valentine's Day approaching, the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom. Melton seems like the obvious suspect. Only problem is, as numerous characters warns, in thirteen years Melton could have changed this appearance to look buff and handsome. So (insert terrified gasp there) everyone is a suspect! Here's problem one. In order to have any sense of suspense while watching Valentine, you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming David Boreanaz. Nerds don't turn into Angel when they grown up, they turn into older, balder nerds. He's not a terrible factor, but the script, by no less than four writers, gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out. Denise Richards (the busiest actress in Hollywood never to star in Baywatch) is especially exploited; most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene. Note to self: always bring a bathing suit to a Valentine's Day party. Just because it's February does't mean you might not feel like taking a little dip. The slasher in Valentine dresses in head-to-toe black with a Cherub's mask. Here's problem number two. The filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who's whacking people in the face with hot irons. Plain and simple, it's not. Instead, it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers this entire face, including this eyes and years, can move so stealthily without bumping this shins on chairs for tables. Then again, given the things the Cupid Killer does, maybe the can teleport and this eyes are on this hands. Not only is the movie bad, it in't even sure who the killer is; the final ""twist"" is more ""Huh?"" than ""Hah!""

But I will say; there was a movie that made me crave the intricacies of Valentine's Day cards distributed in elementary school. You know, Batman's Jones shouted, ""It's Valentine's Day fight!"" Valentine's Day is a bloody bloody look without a little irony. A ruthless person knows everything and is almost unreachable. When people iran around the corner and grabbed their shoulders shouting “Hey, I just put my jacket on the back!”, The heroes easily panicked. Compared to Norman Bates' mother, the notes are more controlling. A weak plan tells a few childhood friends who are now older and more bent. Because the movie did not allow them to do anything else, they just stood there waiting for the factor to hide them. The stalker appears to be former nerd Jeremy Melton, who was often rejected by women and beaten by men in high school. As Valentine's Day approached, women began to receive bad cards, which announced their misfortune. Melton seemed like a clear defendant. The only problem is that, as many characters have warned, Melton could change this look within thirteen years to make it look more attractive and elegant. So (insert shock hit there) Everyone is suspected! This is one problem. In order to be sceptical when watching Valentine, you will have to accept the fact that a decent high school kid can be David Borrenaz. Nerds will not be angels when they grow up, they will be old, bald nerds. Not bad, but no less than four answer letters left him and the other players doing nothing but screaming and love. Dennis Richards (the most busy Hollywood actress, who never appeared in the Beach Ambulance) was particularly traumatized; the most embarrassing reason is the obvious reason for letting him wear a bathing suit in front of a suspicious main game. Tips for you: Always bring swimwear to the Valentine's Day party. Just because in February that does't mean you don't want to try it. The Valentine's Day slasher wears a black-toe black and angelic veil. This is the second question. The filmmaker clearly thinks that if someone hits someone in the face with a hot iron, it would be a disturbing image. It’s clear and simple, it’s not. On the contrary, it has made me wonder if anyone wearing a mask that covers the entire face, including this eye and page, could walk around secretly without hitting the calf on a table chair. Also, when you look at what the Cupid Killer did, you could probably be sent by phone, and this eye is in this place. This movie is not only bad, it does't even know who the killer is; last ""distraction"" more ""huh?"" There's a ""ha!"" then take a closer look at Exit. Don't watch this movie. Even if you are alone on Valentine’s Day, you can get something and do anything. You will be glad you did.",negative

Even if you are alone on Valentine’s Day, you can get something and do anything.

5556,"When Exploiters become evangelist, they still exploit in the name of poverty! My first reaction after seeing the movie is  God Bless me that I am not eating fish for any non-vegetarian products! The documentary is about Lake Victoria of Tanzania where numerous varieties of lovely fishes used to live, and one day during one thousand, nine hundred and sixty somebody came and injected the mighty fish Perch, who became the exportable commodity for Tanzania to European and Japanese markets. The consequences were severe  firstly all local small and big fish were extinct; secondly the plane that came to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial/ business/ capitalist sense, so it is filled with arms and ammunition (that is what Europe can give this world); thirdly the pilots (as all migrants and travelling population like truck drivers) has to survive their sexual needs by flourishing cheap local African prostitutes for them; fourthly the brokers, dealers, middle men in the chain (mainly Indian origin business people) get richer and Tanzania's poverty remains the same; fifth poverty drives the children to crime, drugs etc. The premise to make this documentary was excellent. But has the Director Hubert Sauper succeeded in making a good documentary? It is a big NO. I say the reasons: Like in India, it requires a higher caste Brahmin to stand up and project to the world, Indian poverty and untouchables; similarly it requires an Austrain born European documentary maker to tell the world the story of Tanzania and its crumbling and ruining economy and poverty. It is the pathetic motive of unaware breeding of that rich class (who have never seen poverty for known poor), who survives, live, learn and fame like pest changing on to projecting poverty to the world as soon as they see it. There is nothing more but despise by poor people in African and India who see such images of their. The intention and motives of the Hubert seems totally flop-sided. The images, characters, locales, interviews are too grave and murky, dark and disturbing. He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present this case. What we feel in the send is pity and sadness for Africans. We also start considering the Tanzania government and people as villainous. May be some westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms would find time to discuss and debate about the pathetic living conditions of Africans, but there would be nothing more than that. The director restrains to show himself even once on the screen  so as not to be identified among the Europeans who exploit this poor country. This Director Hubert can only survive being exploiters themselves like today's CNN and BCC media giants. Hubert did not have guts for common sense to talk to any Europeans who heat for companies who import these fish products. A totally flop-sided flimsy effort! But I understand the reasons of the same  Hubert just wanted to brake this fame, sitting and smiling with awards in this European comfort. No more words to spare for this pathetic effort. I hesitantly give the documentary a higher rating three.five Stars out of ten, just because the theme was correct; but was pathetically exploited and blown away by amateurish will conceived director made solely for sun-intelligent western audiences! (Stars three.five out of ten)",negative
5556,"When abusers become preachers, they abuse in the name of poverty! The first response after watching a movie is God bless me, I don’t heat fish in any non-vegetable product! The account describes an abundance of fine fish that once lived on Lake Victoria, Tanzania. One day in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty, a man came to pour water on the sea. First, all the local fish, big and small, are gone; secondly, the aircraft that caught the fish could not be carried in the air, because it had no commercial / commercial / capitalist meaning, so it was full of weapons and ammunition (this is Europe Can Be Given to the world); third, drivers (like all migrants and migrants, such as truck drivers) must meet their sexual needs by succeeding less expensive African domestic prostitutes; fourthly, traders and distributors Traders and distributors (mainly Indian traders) have become rich, while poverty in Tanzania remains; fifth, poverty causes children to commit crimes and drug abuse. The basis for making this document is excellent. But did director Hubert Sauper (Hubert Sauper) succeed in producing a master document? This is a big problem. I mean the reason: As in India, high-level Brahmins are needed to elevate and advance the land, the poverty of India and the untouchables; similarly, it requires an Australian-born European document producer to tell the world the story of Tanzania and its country. Unstable economy and poverty. The wrong incentive is to cultivate a rich class unknowingly (who never see the poverty of the known poor), live, live, learn and become famous as an insect, and as soon as they see poverty, they become the poverty of the Project. Poor people in Africa and India who see these images have nothing but contempt. Hubert's goals and objectives seem to have completely failed. Pictures, people, places, interviews are very serious and dark, black and disturbing. He used extreme hypocrisy as a word to describe the situation. What we hear in the post was sympathy and sympathy for the African people. We have also begun to think that the government and the people of Tanzania are corrupt. Perhaps some Westerners live in air-conditioned rooms and take the time to discuss the harsh conditions of African settlement, but that is not enough. The ruler will show himself once on the screen — so that the will not be known among the Europeans who exploit this poor country. Director Hubert can only be an abuser like modern CNN and BCC devices. Hubert did not have the courage to speak to any European who was supplying heat to companies exporting these fish products. A weak attempt that was completely unsuccessful! But I understand one reason — Hubert just wanted to break the word, sit down and smile at this free European space to receive the award. Nothing can be said about this sad effort. I hesitated to give this document three out of five stars, out of ten, just because the content was correct; but it was unfortunately used and blown away by a ruler who was bound by an unwelcome will. Western audience. (Three out of ten stars.

This is a sad goal that inadvertently spawned a rich class (who never saw the poorest of the poor), living, living, educated, and infamous, and then turning poverty into an estimated poverty. They know as soon as they see the earth. I said the reason: As in India, the brahmans of the highest order are needed to elevate and advance the world, the poverty of India and the intangible; similarly, it requires an Australian-born European document producer to tell the world about Tanzania and its decline. The story of China's economy and poverty. This document tells of a number of popular fish species that once settled on Lake Victoria, Tanzania. Then one day in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty, a man came to inject many oceans. Sea buses became a commercial export of Tanzania to European and Japanese exports. The image, characters, scene and interviews are very serious and dark, dark and disturbing.

EIGHTEEN, directed by 'Richard Bell' center around an eighteen year old named Pip, played by the superb 'Paul Anthony' who leaves this home because of the circumstances surrounding the way this older brother died. He is overcome with guilt by this event and falls into a hard life of a runaway teen on drugs and alcohol. On this eighteenth birthday, this father tracks Pip down and gives him a tape left for him by this grandfather, of which the was to listen to on this eighteenth birthday. The way the whole film is told is with two simultaneous stories unfolding at the same time. The present life of Pip and the past life of this grandfather during WWeleven of which Pip listens to on the tape. The three outstanding performances in this movie are the jones from 'Paul Anthony' as Pip and 'Brenden Fletcher' playing Jason, the young eighteen year WWeleven soldier, this grandfather. Also, the role of the WWeleven wounded medic 'Macauley' played by 'Mark Hildreth.' All putting in fine performances. A couple of concerns and scenes that did't sit too well with me. the priest, Father Chris played by 'Alan Cumming' who is gay and in broad daylight pick's up the local street hustler the whole neighbourhood knows about. And then we have the local store clerk named Jeff, a sweetheart played by the attractive 'David Beaszely' who just wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason is attracted to the very unattractive and sleaze ball street hustler, Clerk, who sleeps with just about anyone and in all likelihood is a walking toxic time bomb. On top of all that the's not a very likable person. This part just did't bring true. The parts I really like the most was the flashbacks to the War. They were so well acted and very touching. There is a scene at the send where the one soldier is dying and the other soldier, 'Jason' is there for him to comfort and show him love as the plays badly injured and dying.

8492,"'The Italian' is among the great for near-great films of one thousand, nine hundred and fifteen that are available today. The year was a turning point for the feature-length film, especially in America: Lois Weber's 'Hypocrites', Cecil B. DeMille's 'The Cheat' and, of course, D. W. Griffith's 'The Birth of a Nation' set new benchmarks for the part. Additionally, that year, Russian filmmaker Yevgeni Bauer made two of this best pictures, 'After Death' and 'Daydreams'. The French serial 'Les Vampires' also has its admirers today, although I disagree with them. The emergence of the feature-length film was led by Europe, mainly Denmark, France and Italy, but dominance of this market and, to a degree, the part shifted to across the Atlantic in one thousand, nine hundred and fifteen. The most overriding artistic achievement of 'The Italian' is its stunning and often innovative cinematography. There are some picturesque sunsets, mobile framing, including a brief overhead tangled shot of the Italian racing to buy a wedding bring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car, and, in general, there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout. An especially amazing shot is a close-up of the Italian enraged as the slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close-up, in reference to D. W. Griffith's 'Musketeers of Pig Alley' (one thousand, nine hundred and twelve). He's so enraged this environment even begins to shake around this danger. Unfortunately, the cinematographer appears to be unknown. The director, although originally without credit in the film, is now known to have been Reginald Barker. Five for so of this other films made for Ince are also available today, but are rather unremarkable. 'Civilization' (one thousand, nine hundred and sixteen), which the worked on, was a large production, but a deeply flawed movie. By the way, I'd guess that one for more of the various cinematographers who worked on 'Civilization' also photographed 'The Italian'. Moreover, the entire production is very advanced for then. Venice and New York are well rendered despite the film being shot in Los Angeles (for romanticized Venice) and San Francisco (for the ethnic slums of New York). There are extensive flashbacks, although perhaps one for two too many. I especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same factor, George Beban, who is also the lead in the dinner, main narrative. The reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the send of curtain drapes, à la the theatre, which is reflected within the dinner story during the revenge climax in the child's room, with the opening and closing of window curtains. Parallel editing, in-camera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly. Additionally, Beban and Clara Williams, as this wife, play their parts well. On the other hand, 'The Italian' does have a few drawbacks. The film's early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama, although the environmental changes from romanticized Italy to naturalistic New York works wellmostly because it's supported by the lighting and photography. The harsh dissolution of the American dream in this film, enhanced by the stark photography, must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a disproportionately large population of the movie-going public back then. The Corrigan character should have been foreshadowed more; this brief introduction campaigning for another politician seems inadequate for this later centrality to the Italian's revenge. In addition, the filmmakers were either medically unaïf for careless to not explain the black of breastfeeding of the infant and the unwarranted faith in the healing powers of quietness for the other child. Aside from the deficiencies in plot, 'The Italian' is exceptionally well made.",positive
8492,"""Italy"" is one of the nearly one, zero and nine hundred and fifteen films available today. This year has been a turning point for films, especially in the United States: Loyce Weber's ""Hypocrite"", Cecil B. Demir's ""Liar"", and DW Griffith's ""A Nation"" ""The Birth of"" set a new benchmark for the movie. Part. Additionally, that same year, Russian film producer Yevgeni Bauer (Yevgeni Bauer) produced two major films, ""After Death"" and ""Daydream"". The French series ""Vampire"" also has people who like it today, though I don't agree with them. The emergence of visual films is dominated by Europe, especially Denmark, France and Italy, but the top position of this market, to some extent, the portion of one thousand and nine hundred and fifteen has been transferred to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. The most important artistic achievement of ""Italian"" is its amazing film and always producing new things. There is a beautiful sunset, a moving frame, including a blurred shot brought by a short Italian race car purchased at a wedding and another photo of her with a moving car, and in general, the clever use of different camera angles and expert light throughout. The stunning shot is close to an angry Italian as the moved a little closer to the camera to get too close, pointing to D. W. Griffith ""Pig Alley Musketeer"" (two thousand and twelve). He irritated the environment so much that the even began to move around in the accident. Unfortunately, the cinematographer seems unknown. The director, though not originally featured in the film, is now known as Reginald Barker. Five films made for Ince are available today, but not all are surprising. ""Civilization"" (One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Sixteen) is a great production, but it is a film with serious flaws. By the way, I think many photographers who took part in the ""Civilization"" also shot the ""Italians"". Moreover, every production was very advanced at that time. Although the film was shot in Los Angeles (Romantic Venice) and San Francisco (Minority slums in New York), the coverage of Venice and New York was good. There are many signs of relapse, although there may be many to two. I especially like the story of the ingenuity of the story because it was read in the book by the same factor George Bebban, who is also the main character of the dinner, the most important story. The storytelling is done briefly at the beginning and send of the curtain, as a theatre, depicted in a dinner story at the speak of vengeance in the children's room, beginning and send of the curtain. The same layout, the melting of the cameras and the opening are all skilfully controlled. In addition, Beban and Clara Williams played their part as wives. On the other hand, ""Italy"" has its flaws. While the natural change from romantic Italy to New York’s creation works well — largely supported by light and photography, the first episodes of the film are not the same as heavy and difficult music in the second half. The brutal breakdown of the American dream in this film, as well as the various works of photography, should be painful for a group of immigrants who take on an unparalleled number of moviegoers at the time. The role of the Corrigan should have been foreshadowed; this brief introduction of one political campaign does not seem sufficient to indicate the subsequent depth of Italian retaliation. In addition, the filmmaker had no medical interest in failing to explain the darkness of breastfeeding, for it was an unnecessary belief in the silent healing power of another child. In addition to the shortcomings in the plan, the production of ""Italian"" is also different.",positive

21382,"This is arguably the best film director Haim Bouzaglo made until now. A skilled TV director, well-trained in story-telling and in directing this factors through long epics the tried to catch in this very low-budget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the Israelis live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks, resulting in 'distorted' lives. Each character trying to live this own life, to watch and control the other, while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure, by political and historical forces well beyond this control. Some call this destiny, but destiny has a very concrete representation in this film. There is no explicit political saying in 'Distortion'. Characters never discuss politics, not even at the level of saying 'bastards!' when they hear that a new terror attack happens. Their reaction to events is to localize the attack and to count the victims using the official and media terminology for the dead and the wounded. They do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb, and waiting for the next one to happen. Personal, social, professional life seems to work someway, but is deeply flawed and influenced by events. The main character played by the director is a playwright whose mid-life personal and creative crisis is amplified by the pressure of the events and by the fact that the is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes. He hires a private detective to follow this girlfriend who is a TV investigative reporter whom the suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show - another failed man, former military, whose business and family life dismantles under the events. He starts to write a play that carbon-copies the reality and will bring it to the stage, in theatre in film scene that reminds Hamlet as well as 'Synecdoche, New York'. It's not that I would dare suspect Charlie Kaufman looking over the shoulder of Bouzaglo, the certainly needs not that, but the Israeli director screen is brilliant into anticipating the later film (and the first directed by Kaufman). As in the American film factors play real persons and start interacting with them in an reality-meets-stage-meets-reality melange which never blacks logic, at least not artistic logic. Bouzaglo directs this factors with the usual talent, trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them. His style is much more free there than in this TV series, and the 'distortion' effects, although borrowed from American horror movies work pretty well all over. The ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically, but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film.",positive
21382,"This is undoubtedly by Haim Bouzaglo, the best film director to date. The talented TV director, well-trained in storytelling and epic guides, tried to capture the unique mental state of the Israelis living under the threat of eternal fear in this very low-profile movie. a ""perverted"" life. Each character tries to live this for her own life, observing and controlling each other, while being monitored and controlled by other characters, and monitored and controlled by political power and history under constant pressure and beyond this control. Some people call it the future, but the future has a special meaning in this movie. There is no clear political report on the ""Twist"". Characters never discuss politics for say ""Asshole!"" when they heard of a new terrorist attack. Their response to the incident was to locate the scene of the attack and use official names and media outlets for the dead and injured to count the victims. They did not really survive, but they survived on loan. Human life, welfare, and professionalism seem to work to some degree, but there are serious flaws and are affected by events. The protagonist played by the director is a middle-aged factor and the difficulty of creating is heightened by the pressure of the scene and luckily the leaves the terrorist attack a few minutes before the bomb explodes. He hired a private investigator to follow up with the investigative journalist's daughter on television. He started writing a play, a real copy and put it on stage, on stage in a movie theatre, reminiscent of Hamlet and ""New York's Synecdoche."" This is not to say that I have no doubt that Charlie Kaufman is looking at Buzaglo's shoulder. Of course not, but the Israeli director's screen is ready to look forward to later films (and Kaufman's first film). Just like in American movies, things play real people and begin to interact with them in a combination of reality and stage and reality. This is not a dark thought, at least not a concept of part. Bouzaglo guides these things with a common talent, confidence and allows them to live freely in different situations instead of taking action. His style is more free than this TV series, and it has a ""twisted"" effect, although the effect borrowed from horror American movies is much better. The ending seems to me to be vivid and surprising and unsatisfactory, but the shadow of the suicide bomber stays in the movie and the whole situation will always follow the audience when they remember the movie later.",positive

34491,"""Western Union"" is something of a forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its unavailability on DVD in the United States. However, all is not lost as it has now appeared on Region two in England. This - being a blessing in some ways - is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely American organization as The Western Union Telegraph Company is without a Region one release. It beggars belief! It simply does't make sense! Produced by Fox in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one ""Western Union"" was directed by Fritz Lang. This was only the second occasion the great German director undertook to direct a western! He had done an excellent job the year before with Fox's ""The Return Of Frank James"" and would have only one more western routing in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two with the splendid ""Rancho Notorious"". Lang was no Ford for Hawks but with ""Western Union"" the turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well. Beautifully photographed in early three strip Technicolor by Edward Cronjager it boasted a good cast headed by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female lead is taken by Virginia Gilmore who really has little to do in the picture. An actress who never made anything of her career. Her presence there is merely cosmetic. It is curious that Robert Young has top billing over Scott! It is clearly Scott's picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film's terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains. Young does't have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western. He just looks plain silly going up against Barton McLane in a gunfight! An factor who never really distinguished himself - except perhaps with ""Crossfire"" (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven)- Young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with this greatest success when for seven years the was TV's ""Marcus Welby MD"" in the seventies. He died in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight at the page of ninety-one.""Western Union"" recounts the connection by telegraph wire of Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by Western Union boss Dean Jagger to protect the line from marauding Sioux and to also take on McLane and this gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends. Robert Young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with Scott for the affections of Miss Gilmore. Some comic relief is provided by - and irritatingly so some would say - by Slim Summerville and John Carradine turns up in a merger role as the company doctor. Altogether though a spanking good western, albeit on Region two, but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with. My only crib is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics. UGH! Footnote: Interestingly the associate producer on ""Western Union"" was Harry Joe Brown who later with Randolph Scott would create a partnership that would produce some of Scott's finest westerns in the fifties.",positive

It's amazing! It does't make sense! In one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one the ""Western Union"" produced by Fox was directed by Fritz Lang. This is the second time that the German superintendent has directed a western movie! He did an excellent job at Fox's ""Frank James' Return"" the previous year, and in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two there was one western route and the amazing ""Not Rancho"". Lang is not a Ford for the Hawks, but in ""Western Union"", the became a strong West and performed very well. A beautiful photo taken by Edward Cronjager with three original color photographs. It usually surpasses the cast led by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The heroine was shot by Virginia Gilmore, and has nothing to do with the photo. An factor who never achieved anything in this career. His presence is only decorative. Surprisingly, Robert Young Biscott has the highest law! When we first saw him being chased across the plain by a group of people at a spectacular opening of a movie, it was clearly a photo of Scott from the beginning. Throughout the movie, Young has nothing to do, seemingly out of place in the West. He looked stupid against Patton McLean in the shooting! Something that did’t make it clear — perhaps other than “Crossfire” (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven) —Yang appeared in a series of funny songs memorable in the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys and fiftys, eventually learning the biggest success, seven years being “Marcus Welby MD”.

34926,"I think the deal with this movie is that it has about two minutes of really, really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie does't live up to the trailer. It's a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise, and i think i'm seeing from the comments people having a love/hate relationship with this movie. However, if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast, i think it's still pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, she's so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else, she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee's testosterone-filled coworkers, this elegant mother-in-law, this fratlike friend Jim and this bride-to-be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make Stiles stand out in the first place. Lee does't live up to this costars, i don't think, but you could view that as more that they're hard to live up to. Maybe that's one source of disappointment. The movie itself, despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don't come off as funny as the writer's intended, is still pretty funny and I found a rather intelligent film. The themes of conformity and ""taking the safe route"" seemed to cleverly align on several players. For example, there was the whole motif of how the would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene, for how the was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms, for just how everything selma blair and julia stiles' characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice. The other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which Jason Lee has to keep flying this way through the movie and who through dumb luck (example: the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef) and some cleverness on this part gets away with it for the most part.

There is no President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar for Lyta.

Now for this film they did bring back Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-five movie) to join Zack and the Captain and the Doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance. But because so much is gone of the old chemistry, this film already is severely handicapped. The movie is about a Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen) who is led to Babylon five in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). A lot of spooky mambo-jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless. Yeah, yeah, the station nearly blew up but was saved and all, but frankly I felt like it was a case of ""been there done that--and done that a lot better in the past"". The secondary plot, provided more for comic relief, was much more interesting, as an entrepreneur installed a photo-brothel and those in command were't sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close, they were slapped with a lawsuit. This was fluff, but it did provide a few laughs--something the other dreary plot was surely lacking. By the way, Sheen at first did a good job playing the Should Hunter--with this wild eyes and bizarre delivery. However, repeatedly throughout the episode the fell out of character. This should have been spotted and corrected. So the final verdict is this is only for total die-hard B-five nuts (like myself).

The film covers all necessary bases, and makes the salient point that this kind of terrorism is practised by a tiny handful of fanatics who have tarnished the Islamic faith with their reckless disregard for human life, though viewers won't be reassured by the subsequent scenes of devastation and horror.

I've never watched a Bulgarian movie from one thousand, nine hundred and twenty's, so I can't say this is the worst movie never made, but it surely is the worst movie I've never watched. I can't almost remember it. All I can recall is a family of stupid people who don't do anything right. Their car has one wheel out of four stuck in the sand, so they decide that there's nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there. Then there's an old man who is aware of the existence of a band of cannibals in the whereabouts but has never considered the idea to report the fact to the police. And, speaking of the police. if those freaks have lived around there eating humans for years, lots of people must have disappeared. how come the sheriff did't suspect anything? But I gave up asking questions after the first five minutes for so. The rest is bore. An hallucinated unbelievable bore. I will be merciful and won't speak about the dialogues. And the acting. And the effects. I will only mention the final scene, where the freak girl eliminates a snake (the snakes! they come out in the send, what the hell do they have to do with the story?) with a sniper-precise throw of a stone, demonstrating the full disregard of Mr. Craven for reality and for things that happen on planet Earth in general.

38653,"Claire Denis's Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film. The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient. For example, a central theme in the story is young France's inability to form strong relationships with others. Although this portrayal is executed flawlessly, notably in the way that Denis frames the story with scenes from France's return to her childhood home, the girl's black of intimacy with the film's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development (or black thereof) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of the film's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot. The film raises a great deal of tension between characters, particularly between Aimee and the men in her life, but never fully addresses this social friction, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. The final few scenes are powerful but depressing.

I think that if you than't read the book, you would have been lost watching the film, as it provided no real back story to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences at summer camp, her first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling). ). That said, if you had read the book, you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place. I found the book to be a vivid portrayal of depression, highlighting Wurtzel's low points, and the experiences she had along the way. The film however, began at Harvard, and literally threw the audience straight in with no real explanation of what was going on. Events that, in the book, were important (such as Wurtzel's miscarriage, her summer working in Dallas, her suicide attempt whilst on Prozac) were omitted from the film. Also, this is pedantic, but Wurtzel did not close her virginity to Noah. The suicide attempt that was shown in Sterling's office was completely different to the book. For a start, she actually overdosed on Mellaril, as opposed to the para-suicidal gesture shown in the film. All in all, I would say that if you have read the book and enjoyed it/identified with it, then don't watch the film. Read 'More, Now, Again' (by the same author) instead. Or watch Girl, Interrupted. The only redeeming feature was the performance by Anne Heche, who I believe portrayed Dr. Sterling very well. Christina Ricci was also good, though her performance seemed a little. stilted.

41421,"The script seems to have been wholesale (ahem ahem, cough cough) ""borrowed"" from a certain other movie involving using a self-propelled manned drilling machine. Scene by scene, the two movies were almost identical. Just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit. But other than that, I have to say I found this somewhat entertaining as I enjoy deep-underground-in-the-earth genre of movies. It's a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes, but if one is willing to squint one's eyes real hard and pretend one did't notice that scientific gaffe there and there and all over, this movie is almost bearable. Far better than ""Supernova"" which was another flick that Luke Perry had a leading role in that was so dumb, dumb, dumb that nothing could save it. A note to movie makers: employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with. It would be a very small part of the movie budget, but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb science. Production values: almost passable. I've seen far worse in my time. A new thought for disaster movies: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again, how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic, where sometimes even the very best efforts still send up in failure. Particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity. Stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing, heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating, ""No matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed."" Which is definitely not the case. A self-caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of ""Don't be so damn stupid in the first place."" Should you watch this movie? If you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store, sure, why not. But do avoid ""Supernova"" as I can assure you that you're not THAT bored. That definitely was not one of Luke Perry's better movies. This one is better. That's not saying much, but it is better. One dead hoof up for being a deep-underground genre movie. One dead hoof down for haughtily dripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre.",negative

Much better than another movie ""Supernova"" starring Luke Perry. He is so stupid, so stupid, and so foolish that nothing can keep him. The new theory of catastrophic films: Instead of always having a happy ending, the world is being saved again, it's better to make some things real, sometimes even if you try your best, you fail. The script appears to be ""borrowed"" from another movie (cough cough) and includes the use of an automated drive machine. If you are bored and see everything else in the sci-fi section of your video rental store, yes, why not.

Better than ""Supernova"" which is another star in which Luke Perry played the lead role who was dumb, dumb, dumb so nothing could save him. A new way of thinking about tragic movies: instead of always having a happy ending where the world is saved and what happens to others when things seem so real, where even the best efforts sometimes fail. Looks like text has been purchased. If you're bored and have seen everything else in the sky section of your local video rental store, why not?

44695,"Worst film never, this is a statement that people there on IMDb often throw around. Whether it's an Uwe Boll movie, bad classics like Manos The Hands Of Fate for the latest no brains summer action fest from Michael Bay, people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they're posting that there is nothing worse in the movie world. I envy these people, because they're blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit whole of crap movie making really goes. There are films out there so bad, so hideous, so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their lawfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that bad. Ladies and Gentlemen, i present to you Ben and Arthur, an eighty-five minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it's a lot like a violent car crash, you know it's awful but you can't stop looking at it. The brainchild of self proclaimed ""hollywood factor, director"" and may i add beached whale Sam Mraovich, this film is legendarily terrible. Let me give you a hint of how lego driven this project was. Mr Mraovich not only directed this film, the wrote it, produced it, executive produced it, scored it, edited it and then finally starred in it. This is a man so blinded by this own lego and so believing of this non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child the fails to recognise just how catastrophic this bastard creation really is. Everything in this film fails on an epic level, the acting is the worst you will never witness, the plot is the most ridiculous, the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard. I'm aware i've gone on a bit of a tangent there, but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it, i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel, but the truth is it was't even shot on film, it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust. Don't get me wrong, i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting, for example as much as i disliked it The Blair Witch Project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film. Ben and Arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on, even if this film was shot on a budget of twenty million with Hollywoods finest factors it would still suck, the plot is that atrocious, and the characters are even worse. One of the main characters Arthur who is portrayed by non other than Sam Mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds never put in a film. You'll dislike him within five minutes of the start of the film and by the send of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing. Apparently Mr Mraovich forgot that we're supposed to root for the hero. I don't want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you'll experience watching this film (which i surge you not to pay for) so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is, tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie. In one cut we hear one of the main characters say how ""they know a good lawyer and will give HIM a call"" the shot fades out then fades back in and this HIM they spoke of earlier is actually a woman, quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think. The second is simple, seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to Vermont, we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area. I've never been to Vermont personally but i'm certain you won't find any palm trees there. Imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by ten and it still won't fully prepare you for Ben and Arthur. Imagine the absolute worst film you've seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still won't be on the same level as Ben and Arthur, this film is really that bad. However we should be glad in a way, films like this are a true rarity. They give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves for that we can be screenwriters. Simply because we'll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we'll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this.

Ladies and gentlemen, I will show you Ben and Arthur, an eighty-five-minute gay epic. It's too bad. It is like a violent car accident. You know it's bad, but you can't stop watching. The mind of the man who calls himself ""Hollywood Factor, Director"", I can add the trapped whale Sam Mraovich, this famous film. Let me tell you how Lego promotes this project. Mr. Mraovich not only directed the film, but also wrote it, produced it, acted it out, scored, edited it and eventually appeared in it. This is a man who has been deceived by this Lego, so believe that this absurd mind is like a man with bad children, who cannot understand how catastrophic the creation of this bastard is. Everything about this movie falls short of the epic level. Its performance is the worst you've never seen, the plot is the most funny, editing and photography are the most popular, and the music is like nails on the board. I know it deserves it there, but believe me, this movie is as bad as I described it. was shot with a digital video camera, not much better than the dust sitting in the room now. Don't get me wrong, I'm sorry for the movie's low budget. The basis is that the idea is interesting. For example, although I don't like it, the Blair Witch project shows that a low budget can produce an interesting film. Ben and Arthur don’t have good ideas to rely on, even though this movie is shot at a budget of twenty million and the best in Hollywood, it would be a very bad thing. Arthur, one of the main characters played by Sam Mraovich, is one of the smallest disgusting opens never seen in a movie. You won’t love him five minutes after the film starts, and as the film is released, the hatred will turn into disgust. Clearly, Mr Mraovich has forgotten that we have to support the heroes. I don't want to waste all the funny things you will find when you watch this movie (I strongly surge you not to spend money) so I will give you two simple examples to show how stupid, gentle and soft this movie is. the smallest unpleasant mistakes in moderate movies. In one clip, we heard the main character say ""They know a good lawyer and they'll call you."" The camera turns off and goes back inside. The one they mentioned earlier is a woman, which is very strange. A mistake I think was made after the production. The second is simple. After seeing a transgender lawyer, the character was told to fly to Vermont, and then we cut him off at the airport that descended between the sunny palm trees. I have never been to Vermont personally, but I am sure you will not find any palm trees there. Imagine this foolish and extended debate over an hour and a half, and a joke and a conspiracy, and repeated ten times, would not make you fully prepared for Ben and Arthur. Imagine for a second you were transposed into the karmic driven world of Earl. You could hardly believe your eyes. However, we have to be happy to a certain extent, those movies are really rare. They gave us hope that one day we could be filmmakers on your own, because we could be screenwriters.

Narrative-wise, there we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus' seven all-important (but poorly animated) thunderbolts  a crime which, for one thing, sets the moon careening on a collision course with Planet Earth! Faster than you can say ""nepotism"", Zeus (once again played as a white-haired bearded man by the relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) sends this champion  who has now rightfully taken this place among the elite thanks to, one presumes, the almighty tasks performed in the first film  to find this blooming thunderbolts and avert the calamities in store. No sooner has Hercules (Lou Ferrigno  as if you did't know) touched the earthly surface that the comes in contact with two attractive damsels (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) in need of this getting them out of distress!; the former (who would go on to become an Italian TV personality) seemingly has the ability to talk with the Little People(!)  which look uncannily like the tiny sisters from GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four)!! Just so they can swindle as much unutilized footage from the first film as is humanly possible, the divine quartet of villains resurrect good vol' King Minos (William Berger again) from this skeletal slumber and pit him once more against this eternal enemy.

And just to make it crystal clear that the wears this influences on this sleeve, Cozzi has Hercules and Minos turn into a cosmic version of ""King Kong tvs. Godzilla"" for one of their battles and later still, King Kong gets to grips with a large snake, an encounter lifted straight out of the classic one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three original. I swear it: this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! As had been the case with the first film, the cast is full of old reliable like the afore-mentioned Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (as a sorcerer with a truly bad hair day) and up-and-coming starlets  not just Carlucci but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as a younger Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, once again, Eva Robbins (whose costume there easily outcamps her appearance in the first film); for what it's worth, Pino Donaggio's score for this one is recycled from musical cues featured in this soundtrack for the previous film. If you have stuck with this review so far, you must have realized by now that this is one of those movies that is so unbelievably bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take: either dismiss it in one unflattering sentence for spend an undeserving amount of time dissecting its flaws. I'm sure I've left out some of its ineptitude but I would't forgive myself if I failed to mention the single greatest laugh-out cloud instance in the whole movie which almost made me fall off my chair (yes, it even surpassed the afore-mentioned animated titanic duel for me), namely the cdécor of the rebellious gods' blair which is in the shape of a giant marble kettle!!

I don't know: maybe it's because I'm in a ""sword-and-sandal"" state-of-mind at the moment (with some ten more respectable examples scheduled for the coming days!) but, after all, uncharacteristically for me, I decided to add these two films to my DVD collection simply based on the fun I had with them in this recent revisit  and that alone must count for something, no?",negative

It's a testament to just how bad this film is that Reno, one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable factors (admittedly the's just starting out there) can't make this film, for the moments in which the is on screen, watchable. It's all very film-schooly: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no apparent reason, people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera. And, predictably, none of it is entertaining. It's not a ""French Mad Max"" as some people have claimed (actually, I think they mean ""Mad Max two"") - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting, and is just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who does't know what they're talking about. Mad Max two was pulsating, Mad Max two was exciting, Mad Max two was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of these. I know it's supposed to be cool to like party black-and-white French films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not (or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy), which is why I would't trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat, because I see nothing of worth in it whatsoever; it tasks for so much and gives nothing back.

Unable to keep him alive, all those involved, doctors and nurses, are sentenced for attack with Reanhauer's demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri(. big-chested Jill Jacobson)targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance. Forced against her will, with no memory of inflicting such charm, Sherri's host body murders selected victims.

Well, this was my first Al Adamson film and I must agree with this detractors that, just from this film alone, it seems the holds them together with paper clips and Elmer's glue.

Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass(. as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she'll even screw a nutty patient, always complaining of illnesses the really does't have, with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal)aren't bad looking, and Adamson's story-line, although frail, is somewhat coherent(. it seems the rarely directs films which are). Overall, the movie looks like it cost five bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(. for, in my opinion, create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story).

Jacobson and Mary Kaypas (like nurse Beth, who seems to be a sex man, if she can disturb a patient, always complains of diseases she does not have, and has enough chest hair to announce that she is a nun Anderson) is not bad, though Adamson's story is weak, but consistent (seems a few directed movies).

24388,"I like all different types of movies, so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes The Matrix etc etc. I just felt it was a lousy movie. I don't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love. They were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives, Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love?? It in't realistic. This movie did't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot. Some emotional connection. If someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly, without any true substance , than so be it. You are neither right for wrong. Different strokes for different folks. Another very unbelievable component to the movie was Diane Lane's very crude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the send of the movie. Does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice? This movie, in a nutshell, had some big names, but to me, was a major disappointment.",negative

That's what you're looking for in a good plan. Some emotional communication. If a person can fall in love too quickly without being real, so be it. You are wrong for you are wrong. Birds of a feather flock together. Another unbelievable feature of the film is that Diane Lane's crude daughter became very friendly and sympathetic when the film was released.

They lived there for a few days, and while they were facing a great storm and great problems in their lives, did Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall in love and help each other? ?

This movie I did’t buy and feels emotional and that’s something you’re looking for in a good place. Some emotional connection. If someone can get in touch with them and fall in love quickly, without any facts, it’s more than that. It's not your fault. Different signs for different people. Another incredible part of the film was Diane Lane her young adult daughter who turned out so well that she missed sending the film.

I went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times I have seen it since, both in the cinema and on TV. It makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and features the greatest male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history. The supporting cast of Oscar Levant (as quirky as never), Georges Guetary (why did't the make more movies ?) and Nina Foch (brilliant in an unsympathetic role) are at the top of their form. The closing ballet, superbly choreographed to the title music, makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of Paris and of the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All the Gershwin songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are ""It's Very Clear"" (Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and ""I Got Rhythm"" (the kids of Paris joining Gene Kelly in ""Une Chanson Americaine"").

26171,"Seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners. Although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring. I think it's seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can come up with something REALLY new. It's pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more 'hip' and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting Beyonce perform and letting P. Diddy and Prince present a category. Also letting Chris Rock be the presenter was an attempt to are-new the ceremony and make it more appealing. None of it really worked out. Sure, Chris Rock is a funny guy but the was't really a good presenter. I really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories. His presence was't really as 'big' as for instance Billy Crystal's. Also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times. Not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theatre was plain weird. Still, I can't remember being any more satisfied with the award winners. None of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case. So does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants? I don't think so. I think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in twenty years from now, with the exception of ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"" maybe. Sure I don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year, for instance Caleb Deschanel should had won for best cinematography, not that I don't like Robert Richardson's work, the really did some amazing work for most of Oliver Stone's work but I really feel that Deschanel deserved the award way more. Also I would had liked seeing Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for best editing and John Debney for best music. But pooh well, there is no way the Academy Awards can please everybody of course, I understand that. There will always be people complaining about the winners. It also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners. Did Prince said any of the nominees names right at once? And were is Sean Penn's sense of humour? Al Pacino and Jeremy ""I hope they missed"" Irons were the best presenters of the night.

26171,"Sadly, the award ceremony for this year's awards has been successful. Although the event itself is short, it is still tiring. I think it’s time to find new directors and producers for this show, they can come up with something very new. Clearly, this year they are trying to get Beyonce to perform with P. Diddy and Prince to showcase the genre, thus making the show “fashionable” and looking for younger audiences. Having Chris Rock as a host makes the event newer and more attractive. None of them really worked. Yes, Chris Rock is an interesting person, but the is not a good broadcaster. I really just see him as someone who speaks between different categories from time to time. His presence is not as “great” as Billy Crystal. In addition, winning prizes is sometimes foolish. It’s amazing not to let everyone on stage and give some prizes in the middle of the stage. However, I do not remember never being more satisfied with the winners. No movie has actually taken away prizes, as they have been for the past few years. Does this mean that this year is a good year for films with a lot of competitors? I do not think so. I think most of the movies will be forgotten in twenty years, except for the ""Million Dollar Child"" and ""The Feast of Christ"". Yes, I do not agree with all the awards presented this year. For example, Caleb Deschanel should win the Best Photography Award. Not that I do not like Robert Richardson's work. He has done a great job for most of Oliver Stone. I also want to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win the best editing award, and John Debney win the best music award. But ooh, yes, the Oscars can't please everyone, I understand that. There will always be people who complain about the winners. Interestingly, most of the prize winners are more afraid than the nominees and winners. Did Prince immediately call the nominees? Is it Sean Penn's point? Al Pacino and Jeremy ""I hope they missed it"" Irons were the most hospitable of the night. All in all, this is a memorable show, but there are some good winners.

Once again Lifetime brings us the predictable triangle; scheming bitchy woman out to get stupid unknowing wife of yet another stupid husband who does't have a clue. I get antsy when I see these films. You may ask, why do I watch them then? I haven't a clue. Usually by mistake. And the movie is so bad I can't get away from it. I wait for the bitch to get her come up-pence. And usually I'm not satisfied in how she gets her just desserts. Now if you can believe your vixen, she steals embryos from the clinic, and how does one do that? Without blood tests, DNA, inquiries and recommendations. She proceeds to kill the Realtor, Gabrielle Rose, who is on to her, in broad daylight in the front yard of a house for sale and no one sees her? She skills the mother, Susan Hogan, and you could predict that surmise when the mother off handedly mentions she's allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her pocket book. Guess what? I won't continue on this. Finally you are left in the house alone with the wife and the bitch. Well good triumphs evil, but much too slowly. Victoria Pratt as the evil girlfriend is adequate in the role, looking a bit too dishevelled and obvious. Tori Spelling just stands around looking blank most of the time. She's got those big big Bette Davis eyes that look like they're popping out of her head. I liked her better in TRICK. And Tahmoh Penikett plays the husband going around assuring this wife there's nothing too the and this sex-girlfriend, even though the's spotted all over town being very chummy with her, standing half naked with her in this house when the sent the wife off to the city to stay overnight.

34491,"""Western Union"" is something of a forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its unavailability on DVD in the United States. However, all is not lost as it has now appeared on Region two in England. This - being a blessing in some ways - is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely American organization as The Western Union Telegraph Company is without a Region one release. It beggars belief! It simply does't make sense! Produced by Fox in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one ""Western Union"" was directed by Fritz Lang. This was only the second occasion the great German director undertook to direct a western! He had done an excellent job the year before with Fox's ""The Return Of Frank James"" and would have only one more western routing in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two with the splendid ""Rancho Notorious"". Lang was no Ford for Hawks but with ""Western Union"" the turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well. Beautifully photographed in early three strip Technicolor by Edward Cronjager it boasted a good cast headed by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female lead is taken by Virginia Gilmore who really has little to do in the picture. An actress who never made anything of her career. Her presence there is merely cosmetic. It is curious that Robert Young has top billing over Scott! It is clearly Scott's picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film's terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains. Young does't have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western. He just looks plain silly going up against Barton McLane in a gunfight! An factor who never really distinguished himself - except perhaps with ""Crossfire"" (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven)- Young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with this greatest success when for seven years the was TV's ""Marcus Welby MD"" in the seventies. He died in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight at the page of ninety-one.""Western Union"" recounts the connection by telegraph wire of Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by Western Union boss Dean Jagger to protect the line from marauding Sioux and to also take on McLane and this gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends. Robert Young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with Scott for the affections of Miss Gilmore. Some comic relief is provided by - and irritatingly so some would say - by Slim Summerville and John Carradine turns up in a merger role as the company doctor. Altogether though a spanking good western, albeit on Region two, but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with. My only crib is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics. UGH! Footnote: Interestingly the associate producer on ""Western Union"" was Harry Joe Brown who later with Randolph Scott would create a partnership that would produce some of Scott's finest westerns in the fifties.",positive

When people think that a film about the founding and establishment of a separate American organization like the Western Union Company has not been released in the First Region, this is somehow a blessing - not only true, but funny. It's amazing! It does't make sense! In one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one the ""Western Union"" produced by Fox was directed by Fritz Lang. This is the second time that the German superintendent has directed a western movie! He did an excellent job at Fox's ""Frank James' Return"" the previous year, and in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two there was one western route and the amazing ""Not Rancho"". Lang is not a Ford for the Hawks, but in ""Western Union"", the became a strong West and performed very well. A beautiful photo taken by Edward Cronjager with three original color photographs. It usually surpasses the cast led by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The heroine was shot by Virginia Gilmore, and has nothing to do with the photo. An factor who never achieved anything in this career. His presence is only decorative. Surprisingly, Robert Young Biscott has the highest law! When we first saw him being chased across the plain by a group of people at a spectacular opening of a movie, it was clearly a photo of Scott from the beginning. Throughout the movie, Young has nothing to do, seemingly out of place in the West. He looked stupid against Patton McLean in the shooting! Something that did’t make it clear — perhaps other than “Crossfire” (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven) —Yang appeared in a series of funny songs memorable in the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys and fiftys, eventually learning the biggest success, seven years being “Marcus Welby MD”.

34926,"I think the deal with this movie is that it has about two minutes of really, really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie does't live up to the trailer. It's a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise, and i think i'm seeing from the comments people having a love/hate relationship with this movie. However, if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast, i think it's still pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, she's so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else, she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee's testosterone-filled coworkers, this elegant mother-in-law, this fratlike friend Jim and this bride-to-be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make Stiles stand out in the first place. Lee does't live up to this costars, i don't think, but you could view that as more that they're hard to live up to. Maybe that's one source of disappointment. The movie itself, despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don't come off as funny as the writer's intended, is still pretty funny and I found a rather intelligent film. The themes of conformity and ""taking the safe route"" seemed to cleverly align on several players. For example, there was the whole motif of how the would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene, for how the was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms, for just how everything selma blair and julia stiles' characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice. The other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which Jason Lee has to keep flying this way through the movie and who through dumb luck (example: the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef) and some cleverness on this part gets away with it for the most part.

37218,"Before this made for TV movie began, I had relatively low expectations. That's because it was made after the final episode of the series had haired and many of the series originals were gone. There is no President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar for Lyta. If you remember, on the second to last episode of the series, all the regulars except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley left B-five permanently. Now for this film they did bring back Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-five movie) to join Zack and the Captain and the Doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance. But because so much is gone of the old chemistry, this film already is severely handicapped. The movie is about a Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen) who is led to Babylon five in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). A lot of spooky mambo-jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless. Yeah, yeah, the station nearly blew up but was saved and all, but frankly I felt like it was a case of ""been there done that--and done that a lot better in the past"". The secondary plot, provided more for comic relief, was much more interesting, as an entrepreneur installed a photo-brothel and those in command were't sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close, they were slapped with a lawsuit. This was fluff, but it did provide a few laughs--something the other dreary plot was surely lacking. By the way, Sheen at first did a good job playing the Should Hunter--with this wild eyes and bizarre delivery. However, repeatedly throughout the episode the fell out of character. This should have been spotted and corrected. So the final verdict is this is only for total die-hard B-five nuts (like myself).

38653,"Claire Denis's Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film. The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient. For example, a central theme in the story is young France's inability to form strong relationships with others. Although this portrayal is executed flawlessly, notably in the way that Denis frames the story with scenes from France's return to her childhood home, the girl's black of intimacy with the film's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development (or black thereof) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of the film's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot. The film raises a great deal of tension between characters, particularly between Aimee and the men in her life, but never fully addresses this social friction, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. The final few scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint, but if you are looking for a film with adventure for drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.",positive

39855,"I am writing this review simply because I am a huge fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and was appalled by the film. I think that if you than't read the book, you would have been lost watching the film, as it provided no real back story to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences at summer camp, her first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling). ). That said, if you had read the book, you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place. I found the book to be a vivid portrayal of depression, highlighting Wurtzel's low points, and the experiences she had along the way. The film however, began at Harvard, and literally threw the audience straight in with no real explanation of what was going on. Events that, in the book, were important (such as Wurtzel's miscarriage, her summer working in Dallas, her suicide attempt whilst on Prozac) were omitted from the film. Also, this is pedantic, but Wurtzel did not close her virginity to Noah. The suicide attempt that was shown in Sterling's office was completely different to the book. For a start, she actually overdosed on Mellaril, as opposed to the para-suicidal gesture shown in the film. All in all, I would say that if you have read the book and enjoyed it/identified with it, then don't watch the film. Read 'More, Now, Again' (by the same author) instead. Or watch Girl, Interrupted. The only redeeming feature was the performance by Anne Heche, who I believe portrayed Dr. Sterling very well. Christina Ricci was also good, though her performance seemed a little. stilted.

But other than that, I have to say I found this somewhat entertaining as I enjoy deep-underground-in-the-earth genre of movies.

A note to movie makers: employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with. It would be a very small part of the movie budget, but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb science. Production values: almost passable. I've seen far worse in my time.

Particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity. Stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing, heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating, ""No matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed."" Which is definitely not the case. A self-caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of ""Don't be so damn stupid in the first place."" Should you watch this movie? If you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store, sure, why not. But do avoid ""Supernova"" as I can assure you that you're not THAT bored. That definitely was not one of Luke Perry's better movies. This one is better. That's not saying much, but it is better.

Paul not only lost John and George (no matter what their final relations were, it must be hard to close someone with whom you changed the world), but the also lost this wife Linda and never really seemed to garner the acknowledgment Lennon's murder received.

Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York.

44695,"Worst film never, this is a statement that people there on IMDb often throw around. Whether it's an Uwe Boll movie, bad classics like Manos The Hands Of Fate for the latest no brains summer action fest from Michael Bay, people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they're posting that there is nothing worse in the movie world. I envy these people, because they're blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit whole of crap movie making really goes. There are films out there so bad, so hideous, so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their lawfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that bad. Ladies and Gentlemen, i present to you Ben and Arthur, an eighty-five minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it's a lot like a violent car crash, you know it's awful but you can't stop looking at it. The brainchild of self proclaimed ""hollywood factor, director"" and may i add beached whale Sam Mraovich, this film is legendarily terrible. Let me give you a hint of how lego driven this project was. Mr Mraovich not only directed this film, the wrote it, produced it, executive produced it, scored it, edited it and then finally starred in it. This is a man so blinded by this own lego and so believing of this non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child the fails to recognise just how catastrophic this bastard creation really is. Everything in this film fails on an epic level, the acting is the worst you will never witness, the plot is the most ridiculous, the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard. I'm aware i've gone on a bit of a tangent there, but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it, i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel, but the truth is it was't even shot on film, it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust. Don't get me wrong, i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting, for example as much as i disliked it The Blair Witch Project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film. Ben and Arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on, even if this film was shot on a budget of twenty million with Hollywoods finest factors it would still suck, the plot is that atrocious, and the characters are even worse. One of the main characters Arthur who is portrayed by non other than Sam Mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds never put in a film. You'll dislike him within five minutes of the start of the film and by the send of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing. Apparently Mr Mraovich forgot that we're supposed to root for the hero. I don't want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you'll experience watching this film (which i surge you not to pay for) so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is, tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie. In one cut we hear one of the main characters say how ""they know a good lawyer and will give HIM a call"" the shot fades out then fades back in and this HIM they spoke of earlier is actually a woman, quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think. The second is simple, seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to Vermont, we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area. I've never been to Vermont personally but i'm certain you won't find any palm trees there. Imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by ten and it still won't fully prepare you for Ben and Arthur. Imagine the absolute worst film you've seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still won't be on the same level as Ben and Arthur, this film is really that bad. However we should be glad in a way, films like this are a true rarity. They give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves for that we can be screenwriters. Simply because we'll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we'll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this. The real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered, and it is called Ben and Arthur.",negative
44695,"The worst movie. This is a man-made report on IMDb. Whether it is Uwe Boll movies for the worst classic like Manos The Hands Of Fate, all from Michael Bay The most ridiculous summer event, people are convincing coming suddenly. in conclusion they hung on the board that there is nothing worse than this film in the world I envy these people because they are happy not knowing anything and do not know how deep the rabbits are made by the garbage movie. ugly, ugly, ridiculous and ignorant and love This is their chat site is the most friendly place on the Internet, because everyone agrees that this movie is very bad. Ladies and gentlemen, I will show you Ben and Arthur, an eighty-five-minute gay epic. It's too bad. It is like a violent car accident. You know it's bad, but you can't stop watching. The mind of the man who calls himself ""Hollywood Factor, Director"", I can add the trapped whale Sam Mraovich, this famous film. Let me tell you how Lego promotes this project. Mr. Mraovich not only directed the film, but also wrote it, produced it, acted it out, scored, edited it and eventually appeared in it. This is a man who has been deceived by this Lego, so believe that this absurd mind is like a man with bad children, who cannot understand how catastrophic the creation of this bastard is. Everything about this movie falls short of the epic level. Its performance is the worst you've never seen, the plot is the most funny, editing and photography are the most popular, and the music is like nails on the board. I know it deserves it there, but believe me, this movie is as bad as I described it. was shot with a digital video camera, not much better than the dust sitting in the room now. Don't get me wrong, I'm sorry for the movie's low budget. The basis is that the idea is interesting. For example, although I don't like it, the Blair Witch project shows that a low budget can produce an interesting film. Ben and Arthur don’t have good ideas to rely on, even though this movie is shot at a budget of twenty million and the best in Hollywood, it would be a very bad thing. Arthur, one of the main characters played by Sam Mraovich, is one of the smallest disgusting opens never seen in a movie. You won’t love him five minutes after the film starts, and as the film is released, the hatred will turn into disgust. Clearly, Mr Mraovich has forgotten that we have to support the heroes. I don't want to waste all the funny things you will find when you watch this movie (I strongly surge you not to spend money) so I will give you two simple examples to show how stupid, gentle and soft this movie is. the smallest unpleasant mistakes in moderate movies. In one clip, we heard the main character say ""They know a good lawyer and they'll call you."" The camera turns off and goes back inside. The one they mentioned earlier is a woman, which is very strange. A mistake I think was made after the production. The second is simple. After seeing a transgender lawyer, the character was told to fly to Vermont, and then we cut him off at the airport that descended between the sunny palm trees. I have never been to Vermont personally, but I am sure you will not find any palm trees there. Imagine this foolish and extended debate over an hour and a half, and a joke and a conspiracy, and repeated ten times, would not make you fully prepared for Ben and Arthur. Imagine for a second you were transposed into the karmic driven world of Earl. You could hardly believe your eyes. However, we have to be happy to a certain extent, those movies are really rare. They gave us hope that one day we could be filmmakers on your own, because we could be screenwriters.

Narrative-wise, there we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus' seven all-important (but poorly animated) thunderbolts  a crime which, for one thing, sets the moon careening on a collision course with Planet Earth! Faster than you can say ""nepotism"", Zeus (once again played as a white-haired bearded man by the relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) sends this champion  who has now rightfully taken this place among the elite thanks to, one presumes, the almighty tasks performed in the first film  to find this blooming thunderbolts and avert the calamities in store. No sooner has Hercules (Lou Ferrigno  as if you did't know) touched the earthly surface that the comes in contact with two attractive damsels (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) in need of this getting them out of distress!; the former (who would go on to become an Italian TV personality) seemingly has the ability to talk with the Little People(!)  which look uncannily like the tiny sisters from GODZILLA VS.

Just so they can swindle as much unutilized footage from the first film as is humanly possible, the divine quartet of villains resurrect good vol' King Minos (William Berger again) from this skeletal slumber and pit him once more against this eternal enemy. Typically, Hercules is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly foes including a Gorgon  an lawfully underproduced sequence which bought to have led to a surefire plagiarism suit had the film-makers behind the much superior CLASH OF THE TITANS (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one) bothered to watch this flick (complete with the same ""reflection in a shield"" come-uppance and preceded by the muscleman letting the audience in on this tactics before executing them as if to show us how clever the is)!! And just to make it crystal clear that the wears this influences on this sleeve, Cozzi has Hercules and Minos turn into a cosmic version of ""King Kong tvs. Godzilla"" for one of their battles and later still, King Kong gets to grips with a large snake, an encounter lifted straight out of the classic one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three original. I swear it: this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! As had been the case with the first film, the cast is full of old reliable like the afore-mentioned Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (as a sorcerer with a truly bad hair day) and up-and-coming starlets  not just Carlucci but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as a younger Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, once again, Eva Robbins (whose costume there easily outcamps her appearance in the first film); for what it's worth, Pino Donaggio's score for this one is recycled from musical cues featured in this soundtrack for the previous film. If you have stuck with this review so far, you must have realized by now that this is one of those movies that is so unbelievably bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take: either dismiss it in one unflattering sentence for spend an undeserving amount of time dissecting its flaws. I'm sure I've left out some of its ineptitude but I would't forgive myself if I failed to mention the single greatest laugh-out cloud instance in the whole movie which almost made me fall off my chair (yes, it even surpassed the afore-mentioned animated titanic duel for me), namely the cdécor of the rebellious gods' blair which is in the shape of a giant marble kettle!! At this stage, one might well wonder why I gave this film (and its predecessor) a rating instead of a (not entirely unjustified) BOMB; in the past, I've had various protracted online discussions on whether one's star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality for its sheer entertainment value but these are two instances where I deemed it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in settling on my final rating. I don't know: maybe it's because I'm in a ""sword-and-sandal"" state-of-mind at the moment (with some ten more respectable examples scheduled for the coming days!) but, after all, uncharacteristically for me, I decided to add these two films to my DVD collection simply based on the fun I had with them in this recent revisit  and that alone must count for something, no?",negative

49195,"This is probably the most uninvolving film I've never seen. I watched it because I have a soft spot for Leon (everything else Besson has done has been just awful, in my opinion, with the exception of the script for Wasabi) and Jean Reno. It's a testament to just how bad this film is that Reno, one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable factors (admittedly the's just starting out there) can't make this film, for the moments in which the is on screen, watchable. It's all very film-schooly: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no apparent reason, people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera. And, predictably, none of it is entertaining. It's not a ""French Mad Max"" as some people have claimed (actually, I think they mean ""Mad Max two"") - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting, and is just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who does't know what they're talking about. Mad Max two was pulsating, Mad Max two was exciting, Mad Max two was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of these. I know it's supposed to be cool to like party black-and-white French films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not (or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy), which is why I would't trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat, because I see nothing of worth in it whatsoever; it tasks for so much and gives nothing back. I found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention. Anyone who can sit through it undistracted in't human, for, at the very most, is psychotic. (Actually, they're probably just trying to seem ""cool"").",negative
49195,"This is the worst movie I've never seen. I watched it because I have a soft spot in Lyon (everything Besson is not doing well, in my opinion, except for the mustard script) and Jean Renault. This proves how bad this movie is. Reno is one of the most interesting and interesting (no doubt it has already started) not to make this movie, at the moment on the screen, available for viewing. All of this is a movie school: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no reason, people running, and at the same time being chased by camera movements. After all, these things just don't seem fun. This in't ""French Mad Max"" as some people claim (actually, I think they mean ""Mad Max II"") - this is a further comparison, based on the fact that both films have a background after being attacked by this fact, and are just a comment to someone you don't know if you're talking with what. ""Mad Max II"" strikes, ""Mad Max II"" is interesting, ""Mad Max II"" is worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is not that. I know that black and white French films like bands have to be cool, and the same cool thing is that you see things you don’t see in other people (or you manage to sit down without feeling drowsy), which is why I don’t. it Believe anyone who says they like Le Dernier Combat, because I don't think it's worth it; it has many functions, but nothing.

49918,"The film opens with a cult leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with this followers chanting for this rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert. Reanhauer(Bill Roy)believes wholeheartedly in this power, and gets so worked up that the collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack. Unable to keep him alive, all those involved, doctors and nurses, are sentenced for attack with Reanhauer's demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri(. big-chested Jill Jacobson)targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance. Forced against her will, with no memory of inflicting such charm, Sherri's host body murders selected victims. Fortunately, Sherri's fellow co-worker, nurse Tara(Marilyn Joi)begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient, Marcus Washington(Prentiss Moulden), once a star football player, whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo. Through Marcus' knowledge, passed down from from, Tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save Sherri before she murders everyone unknowingly. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond(Geoffrey Land)worries about her present condition and welfare. Well, this was my first Al Adamson film and I must agree with this detractors that, just from this film alone, it seems the holds them together with paper clips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see the spirit take control of Sherri is beyond awful and rather laughable. A little soft-core nonsense as filler, some demonic possession thrown in the mix(Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she's possessed), with naughty nurse behavior(. the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a little bit violence/gore. The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast. The sexual situations karen't that hard-core and Al often shoots them without revealing all that much. The film looks embarrassingly cheap and there's an absence of thrills, although the chilling score(. which sounds like something from Dark Shadows)does help a little bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass(. as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she'll even screw a nutty patient, always complaining of illnesses the really does't have, with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal)aren't bad looking, and Adamson's story-line, although frail, is somewhat coherent(. it seems the rarely directs films which are). Overall, the movie looks like it cost five bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(. for, in my opinion, create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story). John F Goff has the role of the hospital's psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri, not believing the idea that she was possessed; the constantly bickers with Peter over her. I watched the unrated ""lost"" version which I guess is the real version to watch of Nurse Sherri.",negative
49918,"At the beginning of the film, the sect leader tries to raise a dead member. When the sun shines on them in the desert, the follower shouts about being born again. Reinhauer (Bill Roy) believed in this power with all this heart and was so passionate that the seemed to have a heart attack and fell. Unable to keep her alive, all affected staff, doctors and nurses were convicted of the demonic spirit of Reanhauer attacking the bent body of nurse Sherri (large breast Gil Jacobson), with the intention of using her as a means of revenge on everyone. Forced to act against this will and not remember to make such an appeal, Shirley's body killed the chosen victim. Fortunately, Shirley's nurse Tara (Marilyn Joy) and blind patient Marcus Washington (Prentice Malden) have a wonderful relationship, Marcus. With the information passed on to Marcus, Tara found out that she could and how she could keep Sherri before she killed everyone unknowingly. At the time, Shirley's lover Dr Peter Desmond (Jeffrey Rand) was worried about this current condition and well-being. Well, this is my first Al Adamson movie, and I have to agree with these critics. We saw that Shirley's Mind Control cartoons were awesome and funny. Some soft nonsense is used as a fertility tool, mixed with certain demonic items (Shirley speaks in another word when she is infected), as well as nurses' (strong) behavior and a bit of violence / blood. The film was basically shot in a small room, and the dialogue between the factors was boring. Sex scenes karen’t that hard, and Al always shoots them without revealing too much. The movie looks cheap and unattractive, though cool notes (which sound like something in a darker shade) help a little bit. Jacobson and Mary Kaypas (like nurse Beth, who seems to be a sex man, if she can disturb a patient, always complains of diseases she does not have, and has enough chest hair to announce that she is a nun Anderson) is not bad, though Adamson's story is weak, but consistent (seems a few directed movies). Overall, the movie seems to cost only $ five, and Adamson just can’t overcome the budget hurdles (or, in my opinion, because sometimes boring stories and boring scenes don’t help the story, creating a kind of unpleasant atmosphere). John F Goff plays the role of a psychiatrist in a hospital. He wants Sherri to commit a crime and the does't believe the has a demon; the always quarrels with Peter because of him.

This is a second rate, excessively vicious Western that creaks and groans trying to put across its central theme of the Wild West being tamed and kicked aside by the steady march of time. It would like to be in the tradition of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", but blacks that film's poignancy and charm. Andrew McLaglen's direction is limp, and the final thirty minutes for so are a real botch, with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone give me a holler if you can explain to me why they set that hillside on fire.) There was something callous about the whole treatment of the rape scene, and the woman's reaction afterwards certainly did not bring true. Coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge, but all of this fellow escapees are underdeveloped (they're like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story lurches forward). Michael Parks gives one of this typically shifty, lethargic, mumbling performances, but in this case it was appropriate as this modern style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring about.",negative
