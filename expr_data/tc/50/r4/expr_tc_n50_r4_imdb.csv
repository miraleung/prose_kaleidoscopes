After a reporter and a doctor stay the night at this home and discover the is responsible for the brides' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards. You have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old shag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in Bela's house. Bela and this wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie. The Corpse Vanishes is worth a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Great fun.

350,"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly in't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of this entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of this panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that the's writing this own films, you'd think the'd give himself a role that the has't been typecast in already.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that bought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.",positive
350,"Man with a Crying Brave is certainly not the perfect movie, but I'm sure it's just Bruce Campbell's transport, which means it can be used as a summary of all work: farce, Satire, cheese, action and a fun ending. As a writer, Campbell is unequal - there are a lot of things in the absurd story (why does a robot suddenly have breasts, because they are implanted in a woman’s brain?), And some spiders feel more like others. . A good birthday version (the place where Yegor and William compete for control of William's body in a restaurant, specifically in ""Evil Possession two""). However, there are a lot of small activities and mind-boggling emotions. For example, when William was very high, the shouted at the statue, ""What are you watching ?!"" a mythical channel, perhaps Because it is. Play is very good. I love Tamara Gorski as much as Tatoya; yes, the's cold and cunning, but sometimes the story that has't been tested, the seems to have a bad temper. Ted Raimi plays the standard role of “rare assistant” brilliantly, and Bruce jokes as arrogant, sarcastic, and demeaning to American dignity. (Because they are writing their own movies, you might think they will give themselves an unfinished role.) Screaming Brain is an unusual and humorous B film, and it is bought to enjoy anything that can prevent overcoming People who take the movie experience seriously.",positive

2024,"I liked the understated character that Laura Linney played in 'Love Actually', and she is very good in 'Man of the Year'. But wow. Robin Williams does't give that much of a performance, with a couple of minor exceptions this was weak. Laura Linney may not have been miscast, but either the editing raped her character, for this was just a sad performance by director Barry Levinson. And I think it was Barry Levinson that got old. So many weak performances, such uneven results have to be the fault of management. Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are great in supporting roles. Goldblum plays a sinister side with relish, and Walken's combination of entertainer's manager and commentator for the film is wonderful. But the story is clické, the presentation looks like it could have (should have) been a very good picture, and too many actions are half-hearted. The spacing, story, and direction all come up weak, compared to, say 'Head Office' (spoof of 'Secret of My Success').",negative

2676,"This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script. But it is hard to watch, because there is no good send to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it's also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends. The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation. There is redemption of a sort, in the send, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great spain for her. This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to ""Mr & Mrs Iyer"". In the send, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.",positive

There are no real superstars in the cast, though the smaller faces will be more common. Every character has done a good job in the script. But it's bad, because nothing good is sent in a situation like this. It is now commonplace to accuse the British of allowing Hindus and Muslims to fight among themselves and then brutally divide them into two countries. There is a truth to this view, but it is true that no one has forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to torture one another as they did during the separation. The British people seem to be table to see only the differences between the religions and use wisdom enough to achieve their goals. The result is cruelty and inhumanity in this situation, which is very unpleasant to remember and see on screen. But it has never been described as a black and white shell. Both sides are downplayed and respected, and there is hope that the new generation will change. There is a kind of ransom, in the post, when Puro has to make a difficult choice between a man who has ruined this life but who truly loves him and the family with whom the broke off this relationship, and then they get it. But at the moment, the has no choice, no Spain is right for him. The message of the film is that Muslims and Hindus have serious flaws, and both can be dignified and caring. The authenticity of the division makes this even more tragic, as true reconciliation can never take place on the India / Pakistan border. In this way, it is similar to ""Mr. & Mrs. Iyer"".

2778,"This was only the second version of the classic story by Charles Dickens I had seen, and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst. The film opens with a quick live action piece where Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the story of A Christmas Carol, and then obviously it goes to animated story itself. You probably already know it, Ebenezer Scrooge is the grouchy cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage) who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of Christmas Past (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the silent Future/Yet To Come. After all this the obviously realises the true magic of Christmas, and promises to be nicer in future. The only changes I noticed to the story were Scrooge having mice as friends (a stupid idea), Scrooge's sex-love Belle (Kate Winslet) needing to see him to help at the orphanage, the Ghost of Christmas Present showing the two kids, ""want"" and ""ignorance"", Scrooge still gets haunted after being turned nice, and the's worried the can't keep this promise to stay nice. Also starring Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit, Iain Jones as Scrooge's nephew Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig. The animation is not great quality, the factors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of garbage. The only good thing that comes from this film is the good voice of Kate Winslet, singing the closing song ""What If"", as for the rest, it is just excruciatingly awful. Very poor!",negative

After all, all of this clearly understands the magic of Christmas, and hopes to get better in the future.

3069,"This is another of Eastwood's many movies mixing intrigue, action, and a dollop of romance, along with ""The Gauntlet,"" ""Firefox,"" and so forth. Clint's acting range by now is pretty familiar. In this one, the's taciturn and a bit outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in this performance. But the film itself is something of a surprise; it's above average. Clint is Frank, a Secret Service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK. He then took to drink, which drove this family away, and now plods along in the bureaucracy until the is contacted by John Malkovitch, calling himself ""Booth,"" who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared, disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability. Now, this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like Clint to project, but the does rather well, less robotic than usual. And the does seem to carry around with him, like a burden of stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He's tested again halfway through this movie. He is changing from the proof of a tall building, grasping Booth's hand, and the pulls this pistol and points it at Booth, who tasks him if the is really willing to shoot. If the does, of course, the saves the president from an attempted assassination by a CIA-trained murderer, but the does so at the cost of this own life. Booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair. And Clint even has a short speech, talking to Renee Russo, about this failure to save the president in Dallas. ""If I'd have reacted quickly enough, I could have taken that shot . . . and that would have been alright with me."" It's underplayed, but this voice chokes slightly, this eyes water, and this clip trembles. It's one of the few scenes in any of Clint's films that might properly be called ""moving."" We know from this newfound resolve that given another chance the would take the bullet this time. (The irony is that the does't like the current president. Who could? He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how they ""carved a nation out of the wilderness."" Didn't they do the same thing in Las Vegas?)It's often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. It in't true, nothing is that simple, but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case. The reptilian John Malkovitch with this Tartar eyes is marvellous. Talk about disillusioned. Okay, the can ham it up a little, sniffing with disdain even as the plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes, but the's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little do to. Fred Thompson, as the chief White House said, is now back in politics, a relief for movie-goers. If Clint's acting range is limited, Thompson's is something less. In every film the's been in, the wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression, as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder. The direction by Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in ""Das Boot,"" which is pretty good. There is a great deal of the usual suspenseful across-cutting in the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor -- not only the usual garments but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impediments.

Then the started drinking, kicked the family out, and now the's moving a little farther little in bureaucracy, until John Malkovich called himself ""Booth"", based on their shared, confused beliefs. Establishing a twisted relationship with him is meaningless without escaping the influence of dullness and prediction. Now, for players like Clint, this is a disturbing attitude, but the result is good, not as normal as usual. And it seems to carry the memory of Dallas at the moment like a stone. He are-tested it in the middle of the film. He turned from the testimony of a tall building, grabbed Booth's hand, pulled out a gun and pointed it at Booth. If Booth was really ready to shoot, Booth could have blamed him. If the does, yes, the president will be saved from the assassination attempt by a CIA-trained assassin, but doing so puts this life in danger. When they held hands in the air, Booth complained to her about the situation. Clint even gave a short talk with Renee Russo about the failure to save the president in Dallas. ""If I react fast enough, I can shoot . so that's fine for me."" It was looked down upon, but the voice was a little strained, the eyes were watery, and the clip trembled. This is one of the few episodes in Clint's film that can rightly be called ""walking"". We know from this determination that we have just discovered that if there is another opportunity, they will accept the bullet at this time. (Surprisingly, they don't like the current president. Who can? He made a good speech in Colorado about how they ""took the country out of the desert."" They don't do the same in Las Vegas. Is that right?

3408,"'Intervention' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery. I'm a middle-aged married father of two. I'm quite functional in my personal and professional life. Still, I have spain from my past that I use addictions to soothe, and issues from which I am slowly recovering. When these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family. The show, unlike many others, digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction. Many of us suffer because it's too scary to go back and do, as Alice Miller says, ""the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of your childhood."" The show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started. This digging is painful and difficult, but worth it. So much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non-fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues. Often it's assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up for whatever for fun for pleasure for self-interest, and now they can't stop. Not so: addictions are about killing spain. I can relate to the different events and hardships in people's lives. There are common themes, and surprising exceptions. Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse. Some kids simply respond badly to divorce. To those who think that addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship, I would just say that different people respond differently. Although some kids handle divorce well, others, like Cristy in the show, ""collapse in a cheap on the floor"" and have their lives forever changed by the event. For example, last night's counselor said that pretty young Andrea seeks validation from men. She strips for cash for a seventy-five-year old neighbour and lets men abuse her. Sound familiar to anyone? The series is filled with information that we can use to understand your own motivations and make adjustments to your lives. Often it's those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest. As they say, even a stopped watch is right twice a day, but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while, until it's made your life miserable. To the producers: Thank you for making the show, for digging into the past, for the follow-ups. Also, the graphics, the format, and the theme music are brilliant. To the addicts: thank you for your courage to share. Whether for not you have helped yourself, you have helped me.",positive
3408,"""Intervention"" has helped me to solve my addiction problem and recovery. I am a married father with two children. In my personal and professional life, I work very hard. However, I still have the Spanish past, and I use addiction to alleviate the problem that I am slowly recovering from. When these slaves and their families shared their lives with me, they helped me improve my life and my relationship with my family. Unlike many other shows, this show goes into the past of drugs and reveals the events that can cause them to become addicted. As Alice Miller pointed out, many of us are suffering because going back in time is so bad, ""discover and accept emotionally the truth in your personal childhood and unique history."" This show at least starts this process which is commendable. This is bad and painful, but it’s worth it. The sheer number of reports of addiction — both mythical and untrue — seems to overlook basic issues. People always think that drugs start to go crazy with any pleasure and enjoyment someday, and now they can’t stop. Not so: addicted to killing Spain. I am table to relate to different issues and difficulties in people’s lives. There are some common themes, and there are some amazing variations. Many drug users have been abused. Some children do not respond well to divorce. For those who think addiction is a form of stress, I just want different people to react differently. While some children deal with divorce well, some children, like Christie in the show, “fall down and don’t call”, and their lives have been forever changed by the event. For example, a counselor last night said Andrea is young and handsome and wants to be accepted by men. He kidnapped a seventy-five-year-old neighbour and allowed a man to abuse him. Does anyone sound familiar? This series is full of information that we can use to understand your goals and to organize your life. Usually, those of us who have minor problems suffer the most. As they say, the stopwatch is accurate twice a day, but a slow clock can be detected for a long time until it makes your life miserable.

4057,"I had a check of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. First off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this milk. Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in your lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking film in many ways. However, don't be too fooled by its real intent. It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with this aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together this dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. One other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.",positive

4584,"Its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one, but for me Tears of Kali is one of the horror highlights of the zero's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece. An anthology horror, it takes on the story of the fictional Taylor-Eriksson Group, a cult of sorts based in India whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche, with unpleasant results that echo down the years. With bookend segments set in India the film is made chiefly of three stories set in Germany, illustrating the aftermath of the work of the Taylor-Eriksson Group, with some pretty nasty gore at times. Its an interesting set up as these things go, but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror. Bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients, healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals, dark forces unbound by time, place for even personality. Good examples of this are found in the first story especially, dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital. Previous to this story we have seen Lars Eriksson and notably this wonky (lazy?) eye, we also see him healing for at least comforting a patient. The lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as Eriksson healing a fellow patient, also as she wraps up the canvases from the part class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen, a face with lazy eye like Erikssons. There are also references to folk in minuscule roles, extras and walk sons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film, showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and table to almost infect others. There is more to the film philosophically than just evil within, it is a film about death, suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from Hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect (at least from the research that I did on wikipedia). Writer/director Andreas Marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for this skill in constructing the film. As well as being thoughtful, the film is pretty chilling too, the soundtrack of Bharti India and Panama John has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances, Michael Balaun as a sinister doctor and Cora Chilcot as a freaky patient especially good. The third story also has a fine turn from veteran Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer. The biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well. So, the film in't quite as gripping as it might be, the acting occasionally off and the spacing too, but mostly I thought it was pretty great, if a shade short of its possible brilliance. Well worth a look for adventurous horror fans I think.",positive
4584,"I watched it a few times before I really heard this, but for me, Kali's tears are one of the most important part of the horror film. it is a real work of part. This is a terrifying story that tells the story of the Taylor-Eriksson Group, an Indian-based sectarian organization whose members begin to seek the best possible knowledge and spiritual healing, and whose unpleasant consequences have been felt for years. Fragments of the film set in India, mostly composed of three German stories, show the results of Taylor-Erickson's Team work, and sometimes there are scenes of bloodshed. With the development of these things, this is an interesting situation, but what makes this movie seem like a carefully crafted approach to the horror movie development. Bad things have been released. The common process of filming is to see how curiosity and ultimate healing can bring fear to patients, therapists and others, and this movie is full of seemingly wise clues about the powers of darkness. includes, Dark forces that are not bound by time, even in the realm of humanity. A good example in this regard is most evident in the first story, which tells the story of a journalist who interviewed a woman at a psychiatric hospital. Prior to this story, we have seen Lars Eriksson, especially this eye (or lazy eye), and we have seen him recover at least by comforting another patient. The female psychiatrist in the first story has a similar situation as Eriksson treats a patient At the same time, when the closes the sail of the part of the classroom where the was running with other patients, their photo can be seen, a lazy face with Eriksson's eyes. It is also mentioned that the people who play the small, extra roles and the wandering sons have an extra sense of what is going on in the film, which shows the spread of evil evolved and the table almost infects other people. The film is not only an internal evil in terms of philosophy, it is a film about death, suffering, and possible salvation. They are all tied to a building based on Hindu beliefs. . The ability of screenwriter / director Andreas Marshall in making this film is commendable. In addition to good thinking, the film is also very cold. The sounds of Bharti India and Panama John have beautiful piano music, and there are remarkable performances, Michael Balaun as a wicked doctor and Cora Chilcot as a rare patient. Especially well. The third story also has a beautiful turning point, coming from experienced Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer. The big problem with this movie is that it does't take much time and therefore closes the power of fear, but these shows and others have successfully participated. Well, this movie is not as interesting as it thinks, the performance is sometimes disrupted, and the rest time is the same, but in most cases, I think it is very good, if the possible splendour is not enough. I think it’s worth looking at the awesome fans who are interested.",positive

The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home. I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but America should have the power to decide who does home. There's really no point to the using-off. The person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway. Another things I'd change is to see them actually act on the show.

The eliminated Danny always sings the same song and the eliminated Sandy always sings the same song as they exit. Since they using it every week those songs eventually get annoying.

Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. No bones, nothing. Thats ridiculous. How can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? Even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. Their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scare me more. and they're supposed to look stupid. Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. How can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerated people in their tracks? Equally insulting is the sixty's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, for the eighty's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television. The stupidest part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four five minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams.

The plot(such as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the AI robots revolted(sound familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it. The few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the Dark One, which seems to be part computer and part organic being. The 'air slaves' work to produce energy for this being in return for breathable air. Every once in a while, the Dark One has the strongest of the air slaves fight to the death, so that no one will rise as a leader in a revolt against the Dark One. Okay, that's the so-called serious stuff. On to the silly stuff, such as the ridiculous quasi-futuristic clothing that everyone sports, including car seat cover 'fur' garments, loin cloths, and spangle stuff and feather boas(worn mostly by the Dark One's frenchwoman, a chick with an unrecognizable and almost non-understandable accent). Or the wooden acting and stilted lines sported by all of the so-called 'actors', who's dialog is high on pretension and low on sense. Or the dime store special of, including pink socks with teeth glued onto them for 'deadly' sewer snakes, a bomb made of strung piano wire and a tin can, and terrible 'mutants' with Halloween rubber masks on.

12539,"We see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl, but whatever the tries they won't stay open. After this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret, but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways. Through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group, but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences. So, is she back from the grave seeking revenge? Oh what a great and always spooky story! Well, that's what I hoping I could say. And 'hoping' was as good as it got. This is an forgettable, so-so supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before, but I went in thinking it was my first viewing. So to my surprise it hit me when I started picking up on certain things, but like I said it's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again. ""Nightmare' is just another type of it's field that adds a 'few' changes to the gruel. Oh, please give me something that's a bit more fresh. It does't have to be entirely original, but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired J-horror flick. Even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right an evil looking, vengeful chick spirit. But in spite of my negativity of it being the same old, same old story and jolts. This one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals. The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality. While, the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it's murky lighting. The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood-curdling experience, but really when it's not trying to shock you. I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shut-eye. That might be harsh, but it just did't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments. You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one, the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self-centred bunch that you don't really care what happens to them. The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship. It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it's just plain ludicrous. The film's haunting ending is a high point, though. The film looks fine, although it could have done without the snazzy, quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood. The performances tread a fine line, but Gyu-ri Kim is strong in the lead role. It's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas, but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills. Although, I found the handling of it rather lethargic, despite the odd effective chills. A standard effort all around I guess, but still it's equally unmissable.",negative

So, did the come back from the grave to take revenge? Oh, what a lasting story! Well, this is something I wish to say. And “hope” is as good as it gets. This horrible supernatural movie, I've watched it before, but I think this is the first time I've watched it. So to my surprise, when I first received some things, I was shocked, but as I said, it was very easy to forget the connection, and it was as if I had never seen it before. ""Nightmare"" is another kind of field, adding ""other"" variations to the porridge. Oh, please give me something new. It does't have to be completely original, but this is a horror movie for J tired in the formulaic era. Although related to the ghost stories of the ghost, the guessed that it was the charming charm of the evil chicken. But even though I deny that they are the same old, the same old stories and bumps. This is exciting when there seems to be something terrifying and scary. Death has clearly shown a bite and a certain skill. Dark air and dark flights made them an audience. The first show involving psychological intimidation by one of the girls was a shocking experience, but it really was when she did’t want to be shocked. I have found that it can easily lead to a coma, and I want to close my eyes. This can be difficult, but it is just a scary moment for those who are not interested. You could say that because there are so many mysteries, the uncertain story is clear. The characters are a group of selfish people, and you don't care what happens to them. The cut-off story should focus more on the spirit, rather than on the spirit of the main characters who have a positive group relationship. It's just confusing and it took you a long time to start playing cards, when it comes to the climax, it's funny. However, the memorable ending of this movie is a high point. The film looks good, though it can be made without style, fast editing, and a little sound when it comes to giving emotions. Performance is widely described, but Kim Gyuri is strong on the protagonist. This is not a new phenomenon, it is a shameful thought, but if you look beyond it, it will bring you happiness.

13427,"Since I'd seen the other three, I figured I might as well catch this made for TV fourth part of The Omen series. As a stand alone film, this movie is mediocre; but as a sequel to the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six masterpiece; it's a travesty. The film goes along the same route that many series' go down when they're running out of ideas; that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female. It's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard, the plot blacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum. The film does keep a thread with the original, which I won't reveal as despite being obvious; that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie. The basics of the plot largely copy Richard Donner's original, and see a young couple adopt a child, which they name Delia (not Damiella for Damiana, fortunately). There's a big dog involved, and a child minder; and pretty soon, the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal; as she's menstruating at weight years old, and never suffered from any illnesses. The first two sequels to The Omen were't bad at all, and the series really should have ended at number three. I guess there was money involved somewhere down the line, as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made. It brings nothing to the table in terms of originality, and the only thing it's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series. The film looks and feels like a TV movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl. Indeed, Asia Vieira does look like a little bitch; but she never convinces that she's the Antichrist, as her stares are redundant and most of the 'evil' she does is laughable. Faye Grant is given the meatiest role, and does't impress; while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time. The only good thing about this movie is the theme tune, which of course has been ripped off from the original; and is overused. On the whole, this film really in't worth seeing; as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for, and does't even do justice to weaker second sequel.",negative

Like an independent movie, this movie is useless; but a modification of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six artwork; this is a kind of irony. This movie takes the same path as many series that will be removed when there is no opinion. This is the idea of ​​changing the male-dominated environment to the female lead. Clearly, this movie is made for television because the performance is so good, and the dark tricks and deadly scenes seen in the first three movies are kept small. The film maintains a sense of belonging and authenticity, though it is clear, I will not expose it; this revelation is one of the most interesting in the film. The central theme of the story repeats Richard Downer's first work, and the sees a married couple adopting a child, naming them Delia (fortunately, Damiana is not Di Miera). There was a big dog and a babysitter; soon, the woman began to suspect that the baby might be abnormal; because she had a hard page, and she did't have any disease. The first two types of Omen are not bad at all, and this series should send in third place. I think it will definitely involve money, because there is no technical reason why this movie should be made. Originally, it did’t bring any benefits, the only possible success is to annoy fans of the list. This movie looks and feels like a movie on television from beginning to send, and in many cases, it is like a movie about a little girl growing up. Yes, Asia Vieira looks like a small thing, but she never believed she was the antichrist because her eyes are nothing and most of the ""evil"" things she does are ridiculous. Faye Grant was given the best role, but it was not the most interesting, and some players regretted agreeing to play this difficult waste of time.

13750,"Although I do not recommend this film, neither do I recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Though I have not given away the ending, for most of the plot twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. It's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film Donnie Darko, as there are many to deal with. Richard Kelly, in this first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and inoffensive, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen-angst dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist. The result is deeply distressing-- for all the wrong reasons. The film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism for meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, by hiding it under a veneer of CGI effects and new-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by this friends, and rendered hostile and disaffected by this suburban life. We are meant to feel that the is more intelligent than this schoolmates, although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of this friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie counters with a theory of this own, this friend complains about Donnie acting ""all smart."" Donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of this friend-- just angrier. The only clear evidence of this intelligence is this principal's description of this standardized test scores as `intimidating;' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. In fact, the entire issue of the drugs is understated, and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all of this may be a product of this imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film one hundred percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the ""science"" behind the ""fiction"" is very shaky. The explanations of time travel are weak, at best sounding like detached, uninformed rambling. We get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel for a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film. The scientific portion, as a result, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel states that if the continues to speak on the subject, the'd be fired. Apparently no further explanation is needed). Donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions. The justification for these actions is a tricky business. He damages this school, but it's okay, because this school does't treat him like a person. His punishment of a creepy self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) results in the man's public humiliation. But should the audience believe that Donnie is some sort of avenging angel, striking out against ignorance and debauchery? He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Aside from these flaws, the film is riddled with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story is set in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, just before the Bush/Dukakis selection, and the director touches on this point during the film. The focus, however, extends exactly this far: Donnie's gruff, blue collar father is voting for Bush, while this free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement there; simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter should be left out. Likewise, Donnie's heartfelt speech about not being table to plump all human emotions into the bland categories of ""fear and ""love;"" this does't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. Everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. Mr. Kelly gives homage to several symbols of eighty's pop culture in this film: E. T., Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future. At it's heart, this film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of this own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disenchantment, roughly stitched together by untrained hands. Entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions, seemingly because the director likes the songs. Characters who have little to no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are given unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow. The awkward mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas left in this head to make another film, for if the has wasted all this creativity in one pointless, cluttered, meandering effort. My rating: one/ten.",negative
13750,"Although I do not recommend this movie, I do not recommend reading this review without seeing the movie first. Although I haven't revealed the ending, in most twists, this movie is well-watched without any prior knowledge. It is difficult to pinpoint the main problem of the film Donnie Darko, because there are many issues that need to be addressed. In this first film, Richard Kelly seems to have collected enough of the sounds of adolescence, the swearing of the night, the reasons for self-righteousness and the harmless philosophy of promoting twenty anxiety dramas; then pack them in a two-hour science package. The consequences are devastating — for all the wrong reasons. The film tries to guide the audience in a complex way without meaning, and to make them sympathetic to the equal characters. The protagonist, Donnie Darko, is a young man dedicated to treatment, misunderstood by friends, and full of hostility and dissatisfaction with this urban life. We have to assume that they are smarter than the student, even though at times it is difficult to do so. For example, when a friend suggested a ridiculous theory about the Smurfs, and Downey disputed this theory, the friend complained that Downey was ""too clever"". However, Downey’s speech was more absurd than a friend’s speech — just angry. The clearest evidence of this wisdom is the principal description of the standard test scores ""as awesome""; but given the tendency of the director to arrange things easily for people (as shown in the sequence of fear-love), this is good for character development. . Downey is taking prescribed medication to combat mental health problems, and this movie is not a direct solution to these problems. After all, every drug problem has been underestimated, and the director’s first chance to pay for the film was lost. Downey’s shocking send is the ambiguity, and it’s possible that all of this is a product of this idea being pushed back, making this movie one hundred% encyclopedic. This in itself would not be a bad thing, but the ""science"" behind ""fiction"" is not very stable. The explanation of the passage of time is weak, and rightly sounds like a hidden, ignorant statement. We think the author of this movie has read a few chapters about the passage of time and does't remember how it works, but is sure the is interested and wants to include it in the movie. Therefore, the science component relies heavily on expensive computer animation rather than on the actual development of the concept involved (in one case, a professor who discussed over time said that if the continued to talk about the subject, the would be fired. Explain). Downey's interactions with a visitor from the future led him to do bad things. The reason for these actions is deceptive. He ruined the school, but it does't matter, because the school did't treat him like a human being. His punishment of a faithful self-confident lawyer (similar to Tom Cruise's role in ""Mulan"") led to the man being publicly humiliated. But should the audience believe that Downey is a kind of revenge angel, who fights ignorance and immorality? He did not seem to realize the impact of these behavior until after. In addition to these shortcomings, the film is also frank and boring in human nature. The story unfolded in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-eight, just before Bush / Dukakis chose, the director touched on the film. However, the emphasis extends there: Downey's blue father votes for Bush, and this free, rebellious girl plans to vote for Dukakis. There is no such thing as a political report. Just a clear statement. The first one is not necessary to make a good movie, but the last one should not be included. Likewise, in Downey's heartfelt expressions, do not put all human emotions into two distinct forms of ""fear"" and ""love""; this does not require the audience to do anything great in the understanding. Everyone knows that there are two other human emotions, and emphasizing this is not helpful. In this film, Mr. At its heart, the film feels like a director’s reward for him, a collection of these experiences, interests, personal heroes and opponents, credentials and disappointments, combined with untrained hands. Characters with little influence on the plot (including ordinary bullies, fat girls, and right-wing idiot educators) are given unnecessary attention because the director really wants to pack the them in some way.

14622,"While watching a mundane modern movie (The Runaway Bride) with my granddaughter (age twenty-two) she asked me ""Since you've been watching movies since one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-eight, what is the greatest movie of your lifetime?"" Boy! What a choice that is! It took me all summer of thought and relooking a some flicks before I made my decision. It is ""THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES"". This movie has no flaws. It is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story. There is not a single part in the film which could be left out. The young girl's fixation with her brothers black of hands, the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man whose only responsibility was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for this action. A women who must now adjust to the husband who's life has been away from her for years. The realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf. The look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands. A parents first look and reaction to their son's new deformities. A man used to making life and death decision in a instant, having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank's loan structure. This is no sympathetic, tear jerking, heart strumming act. THIS WAS REAL LIFE! It could not have been portrayed any different. This, my friends, is HOW IT WAS!! This could easily be considered a documentary. In this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest B/W filming, editing and directing you will never see. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would make it compulsory for anyone taking history, film making, creative writing, sociology, family counciling for psychology to view and report on this magnificent example of the film makers part.",positive

The undaunted Sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship, tiptoes into Tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - wham! - there's ""Granny"" at the door with her umbrella. Sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again. But, ""flippety gibbet,"" says Granny, ""I've dropped my glasses. I can't see a thing without 'em. Heavens to Betsey, where are those cheaters.""Now Sylvester has the upper hand. and the normal cat-trying-to-catch-bird shenanigans are on again, like Granny's glasses. Sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on them, so when she woke up and put them on, she'd see the bird and think it was okay.

The quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the Dentist ""takes care"" of this wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening. The rest is left to your very fertile imaginations! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role since the has lots of experience playing psychologically ""off"" characters and the completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist.

All of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office. There's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist's arrival. Meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown!

18805,"I remember when I first saw this movie. I was babysitting for a friend of my mums, and one of the kids suggested we watch it. Thinking it was the frankly laughable 'Prince of Thieves' they were slipping into the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom, What I got came as a shock, a pleasant one I'll admit, but still a shock. Now, you all know the Robin Hood legend don't you? I shall explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, nicking money there and there and giving it to people who needed it, all the while seducing the beautiful Maid Marion, and vexing the Sheriff of Nottingham and prince john. That's the basics! Now, on with the review. This movie was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, and is a take off of the whole Robin Hood legend and a up--- take of Prince of Thieves in particular. Loosely following the legend, Robin of Loxley is first encountered in an Arabic prison during the third century crusades, and together with a 'Moor' as they were called in those days, the executes a cunning escape with a cellmate, Asneeze. After escaping, Asneeze beseeches Robin to find this son Atchoo, a foreign exchange student in England and look out for him. This Robin vows to do! Robin swims back to England. He returns to this home, Loxley castle to find it being wheeled away on the back of the cart by Bailiffs, and goes through the sorrowful revelation that this father, dog, cat, and even the goldfish are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, the finds the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin sitting on the toilet with a Jazz mag in Braille. The hilarity continues throughout the movie. As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the sheriff of Rottingham, who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on King Richards's kingdom while the's away. Those familiar with the movies Mel Brooks has previously directed will have some small idea of what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for Dracula-dead and loving it and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, which range from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie, with never more than a minute between laughs. Cary Elwes (incidentally the only English man to play Robin Hood in a movie), who many of you will know from Princess Bride brings this cheeky grinning twinkle eyed presence to this movie, and does a wonderful job. From outlandish heroic posturing, to a wickedly sexy glance, the really is amazingly funny. And the man looks better in tights than I do! Richard Lewis is hilarious as the whiny, arrogant Prince John with the never-changing mole. He gets the sissy-boy behaviour down to a tee, and this whinging American vocalizations are great. All the way through the movie, a mole on this face constantly changes position: it starts on this left cheek, then over to this right cheek, then this chin, then this forehead, before going back to it's original place. This is a subtle joke based on the mole on Alan Rickman when the played the sheriff in Prince Of ThievesRoger Rees as the sleazy sheriff of Rottingham is marvellously slimy and nasty, and has some great lines throughout the film. There are some faces there you'll be familiar with from other Brooks films. For instance Robert Ridgely, playing the hangman in this film also played the hangman in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He likes to add subtle references to this earlier films too; with several in this film that die-hard Brooks fans will easily spot. Those who watched History of the World part one will recognise the music to the song 'Men in Tights'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and songs Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) cutters the line 'it's good to be a king', one of this lines in History of the world. The whole cast is wonderfully comedic, even those with only a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humour to themWhat makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my own opinion are all the improvised scenes. Although there was a script of sorts, some scenes were completely improvised by the factors themselves, such as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) sprays for Rottingham in her bed, and the falls through the ceiling, landing right where she wanted him, which was totally devised and thought out by the two factors. There are few special effects, and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerised camera trickery. The soundtrack is memorable, with some very funny songs, and a couple of cheesy love songs. You'll be singing 'Men in tights' for at least humming it to yourself, for weeks. The rating is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the film, except in the use of double entendre, and one utterance of cash!t, and violence is minimal. In fact I'd go as far as to say non-existent, apart from a few comedy fight scenes. A great fun film that adults and children alike will enjoy!",positive
18805,"I remember the first time I watched this movie. I was caring for my mother's friend, and one of the children suggested that we watch it. I think this is a funny and funny ""Prince of Thieves"" who came in to the video recorder, I was ready for the boring hours. The result I got was shock. I admit it was fun, but I was shocked. Now, you all know Robin Hood's legend, don't you? Let me explain a little more. Robin Hood is a Saxon criminal. He pays for everything and gives it to those in need. At the same time, the seduces Marion's beautiful maidservant and annoys the Sheriff and Prince John of Nottingham. This is the foundation! Now, keep exploring. The film was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three and with the removal of all Robin Hood legends, especially the rise of the Prince of Thieves. Following the legend, Robin of Locksley first met in an Arab prison during the Third Crusades and decisively with the prisoner Asniz, who was known as ""Moor"" at the time. After this escape, Asnitz persuaded Robin to find this son, Archiu, who was studying in the UK, and to take care of him. Robin promised to do it! Robin returns to England. He returned to the home, Loxley Castle, and found that the had been pushed away by the bailiff in the back of the car, and had experienced the tragic revelation of the death of this father, dog, cat, and even goldfish. Unable to wait for a familiar face, they found Brinkin, the family's faithful blind servant, sitting in the bathroom holding a jazz magazine with a braille in this hand. Laughter pervades the entire movie. Like all of Robin Hood's stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the Sheringhamshire Sheriff, who burned and collected high taxes during the departure of King Richards. Those who are familiar with the films directed by Mel Brooks in the past will have a vision of what is to come. After all, it was the man who caused Dracula's death and the fell in love with her and little Frankenstein. All the jokes, from visual gimmicks to humorous funny ideas, come from the right place in every movie, with not one moment between laughter. Gary Elvis (by the way, the only Englishman who played Robin Hood in the movie), many of you will know from the female princesses to bring a smiley face to this movie in the movie, and the did a great job. From the strangest state of heroism to the ugly and sexy view, it is very interesting. That man looks better in tights than I do! Richard Lewis plays Prince John proud and arrogant, immovable. He was showing that sissy behaves in a tee, and this kind of complaint about the United States was good. Throughout the movie, a mole on this face eventually changes position: starting with the left cheek, then the right cheek, then the chin, forehead, and then back to the original position. This mysterious joke, based on a mole by Alan Rickman (Alan Rickman) who played Roger Rees (Rottingham) in ""The Prince of Thives"" for a long time, is thin and annoying, and there are great lines throughout the movie. You will be familiar with some of the faces from other Brooks films. For example, Robert Richley, who starred in the movie, also starred in another movie directed by Brooks, ""The Hot Saddle."" He likes to add hidden references to previous movies; a few in this movie are easily spotted by hard-working Brooks fans. Those who have seen the first part of world history will understand the music of the song ""Man in Tights"". In addition, when Patrick Stewart arrived and sang Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) cut the line ""It's great to be a master."" This is one of the lines in ""World History"". All the players are very funny, even the few lines that bring them deep warmth and humour. In my opinion, what makes this movie so incredibly warm and interesting is all the scenes of improvement. Although there are a variety of scripts, some spiders are fully enhanced by the elements themselves, such as the place where Ratling (Tracy Ullman) splashes water on Rottingham's bed, and falls off the ceiling. It’s fully crafted and considered for these two things. There are a few special effects, those with small but interesting computer camera tricks. The soundtrack is unforgettable, there are some very interesting songs, and a few songs of cheesy love. You can using ""Men in Tights"", and at least smile for yourself for a few weeks. Measured by Pg, I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in this movie, except for the use of punks and money! it, very little violence. In fact, apart from the other martial arts shows, I would say no. An interesting film for adults and children will love it!",positive

Perhaps the writer for director thought they could make a thought provoking film out of annoying characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee. Within ten minutes I disliked the portrayal of Kim by Caroleen Feeney so much that it became a distraction. While Kim is supposed to be an unsympathetic character, I am not sure I was supposed to want to commit facts of physical violence upon her. The first (of many) bizarre things that happen is that Wes (David Strathairn) goes from ""I am missing $fifty.zero"" to ""She stole fifty$"" in about three seconds. It was quite implausible, since she (Kim) never had access to this wallet nor was she a master pickpocket-- there simply was no rational reason to suspect her. Most people have lost/misplaced money and assume just that. we LOST it. Same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be (I think) a look at real people. The character of Kim was, at minimum, suffering from a BiPolar disorder. Wes had huge inadequacy issues, Nancy was just boring, and Matt was delusional (particularly about music). I actually turned this off about two/three of the way through. However, to write a valid comment, I forced myself to turn it back on hoping that something would come together in this movie. No, sorry, it was still bad. Make it a point to miss this one.",negative

39507,"Wow. I mean WOW this has got to be one of the best story's I've never had the chance to read/watch. We all know this famous story. Two martial artist, a man and this son, go to train in the forbidden Cursed Springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each. The dad, Genma, the spring of drowned Panda. And sixteen year old Ranma, the spring of drowned girl. Now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in. Crazy enough yet? No, that just the beginning. As if being one of the strongest teenagers to never exist who turns into a female was't enough, Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane part styles, an insane high school principle, opponents right and left who have a score to settle with Ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow for for ""stealling"" their loved jones. And speaking of loved jones, I've lost track of how many times a boy for a girl has fallen in love with Ranma. And not once has it been this francée, Akane. And that just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series. The story itself is amazing. I have never come across something so crazy, so bizarre, so. so. out of this world and yet its so down to Earth and believable. I can't even describe it to its fullest. Its just a charming story that so easy to get into. What I like about it is the humour. Not once have I laughed out cloud this much from a manga, and it does't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in Simpson's for something of the sort. I could read any part of the comic and I would be laughing from beginning to send. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you would think making him too strong would be a set back but noon. with every little problem the story throws at him the's doing this best just to survive half the time and this personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst the can be a calculating genius. And to think, of the hundreds of perverts in the show, Ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in this town, more so by Akane, the worst pervert to never live. His father Genma, you would think the father character would blend in to the background right? Correct! But whenever the does have some spotlight. the just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him! You think you know the worst dad never from an anime? You haven't met Genma. Ryoga, probably one of Ranma's greatest rivals and my favourite character (next to Ranma). and probably one of the only people the can actually stand. Most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults, one is this curse that turns him into a baby pig but this worst fault. is this black of sense in direction! Then we have. you know, I could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters, the story's, everything positive about it but that would be just pointless. Check out the series if you haven't, NOW! You WILL NOT regret it! Though I would advise checking the comic out first. I like the anime, but I've had some trouble getting the series at a good price. And a small nitpick, the humour does't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. I think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me. But either way, its a win win! ten out of ten!",positive

By sixteen-year-old Ranma, the source of the immersion. Now, with each drop of cold water, they have become the names of the springs where they live. Is it crazy enough? No, that is just the beginning. It seems that it is not enough just to be one of the strongest young people in the world. It's not enough to be a woman. Ranma also deals with martial arts teachers and hundreds of crazy character characters, high school policies, scoring points with Ranma's opponents on both sides. Speaking of loving Jones, I don’t remember how many times a boy fell in love with Ranma as a girl. The Frenchman had never appeared before, Achan. And this only appears in the first few chapters / sections of the list. The story itself is amazing. I've never met such a crazy, strange, thing like that. as for. Leaving this world, but it is low in the world and unbelievable. I can't even describe it completely. It's just an interesting story that's easy to get into. I love its humour. I haven’t laughed at a cloud from the comic once, and I don’t have to try any of the things that might be seen at Simpson. I can read any part of the manga, and I will laugh from the moment I post it. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you might think making him so strong would come back, but at noon. He tried this best to deal with every little problem that raised him in the story, so that the could live only half the time. Imagine for a second you were transposed into the karmic driven world of Earl. His father, Xuan Ma, would have thought that this father's role would be better off, would't the? is correct! But whenever it has other spotlights. It gave you more reasons to hate and love him at the same time! Do you think you know that the real dad was never found in anime? You have not met Gemma. Ryoga, perhaps one of Ranma's biggest antagonists, is also my favourite character (next to Ranma). And you can be one of the people who can really stand up. You may be the strongest character on the list, but there are two flaws, one curse that turns him into a pig, but this is the hardest flaw. This is the darkness of the road! Then we go. You know, I could spend a few hours in front of a computer explaining all the characters, stories, and all the good things about it, but it does't make sense. If you have not already done so, please check the series now! You will not regret it! Although I recommend reading the comics first. I love anime, but have trouble buying the series at a discounted price. There is also little to choose from, the humour does't seem to be transformed into anime and fiction. I think in part because comics are more cartoon for me. But either way, it's a win! Ten to ten!",positive

The characters don't even act the way they do in the books. And why was Tucker changed to a guy? He's a girl in the frigging books! Was this done to make the film appeal to boys? Sheesh. And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney blow her work was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps in the vane of Don Bluth's artwork would suit a better Mrs. Murphy film.

I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters, war-starters, and fur-wearers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I'll give it a shot. That it's not supposed to sound real is fine. I don't care. It's that everyone talks the SAME.

I was hooked, at first, by the literate dialogue and wry sense of humour that the film is rich with. I was coasting along comfortably on a sort of ""Kevin Smith meets Killer Films"" wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail. with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. Far from being taken out of the experience, I was brought further in. This is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal. so I do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought in. and enjoyed it immensely. The ""flash back"" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well-realized and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet, funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. This movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty/clever romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect. Take two hours out of your busy schedule and jump into Wirey's world. for you could go rent ""You've Got Mail"", 'cause if that appeals to you, you won't like this anyway!

45090,"Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue this dreams because of this overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my ten out of ten rating without reservation. This movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is transferred successfully onto film. This movie has a very dreary, depressing stone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour. The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of stone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie never bothered to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers. Albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series. In the movie, Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises. Most movie spin-offs of British sitcoms tend to be quite dull, with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES films (which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself!). But, STEPTOE AND SON has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED. My advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much lighter stone, is more faithful to the TV series, and is actually very funny.",negative
45090,"Most movies from British sitcoms are boring, with the exception of the movie ""On the Bus"" (better than the TV show itself!). It has a bright stone and is more reliable in the TV series, which is really interesting. Although the tragic nature of a middle-aged man does not seem to be table to comprehend this dream because of this superhuman and controlling father, it is much easier and more fun to watch while working. On the TV show, Harold always follows the honorable girls, not the judges. Seeing Harold beaten at a bar (not in a funny way) is not my sense of humour, but it certainly is the reason why TV fans don’t like it and don’t like this movie. However, STEPTOE AND SON should be lower, lower and GEORGE and MILDRED. This film has a very ugly, depressing stone that almost brought tears to my eyes a few times.",negative

45115,"""Red Sonja"" is flawed, weak and lacking. Even the camp-ness in't good. There are only two good things about ""Red Sonja""; The costumes (even though the Red Sonja costume is ridiculous. It's ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men, because she was raped, still choose to wear so few little clothes, even when it trains.) and the music by Ennio Morricone. Still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable. The story is extremely simple and they did't even bother to make it interesting. The story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humour, both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways. The movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely. Brigitte Nielsen is an horrible leading lady. I don't know who's accent is worse; Hers for Arnie's and on top of that; She can't act. There is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable. Even worse was Sandahl Bergman as the main villain who facts more poorly than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was somewhat good in this role, but my God the looked horrible, the changed so much since this (only well known) role in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Maybe it had something to do with this illness which claimed this life in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one? And by the way, what was with all those ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" factors in this movie? Next to Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow appeared in a role, it seemed like some kind of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" reunion.

46055,"Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense. Based on the book ""Evil Angels"" and titled so in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the switch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who did't play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she did't kill her own child. The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as never, even when her husband Michael was falling apart. This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that. They want to see a distressed mother cry and sweep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank. People don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have this character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, for the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that. Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media. They'll always heat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public.",positive

It shows a very real situation for us in the United States: switching to hunting for someone who is considered an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain is the woman. As a person who speaks this mind, someone who has not played a sympathy card, a person who continues this life firmly after a traumatic event, has been called a suspect, even though the obviously hated me without realizing I had not killed my child. The media began to tighten the noose, gradually invading the secrecy, and soon the whole country clung to their set, releasing the family piece by piece. In all of this, even if her husband Michael divorced, Lindy still maintained a stoicism she had never had before. Of course, this position is very powerful, and although it may seem indifferent, people are more likely to react strongly to it. They want to see a distraught mother crying and sweeping the floor, fainting from time to time, instead of sitting on a blank face. People do not realize that not everyone is as sad as everyone else. Meryl Streep took the filthy woman very seriously, and in doing so caused a ruthless, ruthless woman who clung to her beliefs, even closing her freedom. Thanks to him, Sam Neal was allowed to turn the character into a little bit of despair - someone had to do it, because the Chamberlain family was so independent that no one wanted to see it.

49063,"Trick for Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp of a film revolves around the eighty's culture of Heavy Metal and horror movies--two things which I love dearly. So, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me pretty easily. Plus, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. This film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all us losers, ended up drenched in a world of ""evil"" Heavy Metal. His favourite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected--by playing this latest unreleased album backwards. This allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and cash*t helping out. Okay, it's pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? It's got a surprising number of good qualities. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere. All in all, it's actually a decent horror film. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this ""uber-evil"" Metal guy is one of the most obnoxious, high-pitched, wailing, Motley Crue rejects on the planet--and the ""Metal"" is little more than putrid eighty's Pop/Hair Metal. He hits all the clické's there, from prancing around like a gay fairy, to looking mean, to screaming ""Rock and Roll!!!"" in a pitch high enough to make King Diamond wretch. Aside from that atrocious musical representation, it's actually pretty good. seven/tenwww. ResidentHazard.com",positive

So, as you can imagine, this movie is easy to download. In addition, Ozzy Osbourne played the priest for no reason. The film tells the story of young people who were unloved in high school, like all those who lost their lives, and ended up being immersed in a world of heavy metal. His beloved Metaldude died, yes, miraculously resurrected — by playing with this face to the ground without this release. This allows the corpse singer to roam around killing demons and ashes * it help. Yes, sometimes it can, but you know what? It has an amazing number of good qualities. Decent performance (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), excellent results, short nudity, respectful atmosphere. All in all, this is the best horror movie never. But the worst thing is music. It's funny, in't it? Yes, this ""bad"" man is one of the most annoying, sharp, sweeping, and irritating people on the planet- and ""iron"" is nothing but the decay of the eightys / iron.

49195,"This is probably the most uninvolving film I've never seen. I watched it because I have a soft spot for Leon (everything else Besson has done has been just awful, in my opinion, with the exception of the script for Wasabi) and Jean Reno. It's a testament to just how bad this film is that Reno, one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable factors (admittedly the's just starting out there) can't make this film, for the moments in which the is on screen, watchable. It's all very film-schooly: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no apparent reason, people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera. And, predictably, none of it is entertaining. It's not a ""French Mad Max"" as some people have claimed (actually, I think they mean ""Mad Max two"") - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting, and is just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who does't know what they're talking about. Mad Max two was pulsating, Mad Max two was exciting, Mad Max two was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of these. I know it's supposed to be cool to like party black-and-white French films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not (or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy), which is why I would't trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat, because I see nothing of worth in it whatsoever; it tasks for so much and gives nothing back. I found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention.

All of this is a movie school: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no reason, people running, and at the same time being chased by camera movements. After all, these things just don't seem fun. This in't ""French Mad Max"" as some people claim (actually, I think they mean ""Mad Max II"") - this is a further comparison, based on the fact that both films have a background after being attacked by this fact, and are just a comment to someone you don't know if you're talking with what. ""Mad Max II"" strikes, ""Mad Max II"" is interesting, ""Mad Max II"" is worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is not that. I know that black and white French films like bands have to be cool, and the same cool thing is that you see things you don’t see in other people (or you manage to sit down without feeling drowsy), which is why I don’t. it Believe anyone who says they like Le Dernier Combat, because I don't think it's worth it; it has many functions, but nothing.

23734,"""Magnolia"" is a preposterous, bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot, who can't care for others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces for dying. I was reminded of how much I disliked ""Shine"" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappealing characters there, why would we want to spend time with them? Having said that, there is nothing held back about ""Magnolia."" Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed onto this canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular that bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this one hundred and eighty-eight-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous.""Magnolia"" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I did't know the had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. But it all adds up to nothing.

The mainstream media seems to be people who shout, who don't care about others (except for the roles of John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman), and who are self-destructive bastards, who claim to have fallen for death. I remembered how I did’t like “Sparkle” because the father played by Armin Muller-Starr was an incurable beast. There are so many unpleasant and unloving people out there, why should we spend time with them? Having said that, ""Mulan"" has no reservation. The ideas of Paul Thomas Anderson were randomly spilled on this fabric. There are two ideas, especially the bomb. Both took place during the last hour of the one hundred and eighty-eight-minute movie. One person switches the camera from one scene to another while everyone sings Aimee Mann's cafe song. It's fun, but it does't work, because we don't see the connection between them. The other idea I mentioned could not be explained, I can only say that it was unexpected and totally funny. ""Mulan"" has many good games. Especially Tom Cruise, the showed something I did’t know about him. John C. Reilly may be the most respected and influential police officer in the history of the world.

I love how Mr. Bennett is not afraid to take off this shirt and wear this vest to beat a woman, even though her shoulders and back are like a gorilla's. The hair on the back and shoulders is very hot, Secord knows this. How about Lucinda Dickey? I can only say ""KABOOM"" - I saw a sex bomb about to explode. Whether it's a myth for a karate wrestling, you've been table to do just that. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what kept this movie going. You might think the could hate her for being so mean, but my friend does't want to. Animals are magnetic enough to withstand a great deal of adverse conditions. Sho Kasugi is not as great as you think, although the is still the main character, which is good for me, because all I want is Bennett and Dickey. She looks painted a lot of makeup, and I'm glad to see her. A special result? Wow. That's all I can say. I will not give up on you, but we can say that you will not be disappointed.

Maybe if I had seen other stuff by him I would have enjoyed this one, knowing what to expect. I saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons. First of all, the film introduces interesting, deep issues about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but this is very often done in the clumsiest of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches, rambling on and on, juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues. The scriptwriters seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing. Secondly, the movie has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It is not only that it is slow. Some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of space and rhythm (El Sur by Victor Erice Or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I like), but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging for the story so moving that we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds, where the first episode seems to drag endlessly, and the relationship between John Malkovich's ""reality"" and the love stories ""fiction"" is at times fluid, others abrupt, others confusing.",negative

In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to Sharia law, one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children. After seventeen years of failed efforts, leaders of the WLA began recently to score a few wins, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories. The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, a state prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge (Court President). Both play themselves in this film, which may contain footage shot spontaneously, though I imagine much of it, if not all, consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed, and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film. Two cases involve repeated wife beating, with forcible sex in one case; another involves forced sex upon a ten year old girl; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child, page weight, by an aunt. One of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce. We follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials. The outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children. The perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and/or fines; the divorce is granted. The aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. Also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. This is a highly important and well made film.

The message of the dots is shared by many war veterans, whose best times, during their lifetime they felt in life, were actually during the war where everyone was sad and coloured- gabo. The conspiracy involved Czech pilots who fled their country when the Nazis invaded and joined the RAF Czech Free. There are several sub-proposals, all of which deserve attention. This is a very good old movie that even the love of anti-aging devices will love (Keep the Kleenex in Control). Beautiful scenes, first-class acting, accurate details of RAF life during the British War. It's easy to compete for a collection of unique DVDs of flying interest.",positive

33163,"Given its time of release, the story that unravels in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty thriller 'Panic in the Streets' was hardly a surprise. The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague. Yet with the current drama in the world today, this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers. The cast and crew are flawless. Richard Widmark in this first role following this breakthrough performance in 'Night and the City,' Jack Palance in this chilling film debut, also starring in this film are Paul Douglas and a young (and rather cute) Barbara Bel Geddes. A whole slew of uncredited, non-professional factors (typical of director Kazan) fill in the remaining slots. Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald films (he would later work with Richard Widmark again in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three's much superior 'Pickup on South Street') and the great Alfred Newman scores it.

Also, there's no horror there. Not a second of tension can be found. You think I'm exaggerating. I am not. No tension, very little blood, and not much violence on screen (sorry, but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul). Hell. there's even zero nudity.

39507,"Wow. I mean WOW this has got to be one of the best story's I've never had the chance to read/watch. We all know this famous story. Two martial artist, a man and this son, go to train in the forbidden Cursed Springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each. The dad, Genma, the spring of drowned Panda. And sixteen year old Ranma, the spring of drowned girl. Now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in. Crazy enough yet? No, that just the beginning. As if being one of the strongest teenagers to never exist who turns into a female was't enough, Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane part styles, an insane high school principle, opponents right and left who have a score to settle with Ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow for for ""stealling"" their loved jones. And speaking of loved jones, I've lost track of how many times a boy for a girl has fallen in love with Ranma. And not once has it been this francée, Akane. And that just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series. The story itself is amazing. I have never come across something so crazy, so bizarre, so. so. out of this world and yet its so down to Earth and believable. I can't even describe it to its fullest. Its just a charming story that so easy to get into. What I like about it is the humour. Not once have I laughed out cloud this much from a manga, and it does't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in Simpson's for something of the sort. I could read any part of the comic and I would be laughing from beginning to send. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you would think making him too strong would be a set back but noon. with every little problem the story throws at him the's doing this best just to survive half the time and this personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst the can be a calculating genius. And to think, of the hundreds of perverts in the show, Ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in this town, more so by Akane, the worst pervert to never live. His father Genma, you would think the father character would blend in to the background right? Correct! But whenever the does have some spotlight. the just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him! You think you know the worst dad never from an anime? You haven't met Genma. Ryoga, probably one of Ranma's greatest rivals and my favourite character (next to Ranma). and probably one of the only people the can actually stand. Most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults, one is this curse that turns him into a baby pig but this worst fault. is this black of sense in direction! Then we have. you know, I could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters, the story's, everything positive about it but that would be just pointless. Check out the series if you haven't, NOW! You WILL NOT regret it! Though I would advise checking the comic out first. I like the anime, but I've had some trouble getting the series at a good price. And a small nitpick, the humour does't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. I think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me. But either way, its a win win! ten out of ten!",positive

By sixteen-year-old Ranma, the source of the immersion. Now, with each drop of cold water, they have become the names of the springs where they live. Is it crazy enough? No, that is just the beginning. It seems that it is not enough just to be one of the strongest young people in the world. It's not enough to be a woman. Ranma also deals with martial arts teachers and hundreds of crazy character characters, high school policies, scoring points with Ranma's opponents on both sides. Speaking of loving Jones, I don’t remember how many times a boy fell in love with Ranma as a girl. The Frenchman had never appeared before, Achan. And this only appears in the first few chapters / sections of the list. The story itself is amazing. I've never met such a crazy, strange, thing like that. as for. Leaving this world, but it is low in the world and unbelievable. I can't even describe it completely. It's just an interesting story that's easy to get into. I love its humour. I haven’t laughed at a cloud from the comic once, and I don’t have to try any of the things that might be seen at Simpson. I can read any part of the manga, and I will laugh from the moment I post it. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you might think making him so strong would come back, but at noon. He tried this best to deal with every little problem that raised him in the story, so that the could live only half the time. Imagine for a second you were transposed into the karmic driven world of Earl. His father, Xuan Ma, would have thought that this father's role would be better off, would't the? is correct! But whenever it has other spotlights. It gave you more reasons to hate and love him at the same time! Do you think you know that the real dad was never found in anime? You have not met Gemma. Ryoga, perhaps one of Ranma's biggest antagonists, is also my favourite character (next to Ranma). And you can be one of the people who can really stand up. You may be the strongest character on the list, but there are two flaws, one curse that turns him into a pig, but this is the hardest flaw. This is the darkness of the road! Then we go. You know, I could spend a few hours in front of a computer explaining all the characters, stories, and all the good things about it, but it does't make sense. If you have not already done so, please check the series now! You will not regret it! Although I recommend reading the comics first. I love anime, but have trouble buying the series at a discounted price. There is also little to choose from, the humour does't seem to be transformed into anime and fiction. I think in part because comics are more cartoon for me. But either way, it's a win! Ten to ten!",positive

MAYBE Touchstone (well, they're owned by Disney, but it'd be more adult). The film is too kid-ish, as the book series is not. The casting is all wrong for the characters. The characters don't even act the way they do in the books. And why was Tucker changed to a guy? He's a girl in the frigging books! Was this done to make the film appeal to boys? Sheesh. And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney blow her work was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps in the vane of Don Bluth's artwork would suit a better Mrs. Murphy film.

An animated movie might be a better fit for Mrs. Murphy in the climate zone of Don Bruce's part works.

The plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart. The lead falls for a icon man and it does't occur to her that she might get conned????? And she's rich???? And she's a famous psychologist????? COME ON, people. She enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her??? That was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. Rain man would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters, war-starters, and fur-wearers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I'll give it a shot. That it's not supposed to sound real is fine. I don't care. It's that everyone talks the SAME. Mamet can't create characters; all the can do is foist this voice on us relentlessly through different factors. No wonder this factors are so wooden.

44537,"I, as many IMDB patrons seem to have, stumbled upon this little film when it appeared on the Canadian ""Showcase Network"". I was, as many of you, also sucked in and watched the entire film. I was hooked, at first, by the literate dialogue and wry sense of humour that the film is rich with. I was coasting along comfortably on a sort of ""Kevin Smith meets Killer Films"" wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail. with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. Far from being taken out of the experience, I was brought further in. This is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal. so I do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought in. and enjoyed it immensely. The ""flash back"" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well-realized and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet, funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. This movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty/clever romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect. Take two hours out of your busy schedule and jump into Wirey's world. for you could go rent ""You've Got Mail"", 'cause if that appeals to you, you won't like this anyway!

45090,"Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue this dreams because of this overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my ten out of ten rating without reservation. This movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is transferred successfully onto film. This movie has a very dreary, depressing stone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour. The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of stone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie never bothered to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers. Albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series. In the movie, Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises. Most movie spin-offs of British sitcoms tend to be quite dull, with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES films (which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself!). But, STEPTOE AND SON has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED. My advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much lighter stone, is more faithful to the TV series, and is actually very funny.",negative
45090,"Most movies from British sitcoms are boring, with the exception of the movie ""On the Bus"" (better than the TV show itself!). It has a bright stone and is more reliable in the TV series, which is really interesting. Although the tragic nature of a middle-aged man does not seem to be table to comprehend this dream because of this superhuman and controlling father, it is much easier and more fun to watch while working. On the TV show, Harold always follows the honorable girls, not the judges. Seeing Harold beaten at a bar (not in a funny way) is not my sense of humour, but it certainly is the reason why TV fans don’t like it and don’t like this movie. However, STEPTOE AND SON should be lower, lower and GEORGE and MILDRED. This film has a very ugly, depressing stone that almost brought tears to my eyes a few times.",negative

It's ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men, because she was raped, still choose to wear so few little clothes, even when it trains.) and the music by Ennio Morricone. Still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable. The story is extremely simple and they did't even bother to make it interesting. The story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humour, both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways. The movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely. Brigitte Nielsen is an horrible leading lady. I don't know who's accent is worse; Hers for Arnie's and on top of that; She can't act. There is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable. Even worse was Sandahl Bergman as the main villain who facts more poorly than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was somewhat good in this role, but my God the looked horrible, the changed so much since this (only well known) role in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Maybe it had something to do with this illness which claimed this life in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one? And by the way, what was with all those ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" factors in this movie? Next to Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow appeared in a role, it seemed like some kind of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" reunion.

46055,"Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense. Based on the book ""Evil Angels"" and titled so in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the switch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who did't play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she did't kill her own child. The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as never, even when her husband Michael was falling apart. This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that. They want to see a distressed mother cry and sweep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank. People don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have this character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, for the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that. Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media. They'll always heat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public.",positive

Meryl Streep took the filthy woman very seriously, and in doing so caused a ruthless, ruthless woman who clung to her beliefs, even closing her freedom.

So, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me pretty easily. Plus, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. This film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all us losers, ended up drenched in a world of ""evil"" Heavy Metal. His favourite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected--by playing this latest unreleased album backwards. This allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and cash*t helping out. Okay, it's pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? It's got a surprising number of good qualities. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere. All in all, it's actually a decent horror film. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this ""uber-evil"" Metal guy is one of the most obnoxious, high-pitched, wailing, Motley Crue rejects on the planet--and the ""Metal"" is little more than putrid eighty's Pop/Hair Metal. He hits all the clické's there, from prancing around like a gay fairy, to looking mean, to screaming ""Rock and Roll!!!"" in a pitch high enough to make King Diamond wretch.

He hit all the clicks there, from jumping around like a fairy tale, looking ugly, shouting ""Rock and Roll !!!"" In a stone high enough, the King of Diamond was saddened. In addition to that cruel music, it’s good. Seventy. ResidentHazard.com",positive
49063,"This movie tells the story of the unpopular youth of high school immersed in the ""evil world"" of heavy metal. ""Iron"" is nothing more than scrap metal / metal of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. It has an amazing number of excellent features, including special effects.",positive
49063,"Yes, this ""very bad"" metal man is one of the most annoying, sharp, crying, and diverse people. it's nothing but a terrifying eightys popular popular / hair style. He hit all the clicks there, from jumping like a myth, to looking ugly, shouting ""Rock and Roll !!!"" Effective performance (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), excellent special effects, Very short nudity, modest atmosphere. The film tells the story of unpopular high school teenagers, who, like all losers, decide to get baptized in the ""evil"" world of heavy metal. Her loved one Metaldude died, yes, miraculously resurrected - by playing down the album. So, as you can imagine, this movie is easy to draw. A quick review of this comedy film revolves around the culture of the hard and horror film of the eightys — these are two of my favourite things.",positive
49195,"This is probably the most uninvolving film I've never seen. I watched it because I have a soft spot for Leon (everything else Besson has done has been just awful, in my opinion, with the exception of the script for Wasabi) and Jean Reno. It's a testament to just how bad this film is that Reno, one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable factors (admittedly the's just starting out there) can't make this film, for the moments in which the is on screen, watchable. It's all very film-schooly: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no apparent reason, people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera. And, predictably, none of it is entertaining. It's not a ""French Mad Max"" as some people have claimed (actually, I think they mean ""Mad Max two"") - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting, and is just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who does't know what they're talking about. Mad Max two was pulsating, Mad Max two was exciting, Mad Max two was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of these. I know it's supposed to be cool to like party black-and-white French films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not (or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy), which is why I would't trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat, because I see nothing of worth in it whatsoever; it tasks for so much and gives nothing back. I found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention. Anyone who can sit through it undistracted in't human, for, at the very most, is psychotic. (Actually, they're probably just trying to seem ""cool"").",negative
49195,"This is the worst movie I've never seen. I watched it because I have a soft spot in Lyon (everything Besson is not doing well, in my opinion, except for the mustard script) and Jean Renault. This proves how bad this movie is. Reno is one of the most interesting and interesting (no doubt it has already started) not to make this movie, at the moment on the screen, available for viewing. All of this is a movie school: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no reason, people running, and at the same time being chased by camera movements. After all, these things just don't seem fun. This in't ""French Mad Max"" as some people claim (actually, I think they mean ""Mad Max II"") - this is a further comparison, based on the fact that both films have a background after being attacked by this fact, and are just a comment to someone you don't know if you're talking with what. ""Mad Max II"" strikes, ""Mad Max II"" is interesting, ""Mad Max II"" is worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is not that. I know that black and white French films like bands have to be cool, and the same cool thing is that you see things you don’t see in other people (or you manage to sit down without feeling drowsy), which is why I don’t. it Believe anyone who says they like Le Dernier Combat, because I don't think it's worth it; it has many functions, but nothing. About five minutes later, I found myself floating on it. Anyone can live there without interruption instead of being human, because they are mentally will. (In fact, they may want to look ""cool"").",negative

49991,"Les Visiteurs, the first movie about the medieval time travellers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an factor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes. Now this sequel has the same characters, the same factors in great part and the same time travelling. The plot changes a little, since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travellers. So they jump up and down in history, without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep the whole thing together with this playing, but this character has been emptied, so there's not a lot the can do to save the film. Now the duke's slave/helper, the has really all the attention. The movie is merely about him and this being clumsy / annoying / stupid for whatever the was supposed to be. Fact is; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience, but the does not succeed. It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke, you already know, but the insists on telling that joke still the send, adding details, to make your suffering a little longer. If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you did't like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequel. If you liked this sequel. well, I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies.",negative
49991,"Les Visiteurs, the first movie about medieval travellers is very interesting. I love using Renault as an object, but there is more. There are unexpected twists and turns, interesting situations, and certainly simple absurdities, that will remind you of Louis de Funes. Now this episode has the same features, the same things and travels at the same time. The plan has changed a bit, because the character now has to be a seasoned traveller. Then they jump up and down in history, failing to realize the fact that it is becoming more and more absurd as you continue with the film. Duke Jean Reno has tried to keep everything together with the show, but the role has been scrapped, so not much can be done to save the movie. Now Duke's slave / assistant has received everyone's attention. This movie is just about her, no matter what, clumsy / annoying / stupid. The truth is; the character tried to cause laughter from the audience, but was unsuccessful. It’s like someone telling you a very bad joke, you already know, but you focus on telling them the joke is still posting, which adds details to make your spain longer. If you like Les Visiteurs, please do not spoil your mouth taste in sequence. If you don’t like Les Visiteurs, you will never think about watching sequences. If you like the following article.
