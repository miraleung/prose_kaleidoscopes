Outkast has really represented the hometown since 'ninety-three when Vone hundred and three (ATLiens know this station) used to bump \"Player's Ball\" on the radio airwaves. And \"Southerplayaisticmuzik\" back in pm 'ninety-four help place Atlanta on the map. Two years later, they come out with their sophomore album \"ATLiens\" in Sept one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. This time, they flipped their whole concept around compared to their first one. While their debut was mostly about pippin and smoking weed, this one was more \"out there\". The production by Organized Noize was more laid back and smoother sounding. Their first single \"Elevators (Me & U)\" was heavily rotated back in summer of 'ninety-six, and everybody was trying to memorize that hook \"Me & U\/Your mommy and your cousin too. \" (lol). Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton and Andre \"three thousand\" Benjamin's rhymes took a side step (not saying they did't improve, but just went a different direction with their rhymes). On the song \"Two Dope Boyz In A Caddilac\" would be a good example of what I'm saying, as well as their second single \"ATLiens\". The most \"out there\" concept on this album would be the two songs \"Millenium\" and \"Extraterrestrial\" that will garuntee to have you head nod. The latter song may sound weird to many listeners because the song does't have any drums, so it sounds like they're freestyling accapella. Guest wise is pretty dope too. Goodie Mob's Khujo and T-Mo appear on \"Mainstream\" as well as Cee-Lo, Big Gipp, and Cool Breeze on \"Decatur Psalm\". Witchdoctor would handle the hook on the song \"Ova Da Woodz\". As much as I LOVE this album, I have to gripe about one thing (and I may come back and edit this to a ten rating, because this should have been on the greatest hits album). \"Jazzy Belle\" was the third single back in early 'ninety-seven, and if you remember it was remixed with Babyface singing the hook to the song. On this album, that in't on there (eventhough the original was a good song) I believe that this album should be breasted and that should be on there. Thats my only tiny gripe on this album. Otherwise this is an awesome album to catch musical vibes off of. If you're new to this Outkast, I highly recommend \"Dre and Big Boi Presents: Outkast\" before you buy any of their albums.

The only thing that says \"out there\" in this song are the two songs \"Millennium\" and \"The Sun\", that will make you nod.

Khujo and T-Mo of Goodie Mob appeared in \"Mainstream\", and Cee-Lo, Big Gipp and Bold Breeze appeared in \"Decatur Psalm\". Witchdoctor will be hosting the songwriter \"Ova Da Woodz\". Although I really like this album, I have to complain about one thing (I can come back and edit it at level ten, because this must have come from the most popular album). \"Jazzy Belle\" is the third single in early one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. If you remember, it was mixed again by Babyface. In this album, there is nothing (although the original is really fun) I believe this album should be tied, it should exist. This is just my little complaint about this album. Alternatively, this is a great album on which you can hold a music resonance.

The Greek-language interlude in Rubylove made him a favourite in the Greek community and the semi-reggae rhythm of Changes IV and commercialism of Tuesday's Dead broadened this appeal beyond the singles-buying public who made songs like Father and Son and Peace Train number one hits. The Wind and How Can I Tell You are classic love ballads while If I Laugh was given a heavy workout on school radio stations. Peace Train became an anthem during the arms race of the early one thousand, nine hundred and heights while Morning Has Broken was one of Stevens's most successful singles. Universal Music have done their best to restore this recording after several complaints about the original CD release. The master tape was mixed through an enhancer (as was common at the time), however the settings were overbiased resulting in a \"spitty\" type sound.

But anyway, \"Rhymin' Simon\" has just about everything you could ask for, this time around with a really great gospel-ish slant. So, let's see what we have there:-Kodachrome: the commercial hit of the album, and it's a great song; fun, upbeat, and truly unique. It's a classic; there's no other song like it. and I love the lyrics--this man could write a song about AnYthinG.-Tenderness: Here's some of the gospel element (thanks to the Dixie Hummingbirds--they rule), a slower, more pensive song dealing with a reality of human relationships--now you've got to love the way the writes songs not about \"LOVE\" but you know, tenderness\/brutal honesty\/truth. -. Mardi Gras: Here's a little Cajun flair, a song that I almost wish would move more, but it's fun and an interesting departure for Simon.-Something So Right: Pretty. honest reflection on personality\/relationships. but too flush and produced for my last.-One Man's Ceiling. : I love this song. My favourite on use one (ok, I admit I'm sticking to the LP) Simon sounds isOUlful on this, man. gospel-y, fun, but not ToO fun :) The title sums up the song, which is a quirky little insight but works amazingly well for the topic of a song!-American Tune: I think this is a very beautiful song, a really simple melody, weary, almost timeless I think. The words are simple but powerful (though some say pretentious). But this is not pretentious--it's indescribably 'what it is.' Oh well, the bridge is my favourite part, it's earnest but never cloying. HOWEVER, I wish they could LAY OFF THE STRING SECTION! Find a live version, simpler=better for this song, in my opinion.-Was a Sunny Day: This song sounds quite perky, but it's eerie. An odd little story of a \"navy man\" and a \"high school queen,\" but it fits. I like this song. I admit I like the way the says \"speedooo.\" You've gotta love the way this dude says this vowels :)-. How to Fall: a good solid LESSON, but come on, it's a nice song. great dark beginning, then melts away, then back. -St. Judy's Comet: I adore this song. I'm a sap, but I do. NOT that it's a sappy song, I'm just a sap that a song about this kid can get me like this one does. anyway, it's a great tune, sounding almost reminiscent of the later \"fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover\". except more wholesome because this is an endearingly self-critical bedtime song for the kid. (\"'Cause if I can't using my boy to sleep, well it makes your famous daddy look so dumb. \") Low key but it moves. very nice.-Loves me Like a Rock: I always think of this as the companion song to \"Kodachrome\"--they're almost like one song in my mind. This song is awesome: more gospel influence, Simon's really getting into it, and the words have that funny-serious feeling that unifies all the songs on this album. SO, it's fun, quirky, and serious.

American-Tune: I think this song is very fun, the music is very simple, tired, I think it's almost forever. I love the words \u2014 someone can write a song about anything. - Gentleness: This is a gospel thing (thanks to Dixie Hummingbirds - they rule), a slow, more meditative song about the reality of relationships - now you have to love the way you write songs, not about \"LOVE\", but you know, honest \/ cruel \/ truthful. So, let's see what we have: -Kodachrome: The sale of this album, this is a beautiful song; interesting, optimistic, and truly different. I have found a live version, in my opinion, the song is easier = better. -It was a sunny day: This song sounds lively, but not unusual. Mardi Gras: There\u2019s a little Cajun style there, I hope this song can be more moving, but very interesting, it\u2019s an interesting move for Simon. -The good thing: Beautiful. This song is beautiful: the influence of the gospel above, Simon loves it so much, the words are so funny and deep, that it unites all the songs on this album. So, it\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s amazing, and it\u2019s deep.","overall":4,"summary":"Fun, Quirky, Serious...Rhymin' Simon","unixReviewTime":1049500800,"reviewTime":"04 5, 2003"}

So, not literally, but I enjoyed this album because it almost looks like Simon\u2019s album model. Well no, each of these albums is just unique. However, \u201cRhymin\u2019Simon\u201d has everything you could ask for, this time with a very good gospel. Now, let\u2019s take a look at what we have there: -Codachrome: commercial hit on the album, and it\u2019s a great song; fun, engaging, and really unique. This is a classic; There is no other song like it. I also love the words - this person could write a song about Everything. -Sadness: Here\u2019s the gospel composer\u2019s part (thanks Dixie Hummingbirds - they lead), a slow, very powerful song about truth of human relationships -now you have to like the way the songs are written, not \"LOVE\" but you know, tenderness\/cruelty\/truth. -. Mardi Gras: It was a wonderful little cajun, a song close to me that I wanted to continue, but it was fun and an interesting departure for Simon. honest reflection on personality \/ relationships. but very squeaky and finally done. - The Roof of One Man. : I like this song. My favourite on one use (ok, I admit I\u2019m sticking to the LP) Simon expressed it that the was quite pleased, man. gospel-y, fun, but not fun ToO really simple melody, tired, almost no time I expected. The words are simple but powerful (though some say pretend). But this is not a sham - it is indescribable 'what it is.' Well, the bridge is my favourite part, it\u2019s true but not closed. However, I want them to release the HELP PART! Find a straightforward, simpler type = better than this song, in my opinion.-Was a Sunny Day: This song is audible, but it\u2019s surprising. An unusual little story about a \u201csea man\u201d and a \u201chigh school queen,\u201d but it fits. I like this song I admit I like the saying \"speedooo.\" You have to like what this guy says to these staff :) -. How to Do It: A hard and good lesson, but wait, this is a good song. big start in the dark, then bright, then back -St. Judy Comet: I like this song. I\u2019m fluid, but I do. It\u2019s not a soap song, I\u2019m just fluid that the song about this baby can get me like this. however, it\u2019s a massive melody, its sound seems reminiscent of \u201cfifty ways to leave your loved one\u201d. except healthier because it's a bedtime song for the baby. (\"'Cause if I can't use my son to sleep, your famous father is well and very dumb.)) The key below but the moves. Very well.-He loves me like a Stone: I always thought that it\u2019s a companion song \u201cKodachrome\u201d-almost one song I have in mind. This song is so beautiful: so many gospel effects, Simon really gets in, and the lyrics have an interesting feel that unites all the songs on this album . SO, it\u2019s fun, complex, and dangerous. This album finds songs of all kinds, but they all have a sense of delay, great lyrics and gospel language combined a great album by Paul Simon!","overall":4,"summary":"Fun, Quirky, Serious...Rhymin' Simon","unixReviewTime":1049500800,"reviewTime":"04 5, 2003"}

I own seven of the band's fourteen Cds but haven't bought one in thirteen years. I'm a music junkie. I'm decidedly not a musical nationalist. As I now have more time on my hands I have decided to plough my way through as much of my record and Cd collections as I can before I go (or my hearing disappears). I use the word plough, not because the task that I have set myself is unpleasant, but merely because it is daunting. I have thousands of records and Cds and hardly know where to start. So far I have listened to all of Steely Dan, well, up to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, and about fifteen Neil Young recordings. As I was perusing the \"B\" section of the Cd wall I was surprised to discover that I had seven Blue Rodeos. I was surprised because I could't recall a single one as being sufficiently remarkable to require a replay. Yet, somehow I had managed to buy these seven between one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. I was inquisitive and that is why you find yourself reading this review. Outskirts is one terrific debut. It really is! There are ten excellent songs stretched over just forty-five minutes. This is the perfect length - the equivalent of an \"A\" side and a \"B\" side - just enough music to satisfy without overstaying its welcome. I would call the style rock-country, a hint of Tom Petty, a dash of Steve Earle. The playing is incredibly tight (these guys were't kids, had been around the music scene for quite a while). Both Jim Cuddy and Greg Keelor have great roots pipes. Bobby Wiseman's keyboards are an essential element and give Blue Rodeo a sound that distinguished the band from the more generic practitioners in the genre. I like that the is often given the opportunity to range free (Floating - Doors era morgan, Piranha Pool - beautiful cool jazz intro). I guess that I've now answered the question of why I have at least two Blue Rodeo Cds. I suspect and hope that I'll soon happily discover why I have seven!","overall":5,"summary":"Not your generic country-rockers","unixReviewTime":1277856000,"reviewTime":"06 30, 2010"}

I have seven of the fourteen CDs in the band, but I haven't bought them in thirteen years. I am a music fan. I am certainly not a patriot. Since I now have a lot of time in my hands, I decided to check my record and CD collection as much as possible before I left (or my hearing disappeared). I use the word farming not because the work I set up is unpopular, but because it is difficult. I have thousands of records and CDs, and I don't know where to start. So far, I've listened to all of Steely Dan's recordings, up to one, zero, nine hundred and eighty, and about fifteen of Neil Young's albums. When I read section \"B\" of the CD wall carefully, I was surprised to find that I had seven Blue Rodeos. I was surprised because I did\u2019t think of anything good that could be repeated. However, somehow, I was table to buy these seven between one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-seven and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. I'm interested, which is why you find yourself reading this review. Suburb is a wonderful start. Indeed they are! ten outstanding songs in just forty-five minutes. This is about the same length as the sides of \"A\" and \"B\" - just enough to satisfy the music without exceeding its popularity. I would call this the path of stone, the land of touching Tom Petty, the arrest of Steve Earl. Performance is very difficult (these people are children, they have been in the music business for a long time). Both Jim Cuddy and Greg Keelor \u200b\u200bhave big root canals. Bobby Wiseman's keyboard is an important feature, and it provides Blue Rodeo with a sound that separates the band from the general genre of the genre. I love always having the opportunity to play freely (low rotation time Morgan, Piranha Pond-beautiful and a cool introduction to jazz). I think I have now answered the question of why I have two Blue Rodeo CDs.

She also wrote all the music for the musical and is one of its producers. This marks the third time Dolly's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty masterpiece has been released on CD. It originally came out on CD in the mid to late 'ninetys, but RCA did a bad job in its release-only weight tracks were included. Then in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Buddha Records, in conjunction with RCA, released the album again with beautiful repackaging and all ten tracks were included with renewed audio. Now comes this wonderful CD edition with bonus tracks.\"nine to five and Odd Jobs\" has gone on to be one of Dolly Parton's most successful albums in her career. It went all the way to #one on the country charts, where it stayed for a whopping ten weeks (her longest stay there), garnered Dolly two Grammy wins, one for Best Country Song and one for Best Country Vocal Performance, both for the song \"nine to five\", and the album went Gold selling five hundred, zero copies. If RCA would do some research on the sales of this album in two thousand and nine, the accumulated sales would bring it to over a million copies. Since Dolly is no longer with RCA the label refuses to do an accounting of her old albums, which is not only an insult to us Dolly fans, but to Miss Parton herself, who is one of the greatest entertainers and singers in the world. The album title song went to number one on the country charts and became Dolly's first #one pop song and her second million selling single, after \"Here You Come Again\". \"nine to five\" also is one of those rare songs in which a female country act had the song go to the top of both the country and pop charts. The last song to do this prior to \"nine to five\" was \"Harper Valley PTA\" back in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight. \"nine to five\" also went on to beat Tammy Wynette's classic \"Stand By Your Man\", in terms of sales for a single.\"nine to five and Odd Jobs\" also produced another #one country hit, Kenny Roger's and The First Edition's \"But You Know I love You\". The CD has many other covers, among the best is \"Detroit City\", which Dolly makes her own. \"The House of the Rising Sun\" is also performed there and Dolly sounds impeccable on the vocal. Mike Post, a big Hollywood record producer who Dolly met on the \"Merv Griffin Show\" in the late 'seventys, produced the bulk of the CD's songs, but it was Dollys long-time friend and band leader Gregg Perry who produced the \"nine to five\" single. Mike Post would also go on to produce Dolly's \"Rhinestone\" album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. An old Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton song also surfaces there, \"Poor Folks Town\", which Dolly wrote, and was included on the duos \"Together Always\" album in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. The crowning jewel in this particular CD collection are three bonus tracks, including a karaoke version of \"nine to five\", a dance mix version of the same song, and the previous unreleased track \"Everyday People\", which was a pop hit in the late 'sixtys. \"Everday People\" is also one of Dolly's best vocal performances never.

They had three main strengths - Annie Lennox's terrific voice and unique, soulful personality , an advanced sense of melody , and their ability to develop as musicians and become more sophisticated as their career progressed. I always really liked them back in the eighty's, and had the good fortune to see them in concert on one\/twelve\/one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine there in Hobart on their We Too Are One tour. Here they are again with a second, updated hits package, and not surprisingly it's very a good CD. This compilation spans one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three until the present day, and like most hits compilations it includes two new tracks to make the CD more enticing to casual and long-term fans alike. They're not going to set the charts ablaze, but both new songs are pretty good. Always with such a successful group that has more than one CD -worth of hit itunes, you wonder whether a twoCD set would be better, but I'm satisfied with this as I'm sort of intending to purchase the group's back catalogue albums on CD anyway. In particular the remastered sound is excellent. My old CD of the Eurythmics one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five album Be Yourself Tonight has much inferior sound on the cloud, rocking #one hit Would I Lie To You (which I love) when compared to the improved sound quality there. Favourite tracks ; Right By Your Side ( holiday \/carnival vibe, lovely) , Would I Lie To You (brilliant rock vocal performance, face guitar playing) , When Tomorrow Comes ( routine melody but lovely lyrics) , I Saved The World Today ( gorgeous melody, great singing) , Here Comes The Rain Again ( cool melancholy vocal , atmospheric instrumentals) , There Must Be An Angel ( Playing With My Heart) ( sweet vocals, terrific harmonica guest performance from Stevie Wonder), Miracle Of Love ( one of the best eighty's radio ballad hits with lovely lyrics) . I hope newer listeners unfamiliar with this music might wish to try out this package of hit songs, all of which are really good. I would imagine however that most fans of this band would already own most of these tracks, so the only selling point then is the improved sound quality. I 'm going to give this five stars because I like all the songs on this disc a lot.","overall":5,"summary":"Excellent pop group","unixReviewTime":1142467200,"reviewTime":"03 16, 2006"}

Over-amped, distorted guitars, melodic songs with soaring choruses and plaintive vocals are all in evidence. On \"Carnavas,\" their debut, they're at least closer to the Pumpkin's early albums, eschewing the grandiosity that made Corgan's later work such a chore. Actually, they seem to have more in common with another young L. A. band, Autolux. Both are clearly indebted to the noisy soundscapes of My Bloody Valentine and the more melodic moments of Sonic Youth. Listen to \"Carnavas\" back-to-back with SY's recent \"Rather Ripped\" and you'd think the two bands could be cousins. Mind you, SY's songs are stronger and their guitars more gloriously of***ed up, but Silversun Pickups have plenty to offer as well. Like Autolux, the Pickups manage to fold their more experimental tendencies into their songs, and when they stretch things out, like on album closer \"Common Reactor,\" they drone instead of jam. Sometimes they're even genuinely hypnotic, but even as Brian Aubert's guitars soar into the stratosphere, they keep their feet on the ground (actually, they kinda have to; otherwise, they could't reach their effects pedals). Another nice touch are the keyboards of Joe Lester, which curiously makes the sound warmer (as opposed to the chilliness of say, Radiohead). Lyrically, the band traffic in the vague, elliptical imagery that have been a staple of indie rock for more than twenty years. At the very least they're modest, not self important. The propulsive \"Future Foe Scenarios\" begins \"The things we laid do not amount to much\/made of abandoned wood and stones and such.\" All things considered, while Silversun Pickups are anything but original, they survive comparisons to their inspirations fairly well.

On another note (unlike Babyface's Playlist) I don't understand how any Toni, Tony, Tone listener did't see this coming. Raphael has been retro since \"Hey Little Walter\" and pretty much kept an older genre sound on almost all TTT's cd's. This cd is not a homage, it is a work of part because the handles the music masterfully as though the was in the sixty's. For those who'd rather pick up Sam Cooke when you want to hear him, cool, but I'm sure just like artists such as Prince, Madonna, and other older artists try and go back into that era for more for less vice versa meaning they try to enter this era and look stupid doing it; this is a focused cd and absolutely well crafted musically with full melodies, choruses, and poignant lyricism. I say this to say it is authentic in its recreation of that vibe. I'm pretty sure you can pop this cd in with Sam Cooke, Smokey, Diana, on a playlist and people would think this was made also in the sixty's. Okay the sixty's aside and fifty years later, I see this as a perfect cd because of the variety of songs that blend perfectly together. In other words the slow jams are catchy itunes and the fast songs have a strong beat that make you want to dance; and ultimately you can tell this is where Raphael's heart was at this time of\/c it sounds like the was having fun when making this cd. The only song that was bad was the bonus song with Jay-Z. My favourites are: The Big Easy (an code to what is going wrong with the world since this baby left), Oh Girl (a sweet very high crying falsetto ridden song that pleads to a girl about how she changed this world. It slightly puts you in the mind of La, la, la means I love you for a Smokey song), Calling (a spanish tinged slow ballad song with a spanish guitar and spanish singer duet; in this song the's begging for a girl to pick up the phone of\/c the's calling), and Never Give you Up (a more up to date beat mid-tempo song with Stevie playing the Harmonica and another guy who sings one verse that sounds just like one of the old Tony's.)Anyway I'm really happy I got the cd of\/c I almost did't and typically Raphael in't one of those artists I just trust enough to always catch this vibe; so I do have to listen to what vibe the's on before I pick it up; but this is a cd I know many will miss and instead pick up Amy Winehouse.

The only bad song is Jay-Z's bonus song. My favourites are: The Big Easy (code of what goes wrong in the world when a child leaves), Oh Girl (a sweet, cloud cry, begging a girl to change the world. In La's mind, there, this means I love you because of Smokey's song), Calling (slow song inspired by Spanish with a Spanish guitar and Spanish music; in this song Asking a girl to pick up the phone \/ pc phone), and Never Give Up (the latest speed song, Stevie plays a harmonica, and someone else's poem sounds like one of Tony's old jones.) Anyway, I'm glad that I found the \/ pc almost almost non-existent, and usually Raphael is not one of the artists I trust enough to hold this breath; so before I can pick it up, I have to listen to its spirit first; but this is a CD I know a lot of people will miss, but take Amy Winehouse. Um? Oh yeah. If I had to choose, I would choose Saadiq.","overall":5,"summary":"detailed review\/great cd","unixReviewTime":1224028800,"reviewTime":"10 15, 2008"}

I liked this CD and I played it a lot. I knew what kind of music (the sixties) would be before I bought it; So for those who don't know me, I can understand the frustration. In another note (unlike Babyface's playlist) I don't think any listener Tony, Tony, Tone has never seen it happen. Raphael has been retro since \"Hey Little Walter\" and has a good old-fashioned sound on almost every TTT cd. This CD is not respectable, it is part of the work because the music is as clear as sixty's. For those who like to pick Sam Kok if you want to hear it, fine, but I'm sure artists like Prince, Madonna, and other old artists will come back to this place to learn more about the opposite. Trying to Which means it's about to be the most delusional time of the year, as well. This is a CD focused and well-structured CD with complete songs, choruses, and balanced music. I say that it is true to are-enforce this view. I'm sure you can add this CD to the playlist with Sam Cook, Smoky, Diana and people will think it was done in the sixties. Exactly sixty and fifty years later, I see it as a good CD because of the variety of songs that come together so well. In other words, Slow Jam is an interesting iTunes and fast songs have a powerful rhythm that makes you dance. And finally you can see that Raphael's heart was there at the time of CK \/ it seemed like the was having fun making this CD. The only bad song was a bonus song with JZ. My favourites are: Big Easy (code of what's wrong in the world since the baby left), Oh Girl means I love you smoking song), Calling (a cool Spanish with Spanish guitar) A ballad song and a set of Spanish artists. In this song, a girl is asked to pick up the phone. A boy who sings a verse that sounds like Tony's old voice.) Still, I'm really happy that D has been found \/ I have almost never been found and in general Raphael is not one of the artists on whom I rely enough to keep this vibe alive. So I have to listen to what Vibe says before the takes it. But this is a CD that I know many people will remember instead of downloading Amy Winehouse. Huh? Yes.

Individual releases from both artists are worth months of anticipation: both forefathers of West Coast ship shop, they have impeccable catalogs and huge legacies; DJ Quik, in my opinion, as the West Coast's greatest producer and Kurupt as the quick slipped, smooth lyrical half of Long Beach's Tha Dogg Pound. Both helped pioneer the of-funk phenomenon from the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninety and have proven time and again to be masters of gangsta wrap. Quik's discography is among ship shop's best, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a single beat of this that's anything less than great. This also arrives at a perfect time; Quik has been inactive for four years and Kurupt has suffered some recent backlash from fans who claim this hunger is lost.\"Blaqkout\" is an immediately appealing LP that just sounds great and is perfect summertime music. It has the light, breezy vibe that Quik perfected onSafe & SoundandRhythm-al-ism, yet stays innovative and forward-reaching with further creativity. Quik is a musical genius and an artist foremost, so even on a collaboration piece this beats take center stage. The instrumentals are rich and funky and do this immense talent justice, bearing this famous Midas touch. Kurupt and Quik share mic duties equally along with a few guests. There's not much heavy lyricism; they tend to flex their MC muscles with light sixteen-bar verses between good hooks. It's clear they've come to play from the gorgeous opening title track, with its soaring synths and heavy claps, and the funky \"Cream N Ya Panties.\" The bouncy \"Ohh!\" and \"The Appeal\" are strong, and Kurupt trips the cleverly minimalist \"ninex Outta ten.\" Quik impresses on the space-age winner \"Jupiter's Critic and the Mind of Mars,\" and the gem of the tracklist is the brilliant party track \"Hey Playa! (Moroccan Blues),\" where Quik flips a ridiculous sample into a superb production. As far as flaws, I'd only pick the reggae track \"Exodus\" and \"Watcha Wan Do\" as subpar, so the latter did't need an alternate mix on the last track. It's a little brief at barely forty minutes.\"Blaqkout\" is quintessential West Coast ship shop and perfect summer music from two legends.

It sounds great and is the perfect summer music. It has the perfect light of Quik and a relaxed atmosphere in terms of safety, sound and rhythm, while maintaining a new version and looking forward with more design. Quik is a music artist and one of the most important artists, so even in collaborative work, the region is in the middle. Musical instruments are rich and fashionable, displaying a great talent for justice, with this famous form of turning stones into gold. Kurupt and Quik shared the microphone functions equally with most of the guests. No music is too hard; they often twist their MC muscles with sixteen quick poems between beautiful hooks. Obviously, they started playing on the theme of the fun opening title, with their high synthesizers and heavy shoulder, and the fashion \"Cream N Ya Panties\".
