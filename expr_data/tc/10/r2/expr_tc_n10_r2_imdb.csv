2918,"*Spoilers and extreme bashing play ahead*When this show first started, I found it tolerable and fun. Fairly Oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked. It also had high ratings along with Spongebob. But it started to fall because of the following crap that Butch Hartman and this team shoved into the show. First off, toilet humour in't all that funny. You can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp, but that's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a clické joke. Next there are the kiddie jokes. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people across-dressing. LOLOLOL!!! I just can't stop laughing at such gay bliss! Somebody help me! But of course, this show would't suck that bad if it were't for stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed Australians? They saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving, boomerang-throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert. But now. Is the coup de grace of WHY this show truly sucks the loudest of them all. OVER-USED JOKES!!! The show constantly pulls up the same jokes (the majority of them being unfunny) thinking it is like the greatest thing never! Cosmo is mostly the one to blame. I hated how they kept on mentioning ""Super Toilet"" (which also has a blend of yiddish humour in it just as well) and Cosmo would freak out. And who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in Dimmsdale would use in that one be-mail episode? You know, the one in which every single parent (oblivious to other parents saying it) would butter the EXACT same sentence before breaking into their kid's room? Yes, it may be first class humour to some people, but it is pure is*** to others. If I'm not mistaken, I do believe Butch Hartman said something about ending the show. Thank God! Everyone around my area says it's, like, the funniest Nickelodeon show never. I just can't agree with it I think it's just another pile of horse dung that we get on your cartoon stations everyday, only worse.",negative
2918,"* Robbers and extreme criticism will start * When the show started, I thought it was tolerable and interesting. Ideally Oddparent is a type of cartoon that is popular with adults and children. It also received top ratings with SpongeBob. But it started to decline due to the subsequent stupidity that Butch Hartman and the team pushed into the show. First of all, the humour of the toilet is not funny. You can easily laugh at a busy baby, but this is almost exclusively for the audience who laughs at such a joke. Next comes a bad joke. Lol, we see people wearing underwear, we can see people wearing underwear. LOL! ! ! I can’t stop laughing at gay fun! Someone help me! However, if it were not for this, the show would not have been so bad. Do you see how the group reflects the people of Australia? They think they are just fools to love the kangaroo and the boomerang - throwing in the hot desert. but now. Why this show is attracted to the highest of them, even if it is a deadly plague. Extreme jokes! ! ! This show always produces the same jokes (most of them are boring), you think it's the biggest thing! Cosmo is the main culprit. I hate to always talk about “high toilets” (mixed with Yiddish shame), and Cosmo is scared of you. Who can forget that the smart goat joke that every Dimmsdale parent watched used that email quote? Do you know, in that case, every single parent (you don't know what other parents say) can say the same sentence before entering their child's room? Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me. If I remember correctly, I believe Butch Hartman said something about ending the show. Thank God! Everyone in my area said it was the most interesting Nickelodeon show. I don't agree with you that this is just another pile of horse manure we get from your cartoon station every day, and it will only get worse.",negative

I don't remember any farting for belching in the book, do you? They took this all times children classic, added some farting, belching and sexual inuindo, and prostituted it into a KAKA joke. This should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like.

10228,"This is a brilliant, lavish Czech film from the Sverak father and son team, all about two Czech pilots who flee to England to help the RAF in the Battle of Britain but who also fall out over a woman (the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Features some excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes  probably the best never and much better than Pearl Harbour for even the film Battle of Britain - and a number of interesting general themes such as love, war, romance, comradeship, loss and servitude. Also, the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (though made easier there with the great stalwart Anna Massey). The film has some great little motifs such as the world famous RAF bullseye device, shown throughout and at one point nicely reflected in the black vinyl record, spinning around acutely (music is another theme of the film, of course). Plus, all of the traditional icons of English life: dimpled beer glasses (unlike the post-war straight glasses used in Pearl Harbour), tea in a nice china tea set in an English country garden (though shot in the Czech Republic?), the mascot dog, a vintage bottle of HP sauce, even a darts board! Of course, the fairfield and surrounding countryside is ridiculously unlike anywhere in the south of England, though the virtuous aerial sequences make up for this, showing Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always synonymous with southern England and the Battle of Britain. But best of all is the sensational musical score from Ondrej Soukup, as good as anything from Hans Zimmer yet all in the tradition of the late, excellent Ron Goodwin who scored the original Battle of Britain film amongst other classic English war films. There's even a nice little cameo role for the  apparently  famous Czech musician and factor (and Kevin Kline lookalike) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays on the piano the title theme song, Dark Blue Sky. Excellent! It's got a few smutty yet funny little Freudian devices too, such as always showing an inflated condom floating by the ceiling whenever Karel (the callow but brilliant Krystof Hadek) is stuck at the fairfield while this love rival and fellow pilot Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is with Susan. Another great English factor in this film! Charles Dance is of course fine as Wing Commander Bentley. Highly recommended and well worth watching/hiring  get the DVD with special features (stuff like how they created the dog fights and stuff). Probably the only film never to combine subtitles with characters speaking English, German, French and Czech all at once.",positive
10228,"This is a beautiful and beautiful Czech film from Sverak's father and son's group. It tells the story of two Czech pilots who fled to the UK to help the Royal Air Force take part in the British war (beautiful Tarafi Zgerald). Having great and realistic air combat scenes — perhaps the best in the Battle of the British movie, better than Pearl Harbor — and many more interesting themes such as love, war, romance, comrades Friendship, loss and bondage. In addition, the temptations and difficulties of moving abroad and learning foreign languages ​​(although it is much easier with the independent Ana Messi). The film has some beautiful little patterns, such as the famous Royal Air Force, on which it travels and is sometimes featured in black Vinyl records, which revolves around a lot (yes, music is another movie theme). In addition, all the traditional symbols of British life: toothpicks with toothpaste (different from the standard glasses used in Pearl Harbor after the war), tea in delicious porcelain bricks in English country gardens (although it was taken from the Czech Republic?), Mascot dog, old bottle, HP and dart board! Of course, Fairfield and the surrounding countryside are very different from any other place in the south of England, although the excellent airport sequence makes it, featuring Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always a battle between southern England and Britain. But the most important is the soundtrack of Ondrej Soukup, which is as good as any of Hans Zimmer's works, but inherits the tradition of the late and best Ron Goodwin, who made the sound of the first British Film War in some British war films. There is also a small guest role - obviously the famous Czech singer and subject (like Kevin Klein) Aldrich Kaiser, who played the lead song titled ""Deep Blue Sky"" on the piano.

Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it. Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it. The deeper meaning- (to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble) Humans are self serving, we make decisions that can destroy your lives and don't open email without a return address. Summary: Creepy old man tells Cammeron Diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks. Of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money. Then the movie takes a dive into the unusual. To spare my fingers the typing. For pushing the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings, in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race. I liked: The willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines. Its different. Its intense. It has a deeper meaning (although its philosophy one hundred and one material). It leaves you guessing. NOT A Hollywood ENDING! I disliked: Why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme? What god like alien has the patience for that? Diaz was good, but was there a need for the country accent? They live in Virginia.

Richard Kelly likes to make movies that make you feel stupid when you don’t understand the “deep meaning” the first time you watch it. Honestly, I had to look at the Box twice before I liked it. Deep meaning- (in order to save you from the stupid psychiatric group) People love themselves, the decisions we make can ruin your life, and they won't open without a reply email address. Introduction: A trembling old man tells Cameron Diaz that if you press a button, I'll kill a stranger and give you a million dollars. Yes, the pushed it and found the money box as the trembling old man had promised. After that, the film explores a deeply unfamiliar situation. I might as well type with my fingers. With the push of a button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by aliens with supernatural powers. This is a comprehensive test to measure human behavior. What I love: This movie is determined to ignore the general movie's direction. This is different. He is angry. It has a profound meaning (although its philosophy is one hundred and one). It makes you guessed. What an send to Hollywood! I don't like it: Why would anyone who has the technology to suppress another form of life devise such an absurd plan?

43108,"Naturally, along with everyone else, I was primed to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON over the legend of Custer. Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part my expectations were fulfilled (in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way). Yet even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the Custer story, I was struck by some of the points made in this movie that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counter the typical clickés of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in Westerns of the early twentyth century. For instance, even while this film attempted to whitewash it's hero, certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real-life Custer: one) His initial entrance at the West Point front gate, in which this arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of this character.two) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed as much to Custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor; there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where the seems downright stupid.three) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. I half-expected to see the Marx Brothers for Abbott and Costello wander into the scene.four) Custer's stand against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky.five) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored. And although the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the Black Hills squarely at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I did't expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivocally in a movie like this. And one other thing: usually in these films it is the Indians who are portrayed men mass as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol.

C) Custer promotion in general is not a joke, but it is also a joke. However, even in this very clear (and under a lot of criticism) telling Custer's story, I was shocked by some of the scenes in the film, sometimes subtle but solid, and seemingly different from the usual. Although the music and certain ways of portraying Indians in this film are certainly proof of racial discrimination against ignorant people, I am still amazed that this film provides details of how Indians attacked those white people of the country have a right, and clearly responsible for fighting Montenegro at the feet of white people. In this movie, at least two scenes are shown this way, actually the seventh Cavalry troops, not the Indians. I look forward to seeing Marx's brothers strolling around Abbott and Costello. four) Custer's position against Jeb Stuart in Gettysburg was not made white as an excellent military leader, but with carelessness and luck. five) Custer's alcohol problem is certainly not going to be noticed. Yes, that part of the story is true, but I did not expect to see it clearly portrayed in such a moving picture. In fact, no one can deny that the obvious villain of this work is not Anthony Quinn, who sits on a cow, but Arthur Kennedy.",positive

So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivalled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I did't finish it. I can understand why this sound career was so limited, the did't get very good material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is very forgettable. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but this role there also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before the gets in a bring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans there and this wont be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, four out of ten. Don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this for is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase.

After seeing the (or most violent) punches of Chaplin, Abbot and Costello, three heads, Martin and Lewis, brothers Marx, and Laurel and Hardy, this is easy to forget. I’m interested in watching Adolf Menjo, because I really like this role in The Way of Glory, but the role is nothing special to me. Maybe they should take part in a boxing match before, because at least half of the movies (at least it seems like) are about to go into the game. I would say there are a lot of Lloyd's fans out there. Don't watch this with anyone who wants to love old movies, because they can never watch one with you, obviously. For those who really enjoy this work, in addition to looking for many well-known comedies, I recommend the ""Kelly Second"" produced a few years ago.

He seems to find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries for, and then with tongue-in-cheek editing make fun of everything they are about. It's never really a direct caricaturation of them and Morris seems most of the time to be saying, ""But no, no, these people are really fascinating, really!"", but there's always these subtle little canted angles and not-so-subtle editing techniques that show that Morris seems to be mocking them behind their back. This movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation. a man who studies African hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly want-like, a lion tamer, a man who keeps a garden full of animal-shaped shrubbery, and a robot designer. The general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal, human, and life features? So the title of Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control does't really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie. right? Except of course Morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals' passions (he might call them ""obsessions"") making synthetic designs on life. I share not that fear and honestly don't appreciate some of the connections Morris makes in the film. But I stress this subtlety. With no voice-over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it's not as if Morris never pounds that anxiety onto the spectators' collective head. Instead the mixes circus footage and want footage together often at times when they're taken out of the context of the circus and the wants, showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about. I don't find them absurd, I find them all very neat and interesting individuals. Unless, of course, the did't intend such juxtapositions, which means the's just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subverted. Considering none of this films I've seen so far have particularly impressed me, I don't really care to find out what the's trying to do.--PolarisDiB",negative

You seem to have found very interesting and diverse characters, great people to create documents, and then use funny editors to make fun of them all. This did not bother them. Morris seemed to say most of the time, ""But no, no, these people are really attractive, really!"" shows that Morris seems to be making fun of their skill behind the scenes. The film traces four people who broke the traditional boundaries of biodiversity. A reader of African furness mice discovered that they were in great demand, a tamer lion, a man who planted shrubs in the garden, and a robot designer. The main theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what it represents the animals, humans and characteristics of life? Therefore, fast, inexpensive and uncontrollable titles seem meaningless to movies. right? Of course, Morris seems to be a little distracted by these people who are interested in making a living (you might say ""worried""). I don’t have that kind of fear, and honestly, I don’t appreciate the communication that Morris made in the movie. But I emphasize this deception. Without a word, leaving the words out completely in the interview, Morris did not seem to put this concern in the mixed minds of the audience. On the contrary, when they are separated from the circus background and desire, they always mix circus shots with the desired shooting, showing the absurdity that all these people are talking about. I don't think they are irrational, I think they are clean and funny people. Of course, unless they will be in such a state, it is a bad job and not a silent distraction.

Keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent INSANE amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting for anything else for that matter. The crazy thing I noticed is that every character is completely over-portrayed, and it seems (most of the time anyhow) that the film had been 'sped-up' to make the characters move faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was dubbed too?) I understand the cartoon had this, but it does't work for live-action. It just looks odd. as if the camera crew decided to act because they could't afford real factors. The English version is horribly dubbed, and the character's words do not match the mouths at all. I would have proffered subtitles, but since this is a kids movie, and since some kids cannot read well, I'll let it go. But there is something extremely odd about this movie. It's supposedly a kids movie, but there's a lot of material about SEX, RAPE, and STRIPPING which in't exactly for young Western audiences. (In the Orient, they have different laws and sexuality in children's movies is much more accepted). But parents be warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, multiple scenes where people say 'sex maniac' and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the 'sex maniacs' and shows him her breasts! Who was this movie made for anyway? Oh, and the special effects are laughable. You can tell the spaceship-like things that bomb the village are cardboard cutouts (or animation, I was't sure) that look unconvincing, even to a kid. The makers of this movie left out a lot of cool things from the cartoon, simply because they could't budget the kind of money they'd need. I did't like how the names of all the characters were changed. it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. I don't really recommend this movie to anyone. Kids, adults, for Dragon Ball Z fans. It's just a poor representation of the cartoon, and obviously, one will be table to tell that this movie was brushed and no care whatsoever was put into it. I won't even get into the camerawork. just wait until the send credits at the still picture that sits there for two minutes. most of the shots are not framed correctly AT ALL and the movie just seems made by amateurs.

Remember, this is a movie, and they seem to be spending crazy money exploding without enough money for anything else. The worst thing I’ve never seen is that every character overreact, and it seems (most of the time it is) that the movie is “fast” to make the characters go faster! (I don't know if the Hong Kong genre is also called extant?) I know this cartoon has this thing, but it does't work on the live genre. It looks strange. It seems that the film crew decided to take action because they could not afford the exact same conditions. The English version of the dubbing is awesome, and the names and mouths of the characters are completely inconsistent. I could have provided the footnotes, but because this is a children's movie and some kids can't read well, I give up. But there are some very strange things in this movie. This is supposed to be a children’s film, but there are a lot of things about sex, rape and liberation that are totally inappropriate for a young Western audience. (In the East, they have different rules, and sex in children's movies is acceptable). But parents need to pay attention! There are places where two characters talk about rape, there are many places where people say “sex”! Who is this movie for? Oh, special results karen't funny. You could say that things like the bomber that exploded in the village were cardboard cuts (or cartoons, I'm not sure), and even for kids, they don't seem convincing. The producers of this film have missed out on a lot of cool stuff in the cartoon, because they can’t afford to budget for the kind of money they want.

He had some big moments in this career but the also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in this career. The strange thing about Jill The Ripper (or Jill Rips. for Tied Up) is that I honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller? It shows in the way that they describe it on IMDb, on the DVD case, in the commentaries, and this film is not serious. To call it campy would be a huge understatement. The film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it's nothing more than shallow, confusing and gratuitous. On top of that they put Lundgren, who is known for action films, in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because this range as an factor is pretty limited. The entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller? Just the plot and premise immediately make it a B-Movie Porn at very best. Dolph Lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic Matt Sorenson who decides to play Detective when this brother is murdered. I mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has Lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes, and witnesses and everything else even though the's not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather black cluster performance from Lundgren. Danielle Brett is Lundgren's eventual love interest and this brother's widow. Brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story. The supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it's on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by Victor Pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film, boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain. I honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there was't any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where Lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked. To explain how classy and well done this movie is (sarcasm. sarcasm) the back of the DVD I picked up (it was really cheap) has Lundgren's character listed as ""Murray Wilson"" (not the name of this character in the film.) While somehow Lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it's face trying to be serious.

It showed how they described it in IMDb, in the DVD box, in the review, and the movie was not in-depth. Calling it Camp will be a big deal. This movie is trying to be hard and careful, but in reality it is more than just, frustrating and not discriminated against. Most importantly, they let Lundgren, known for this action films, try to play a more complex role, which makes it even more difficult because the width as a very small object. Every movie revolves around the world of pornography, but are they trying to turn it into something more interesting? Just the plan and the foundation immediately make it the best B movie. Dolph Lundgren plays the role of a disgraced and angry former police officer Matt Sorenson. When the brother was killed, the decided to play the detective. What I am saying is to set aside a lot of loopholes and allow Lundgren to roam freely to investigate crimes, witnesses and everything else, even if the is no longer a police officer, and you can still see the work of a strange and black group by Lundgren. . Danielle Brett is Lundgren's last lover and brother-in-law. Considering the script and the bad story, Brett has played this role decently enough. The supporting cast is huge, and no one is outstanding in their plays, except that on the negative side, like Victor Pedtrchenko’s horrible performance, the seems to have a lot of different names in the film, Serious Sentence, and really. a terrible villain. Honestly, I tried to get into the mystery and the movie and watched it carefully, but for no reason, because it was a joke and a chaos of unsafe sex games, including a comic strip where Lundgren was hung upside down Almost naked. To illustrate the beauty and brilliance of this film (humor. Humor), the back of the DVD I took (very low price) I listed Lundgren's character as ""Murray Wilson"" (not the character's name in the movie) Lundgren was table to watch normally, the film seemed immeasurable when the tried to deep.

I just did, and I was AMAZED about how good I thought the movie was, as opposed to when I first saw it three years ago. The first time around I was certainly impressed by the astronomical vistas we're treated to in this movie, but by and large I did't think that much of the movie as a whole. It was an Alien trip-off, and I thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science. That they were allergic to light was something I found especially ridiculous. Based on my first viewing, I recently rated this movie a five. However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is on the way, and the movie poster for that one looks amazing, I thought I'd better brush up on Pitch Black once more, so I borrowed the video from a friend. I am so glad I did. There's so much of what I thought I remembered from the first viewing that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died very early in the movie. This was not so. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. This was not so. I thought Riddick was the sole survivor. This was not so. I see now that the movie works *extremely* well. There in't an excessive, tiresome focus on the monsters. It's much more of a human drama. The main characters are appealing and capable of some convincing acting. And there are so many little details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and believable, such as the shortage of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet they crash on, and the fact that the monsters have beaten everything on the planet, and so they turn on each other. And I have to mention the astronomical vistas again. I mean, we start out seeing the spaceship passing through a comet's tail, with bits of spacedust zapping through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just as the shipwrecked people think it's about to get dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon, and everything is engulfed in a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see the huge, neighbouring, fringed gas giant rise across the sky, and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship skid closely above one of these very rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I don't think I've seen any other SF movie that really made such a point out of including these things. I hope we see much more of it in the sequel. Pitch Black now gets from me a rating of nine out of ten. A cult classic? You bet!!",positive

It also has some of the best performances never seen in a movie, and when Sean interviewed Ed Harris' character in prison, it was a thrill. I really like this one, I can't recommend this, don't miss this! Don't pay attention to comments that say the last thirty minutes are bad. It is as powerful as any movie.",positive

This film makes Camp Blood one and two look like greats. The film contains bad acting, poor sound, poor confusing storyline, bad makeup- and it bored me so much i turned it off. even the nudity was rubbish! Did they even have a budget for this film? I don't think they did. You can tell if your gonna like this film for not in the first five minutes. if of want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger four for even camp blood. Avoid this trash - I watched it on TV and felt griped off, so don't spend anything on it. The best part is probably the send.",negative

36141,"Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little. My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind. Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it. Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it. The deeper meaning- (to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble) Humans are self serving, we make decisions that can destroy your lives and don't open email without a return address. Summary: Creepy old man tells Cammeron Diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks. Of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money. Then the movie takes a dive into the unusual. To spare my fingers the typing. For pushing the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings, in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race. I liked: The willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines. Its different. Its intense. It has a deeper meaning (although its philosophy one hundred and one material). It leaves you guessing. NOT A Hollywood ENDING! I disliked: Why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme? What god like alien has the patience for that? Diaz was good, but was there a need for the country accent? They live in Virginia. I give it a seven because Kelly did't put as much attention to detail as with this other movies. Overall good flick.",positive
36141,"Even in science fiction, the movie is outraged. Yeah, a little more. The first thought after reading it was that I just lost my mind. Do not expect another Dark to watch this movie. Daktronics fans will never love another Richard Kelly film because of their unusual religious standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, this father. Richard Kelly likes to make movies that make you feel stupid when you don’t understand the “deep meaning” the first time you watch it. Honestly, I had to look at the Box twice before I liked it. Deep meaning- (in order to save you from the stupid psychiatric group) People love themselves, the decisions we make can ruin your life, and they won't open without a reply email address. Introduction: A trembling old man tells Cameron Diaz that if you press a button, I'll kill a stranger and give you a million dollars. Yes, the pushed it and found the money box as the trembling old man had promised. After that, the film explores a deeply unfamiliar situation. I might as well type with my fingers. With the push of a button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by aliens with supernatural powers. This is a comprehensive test to measure human behavior. What I love: This movie is determined to ignore the general movie's direction. This is different. He is angry. It has a profound meaning (although its philosophy is one hundred and one). It makes you guessed. What an send to Hollywood! I don't like it: Why would anyone who has the technology to suppress another form of life devise such an absurd plan? Is there a god like a foreigner who is so patient? Diaz is fine, but do you want a country sound? They live in Virginia. Give me seven points because Kelly did’t pay as much attention as the other films. Overall a good film.",positive

It turns out that The Matrix Revisited tells you hardly anything about the part of filmmaking for even how The Matrix was made. It is basically a huge commercial for The Matrix, a movie that the target audience of The Matrix Revisited has already seen! If you really want to know about the process and the troubles and the stress and the detail that went into making of The Matrix, look no further than the bonus features on the original DVD of The Matrix.

43108,"Naturally, along with everyone else, I was primed to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON over the legend of Custer. Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part my expectations were fulfilled (in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way). Yet even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the Custer story, I was struck by some of the points made in this movie that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counter the typical clickés of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in Westerns of the early twentyth century. For instance, even while this film attempted to whitewash it's hero, certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real-life Custer: one) His initial entrance at the West Point front gate, in which this arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of this character.two) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed as much to Custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor; there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where the seems downright stupid.three) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. I half-expected to see the Marx Brothers for Abbott and Costello wander into the scene.four) Custer's stand against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky.five) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored. And although the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the Black Hills squarely at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I did't expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivocally in a movie like this. And one other thing: usually in these films it is the Indians who are portrayed men mass as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol. In this movie, it is actually the troops of the seventh Cavalry, and not the Indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way. All in all, this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the Hollywood bunk.",positive
43108,"the main character, however, this means Castor's misconduct and character in real life: one) His first entry into the former door of the West Point Military Academy. two) His tragic report to the West Point Military Academy seems to resemble Custer's ignorance of military service requirements and any other factors; during Flynn's role as Custer at West Point Military Academy, there were times when it seemed like a complete failure. C) Custer promotion in general is not a joke, but it is also a joke. However, even in this very clear (and under a lot of criticism) telling Custer's story, I was shocked by some of the scenes in the film, sometimes subtle but solid, and seemingly different from the usual. Although the music and certain ways of portraying Indians in this film are certainly proof of racial discrimination against ignorant people, I am still amazed that this film provides details of how Indians attacked those white people of the country have a right, and clearly responsible for fighting Montenegro at the feet of white people. In this movie, at least two scenes are shown this way, actually the seventh Cavalry troops, not the Indians. I look forward to seeing Marx's brothers strolling around Abbott and Costello. four) Custer's position against Jeb Stuart in Gettysburg was not made white as an excellent military leader, but with carelessness and luck. five) Custer's alcohol problem is certainly not going to be noticed. Yes, that part of the story is true, but I did not expect to see it clearly portrayed in such a moving picture. In fact, no one can deny that the obvious villain of this work is not Anthony Quinn, who sits on a cow, but Arthur Kennedy.",positive
