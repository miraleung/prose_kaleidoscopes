23,"First of all, let's get a few things straight there: a) I AM an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact (I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool). of) I DO like several B-Movies because they're hilarious. pc) I like the Godzilla movies- a lot. Moving on, when the movie first comes on, it seems like it's going to be your usual B-movie, down to the crappy FX, but all a sudden- BOOM! the anime comes on! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill. The animation is VERY bad & cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie I ""vividly"" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school. & it's the same kids over & over again! The FX are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices(especially the English dub that I viewed) was horrid & I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & Joel/Mike on MSTthreeK (you pick the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time. Heck, I'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it's stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I'm giving this movie a three/ten, an improvement from the zero.five/ten I was originally going to give it.(According to my grading scale: three/ten means Pretty much both boring & bad. As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting to fifteen.)",negative
23,"Cartoons are awesome and cheap, even worse than the SPEED RACER I remember, for criissakes! Foreign exchange is terrible; Dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla.

Because it’s stupid, painful to watch at the same time and unplanned fun, I’ve given this movie three / ten points, which is more than the zero / ten improvements I was determined to give it. Go ahead, when the movie is released for the first time, it looks like your normal B movie, even if FX is bad, but all of a sudden — boom! After all, it’s cheap, and one of the few events in the movie that I remember “clearly” was when a group of kids came out of school. First, let's say a few things directly: a) I'm an anime fan — in fact, I used to (I used to watch Speed ​​Racer in kindergarten). Cartoons are very bad and cheap, and even worse than SPEED RACER in my memory, thanks to crisaci!

Continuing, when the movie comes out for the first time, it looks like it will be the regular B-movie, which goes down to FX, but suddenly- BOOM! the anime is coming! This is when WWWAAAAYAYYYY down the movie. The movement was horrible and cheap, worse than I remember from SPEED RACER, for the excitement! In fact, very cheaply, one of the few scenes in the film that I “clearly” remember is when a group of kids finished school. & are the same kids again & again! FX is horrible too; Dinosaurs are worse than Godzilla.

Honestly, this is the only way to easily enjoy this movie and save it. Heck, I plan to show it to another of my otaku friends who are my friends Halloween night at B-Movie. Because it is stupid, very painful to watch & deliberate and funny at the same time, I give this movie thirteen, a development from zero.five / ten I would originally pay. : thirteen means beautiful both boring and ugly both in speed ”is one of my favourite otaku movies.

8686,"Madison is not too bad-if you like simplistic, non-offensive, ""family-friendly"" fare and, more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing. If, like me, you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., prepare to be disappointed. Professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports clické in the book. I need't repeat what they've said. What I felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the ""glory years"" (which many would argue were already past in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one). Yes, it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast, though it was clear that the restored versions (hats off to the volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum) were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed. But where was the sound? Much of the thrill of the old hydro was the mind-numbing roar of six Allison for Rolls-Merlin aircraft engines, wound up to RPM's never imagined by their designers, hitting the starting line right in front of you. You did't hear it, you FELT it. Real hydro buffs know exactly what I'm talking about. There's none of that in Madison. Instead, every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a ""heroic"" musical score. And then there are the close-up shots of the drivers, riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home-town hero. Or, in one particularly ridiculous shot, taking time to spot Jake Lloyd giving a ""Rocky"" salute from a bridge pier. In reality, some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock-hard water at speeds above one hundred and fifty mph. As one reviewer so aptly put it, ""The sport deserves better than this.""Finally, since another user brought up anachronisms, I'll add one: the establishing shot of Seattle shows the Kingdome and Safeco Field. Neither existed in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one",negative
8686,"Madison is wrong - if you like light, non-violent food, ""family friendly"" food, and most importantly, if you run away from the sea. If, like me, you grew up in this game and your heroes are called Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc. Professional film critics have commented extensively on the film's formula and its choice to use all the old drama programs in the book. I don't have to repeat what they said. I regret that in the ""glorious years"" (many would argue that it is already the year one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one) the true sense of urgency has disappeared. Of course it is nice to see old boats roaring along the trail, although it is clear that the restored report (tax on Seaplane volunteers and the Row Museum) is caring for the situation at a reduced space. But where is the sound? Much of the excitement of the old Hydro is the confusing roar of Roll-Merlin aircraft from the six Allisons, which reach an unexpected RPM by its designers, hitting the first line in front of you. You never heard it, you heard it. True hydro lovers know exactly what I'm talking about. Madison does not have these. Instead, the rest of the race is buried under the music that should be “hero”. Then there is the driver's shuttle, a nice and comfortable ride in the cockpit, as if they are relaxing in a modern car, in some cases, taking a moment to smile and thinking of a better way to avoid the homes of the poor — —the city hero. Or, with a funny shot, take the time to see Jack Lloyd pay homage to ""Rocky"" at the pier. In addition, some unrestricted pilots wore bulletproof vests to reduce the impact when the ship flew over the green water at a speed of more than one hundred and fifty mph. As one commentator aptly put it, ""This game deserves better than this."" Finally, since one user is asking an unexpected question, I will add another: Seattle's setup shot featuring Kingdome and Safeco Field. It did not exist in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one.

The movie on it's own is basically the kind of typical B-movie crud that Italian film-makers were churning out in the early to mid eighty's.

10395,"After Watergate, Vietnam and the dark days of the Nixon and Jimmy Carter eras, what the world needed was a good old-fashioned chapter-play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the America of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six for the jungles of South America in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures. Unfortunately what it got in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five was Doc Savage, The Man of Bronze. Perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer George Pal's final film is that this often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of Kenneth Robeson's pulp-paperback novels probably had George Lucas and Phil Kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other ""We can do better than that,"" and adding a bullwhip, a battered Fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix. A big part of the problem is that Doc Savage is in many ways even harder to write for than Superman  explorer, adventurer, philanthropist, a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach-blonde bulletproof muscle-bound body of a Greek God (or rather the form of TV's Tarzan, Ron Ely, a rather dull Charlton Heston clone there), there's simply nothing the can't do and, more damagingly, nothing that can charm him. The man is the virtual incarnation of Hitler's Aryan ubermensch (no surprise that the DVD is only available in Germany!), albeit with all-American values. And just in case there should never be anything the's overlooked (not that there never is) the has not one but five sidekicks in this entourage, the (less than) Fabulous Five. A chemist, an electrician and even an archaeologist I can accept, and at a stretch I could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer, but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on this adventures? In reality Doc's brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way  even Kryptonite would't put a dent in him - there needed to be someone at risk in the stories, though with the exception of Paul Gleason they're all so horribly badly cast and overplayed (as are most parts in the film) you'd happily kill them all off during the opening titles. The villains fare no better, with Paul Wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as Captain Seas, Scott Walker (no, a different one) delivering one of cinema's worst accents (is it meant to be Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Greek, Pakistani for some nationality no-one has never heard of?) while Robyn Hilton's Marilyn Monroe-ish dumb blonde moll gives Paris (no relation) a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes. Even with those drawbacks, this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients  lost tribes, a pool of gold, a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive, all wrapped up in a quest to discover why Doc's father was murdered. Unfortunately it's a question of stone: in the sixty and seventy pulp superheroes were't brooding figures prone to state-of-the-art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low-budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought, the films aimed purely at the matinée market: you know, for kids. There have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight-faced  and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post-production, be it the Colgate twinkle in Doc's eye, the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust-up with Captain Seas for Don Black's young-ho lyrics to John Philip Sousa's patriotic marches  but plenty was in the film to begin with. After all, it's hard to see how one of the villain's underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was never intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat, while Doc's explanation to Pamela Hensley of why the never dates girls could be a scene written for Adam West's Batman. Instead, the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional, such as Doc displaying this sixth sense by, her, bobbing this Adam's apple. Perhaps an even bigger problem is that, while promising on paper, the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion, be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of New York skyscrapers for escaping from a yacht full of bad guys. Even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director Michael Anderson: having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier, Doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them. Still, aside from Doc's various vehicles all stamped with this logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze, the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously L. A. standing in for New York while Fred Koenekamp's cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget. And it's good to see a superhero movie that does't spend most of its running time on an origin story, though one is left with the suspicion that Doc sprang fully formed from the loins of Zeus himself. It's a film I'd really like to like more, but it just feels like one hundred minutes of lost opportunities. No wonder Doc Savage, The Arch Enemy of Evil, the sequel so optimistically promised in the send credits, never happened.",negative
10395,"After Watergate, Vietnam, and the dark days of Nixon and Jimmy Carter's time, the world's most sought-after veteran snake-fighting hero and villains in the United States for a thousand people, nine hundred and thirty-six South America A series of spectacular cliffs in the jungle. Unfortunately, the jones you get at one thousand and nine hundred and seventy-five are Doc Savage, the Bronze Man. Perhaps the best thing to say about the late film producer George Parr is that this pseudo-novel modification by Kenneth Robeson is always well-designed, but unfortunately, it could cause George George Lucas and Phil Kaufman to leave the stage and say to each other: ""We can do better than that,"" and add bullwhip , shabby Fedora and other much-needed character flaws. A big part of the problem is that Doc Savage is harder to write than Superman in so many ways - explorers, tourists, talents, scientists and intellectuals, have Greek deities (or Tarzan instead of TV, Ron Ely, something like Heston clone form), nothing that can be done at all, and something destructive. is that nothing can attract him. This person is Hitler's Aryan ubermensch avatar (no wonder DVD is only available in Germany!), Although it has all American prices. In the case of no negligence (no) in the institution there are only five, (less) five good partners. A pharmacist, electrician, for archaeologist, I would accept it, and I would even go and see if a construction engineer would be needed, but what kind of hero would take a criminal lawyer to risk it? After all, Doc's thinking tank may have been added, because the hero is infallible and perfect for almost everything - even if Kryptonite stone does't affect him - one has to be in danger in the story, though With the exception of Paul Gleason, depth and acting skills are very similar ), and is happy to kill them all in the opening title. The villain's performance in't much better, Paul Wexler removes all threats from a geography lecturer like sea captain, Scott Walker (no, someone else) brings Some of the worst genres in the movie (Scots, Irish, Welsh, Greeks, Pakistanis have never heard of certain nations?) And and Robin Hilton's Marilyn Monroe-style blonde blonde Moore Rangpa Liz (no relatives) competed for her money on a luxury bet. Aside from these shortcomings, it should be better than ignoring a variety of things - a lost nation, a pool of gold, a melee with biplane and the deadly poison of the resurrection, all of which are involved in investigating why Doc's father was killed. Unfortunately, this is a stone problem: in the sixtys and seventys, vulgar superheroes were not imaginative of people who preferred to take the most advanced action and unique results, but were regarded as a slender budget camp with fast-paced entertainment almost in the background, these movies focused on totally on the matinee market: you know, for kids. For a long time, there were rumours that the original adjustment was straightforward — yes, most of the camp's value added to the background product, whether it was Colgate's light in Doc's eyes, for humorous subtitles that identified different combat techniques in the last dust — and Captain Sea Choir Don Blake wrote John John Susa's parade patriotic — but there is a lot of content at the beginning of the film. After all, it’s hard to see how a less-than-evil person calls a call from a giant, not just a joke, and Doc’s explanation to Pamela Hensley as to why a girl who has’t dated could be something Adam West’s Batman wrote. In contrast, the most exciting times are often unintentional. For example, Doc expresses this sixth sense and drops Adam's apple. Perhaps the biggest problem is that even though the promises were made on paper, the actions were handled harmlessly, even chasing a murderer on the proof of a New York suburb building to escape a ship full of bad guys. Even the fiery green snake floating in the air and a successful view of the victim's poison failed to arouse any enthusiasm for director Michael Anderson: after showing this best shows before, Doc was only table to use them to kill them with a chair and electric fan, just draw the curtains. However, all the cars except Doc are printed with this logo and look like plastic folded rather than copper. The product design is always very good, although it is clear that Los Angeles represents New York, and Fred Koenekamp's photo ensures that the film always looks good. well, despite the low budget. It is interesting to see a great movie that did not spend much time in the history of the origin, although some people suspect that Doc was made entirely at the waist of Zeus himself. This is a movie I want to love more, but it feels like a missed moment of a big minute. Not surprisingly, Doc Savage, the Arch Enemy of Evil, this promising approach hoping to file a lawsuit has never happened.",negative

19882,"Pam Grier is the super soul sister of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, appearing in many blaxploitation films that have recently been discovered and appreciated by a new generation. I can safely say that BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA may be the worst Pam Grier movie I've never seen. Grier is Lee and Margaret Markov is Karen; they are two female prisoners who escaped from prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked the paddy wagon. Chained to each other, the film becomes THE DEFIANT ONES for women, but has three separate plots: a fat criminal (Filipino sleaze star Vic Diaz) wants Lee dead, a cowboy bounty hunter (the excellent Sid Haig) searches for the two girls; and Karen's revolutionary friends search for her. The film eventually becomes so convoluted and uninvolved with the two women that the title should have been MEN CHASING WOMEN. Grier, an action star, is not given any chance to participate in any of the many (overlong) action scenes. Markov is excellent as Karen and Grier is OK as Lee, but both are eventually forgotten in the many subplots. One interesting scene has the bounty hunter forcing a police officer and this chief to drop their pants so the can shoot the one with the smallest penis (judged by this whore), but is easily forgotten amidst all the mayhem. BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA starts out great as a women-in-prison film complete with lesbian wardens and a shower scene, then completely switches to a chase film. If director Eddie Romero (famous for directing Filipino horror films) had just stuck with the WIP theme, the would have been fine. Instead, BMWM gets real old real fast and the surprise ending just makes the audience wonder why they sat through a ninety-minute film for it to send like this! Another problem: where is the film supposed to be set? While some of the accents are Hispanic and cities have Spanish names (Los Robles, etc.), all the natives are obviously Asian! Hmmm.

Grier, an action star, is not given any chance to participate in one of the many (extra) scenes in the performance. MAMA BLACK, MAMA WHITE started well with the film of women in prison complete with lesbian guards and baths, and then completely moved on to the chasing film. Pam Grier is the super soul sister of a thousand, nine hundred and seventy’s, who appeared in many hate films recently received and enjoyed by the new generation.

48295,"What I found so curious about this film--I saw the full four hour roadshow version, is how oddly dispassionate it is. For a film about two very charismatic men--Castro and Che, engaged in a gargantuan political struggle, it's almost totally devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is at best a second level factor, with a slightly high pitched voice) have no drama for depth and basically come down to Castro telling Che: go there, go there, do this and that, with no explanation as to what effect for use this action will result in. Odder still is there is an factor in the cast who has the requisite power to play Castro--Joaquim de Almeida, but the's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half. Without the tension for passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a bullish epic-length film about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose for send. Several of the reviews I've read showered praise on the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the factors almost completely. (One in fact spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than the plot for factors for the fact that it's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.)This is an odd, odd thing to do since a) Soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and of) it's no more than a competent job of work, with an unremarked upon nod to Oliver Stone's JFK in the black and white cut up camera-work when Che visits New York.

48863,"I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school, and it left me with a stunning impression. Here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own. Her story, which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. As part of your study, we watched the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three adaptation of the story, and it blew me away. The mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to Bronte's original text and the essence of the story, but the factors who portrayed the characters were just great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, by the name of Rochester) captured brilliantly the essence of their characters. I cannot imagine anyone else in their roles. (The other performances of Rochester in other versions such as the two thousand and six version black the passion, energy, and tenderness needed to portray Rochester accurately. I say that Timothy Dalton comes out on top because the possesses all these characteristics in this portrayal of Rochester. Zelah Clarke not only looks like Jane Eyre, but she captures Jane's quiet, but firm and passionate nature brilliantly. She holds in her emotions, like the Jane of the book, at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in Jane's passionate scenes. The chemistry that Clarke and Dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to Jane and Rochester's devoted relationship.) As well, the supporting factors also fit their roles perfectly, and the sets fit the Gothic nature of the story. I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale. If you have not read the book before, then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.",positive

24496,"******WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**************So who are these ""Mystery Men?"" Simply put, the Mystery Men are a group of sub-Heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves this wife and kids at home while the cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with this extraordinary and unique Shovel-fighting style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villains by night, if this from in't keeping him busy with the latest snooping. Mr. Furious works in a junk yard to learn this pay, then takes out this frustration on this friends at night, tossing will-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, So What?). Ben Stiller breathes such life into this character, you can't help but love him. These three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about. becoming real Super Heroes. Obviously, it could happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all. a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on this costume to stop an extra bullet for two. Greg Kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture this fans attention in the twilight of this career. To bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again, C. A. frees Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by Goeffrey Rush. This lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp Champion City into a reflection of this own insanities. and ends up capturing C. A. within hours of this release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help. Recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who CLAIMS to turn invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is looking at him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown to be table to cut guns in half with this mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise. This film really is a across-genre romp. Anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a closing battle. This is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up. But at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. Both at once. While not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of D. C. Comic's short-lived Inferior Five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. It offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. If the Big Guy with the S were flying around New York City, you'd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis. Sure, the Shoveller fights pretty well, and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world. But does that make them genuine super-heroes? Only in their minds. This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. Inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics. One-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. Particularly marvellous is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball/father. Yet, it in't a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter for eternally memorable jokes. It mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it. What really makes Mystery Men a good film, in the send, is that it is very engaging. The weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that greeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp. Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani comes off as bored and directionless as Mr. Furious' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as this conscience. Tom Waits seems somehow confused by this own lines as the mad inventor Dr. Heller, although this opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. And the villains are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). The cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well. Yet, overall, this film is incredible. You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.eight/ten in my opinion.",positive

As a middle-aged ticket seller, Greg Kinnear tried to win the interest of fans on the evening of this career. In order to recapture the ""extra magic"" that might win the contract again, C. A. bring out Casanova Frankenstein, the most dangerous WAAAAAY played by Goeffrey Rush to cool off. This crazy genius has made a ""psychofrakulator"" who has challenged Champion City to prove this madness. And I finally caught C. A. within a few hours of this release. Only the mysterious people are left to abandon Frankenstein's evil plan, but with someone as loyal as a disco boy to protect Frankenstein, the trio needs a little help. At the start of the grind, after a painful grinding party, the team sat down with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who had real talent in this team. An unidentified boy (Kel Mitchell), says the is invisible when no one is looking at him; duck (Paul Rubens), the amazing and powerful deception given by noisy gypsies; and the unused Sphinx as (Wes Studi), the was shown to be table to cut a gun in the middle of this idea, and then spent most of the rest of the movie discussing silly tricks and acting very wisely. This movie is really playing. Anyone who wants to split a movie into a clean slate is fighting a final fight. This is a spoof / spoof of the superhero genre — from Burton's pseudo-updated endless pseudo set (sometimes decorated with spoof accessories) to comedy costumes, a kind of comic book that is well publicized. But at the same time, this is also an important movie. Two at the same time. While not a special one in itself (for example, the film shows the short-lived DC Comic ""Five Bad"" in some ways), it's something new on the big screen. It provides a world of comic book where you have to stop believing and accepting, and then join the unstoppable people who want to — we all know that if the heroes are really powerful, then these people are also real. If there's a big S man walking around New York City, you'll see six stories about idiots in regular underwear. Of course, Shoveler's fight is pretty good, and Blue Raja can throw forks right - all over the world. But does this make them heroes? Only in their hearts. The movie is also a comedy, though black. This is inevitable when you try to show the folly of patents. When a comedy genius on stage throws multiple play clips, one plane. The most interesting is the conversation between Jane Garofalo and her soccer / dad. However, for jokes that will never be remembered, it is not a joke. It includes drama, discovery and love, but never set foot in it. The thing that makes ""The Amazing Man"" a good movie is that it's very interesting. Weak / bad people will eventually be judged, and they will pass away and become great heroes; justice has been done; the movie ends with a Greek scene (as a real possibility in the world of flying flying and hidden glasses). If the audience stops trying to write this movie, then this movie could be an amazing game. Of course no movie is perfect. Although Claire Forlani plays an important role as a conscience, she is bored and confused as Mr. Furious's lover. Tom Waits seems confused by this lines as a crazy composer. Dr. Heller, although the opening for retired ladies in a nursing home is worth a look. The villain is always a running dog with a gun (this is mentioned in the movie). Photography is in the middle (just as it happens in a normal nickname, so it sounds), music sometimes overpowers the beauty of places, and unique effects have never been well combined in some places. However, overall, this movie is amazing. You’ll have to be a fan of the superhero and kind of superhero to appreciate this movie, but it’s a fun game and a great way to kill a few hours and relax the mind.

This movie is really a romp of any kind. Anyone who wants to split pigeon films into smaller parts is fighting a war of leadership. It’s a parody of the superhero genre-from pseudo-Burton altered to endless (sometimes decorated with lots of sprays) in comics, the comic-book genre will get your delivery. Good. But at the same time, it’s also a serious superhero flick. Both at once. While it’s not a unique concept in itself (for example, this film in some ways reflects D. C. Comic’s short work on Inferior Five), it’s something completely new on the big screen. It offers a world of comedy-comedy that has to stop infidelity to accept it anyway, and then discard the inevitable lust-we all know, if heroes are real, then these people are not it will be true. If Big Guy S is flying around New York City, you’ll see half a dozen news stories about idiots in underwear constantly kicking their tails. Sure, the Shoveller fights well, and the Blue Raja throws a fork right - all over the world of heroism. But does this make real superheroes real? Just their minds. This film is a comedy, even if it is dark. Inevitably, when trying to point out the patent of the humorous nature of super-heroics. One-liners fly when comedians throw multiple pieces on stage. Janeane Garofalo’s conversations in the bowling valley are remarkable. However, this is not a joke more than a part-time joke that will always remember the joke. It combines dramatic proportions, discovery and love, but I haven’t fully embraced one. What really makes a great Mystery Men movie, is the posting, it should be fun. The good / weak men were eventually allowed and, in a moment of brilliance, really became great heroes; given justice; and the film ends with a real Greek scene (as far as possible in a world where bowling balls fly and mirrors are carefully hidden). If the viewer stops trying to label the movie, a movie could be a big romp. Of course, there is no perfect movie. Claire Forlani has emerged as lazy and unfocused as Mr. Furious in love, even though it plays an important role in this conscience. Tom Waits seems to be confused by this particular line as the crazy creator of Dr. Waiting. Heller, even the opening scene for retired women in home care is worth watching on its own. And the evil is never greater than the guns (bar where the film was made). Cinema is cheap and cluttered (as is the case with a regular comic book, so it can be forgiven), music sometimes obscures the visuals, and the special effects don’t really mix with the rest. But overall, this film is surprising. You may be a fan of comedy and the kind of hero who would really appreciate this film, but it’s a fun and a great way to kill some time and let your mind relax.

Odder still is there is an factor in the cast who has the requisite power to play Castro--Joaquim de Almeida, but the's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half.

Here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own. Her story, which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. As part of your study, we watched the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three adaptation of the story, and it blew me away. The mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to Bronte's original text and the essence of the story, but the factors who portrayed the characters were just great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, by the name of Rochester) captured brilliantly the essence of their characters. I cannot imagine anyone else in their roles. (The other performances of Rochester in other versions such as the two thousand and six version black the passion, energy, and tenderness needed to portray Rochester accurately. I say that Timothy Dalton comes out on top because the possesses all these characteristics in this portrayal of Rochester. Zelah Clarke not only looks like Jane Eyre, but she captures Jane's quiet, but firm and passionate nature brilliantly. She holds in her emotions, like the Jane of the book, at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in Jane's passionate scenes. The chemistry that Clarke and Dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to Jane and Rochester's devoted relationship.) As well, the supporting factors also fit their roles perfectly, and the sets fit the Gothic nature of the story. I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale. If you have not read the book before, then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.",positive
48863,"I read Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school and it left me very impressed. This is a beautiful novel about a woman who struggled to find love and acceptance in the dark days of Victorian England. This young woman is Jane Eyre, a poor and simple character, with a strong passion and passion. Bronte told her story through Jane's eyes, sad and encouraging. As part of your study, we watched one, nine hundred and eighty-three stories edited, much to my surprise. These miniseries not only try to be honest in the context of Bronte’s first work and story, but also an important point to show. Zella Clark (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's boyfriend, Rochester) both handled their roles well. I can’t imagine someone else playing their part. (Some of Rochester's works in other editions, such as the two thousand and sixty-six edition, black show exactly the passion, power, and kindness that Rochester wants. I say Timothy Dalton is superior because in this picture. With all these qualities Rochester. Jane's calm, yet determined and passionate expression. It is reflected in Jane's love affair. Clark and Dalton in their performances. If you have never read this book before, then you can use this work as a reliable introduction to this wonderful story.",positive

49536,Some bad reviews there for this and I understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than most. I thought that this worked in a way because afterwards I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success in't it? I would say there is just the right level of sleaze there to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven. David Hess is only in this briefly so don not get your hopes up to much if you like Last House. Other than that - worth a look.,positive
