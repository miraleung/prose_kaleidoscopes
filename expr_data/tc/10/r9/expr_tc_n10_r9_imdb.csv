247,"This movie was so bad it was funny! For awhile there I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la ""For Your Consideration""). The ""cliffhanger"" scene at the send had me laughing until my insides hurt. The script was dreadful enough, but coupled with Sean Young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fake shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing got made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star factors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions.",negative

3207,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Unorthodox journalist Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) flits away this time winding up the local constabulary and trying to romance a member of police personnel. But everything changes when the landlady of the Thames side pub the frequents is found murdered and a transcript of an unpublished novel cum confession by legendary writer Charles Dickens is found. As the digs deeper into both mysteries, the is plunged further into mystery and danger than the bargained for. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight, former footballer Vinnie Jones shot out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise with this gangster cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Okay, no one was blown away by this acting ability, but this presence as a hard man looked set to ensure a decent career as a movie tough guy. But it all proved to be a one hit wonder, and all the really achieved after this was supporting role status amongst far more acclaimed factors in films like Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish, before descending into the realm of straight to DVD hell, the latest being this muddled and labourous thriller, which might have been okay had the not taken other acclaimed and promising new talent stars like Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith along with him. What caused him to fall from the dizzying heights of success so quickly (apart from maybe being a one trick pony) is anyone's guess (a dodgy personal life being a possible guess) but there the is. A script as far fetched and incomprehensible as this would have been a task in anyone's hand, but with a miscast looking Jones in the lead, it's even more of a task to fathom. Jacobi's juxtaposing roles as a former these tramp and Dickens himself talking directly to the camera through-out are obviously hints building up to something and the script is predictable in other areas too. Add to this cheap looking production values through out and debut director (also writer) Brendan Foley has made a bad first impression. What exactly did I expect with something that came free with The Daily Mail? *",negative

Jacoby's role as the previous tramp and Dickens himself spoke directly to the camera during the whole process, which clearly suggested the development of certain elements, and the text is also described in other ways.

6584,"This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring this `vision' to the screen. He has done it with `Batman', `Sleepy Hollow' and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo). Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership. The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. During the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's America was struggling to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms. It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal. In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify this intelligence to a species the considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious. Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties. This is Apes for Dummies. It is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. The `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `I know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent. The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding (though I continue to dislike this dark look). However, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script. The story has been reduced to a monster movie. The humans band together behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous Apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoat (notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari). The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality. The acting is mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a fine factor who is simply miscast in this role. Walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong. This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant factor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable. She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a across between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager. Then there is Tim Roth. His is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin. Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade. He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time. Additionally, this physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists. This film is a great disappointment. It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. I rated it a three/ten. From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a nine/ten. However the story is an insult to the original franchise. It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius the is. Of course it's true, but it would be great if the used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.",negative
6584,"This movie is another film in which director Tim Burton tried to use a common theme to bring this ""idea"" to the screen. Completed ""Batman"", ""Sleepy Valley"" and current work. This is not a problem. The only thing that is consistent with the original version is that it has a talking monkey (Charleton Heston made a cameo). Burton rearranged the whole story and played it for today's popular levels. The first Monkey planet was the product of that era. In one thousand, nine hundred and sixty, the United States worked hard to redefine its culture. It was a time of turmoil for rethinking and rethinking local customs. During human rights, historically marginalized groups demand equal treatment. In this context, POTA is a metaphor, reflecting the chaos of philosophy that plagued the audience at the time. POTA is a very clever movie. By allowing white people to express this wisdom in a way that is considered inferior, it poses a problem and subtly puts American society under pressure. Dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charlton Heston), Drs. Cornelius (Rody McDowell) and Dr. Zilla (Jim Hunter) are thought-provoking, intelligent, and humorous. Burton's version is a modern product, just as POTA is a one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys product. This is a stupid monkey. It is absurd and irrelevant, replacing intellectual dialogue with politically correct adjectives, focusing more on form than objects. The ""Unexpected"" ending is not fully adjusted, and there is no contribution to the movie without suspicion of stopping further progress. While the send of the original POTA combines all of the content into a powerful space, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, saying, ""I know what you don't know, you'll have to wait for something to come"" from a technical point of view, like the Burton movie, the movie is outstanding. The shading is good, and Burton’s photography is great (though I still don’t like this darkness). However, thirty-three years of progress in prosthetic makeup cannot do this without the insult. This story has been narrowed down to a monster movie. The people rallied behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) and fought fearsome monkeys with the help and influence of other divers (especially Ali, played by Helena Bonham Carter). The show shows a simple and easy way, it is very violent, very good for the fast food mindset today. Acting skills are not equal. Mark Wahlberg is a good thing, the played this mistake by mistake. Wahlberg is very good at playing black, depressed, bullied but strong characters. The section is looking for an inspiring hero, a character who is not on the Wahlberg register. Helena Bonham Carter (Helena Bonham Carter) is an outstanding factor, her character is far below her ability, so this breakup is a funny one. He desperately wanted to do something about this weak man, but this description was like a contradiction between a peaceful university overseer and a sick youth. Then there was Tim Rose. He is an factor who has delivered with this hand a movie to complete destruction. Like the wicked General Thad, Rose is very hateful. He created one of the worst atrocities in my memory. In addition, this type of body movement is the most advanced, making chimpanzees the perfect combination, so that people almost believe in the existence of this type. This movie is very disappointing. This is a dignified pleasure, if you look at your mind at the door. I gave it three points / ten. From an artistic point of view, it’s much better than that, maybe nine/ten. However, this story is an insult to the first franchise. This is just another Burton's attempt to elevate himself, using a common theme to draw an audience to the box office, so that more people can see what this genius is all about. Yes this is true, but it would be good for them to use this talent to make more movies instead of sensible paps that are easy to use in bulk.",negative
6584,"Although the original POTA ends up combining all the themes in a dynamic space, Burton's ending is simply ridiculous to the audience, saying: ""I know what you don't know, and you'll have to wait for some other way to be announced.

Language between Colonel Taylor (Charlton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Rody McDowell) and Dr. Zilla (Jim Hunter) In addition, this kind of body movement is the most advanced, so that the chimpanzee fits perfectly, so that people believe in almost the existence of this species.

11609,"""Eh-heh meh-heh they, dude - look at these aliens. They're like - biting the humans and stuff! Eh-heh meh-heh meh-heh"" This must rank amongst the worst movies of all time. It's butter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain. Sure, you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but it's easy to tell who these sell-outs are. Their reviews are TOO good. To give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some B-movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review! Calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shills. But enough of that. This movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being SO bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh at. The old Japanese sixty's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. At least in those sixty's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked. Or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships, how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved UPWARDS out of the back. Those movies made fun of how BAD they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) seems to actually think of itself as a GOOD movie - which makes it incredibly absurd. The effects were awful by today's standards. Beyond awful. However not quite as bad as the sixty's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal. The plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as I've never seen, made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect. I won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one; it just would't be fair to this pitiable plot (plus it would take to long to even get started). Most of the acting was awful; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one.

But enough is enough. This movie has all the bad things that will happen in a movie, but it's not so bad that it's funny to laugh at. Old Japanese movies of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys have features that are lacking in this movie. At least in this sixty’s film, you can laugh at how ugly a rubber monster suit looks. Or you may laugh at the sight of a spacecraft, the way the model hangs on a rope, and the way flames bend upward from the back. Those movies make fun of how bad they are. Alien Express (also known as Dead Rail) seems to be taking a good movie - which makes it very stupid. By today's standards, this effect is alarming. Outside is terrible.

I got to say this is one of this good leading roles. However I do believe this role in Vanilla Sky was better acted.

18828,"When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel turned film, I was intrigued. Being a fan of the book, I assumed she'd be playing Tony, Roz, for Charis, but more so, I was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head-y, almost psychological (but not psychological thriller) novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who than't read the novel, and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had. The book is a complex reflection of society, women, and modern life, and I was interested to see how they used the three different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film. What they actually did was a crime. The biggest error and confusing issue is: Why would Oxygen, a network that advertises as being for women, take an amazing book about how complex, wonderful, and terrible women are and can be, and change the protagonist from three women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story? It seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask Roz, Tony, and Charis about how they knew Zenia and in doing that, they brushed through bulk of the book. In doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it, aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with. In the film, these women karen't people, they are characters. In the book Zenia does fake her death, but the book mentions it to get this point across, while the film wastes thirty-forty-five minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use. They tried to make this complex book an episode of Law and Order for CSI. It turns out that Mary Louise Parker played Zenia, which was SO wrong. Zenia is a Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, for maybe even a Scarlett Johnasson type. She is a woman men can't not adore, and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by, but in a ""keep your enemies closer"" kind of way. And once she gets closer, she seems totally genuine and trust worthy, despite your better judgment. She's the kind of woman who, even when she closes, she wins: she's always still beautiful, still rich, and there are always still people out there who don't know her game. In the film, Zenia did't take Charis's man (the blonde American draft dodger who was using Charis in the first place. ) but instead took August and tried to become her legal guardian (and apparently came back to be her Lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies). And Zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with August, but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed. It's was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book, but I think had I not read the book, I would have spent the whole movie confused, if I had bothered to stick with it at all. And Roz's husband was dead before Zenia came in to the picture (which was weird since Zenia took Roz's business AND home life in the book, which is why Roz hated her so much) and she and Zenia had conspired to kill Roz's husband years and years back. And according to the film Tony and West had been dating forever. even at the party where Zenia and West (in the book) had painted the whole place black and they made Tony seem like this totally with it (and evil, bitchy) person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it. Tony's character was SO wrong in this film. she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky, mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book. The film basically implied smart women are evil, beautiful women are evil, powerful women are evil, and women who teach yoga are off their rockers. They basically tried to make it so Zenia was't necessarily as awful as she was in the book, and then, in the send, the three women convince this former cop (who, of course in the process of researching this, meets Zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to send with them moving to Barbados for something ridiculous, which of course Zenia bails on) to hide Zenia's body (which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at, but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony, for they conspired together to do it. ) and then Zenia also managed to take all of Roz's money in the process. By the send of the film I was only half paying attention between commercials of/c it had aspirated so far out in space from what it could and should have been. If you karen't confused by this breakdown of the film, then maybe you would like it, because I have read the book and seen the movie, and from the movie alone I am ridiculously confused. It was terrible. I get that making a film out of that book is quite a task, but if you are going to take on the task, you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary, instead of creating some useless character to be your Alice in wonderland. Are there really no fluffier books that Oxygen could be making at least half decent TV movies of?",negative
18828,"When I saw Mary Louise Parker related to this film taken from an epic novel, I was very interested. As a fan of this book, I thought you were going to play Tony and Rhodes in Charis, but most importantly, I would like to know how they put together this very interesting, almost psychological (but not psychological) novel turned into an understandable movie. for those who do not read novels, which will at least satisfy those who have read novels. This book is a complex picture of society, women and modern life. I would like to know how they used the three narratives to tell the story in the film. What they were doing was committing a crime. The biggest mistake and confusing question is: why Oxygen, a network advertising women, can hold an amazing book about how tough, amazing and scary women are, and change the protagonist from three women to a stupid predecessor who has no real motivation to participate. the story? Apparently no matter who changed it, by using this person to directly ask Roz, Tony and Charis how they got to know Zenia, this seemed easy to resolve. In doing so, even though they confuse the story and cut off all the benefits of the characters in it, without leaving the audience without a reliable connection. In the film, these women are human, but not characters. Zenia made the impression of her death in the book, but it is mentioned in the book to convey this, and the film spent three hundred and forty-five minutes, focusing on the former police officer running around, useless. They are trying to make this difficult book a part of CSI Law and Order. Apparently Mary Louise Parker played Zenia, which was wrong. Zenia is Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, and possibly Scarlett Johnasson. You are a woman who can help but praise you, a woman who is attractive and threatened, but in a way that ""draws your enemies closer"". When you are close, even though your sentence is better, you seem more honest and trustworthy. She’s the kind of woman who can succeed even if she closes the door: she’s always beautiful, rich, and there are always people who don’t understand her game. In the movie, Zenia did not remove Charles' husband (using Charles's blonde American Dodgers first.) Instead, she took August to try to be her legal guardian (and apparently came back to be her sex lover) at a coffee shop). Zenia killed the chicken before she left in August, but because all the collections had been removed, there was no reason. It’s as if the script writer is holding the straw to please those who have read the book, but I think I have never read this book and would be confused throughout the movie, if I bothered to stick to it all. . And before Zenia appeared, Rhodes' husband was already dead (which is strange, because Zenia took Rhodes' life and family life in a book, that's why Rhodes hated her so much) and she and Zenia plotted to kill Rhodes' husband many years ago. According to the film Tony and West were dating. Even at the party, Zenia and West (in the book) paint all over the black area, making Tony look like this person (cruel, bitch), always because of him His wisdom is respected by everyone and loved for it. Tony's role is wrong in this movie. He seems a little crazy, like the plotter of this conspiracy, rather than a dull, regular teacher reading a book. This movie basically means that smart women are cruel, beautiful women are cruel, powerful women are cruel, and women who teach yoga are rock and roll. They basically tried to make Zenia not look as bad as in the book. Then, in the transfer, the three women confirmed to the former police officer (of course, in the process of investigating the matter, the met Zenia and fell in love with her.) They had to move to Barbados with them on bail) to hide Zenia's body (they found the body in the hotel where she was staying, but the film showed that one of the three women pushed her away. on the balcony because they had conspired to do so.) With the distribution of the movie, I have only considered half of the pc commercials, which are already far away from where they should be and should be in place. If you are not confused about the demolition of this movie, you will probably like it, because I have read this book, watched a movie, and I feel funny in the movie alone. it will be very frightening. I know making a movie with that book is hard work, but if you want to take on this job, you should first decide what content in the book is unnecessary, instead of creating other useless characters to be Alice Dreaming in Wonderland. Is there really no longer a flexible book that allows Oxygen to make at least half of a good TV movie?",negative

44350,"Some years ago, satellite channel U. K. Gold promoted repeats of 'Men Behaving Badly' with the hype: ""Here it is, the original flat-sharing sitcom!"". This was in fact untrue. 'Man About The House' was also a flat-sharing sitcom and iran from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three-seventy-six. It was the brainchild of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular sitcom 'Father Dear Father'. When it ended, they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times. In the first episode, Chrissy ( Paula Wilcox ) and Jo ( Sally Thomsett ) are tidying their Myddleton Terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath. He is Robin Tripp ( Richard O'Sullivan ), a Southampton cookery student of no fixed abode. While this clothes dry out, the puts on a ladies' dressing gown and prepares them a meal. They are so impressed by this culinary skills that they invite him to stay. But there must be no naughty business. So Robin has to pretend to be gay. On B. B. C.-two's 'I Love one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three', shown in two thousand, Julie Burchill claimed that 'House' showed her a way of life she envied. She was not alone. One of the most iconic ( for me, anyway ) images of 'seventy's British television was Sally Thomsett coming out of the London Underground carrying a parasol, and a 'blind' man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past. A man living with two girls was a risqueé subject for the time, but Mrs. Mary Whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar, it was innocent, good-natured fun. Mortimer and Cooke's scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it. Richard O'Sullivan was still playing 'Bingham' in I. T. V.'s 'Doctor In Charge' when this got started. In fact the second run of 'In Charge' overlapped with the first of 'House'. He was born to play the sex-mad Robin. Paula Wilcox's 'Chrissy' was more streetwise than 'Beryl', her character she played in 'The Lovers', while Sally Thomsett's 'Jo' was a lovable dizzy blonde. As time wore on, the became almost like an older brother to them. For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as the warring Ropers. George had lost interest in sex, but Mildred had not. They went on to their own show - the aptly titled 'George & Mildred'. The late Doug Fisher was good value as as Robin's wideboy friend Larry. He worked so well the was made into a regular. Within a year of its debut, there was the inevitable movie spin-off. I am not a big fan of the 'Man About The House' movie because I think it was stretched to fit the big screen. Most of its characters had never appeared in the series. The format was sold to America, where it became the long-running 'Three's Company' starring the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was far more suggestive than the British original, with Somers often seen in sexy clothing. After six seasons, 'House' ended with Chrissy marrying Robin's older brother Norman ( Norman Eshley ). Fans were devastated to see Robin failing to get the girl the loved, but there was some consolation in the fact that the too landed this own show - 'Robin's Nest'.",positive

It was the creation of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular sitcom ""Dear Father"". When it was over, they decided to do something more timely.

22739,"First: The recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax. Judging from the cover you'd think this was some kind of scandal movie about Kylie playing a character having sex, taking drugs and whatever. This is just a cheap market-scheme. She's barely in it and does neither of the things. The marketing there is unbelievable, and I'm surprised the filmmakers has't objected. The movie itself was to me a huge disappointment. It seemed like a Sunset Beach episode directed sloppy-handed by a teenage Quentin Tarantino. And that not meant as a compliment, mind you. I think the weakness of the movie first of all is the story. It seems to be about nothing. Just about cool teenagers stripping around living 'on the edge'. The characters themselves does have some personality though, but the movie does't use its potential. As said, there's no story of any substance there. It seems to elaborate too much on cool dialog and ends up looking like a colourful MTV had. It definitely has that feeling. Still though, I guess some people might enjoy it, but I'd say there's far better movies like this around.",negative

22779,"Sarafina was a fun movie, and some of the songs were really great. Sarafina was very entertaining. I don't normally like music things like this, but the singing was not flame like it looked like on the box. The movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the Soweto rioting of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six. It showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters. Because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience, and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government, who you can not sympathise with. The singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent. The clothing of the students in Sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from Soweto. They made the movie actually in Soweto, which is why it looks very accurate in many parts. All these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about apartheid. As viewers we must be critical of the way the history of Apartheid was presented. As I said before, you become sympathetic to the students - this makes it potentially less reliable and objective. Also, it changes some of the details from other accounts. In Sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students. The police and army were very aggressive at Soweto, but this is probably an exaggerated event. The police and army did shoot students, but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this. The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime. This is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students. The movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about apartheid. The teacher was arrested for being against the government, and the mum goes to work in a white persons house. But there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it for any details about the racist policies and laws. -By George S, Chris and Finlay",positive

This video is helpful in understanding history because it is an interesting view of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six Soweto riots. It shows you something from the students' point of view in chaos, and it shows you that they are real characters. This is because you have to see them as real characters, which makes you love them more as listeners and makes you more sympathetic to them, because they are completely victims of white supremacy and you have no sympathy for them. Student singing is correct, because we know in detail that students of violence were singing and dancing before they became violent. The Sarafina student's belongings are very similar to those shown in the Soweto photo. They actually made a movie in Soweto, which is why it seems so accurate in so many places. All of this makes the film more relevant to people who use it to understand racism. As observers, we need to criticize the way in which the history of apartheid is set. As I said before, you will empathize with the students — this can make it less credible and more meaningful. Additionally, it also walters other accounts for other accounts. In Sarafina, when police stormed their classroom and violently opened fire on students, the situation became tense. Police and the army are violent in Soweto, but this is likely to be an exaggeration. Police and the army shot the students, but there is no evidence that they entered the school this way and killed them. Fighting is more frequent on the streets, with robberies and crime. This can be done in a movie to make you more sympathetic to the students at school. If the movie has a different view of prejudice, it might be helpful. The teacher was arrested for sedition, and her mother went to work at a white man's house. But there is no information about the government, and no information about racist policies and laws. - George S, Chris and Finlay Because you have to treat them like real characters, which will make you love them more as listeners.

But, for its time, it's actually a very remarkable film. Much of this is because the prints were hand painted--making Annabelle appear red and other color as she does her amazing dance. I've actually seen two different versions--one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout. I think the red one depicted on the DVD ""The Great Train Robbery and Other Primary Works"" is the best of them. The dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance part.

44350,"Some years ago, satellite channel U. K. Gold promoted repeats of 'Men Behaving Badly' with the hype: ""Here it is, the original flat-sharing sitcom!"". This was in fact untrue. 'Man About The House' was also a flat-sharing sitcom and iran from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three-seventy-six. It was the brainchild of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular sitcom 'Father Dear Father'. When it ended, they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times. In the first episode, Chrissy ( Paula Wilcox ) and Jo ( Sally Thomsett ) are tidying their Myddleton Terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath. He is Robin Tripp ( Richard O'Sullivan ), a Southampton cookery student of no fixed abode. While this clothes dry out, the puts on a ladies' dressing gown and prepares them a meal. They are so impressed by this culinary skills that they invite him to stay. But there must be no naughty business. So Robin has to pretend to be gay. On B. B. C.-two's 'I Love one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three', shown in two thousand, Julie Burchill claimed that 'House' showed her a way of life she envied. She was not alone. One of the most iconic ( for me, anyway ) images of 'seventy's British television was Sally Thomsett coming out of the London Underground carrying a parasol, and a 'blind' man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past. A man living with two girls was a risqueé subject for the time, but Mrs. Mary Whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar, it was innocent, good-natured fun. Mortimer and Cooke's scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it. Richard O'Sullivan was still playing 'Bingham' in I. T. V.'s 'Doctor In Charge' when this got started. In fact the second run of 'In Charge' overlapped with the first of 'House'. He was born to play the sex-mad Robin. Paula Wilcox's 'Chrissy' was more streetwise than 'Beryl', her character she played in 'The Lovers', while Sally Thomsett's 'Jo' was a lovable dizzy blonde. As time wore on, the became almost like an older brother to them. For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as the warring Ropers. George had lost interest in sex, but Mildred had not. They went on to their own show - the aptly titled 'George & Mildred'. The late Doug Fisher was good value as as Robin's wideboy friend Larry. He worked so well the was made into a regular. Within a year of its debut, there was the inevitable movie spin-off. I am not a big fan of the 'Man About The House' movie because I think it was stretched to fit the big screen. Most of its characters had never appeared in the series. The format was sold to America, where it became the long-running 'Three's Company' starring the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was far more suggestive than the British original, with Somers often seen in sexy clothing. After six seasons, 'House' ended with Chrissy marrying Robin's older brother Norman ( Norman Eshley ).
