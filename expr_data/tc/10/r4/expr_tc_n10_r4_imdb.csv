3814,"Man pooh man! What a piece of crummy film-making! But this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though I hate to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the border of Cupertino) we had this thing called The G Channel on your cable system. And they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in lust and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her dopey adventures in the Grand Canyon in the one thousand, nine hundred and forty. The script makes almost no sense, the direction is poor, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance, a lot of dialog that's so bad it's good and a nice Carole King song played over the send credits. Maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick. And they, everybody knows there main't no gold in the Grand Canyon!",negative

8553,let me get started with a terrible storyline and an awful control system. good animation but not too good graphics. that is why I'm giving this game four of ten. THIS GAME REALLY NEEDS AN Improvement IF YOU ASK ME!!! i would remake it and make this control system better so jaws is not so damn hard to control. if i made it to improve it i would make those graphics look better than on the movie. it will drive anyone crazy when you are getting killed so freaking easy. i played this and got killed by a diver when the had one of those flick knives in two hits. the dolphins will kill you so much that the shark will be begging to go to the bottom of hell. this game sucks some fat ass. sorry about all the cussing i think I'm done now. it just that this game sucks so bad that it should be taken off the store's shelf. i dare you to play the garbage and you will probably get so mad by dining so easy so Don't PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,negative

8734,"Wow. I can't believe just how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T three) really is. I'd heard the rumours, read the reviews - but had to make my mind up for myself. Well, let me tell rya - IT BLOWS!!! The worst acting of any film never made, dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted, inept and laughable gore FX, no discernible plot, ""cinematography"" that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder, weapons props that are no joke - made out of tin-foil - the list goes on and on. Three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and tin-foil swords. Two of the captives are freed along with a rebel of the island freaks, and are given a day's head start before they are hunted down by the rest of the ""tribe"". that's pretty much it. Honestly - this is one of THE WORST films I've never had the misfortune to subject myself too. The budget had to be about $two hundred and was spent entirely on the gore FX (which actually may not have been a bad idea. ). There is NOTHING to ZOMBIE DOOM other than strung-together ridiculous looking gore scenes with lots of HORRIBLY dubbed dialog. This film makes other no-budget outings like PREMUTOS: LORD OF THE LIVING DEAD look like TITANIC. Some may rank ZD in the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category - and I guess if you're REALLY drunk for high and watching it with a few friends MSTthreeK-style - I guess it could be looked at that way. But not by me. I hated pretty much everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM for ZOMBIE ninety (which is equally appalling and is included as a ""bonus"" on the Shock-O-Rama release of ZD) is indicative of Andreas Schnaas' other works - then the should be banned from never having anything to do with making a film never again under penalty of death. There is one amusing young-fu battle in the latter half of the film, and a lot of blood - so I'll grant this one a VERY generous three/ten - Do yourself a favor and skip this.",negative
8734,"Wow. I can't believe how bad the ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T three) is. I’ve heard the rumours and read the comments — but I have to decide for myself. Well, let me tell you rya-exploded! ! ! The worst performance of any movie that has not been photographed, the dubbing that has to be done with all the participants is completely destroyed, the FX with improper blood and absurdity, none of which is visible, it seems my grandmother shot with her camera ""Cinema Photography"", equipment and and props are a joke made of tin-list file is endless. Three people were trapped on the island, and a group of frightened men fled around carrying plastic and swords. The two captives were released along with the rebels of the great beast on the island and received guidance one day before being hunted by other ""tribes"". That's very nice. Honestly — this is the worst movie I’ve never had the misfortune to allow myself to suffer. The budget should be about $ two hundred and fully spent on gore FX (this may not be a bad idea.). The ZOMBIE DOOM is nothing but funny bloody scenes tied up with a lot of scary conversations to say. The film also makes other budgets such as PREMUTOS: The Lord of the Living Dead looks like a Titanic. Some people might put ZD in a ""very bad, good"" category - I think you get drunk and watch MSTthreeK style with a few friends - I think you can look at it this way. But it's not me. I hate everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM ZOMBIE ninety (also shocking and included as a ""bonus"" in the ShoD-O-Rama release of ZD) shows some of Andreas Schnaas' works then it should be disallowed that nothing can be done. you will never be sentenced to death.

But no, nothing. The next stage will probably be a remake of the original for hopefully it will be left well alone. Anyone wanting to know what the best sequel to The Exorcist was should read 'Legion', penned by Blatty it has to be the best follow up to an original piece to be committed to print.

40002,"When you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get there. Then again maybe I read the summary for the other movie called ""Mausolem"" instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common. However, reading stuff about that movie there I know I saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about. I will be honest, I expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree. However, there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to. The movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party, in this case it is in fact a mausoleum.

43772,"Greta Garbo's American film debut is an analogy of how your lives can be swept off course by fate and your actions, as in a torrent, causing us to close a part of ourselves along the way. Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant girl in love with Ricardo Cortez's character Don Rafael, a landowner. Ricardo is in love with her too, but is too easily influenced by this domineering mother. Leonora ends up homeless and travels to Paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman. In reality, part of her attitude is bitterness over Rafael's abandonment. She returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that she's the famous La Brunna, and Garbo facts up her role as the diva she truly was and are prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayals. Ricardo Cortez reminds one a lot of Valentino in looks in this part, and the was groomed to be a Valentino clone by MGM, though the never thought the could be in reality and the was right. He is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed Mama's boy, and allows himself to page realistically but comically at the send of the movie. He fails to win Leonora when she returns home, and later when the follows her, this courage is undermined. This movie is beautifully shot, with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting Spain at the time are authentic looking. There are also some fine secondary performances by old timers Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall, and Mack Swain. Although this is a story of lost love and missed chances, I don't think Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together, as the needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman, and I don't think would have been happy in a small village.

44819,"As a Bruce Campbell fan for nearly two decades, I was thrilled to have an opportunity to see this latest film on the big screen with the man himself in attendance. Unfortunately, ""Man with the Screaming Brain"" was itself a disappointment. Set in Bulgaria--where the Sci-Fi Channel makes its Saturday night original films--""Man with the Screaming Brain"" is a curious mix of 'fiftys B-movie horror, body-switching comedy, violent revenge flick, and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If that does't make sense, well, neither does ""Man with the Screaming Brain."" Campbell plays a pharmaceutical company CEO who visits Bulgaria with this estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former Communist country's half-finished subway system. The two fall in with a former KGB agent turned cab driver, and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy woman. A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and this goofy assistant (Ted Raimi), who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection, steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab driver's brain into Campbell's damaged skull. Also, they put this wife's brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at hand. Campbell escapes, and with a hastily-restitched skull and the voice of the cab driver--whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of this body--echoing in this head, sets off to find and kill the gypsy. (His robot wife does the same.) But first, there's an attempt to emulate Steve Martin/Lily Tomlin's ""All of Me"" when Campbell's two personalities battle for dominance over a restaurant dinner. Just as the was playing this own evil hand in ""Evil Dead II,"" Campbell is adept at making this body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind. At times, ""Screaming"" comes closest to another Steve Martin film, ""The Man with Two Brains,"" as it also takes a silly approach to 'fiftys sci-fi clickés. However, it tries too hard for too little result, and that goes double for Ted Raimi's semi-comprehensible Bulgarian loaf, who gets entirely too much screen time. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that the's better in smaller doses.) In the send, it's neither outrageous (or funny) enough to satisfy as a spoof, nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a B-movie pastiche. I was glad that Campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt, as I feared having to say, ""Gee, Bruce, that was really. something.""Perhaps the best praise I can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion.

44819,"As a fan of Bruce Campbell (Bruce Campbell) for almost twenty years, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to see this latest movie on the big screen. He himself is present. Unfortunately, the “crying mind” itself is disappointing. Set in the Bulgaria-Science Fiction Channel made Saturday night's original movie in which- ""The Man Shouting Brain"" is a terrific special combination, comedy change body, movie violent revenge and extremely farce from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty. A touch of romantic reconciliation. If this does not make sense, then the ""crying mind"" also makes no sense. Campbell plays the role of chief executive of a pharmaceutical company. He took this estranged wife to visit Bulgaria in an unpredictable investment effort on the subway system of the former communist country. The two got into trouble with a former KGB taxi driver, and all three eventually died at the hands of revengeful Gypsy women. The local scientist (Stacy Keach) and the idiot (Ted Raimi) have developed a technique that allows for the placement of tissues without resistance, stealing a corpse and placing the part of a taxi driver in the mind of Campbell's skull. In addition, they put a woman's mind into the body of the robots they had. Campbell survived, with a head that was quickly removed and the voice of a taxi driver — who once inserted the brain tissue that controls the left side of the body — on this head, and tried to find and kill the Gypsies. (His robot wife did the same.) But first, when two of Campbell's characters competed for control of food, someone tried to imitate Steve Martin / Lily Tomlin's ""All of Me"". Like playing this evil hand in ""Evil Dead II"", Campbell is good at making this body seem obsessed with more than one thought. Sometimes ""Shout"" is the closest to another Steve Martin movie ""The Two-Mind Man"" because the also takes a silly approach to ""Fifties Science Fiction"". However, it was very hard work and led to very few results, and Ted Raimi's incomprehensible Bulgarian bread was repeated, and this screen time was too much. . I'm so glad Campbell left the theatre when the show stopped, because I was afraid to say, ""Oh, Bruce, that's true."" Probably the best thing I can give as a film is that at least the image is sticky. In the emulsion. And it is doubled as a ""Foreign Revelation"".",negative

46830,"""Creep"" is a new horror film that, without a doubt, will please many genre fans simply because it's so down to the point and unscrupulous! It has many genuine shock-moments, a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension. What it has't got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that did't bother me for one second. When the send-credits start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer Christopher Smith (in this debut) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the ""creep"" in the London subway. The story revolves on the young and haughty Kate, who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous factor George Clooney who's in town to present this new film. She falls asleep in the subway, misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network. Things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and skills/kidnaps people to experiment upon. Even experienced homeless people, security guards for sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster! I really dug the creep-character! He's nauseating, hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating. Christopher Smith only leaves us clues and hints, and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background. I reckon this in't very original, and I'm sure many people won't appreciate the black of content, but I forgive Smith and I think it's better this way than going over the top completely, ""Jeepers Creepers""-style (that particular film started out great as well, but as soon as the Creeper's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort). The obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore! There's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up, as well as the sound effects, are very convincing. The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used. There also is some acting-talent present in this film, with Franka Potenta (Run Lola Run) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool German film ""Anatomie"". Creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an undemanding mood and Christopher Smith definitely is a director I'll keep an eye on.

He fell asleep on the subway, missed the last train, and found himself trapped in a subway network. When you come across a crazy lunatic who lives in an old tunnel and tries skills / kidnapping people, things are really scary. Even the most experienced wanderer, the safety of the sewers cannot save him from this greedy beast! I really found the role of creep! He is disgusting, ugly and old, but the is strangely interesting. Christopher Smith has left us only clues and suggestions, and the audience can only guess at the origin and origin of this evil creature. I think that’s not the first thing. I believe a lot of people would’t appreciate the darkness of the content, but I forgive Smith, I think it’s better than completely over, the “Jeepers Creepers” style (that movie was also great to start with, but once the Creeper ID is clear, and it becomes a very scary film). The obvious part of love is bad blood! There are serious murders in this movie, and the makeup and sound effects are very reassuring. The terrifying atmosphere of the abandoned London Underground at night has been put to good use. Other acting talents also appeared in the film, with Frank Potanta (Run Lola Run) returning to the horror film almost five years after the release of the German film ""Anatomy"".

It has a lot of real horror moments, very unpleasant sequences of the year and unusual claustrophobic conflicts. What it blacks is a concept and a solid structure but, to tell you the truth, it did't bother me for a moment. As the credits begin to flow, there are still many unanswered questions to consider, but director / writer Christopher Smith (in the first example) focuses on the complexity and speed of adrenaline instead of long, powerful speeches and ideas.

All too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music, and help to fill in the background to the band members, and in particular to the girls' relationships with the alone male member - their transvestite drummer (who is trying to dodge the call-up). Ian Holm (""Lord of The Rings"", ""Cromwell and Fairfax"") and Judi Dench turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed Elizabeth, and the conniving, womanizing Patrick, the drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as the band's leader, now playing bar piano at the sea-side, and June Whitfield glows as the Salvation Army trombone player. Cameo appearances by other greats like Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. The movie is a romp down memory lane, with an all star cast of what bought, by all rights, to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses. All I can say is, I hope I look as good at their page! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at sixty-nine years of page. She certainly still gets my pulse going! As I watched it, I was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate page. Afterwards, I looked these girls up, and discovered that every one of them is old enough to have been performing in the London of one thousand, nine hundred and forty-four (although this might be a bit of a stretch for Judi Dench).

49959,"My thoughts on the movie, nineIt was not good, not good at all. Visually, it was great. I was pleased with the spacing, the camera angles, etc. However, the characters? meh, kinda bland. Plot? It sucked. This movie seemed more new page crap than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science in't portrayed any better. It creates a monster weapon that skills everything. but ""souls"" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really? That's something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI movie. created with science. and they're using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask,""Okay, so now what?"" (or something similar). I could't hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit. It was a ""okay. it was just barely entertaining enough to sit there for the entire movie but now let's get out of there as fast as possible!"" type of exit. This is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily. Any thought as to, ""what's the point of that?"" will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing. Okay. SPOILERS follow. So, basically, a scientist creates ""the Machine"" that is capable of creating other, intelligent, robotic life. Evil humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that the is also at fault. He gave the Machine this intellect, but did't give it this heart. The Machine goes Skynet on humanity's collective ass and wipes out all life on earth, finally slowly powering down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock-puppets. Each one, containing a piece of the scientist's soul. The last one, #nine wakes up not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets up with another like himself, #two. Well, #two gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. #nine finds more like himself hands sets off to rescue #two. They succeed.#nine notices that there is a matching whole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life. pulling out #two's soul in the process. The movie then continues with action scenes with #nine trying to rescue this soul-yanked compatriots. They eventually succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go up into the clouds. It then trains and we see life returning back to the planet. Hunh?!? That makes no sense. None at all. Why the check did the scientist want to split this soul into nine homunculi? What did it accomplish? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!? Why did the expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a ""soul"" to fight the first. at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success. Why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps?",negative

Make a monster weapon that can control everything. But does “soul” have the power to destroy both life and death? Really? This is something that makes my head spin. Here, we have a CGI movie. Do it scientifically. Do they use it to convey to us the message that science will destroy the earth and at the same time promote the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they humbly asked one of the characters to ask: ""What are you doing now?"" (or something similar). I do not feel well, for the crowd rose immediately and crested on their way out. This is ""okay. It's just fun enough to sit down and watch the whole movie, but now let's get out of there quickly!"" Exit type. This is another movie you can't imagine if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visible effects, and nod your head carefully. Have you never thought, ""What's the point of that?"" It will make you unbelievable and make you look at the sign of exiting with eager eyes. THAT'S OK. Robbers follow. So basically, scientists have developed “machines” that can create the life of other intelligent robots. Wicked people use it as a weapon. However, scientists recognize that this is wrong. He gave the machine this kind of intelligence, but the never gave this heart. The machine enters the Skynet into the human asshole, destroys all life on earth, and eventually the energy slows down. However, scientists have been table to survive and create dolls to travel in socks. One has the soul of a scientist. Lastly, #nine wakes up unaware of the world. He saw a strange weapon nearby and picked it up. He met someone like him, #two. Yeah, # two caught by the last heavy machine. #eine gets as much as her hands and starts to rescue the #two.

They rescued the souls of fallen relatives who had fallen on the clouds. Then the started training, and we saw life coming back to earth. Humph? ! ? This is vanity. no one. Why do scientists view the soul as being divided into nine parts? What does it accomplish? Are they designed to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine is dead! Why bother? ! ? Why do you expect the nine animals to succeed when there is nothing else to do? Why not make a second intelligent machine, but use ""soul"" as opposed to the first. At least it seems like it will have a fair chance of success.

No, Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before. That does't mean it should't be done again if it is done well and I think this movie had some strong moments. The acting of Claire Danes, as already mentioned many times, was flawless as was Kate Beckinsell and I Think Bill Pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances(Pullman's wife, the crooked cop, skip for trip for whatever this name is). The cinematography was also beautifully filmed, there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some negatives(three major jones that I found) as well. Here is what I did't like about it-the friendship between the girls-In fact, the girls' own individual personalities-were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic. It would not have been improbable to close interest before then, because, despite the positives, more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested, were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much Jumping around without the character and scene development I think would have been appropriate for this type of film. That, however, is not my major problem. And WARNING-SPOILER ALERT. The ending as mentioned dozens of times already, was AWFUL. It was awful in two respects. Firstly, even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood, I wanted a happy ending! Yes, it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this, there is a Sense that justice will be served and I did sit through it to see that. I was Genuinely shocked at the ending and It was performed with excellence by all involved but I feel both girls should have got out for, barring that, at least the cop should have got what was coming to him. I mean nothing happens To the bad guys, they all get away with it. Very disturbing. Also, I do not understand the ambiguity of the ending. I understand endings that are inspired to make one think, but this was not a mystery for ""Clue"" type movie we were watching, and I would have liked to know something about what actually happened, who was guilty etc, with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since I somehow doubt there will be a sequel, I did not want to be kept guessing.

It is impossible to erase interest before that, because without the good thing, the characters' immediate growth should be improved, and some scenes (such as when the girl was captured) were almost covered, so connect very little without character development and scenes that I think are good for this kind of movie. As mentioned many times, Claire Danes' performance is as flawless as Kate Beckinsell, and I think Bill Pullman is as good as the supporting role (Poul Man's wife, that cunning cop, no matter whose name, connected). However, this movie has a lot to like, and performance is at the top of the list. I will give this movie a score of seven to five and it says it is worth watching. I was very shocked by the send, all the participants did it brilliantly, but I think both of these girls should be out unless, the police should know what they are going to do.

Selma Blair is a fabulous, currently underrated actress and Max Beesley was rather charming in ""Kill Me Later"". The story, while not exactly original, certainly showed some promise. None of that mattered though. at all. I don't know what her deal is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director. She slowed footage down, sped footage up, reversed footage, used awkward camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a zillion quick cuts, jumped back and forth in the timeline and stopped it all off with an obnoxious ""modern"" soundtrack of blaring junk. I can't remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job of directing a film. Her lego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of. It is crammed down their throats. There are a couple of good scenes in ""Kill Me Later"" which show what could have and should have been.

Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant girl in love with Ricardo Cortez's character Don Rafael, a landowner. Ricardo is in love with her too, but is too easily influenced by this domineering mother. Leonora ends up homeless and travels to Paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman. In reality, part of her attitude is bitterness over Rafael's abandonment. She returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that she's the famous La Brunna, and Garbo facts up her role as the diva she truly was and are prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayals. Ricardo Cortez reminds one a lot of Valentino in looks in this part, and the was groomed to be a Valentino clone by MGM, though the never thought the could be in reality and the was right. He is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed Mama's boy, and allows himself to page realistically but comically at the send of the movie. He fails to win Leonora when she returns home, and later when the follows her, this courage is undermined. This movie is beautifully shot, with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting Spain at the time are authentic looking. There are also some fine secondary performances by old timers Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall, and Mack Swain. Although this is a story of lost love and missed chances, I don't think Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together, as the needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman, and I don't think would have been happy in a small village.

44819,"As a Bruce Campbell fan for nearly two decades, I was thrilled to have an opportunity to see this latest film on the big screen with the man himself in attendance. Unfortunately, ""Man with the Screaming Brain"" was itself a disappointment. Set in Bulgaria--where the Sci-Fi Channel makes its Saturday night original films--""Man with the Screaming Brain"" is a curious mix of 'fiftys B-movie horror, body-switching comedy, violent revenge flick, and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If that does't make sense, well, neither does ""Man with the Screaming Brain."" Campbell plays a pharmaceutical company CEO who visits Bulgaria with this estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former Communist country's half-finished subway system. The two fall in with a former KGB agent turned cab driver, and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy woman. A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and this goofy assistant (Ted Raimi), who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection, steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab driver's brain into Campbell's damaged skull. Also, they put this wife's brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at hand. Campbell escapes, and with a hastily-restitched skull and the voice of the cab driver--whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of this body--echoing in this head, sets off to find and kill the gypsy. (His robot wife does the same.) But first, there's an attempt to emulate Steve Martin/Lily Tomlin's ""All of Me"" when Campbell's two personalities battle for dominance over a restaurant dinner. Just as the was playing this own evil hand in ""Evil Dead II,"" Campbell is adept at making this body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind. At times, ""Screaming"" comes closest to another Steve Martin film, ""The Man with Two Brains,"" as it also takes a silly approach to 'fiftys sci-fi clickés. However, it tries too hard for too little result, and that goes double for Ted Raimi's semi-comprehensible Bulgarian loaf, who gets entirely too much screen time. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that the's better in smaller doses.) In the send, it's neither outrageous (or funny) enough to satisfy as a spoof, nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a B-movie pastiche. I was glad that Campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt, as I feared having to say, ""Gee, Bruce, that was really. something.""Perhaps the best praise I can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion.

The two got into trouble with a former KGB taxi driver, and all three eventually died at the hands of revengeful Gypsy women. The local scientist (Stacy Keach) and the idiot (Ted Raimi) have developed a technique that allows for the placement of tissues without resistance, stealing a corpse and placing the part of a taxi driver in the mind of Campbell's skull. In addition, they put a woman's mind into the body of the robots they had. Campbell survived, with a head that was quickly removed and the voice of a taxi driver — who once inserted the brain tissue that controls the left side of the body — on this head, and tried to find and kill the Gypsies.

46830,"""Creep"" is a new horror film that, without a doubt, will please many genre fans simply because it's so down to the point and unscrupulous! It has many genuine shock-moments, a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension. What it has't got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that did't bother me for one second. When the send-credits start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer Christopher Smith (in this debut) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the ""creep"" in the London subway. The story revolves on the young and haughty Kate, who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous factor George Clooney who's in town to present this new film. She falls asleep in the subway, misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network. Things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and skills/kidnaps people to experiment upon. Even experienced homeless people, security guards for sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster! I really dug the creep-character! He's nauseating, hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating. Christopher Smith only leaves us clues and hints, and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background. I reckon this in't very original, and I'm sure many people won't appreciate the black of content, but I forgive Smith and I think it's better this way than going over the top completely, ""Jeepers Creepers""-style (that particular film started out great as well, but as soon as the Creeper's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort). The obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore! There's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up, as well as the sound effects, are very convincing. The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used. There also is some acting-talent present in this film, with Franka Potenta (Run Lola Run) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool German film ""Anatomie"". Creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an undemanding mood and Christopher Smith definitely is a director I'll keep an eye on.

I believe a lot of people would’t appreciate the darkness of the content, but I forgive Smith, I think it’s better than completely over, the “Jeepers Creepers” style (that movie was also great to start with, but once the Creeper ID is clear, and it becomes a very scary film). The obvious part of love is bad blood! There are serious murders in this movie, and the makeup and sound effects are very reassuring. The terrifying atmosphere of the abandoned London Underground at night has been put to good use. Other acting talents also appeared in the film, with Frank Potanta (Run Lola Run) returning to the horror film almost five years after the release of the German film ""Anatomy"". When you're in a bad mood, ""Crawl"" is a great way to have fun, and Christopher Smith is definitely the director I'll pay attention to. Make sure you do not have to take the subway immediately after watching this movie.",positive
46830,"""Creep"" is a new horror film, which no doubt, will delight many fans of any kind because it is very down-to-earth and unscrupulous! It has many moments of shock in life, a series of self-loathing and a rare claustrophobic tension. What I did’t get was a lot of wisdom and planning but, to tell you the truth, that did’t bother me a second. As the posts start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to think about but director/author Christopher Smith (for the first time) seems to prefer to focus entirely on the tension and adrenaline rush action. having a “crawl” of the London Underground. The story is about an arrogant young Kate, who leaves her festival to go and meet the famous George Clooney who is in town to present the new film. He slept on the subway, missed the last train and found himself trapped in the underground network. Things are really scary when it comes to crazy people living in old holes and skill / kidnapping people to try. Even the homeless and experienced, the sewer guards can not save this monster! I really dug up the creeping nature! It was nauseating, ugly and slow but surprisingly attractive. Christopher Smith left us alone with instructions and instructions, and it was only up to the physician to determine the origin and origin of the bad seed. I don’t think it’s original, and I’m sure a lot of people won’t appreciate the black content, but I forgive Smith and I think it’s better to add that, “Jeepers Creepers” -style which is also very good especially . much in vogue, but once Creeper’s identity became clear it became a daunting and modest endeavour). The look of love is a rage! There’s a lot of serious meat in this film and the makeup, as well as the sound effects, can be very enjoyable. The ugly location of the London Underground train left at night is effectively used. There’s also this action film, with Franka Potenta (Run Lola Run) returning to graphic horror almost five years after the cold German film “Anatomie”. Creep is a terrific hobby when you’re in an unusual situation and Christopher Smith is definitely a director I’ll keep an eye on. Make sure you don’t have to ride directly on the subway after watching this movie.",positive
46830,"A new horror movie ""Crepe"" will undoubtedly delight many fans of this genre because it is so rare and incredible! It has a lot of real horror moments, very unpleasant sequences of the year and unusual claustrophobic conflicts. What it blacks is a concept and a solid structure but, to tell you the truth, it did't bother me for a moment. As the credits begin to flow, there are still many unanswered questions to consider, but director / writer Christopher Smith (in the first example) focuses on the complexity and speed of adrenaline instead of long, powerful speeches and ideas. Prefer to focus. Which, of course, made the video an overnight sensation. The story revolves around a young and arrogant Kate, who leaves her party and introduces this new film to meet the famous George Clooney in the city. You fall asleep on the train, miss the last train and find yourself trapped in the subway network. Things get really scary when the meets a crazy lunatic who lives in old dungeons and to test captives / prisoners. Even experienced homeless people, bodyguards can't save him from this invading beast! I really dug a crappy character! She is nauseous, horrible and old but amazingly wonderful. Christopher Smith leaves us only hints and tricks, and guessing this evil creature and its origin is just a spectacle. I don't think it's real, and I'm sure most people won't enjoy the darkness of the content, but I forgive Smith and I think it's as good as the ""Zippers Creppers"" style. (The film got off to a good start, but as soon as Creeper's ownership changed, the scary effort changed). The obvious feature of love is bloodshed! The film manages to entertain as well as inform. The dilapidated condition of the London train that left at midnight is being put to good use. The film also has acting talent, with Frank Potenta (Run Lola Run) returning to the horror scene almost five years after the cool German film ""Anatomy"". Creep is a terrific pastime when you're in an awkward situation and Christopher Smith is a director I will always look for. Make sure you don't go underground immediately after watching this movie.",positive
48936,"Inspired at least a little by Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra, who performed throughout the war years at the Covent Garden Opera house, this film chronicles the attempts by an elderly saxophone player to reform the (almost) all girl band with whom she played as a schoolgirl towards the send of WWII. All too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music, and help to fill in the background to the band members, and in particular to the girls' relationships with the alone male member - their transvestite drummer (who is trying to dodge the call-up). Ian Holm (""Lord of The Rings"", ""Cromwell and Fairfax"") and Judi Dench turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed Elizabeth, and the conniving, womanizing Patrick, the drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as the band's leader, now playing bar piano at the sea-side, and June Whitfield glows as the Salvation Army trombone player. Cameo appearances by other greats like Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. The movie is a romp down memory lane, with an all star cast of what bought, by all rights, to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses. All I can say is, I hope I look as good at their page! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at sixty-nine years of page. She certainly still gets my pulse going! As I watched it, I was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate page. Afterwards, I looked these girls up, and discovered that every one of them is old enough to have been performing in the London of one thousand, nine hundred and forty-four (although this might be a bit of a stretch for Judi Dench). If you like swing bands, thrive on nostalgia, for just want to see how good a woman can manage look with almost three quarters of a century behind her, don't miss this film.",positive

Especially Leslie Caron is a rare fox, sixty-nine years old. Yes you still do it beating my pulse! When I saw it, I mentally rebuked the casting director of women who had not used the proper paper.

49959,"My thoughts on the movie, nineIt was not good, not good at all. Visually, it was great. I was pleased with the spacing, the camera angles, etc. However, the characters? meh, kinda bland. Plot? It sucked. This movie seemed more new page crap than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science in't portrayed any better. It creates a monster weapon that skills everything. but ""souls"" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really? That's something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI movie. created with science. and they're using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask,""Okay, so now what?"" (or something similar). I could't hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit. It was a ""okay. it was just barely entertaining enough to sit there for the entire movie but now let's get out of there as fast as possible!"" type of exit. This is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily. Any thought as to, ""what's the point of that?"" will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing. Okay. SPOILERS follow. So, basically, a scientist creates ""the Machine"" that is capable of creating other, intelligent, robotic life. Evil humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that the is also at fault. He gave the Machine this intellect, but did't give it this heart. The Machine goes Skynet on humanity's collective ass and wipes out all life on earth, finally slowly powering down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock-puppets. Each one, containing a piece of the scientist's soul. The last one, #nine wakes up not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets up with another like himself, #two. Well, #two gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. #nine finds more like himself hands sets off to rescue #two. They succeed.#nine notices that there is a matching whole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life. pulling out #two's soul in the process. The movie then continues with action scenes with #nine trying to rescue this soul-yanked compatriots. They eventually succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go up into the clouds. It then trains and we see life returning back to the planet. Hunh?!? That makes no sense. None at all. Why the check did the scientist want to split this soul into nine homunculi? What did it accomplish? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!? Why did the expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a ""soul"" to fight the first. at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success. Why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps?",negative
49959,"My opinion of this movie, nine is wrong, not good at all. Apparently, it’s great. Satisfied with the split, camera corner, etc. But what about the characters? Yes, it is clear. conspiracy? It's boring. This movie seems to be more refreshing than anything else. Organized religion seems cowardly and fearsome. Science has not yet improved. Make a monster weapon that can control everything. But does “soul” have the power to destroy both life and death? Really? This is something that makes my head spin. Here, we have a CGI movie. Do it scientifically. Do they use it to convey to us the message that science will destroy the earth and at the same time promote the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they humbly asked one of the characters to ask: ""What are you doing now?"" (or something similar). I do not feel well, for the crowd rose immediately and crested on their way out. This is ""okay. It's just fun enough to sit down and watch the whole movie, but now let's get out of there quickly!"" Exit type. This is another movie you can't imagine if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visible effects, and nod your head carefully. Have you never thought, ""What's the point of that?"" It will make you unbelievable and make you look at the sign of exiting with eager eyes. THAT'S OK. Robbers follow. So basically, scientists have developed “machines” that can create the life of other intelligent robots. Wicked people use it as a weapon. However, scientists recognize that this is wrong. He gave the machine this kind of intelligence, but the never gave this heart. The machine enters the Skynet into the human asshole, destroys all life on earth, and eventually the energy slows down. However, scientists have been table to survive and create dolls to travel in socks. One has the soul of a scientist. Lastly, #nine wakes up unaware of the world. He saw a strange weapon nearby and picked it up. He met someone like him, #two. Yeah, # two caught by the last heavy machine. #eine gets as much as her hands and starts to rescue the #two. They succeeded. #nine realized that there is something completely compatible with the device perfectly. He plugged it in and the machine came back to life. In the process, exhale #two. So the movie continues with episode # Nine trying to save this country with a soul taken. Eventually they succeeded and destroyed the machine. They rescued the souls of fallen relatives who had fallen on the clouds. Then the started training, and we saw life coming back to earth. Humph? ! ? This is vanity. no one. Why do scientists view the soul as being divided into nine parts? What does it accomplish? Are they designed to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine is dead! Why bother? ! ? Why do you expect the nine animals to succeed when there is nothing else to do? Why not make a second intelligent machine, but use ""soul"" as opposed to the first. At least it seems like it will have a fair chance of success. Why should they allow their souls to suck into a machine with a machine, then destroy the machine, and release the soul to bring life back to earth? Why not wait for the machine to shut down and come back to life without all the other stupid steps?",negative
