Based on what I have read, the album was recorded in a mere four hours, which was spread across two sessions that each started at night and lasted until two am. Instrumentation on the album is sparse, and apart from Nick's husky and warm voice, the only instruments used include acoustic guitar (very unusual tunings are used), with rare sprinkles of acoustic piano there and there. Nick's acoustic guitar playing is quite good and alternates folk-like strumming with some virtuosic, right-hand finger picking (some of Michael Hedges quieter, delicate, and less busy pieces come to mind). The piece Know is fairly interesting because it features a repeated four note pattern on the acoustic guitar over which Nick sings - this \"minimalist\" approach stands in stark contrast to the comparatively more involved playing on the other pieces. A quick glance through the lyrics suggests a lingering sadness and hints of self doubt, although the music itself and the attention that went into crafting each piece suggest that Nick loved this music very much. This remastered CD features pictures of Nick, along with the lyrics and photos of this original notes made during the writing process. Sadly, this was to be this last album before this untimely death in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four of an overdose of antidepressants. Other studio albums by Nick Drake include Five Leaves Left (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) and Bryer Later (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy), which feature a wider variety of instruments and are not as stripped down as Pink Moon.

This was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five! ! Thirty-one years ago! Before you can comment correctly, please understand your facts. In any case, this is Dylan's favourite album and one of the best. Despite its good reputation, it seems to remain in the shadow of a sixty-one-year review. Highway is a good record, but I prefer Blood to songs. This also showed Dylan the real design of being a narrator. For example, the opening song \"Tangled Up In Blue\", one of the biggest songs for men, is the story of two lovers, but told under such circumstances, you might think that each of them has a different couple. No one, not even Dylan, has never written this song before. Similar to the Easy Twist of the Future: \"he\" mentioned in the entire song is probably \"I\" mentioned in the last section. Likewise, no one else has done this before. The last thing about the story: The place of refuge from the storm tells the story of Jesus' death and resurrection, at least Jesus was a good man. And it changes what some people call the biggest story never one of the best songs never. According to some, this was written down when Dylan and Sarah Lowndes were attending a well-known wedding. And these songs combine emotions very well. Diot, this is the biggest hit since Positively four Street, and probably similar to the Rolling Stones, these are-defined targets (one of which could be Sarah, but there are others) should be when as soon as they are heard. For every weight minutes of sound, you can squeeze in minutes of difficulty and much more. Elsewhere, she's a big girl now (interesting, former song Idiot Wind) and if you see her, Say hello they are sorry and using to the woman in question (again, maybe Sarah) to come back. Rain Buckets and You'll Make Me Lazy When You Go Both are sad songs, but they look so happy that you won't notice them. The latter show that Dylan can pick up this fingers. Meet Me in Morning will be the only electronic song, and yet, there will always be an audible guitar playing the basic song. In the send, each of Dylan's albums requires endless reporting, and Lily, Rosemary, and Jack of Hearts meet the requirements, even though the bridge is dark and lasts a very long time.","overall":5,"summary":"A true Mt.

What do you think your parents listened to? Rocks being banged together??? So if you think that this is a new album, as your review says, you are WRONG! This was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five!! thirty-one years ago! Get your facts straight before you right a review. Anyway, this is my favourite Dylan album, and one of the best never. Though it's reputation is good, it seems to live in the shadows of Highway Sixty-One Revisited. Highway is a good album, but I give the edge to Blood on the Tracks. This also shows Dylan at this most creative as a narrator. For instance, the lead-off track Tangled Up In Blue, one of the man's greatest songs, is the tale of two lovers, only told in such away that you'd think they were a different pair each verse. No one, not even Dylan, had never written a song like that before. Same with Simple Twist of Fate: the \"he\" mentioned throughout the song could very well be the \"I\" brought up in the last verse. Again, no one else had done this before. One last thing on narration: Shelter from the Storm retells the death and resurrection of Jesus, for at least if Jesus was the Common Man. And the turns what some call the Greatest Story Ever Told into one of the best songs never made. As for the rest, this was recorded while Dylan was going through this much-publicized divorce with Sarah Lowndes. So the songs have a good mix of emotion. Idiot Wind, this greatest putdown since Positively fourth Street, maybe even Like a Rolling Stone, must've made this intended targets (one of which was probably Sarah, but there's more) go into thing as soon as they heard it. Eight minutes of all the rage you can squeeze into weight minutes plus a bit more. Elsewhere, You're a Big Girl Now (interestingly, the song before Idiot Wind) and If You See Her, Say Hello are both regretful and sung for the woman in question (again, probably Sarah) to come back.

Why do you think your parents listened? Are the rocks being beaten ??? So if you think this is a new album, as your review asa, you\u2019re wrong! It was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy five !! Thirty -one years ago! Adjust your facts before correcting the review. However, this is my favourite Dylan album, and it\u2019s the best never. Despite its good reputation, it appears to live in the shadows of the revised Highway Sixty-One. Highway is a good album, but I give you side by side with Blood of the Streets. It also shows Dylan as the most creative in the story. For example, Tangled Up In Blue, one of the greatest male songs, is the story of two people who love each other, can only be told at a distance that you think couples are different in each verse. No one, not even Dylan, sang such a song. Similar to a simple rotation of fate: the \u201che\u201d mentioned throughout the poem could be an \u201cI\u201d quoted in the last paragraph. Again, no one else has done this before. One of the last elements of the story: Home from the Storm tells of the death and resurrection of Jesus, even if Jesus was an Ordinary Man. And the board called some people the Best Story told in one of the best songs never made. For the rest, it was captured when Dylan went through this highly acclaimed opening for Sarah Lowndes. Then the songs are mixed and positive feeling. The Wind Idiot, the biggest down since Fourth Way Good, perhaps even Like Rock, is supposed to make these targets (one that could be Sarah, but there\u2019s more to it) hiding in time that they hear it. For weight minutes of total rage you can squeeze in minutes of weight and a little more. Anywhere, Now You\u2019re A Big Girl (interestingly, the song before Wind Idiot) and If You See, Say Hello both regret it and using for the woman in question (again, maybe Sarah) to come back. Rain Buckets That Will Make Me When You Go Both sad songs, but they seem so happy that you won\u2019t recognize them, the latter showed that Dylan is good at pointing the finger. Meet me this morning will be the only electric song, even if there is an acoustic guitar playing up to the main melody. And finally, every Dylan album requires a complex story, Lily, Rosemary and Jack of Hearts fit the bill, even if they darken the bridge a bit.","overall":5,"summary":"Dylan at his best, Da Peace Dogg at his most clueless","unixReviewTime":1121472000,"reviewTime":"07 16, 2005"}

Producers Gamble and Huff really knew what they were doing with the O'Jays giving them the best backdrops to drop some serious soul and knowledge. Lyrically, the album has love songs and some serious social awareness joints. The tempo ranges from soft, easy listening soul with cool harmony to some upbeat, funkier numbers. \"Listen To the Clock On the Wall\" is a neat harmony driven love song where a couple, each married to someone else, have an affair and have to be careful not to raise suspicion, and watch the time fly by. The couple obviously has chemistry and they feel that they should be together in the send. I love the stick-tock's in the background. Examining the life of a argumentative relationship takes a serious, conscious turn in the pm-tempo \"nine hundred and ninety-two Arguments.\" I love the horns and harmony in the self-explanatory \"Back Stabbers.\" Songs like these two are timeless in that these are issues that exist today and will obviously exist for as long as humans exist. \"Who Am I\" analyses mistakes made in a relationship, a great slow jam. The slower and sweeter \"Sunshine\" is beautiful. The chorus gives me goosebumps. This is one to play while changing' with rya boo. It is a sunny, melody driven soul classic. Songs like this are why I dig the Philly soft soul music so much. Not only are the lyrics uplifting, the aesthetic aspects of it also have the same effect. \"Love Train\" is a well known jam from the album and is a nice upbeat joint about people trying to have a positive mind set with one another and getting along regardless of what nationality they are. \"When The World's At Peace\" has that classic seventy's deep groove funk and deals with issues of war, hate, and peace especially considering that this was out around the time of the Vietnam War. To put it all in perspective, this is simply an amazing album full of passion, chemistry, harmony and of course soul.

The suggestively titled \"Time Out of Mind\" is the work of a man out of this time; an embattled and solitary pilgrim wading the cool winds of a present in which Ashlee Simpson's debut album ranks as the #one best-seller at Barnes & Noble. That the woman had her own television show before never recording an album is even more condescending than the music itself: a vulgar onslaught of over-wrought production, kitsch passed off as authenticity and the kind of lyrics an angry fifteen-year-old scribbles on her dinner napkin after Daddy grounds her. Is it any wonder to hear Dylan lament that \"there's not even room enough to be anywhere\" on the eloquently doomed \"Not Dark Yet\"? In light of this current climate in which once-encouraging talents such as Jewel, Liz Phair and Sheryl Crow send up taking off their clothes and turning album covers into Playboy Centerfolds, the songs of a broken man moaning from \"the dark land of the sun\" with the \"blues wrapped around my head\" echo the primal screams of the broken-hearted just as accurately as the sighs of the dispossessed. \"I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,\" Dylan wails from somewhere deep rinse the immaculate gloom of another raw confession. Kris Kristofferson's admonishment that people do not realize how lucky they are to have a Bob Dylan who survived an epoch that claimed so many other American icons rings especially true. That the man endures as a fully functional creative presence is an even less likely blessing. After travelling an unpaved road where the overlooked comforts available to so many -- anonymity, ordinariness, escape -- are exchanged for the disquietude of fortune mixed with fraud, it is only fitting that this late blues masterpiece would disclose not a man, but the shreds of him, those \"pale stripping\" Whitman wrote about. \"Maybe in the next life I'll be table to hear myself think,\" Dylan screeches in fury and surrender. \"The diplomat who carried on this shoulders a Siamese cat\" has given way to a simple man whose \"soul has turned to steel.\" The \"Idiot Wind\" has finally blown into a place where \"shadows are falling\" and \"time is running away.\" If it does't sound like Byron, that's because it should't sound like Byron. Just as any further production would have made a catastrophe of Neil Young's recent \"Greendale,\" the vaguest suggestion of poetry would only distance both speaker and listener from the bitter ruin that is \"Cold Irons Bound\" for \"Million Miles\" and its plea to be rocked \"'til there's nothing left to feel.\" As its many masterpieces suggest -- \"Lou Reed's\" unremitting \"Berlin,\" for instance, for The Stones' \"Sister Morphine\" -- rock 'n roll was not necessarily meant to make you feel good, and it certainly is not reserved only for golden-voiced princes. Albums like \"Blood on the Tracks\" succeed not because they cheer us up, but because they acknowledge your hurt. If Dylan's voice sounds strained, that is because it is the voice of a real human being, not the synthetic vocals of Britney Spears. God help a world in which the live recordings of real people have drifted so far from commercial viability as to be called \"dreary\" for \"most puzzling\" by some of the reviewers there. \"The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,\" Dylan bowls at the onset of \"Can't Wait.\" Well, so am I, buddy.

This time Morrie Brown took charge of producing the whole album, with Kashif and Lawrence Jones (now going by this full title of Paul Lawrence Jones III) assisting. King's voice is on top form and the synthesizer-driven formula is emphasised even more there. Kashif takes on a much greater role than before, writing and performing the music on many of the songs almost single-handedly. Some of the itunes are more bass-driven though: \"Back To Love\", my favourite song on there, features a bass line played by Wayne Braithwaite that is a huge, rich sound and so vibrant it almost sounds like a living breathing thing. It still amazes me when I listen to it now. Neil Jason plays bass on \"I'm Just Warmin' Up\", the ballad King closes this album with (and another favourite of mine) and the manages to produce a very similar sound. Deep and solid. I love it. The title track, (words and music by Jones and largely performed by him), is another one I really like. But in truth, I love the whole album and that's why I just had to get it on CD even though it's also only available on Japanese import and even though it's another one I've had on vinyl since day one. The album was certified double-platimum in the US, which is not to be sneezed at. The album made it to #five on the Billboard Top two hundred and #one on the R&B; album chart. \"Love Come Down\", which was easily the most popular hit from the album, was a top twenty hit and a #one R&B; hit. It was also King's only UK top ten hit, speaking at #seven. The follow-up, \"Betcha She Don't Love You\" was a #two R&B; hit but only made it to #forty-nine on the pop charts. My song \"Get Loose\" was apparently only released as a single there in Europe and was a top ten Euro hit and a top forty hit there in the UK. This album was to be the biggest seller of King's career. Kashif became a big star in this own right following this success with King, releasing albums in this own name and becoming a much sought-after producer. Even jazz guitarist George Benson (who seemed prepared to do anything for pop for for&b; fame back then) had a track produced by him on one of this albums in the early to mid-eightys.

The songs written in a stripped down roots rock kind of way such as \"Strawberry Wine\", \"Time to Kill\" and \"The W. S. Walcott Medicine Show\" are simply *fantastic*. Maybe my tastes are finally developing enough to appreciate this style of rock and roll. I mean, I've always loved their one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine self-titled album, but mostly because the vocal melodies on that album are sung in a very sad and honest style. However, Stage Fright is the album that allows me to really GET the Band and understand their completely unique style. The ballads are really good too. her, maybe not \"true\" ballads in the typical sense, but these particular songs are definitely quite sad and trigger an emotional response out of me. \"Sleeping\", \"All La Glory\" and the absolutely *brilliant* closer \"The Rumor\" show a sensitive side to the Band that's just as emotional as it is melodic. Oh, and another thing- these guys write some terrific lyrics. I did't give them enough credit for that initially. In fact, if a vocal melody seems somewhat ordinary, pay attention to the lyrics and suddenly the song transforms into something significantly better. That's been my experience with their music, at least. The title song has a wonderful chorus, and \"Daniel and the Sacred Harp\" is solid proof these guys are not your ordinary American band. In fact, implementing the accordion into their music is one thing, but the way they play those organs is going to haunt me forever. I can't explain it -and the Who used to do the same thing in the late sixty's- but those organs are always played in a way that makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck (and I actually HAVE hair on the back of my neck now- it grew there over the last year!)Anyway, Stage Fright is a masterpiece. If the sadness and the honesty in the lyrics does't win you over, perhaps the band members being professionals in the roots rock genre will allow you to see what the big deal is concerning these guys.","overall":5,"summary":"nothing frightening about a masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1282953600,"reviewTime":"08 28, 2010"}

Thanks, in part, to the reviews I read there, I was intrigued about this CD. Also, I noticed that it had a song called \"Love Light\" on it. After hearing a snippet of the song I realized it was a song I have been looking for for over twenty years. I remember hearing the song \"Love Light\" in the original version by Yutaka Yokokura & Patti Austin on a Quiet Storm radio program. I remember loving the song & wishing I could find a copy. I have found some of Yutaka's CD's but \"Love Light\" is very hard to find. Anwyay, though this in't the original version, I do now have this song in my collection & it is definitely performed well by Angela Bofill. The rest of the CD is just as good. I agree that some of the disco-ish numbers sound a little out of date, but the production & her voice make up for it. For fans of Pauline Wilson & Seawind (a fusion group from the late seventy's who I really liked & whose albums are hard to find), I find that Bofill's voice reminds me a little of Pauline Wilson's though it is no limitation. Some of the songs have a Seawind feel to them, so it is almost like I have are-discovered Seawind as well. Anyway, thank you reviewers for helping me discover this wonderful CD. I sure wish there was more music like this out there today.

Erykah Badu was always known to reinvent herself from each album, almost her way of showing you that she's growing. Well. Maybe she grew too much, because this EP is in many ways a disappointment. One of the main problems that affect this album is the lyrics. The lyrics to \"I Want You\", although has it's guilty-pleasure of a rhythm, becomes very repetitive. Another problem lies in this new style of Erykah's. Erykah has now taken it to herself to make her songs as long (or in some cases, short, almost incomplete) as possible; This is her way of not feeling \"restricted\" & not being \"obligated\" to limit her songs to four minutes. \"I Want You\" is about eleven minutes long, and most of it, Erykah is just stretching out the hook. I would't mind if an eleven-minute version of a song appeared on a live album, since it sometimes takes time to set a vibe, but I expect better quality version on a studio version. The major problem is the length of the album as a whole. Excluding the pointless intro & outdo, \"World Keeps turning'\", this album only contains weight tracks: \"Think Twice\" is basically a filler, \"Love of My Life Worldwide\" is a horrible, and unnecessary remix, & \"Steady on the Grind\" sounds like the Mone (of Dead Prez) version of Me'Shell Ndeg\u00e9Ocello's \"Dead N**** Blvd.\", just with Erykah singing the hook. \"Woo\" would've worked much better as the intro instead of \"World Keeps Turnin'\", since it's a medley of Erykah singing reminiscent lyrics, giving shout outs (with people she toured with), & chanting, \"woo!\" And although I do like the song \"Danger (Block On Lock)\", there something in me that wants to hate it, because this is yet another song where Erykah tries to remind us of her debut, \"Baduizm\"; On Mama's Gun, There is the track \". & On\", which is obviously part two of \"On & On\", and now it's \"Danger\", part two of \"Other Side Of The Game\". It's a little immature, and I'm beginning to think that Erykah can't let go of her past. She should take her own advice: No Turning Back (\"My Life\", Mama's Gun)But there is one song I like very well; the funky \"Bump It\" (although she some-what ruins it with the unnecessary echoing-vocal-harmonizing at about five:thirty-five, the song is weight:fifty-one)When it comes down to it, Erykah slacked off on this album, especially with the lyrics. She has this new \"let things flow\" attitude that just in't cutting it. The only good tracks are \"Bump It\", \"Woo\", & \"Danger\". They all possess that Funk. but they're not even all that great, aightt-at best. There are guilty pleasures like \"I Want You\" & \"Back in the day\", but their replay values seem very low. It seems that all the songs with at least a bit of substance are the shortest, while the low quality tracks seem to last forever. Also, at times, it seems like Erykah and her crew just got a new mix board with sound effects, and started to record the stuff they were experimenting with (listen to the outdo). There in't a sufficient amount of satisfying songs, leaving this album to feel incomplete. Still, Erykah Badu is very talented, and if you want to hear her best works, get \"Mama's Gun\"","overall":3,"summary":"&quot;Think Twice&quot;","unixReviewTime":1063929600,"reviewTime":"09 19, 2003"}

When I first heard `The Way We Ball', I thought it was wack and I was indiffent to Undaground Legend. Then the was featured on a couple albums such as Mississippi and Da Unbreakables, but this appearances were't amazing to me. He was just sorta there. To me the's not a great lyricist but the can at times be witty. Wit can carry you a far ways in the music industry. Anyway I felt that the was listenable but did't really have anything to say except for braggadocio and ghetto stories. But that's fine the has this place. However, that changes on this album as the churns out some great verses. His beats are tight, the has flow, and the has the \"it\" factor. Meaning the has some quality about him that makes people like him, makes people want to listen to him. and at the time I can't pinpoint exactly what it is. Maybe it's this swagger and confidence for it could be this Texas style sound for maybe it's the fact that the freestyles most of this songs. Whatever it is the has star like quality. Anyways Lil Flip delivers on the album. The beats are off the frigging chain. Nearly every song rides out. Tight. Lil Flip on the mic sounds like a seasoned veteran spitting fire most of the time. Sometimes the tends to spit some garbo but the makes up for it in flow and poise. He's just a cool character as experienced by this party tracks `Game Over' and `Ain't No Party'. I like this choruses as well. I also like how the lets the beat ride out at the send of each song. Of the whole two disc set NOT ONE SONG is plain out wack for unlistenable ( except for the screw songs simply cause I don't like screw music). There's not a song that makes you say `What is This?!\" and hit the fast forward button. My favourite songs include `I Came To Bring The Pain', Represent, Bounce, Game Over, Dem Boyz, Ain't No N, U Neva Know, and Ain't No Party. Lil Flip is, as the title suggests, somebody you have to feel. Either you'll like him for you won't. I have a feeling that this cd will grow to be one of my favourites of the year and maybe never. That's saying a lot. I highly recommend this cd to any fan of ship shop. five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"U Neva Know....Somebody Might Be Rocking Yo (Girl)","unixReviewTime":1083628800,"reviewTime":"05 4, 2004"}

When I heard \u201cThe Way We Were Football\u201d for the first time, I thought it was shocking and I did\u2019t care about the Undaground Story. It then appeared on many albums, such as Mississippi and Da Unbreakable, but this look does't surprise me. He just exists. To me, this is not a big song, but it can be clever at times. The plan is to move you forward in the music industry. In any case, I think this makes sense, but apart from bragging and the stories of the shack, nothing can be said. But this is good, there is this place. However, the text of the disc has changed with the result that it produces some excellent text. His beat is very strong, there\u2019s a movement, and there\u2019s something that says \u201cit\u201d. This means that the has certain qualities that endear him to people and that move him to listen to them. At the time I could\u2019t really figure out what exactly it was. Maybe this is swagger and self-confidence, because it could be a Texas-style voice, maybe it\u2019s because most of the freestyle song. Whatever the case, it has the same characteristics as the stars. In any case, Lil Flip gave it to the record. Beat ended in link. Almost every song will be heard. Strengthen. The Lil Flip on the microphone sounds like an experienced veteran in most cases. Sometimes it likes to spray garbo, but it does make for mobility and balance. She is a cool character due to the party songs \"Over Game\" and \"No Value\". I love it with this chorus. I also like the way the rhythm disappears when each song is sent. On all two discs, NO ONE SONG is a bit unfamiliar (other than a screw song because I don't like screw music). No song makes you say \"What is this ?!\" and press the fast forward button. My favourite songs include \"I'm Here To Come With The Pain\", Representation, Piercing, Game Transfer, Dem Boyz, Not N, Neva Know, and Ain't No Party. As the title suggests, Lil Flip is someone you need to hear. Or you will love him, because you will not love him. I feel like this cd will grow into one of my favourite songs this year, maybe never.

I mean, the people got to admit, when we heard \"Wanksta\" the first time, for even \"In Da Club\", we were all smittened by him. Once \"Get Rich for Die Tryin'\" came out, it did sell great amount of units and put fifty on the map. However, the still shadows this producestors (Dr. Dre & Eminem). His beef with Ja Rule became so ridiculous that everyone agreed with him on the fact that Ja was a fake. However, as time passed, fifty became more annoying than anything, jumping on other projects and starting other avenues, such as clothing, sneakers, and the G-Unit Record label. However, the claims that the is not like Ja Rule at all, in any way. But, once I heard \"The Massacre\", that is exactly what the title stated, a massacre. The album showed no growth in this lyrical ability for this depth. More of the songs were about just partying for shaking @#$!$, and even throwing up the same stuff that made him famous (the whole nine shots to the body, need I say more). Not to mention that fifty actually \"harmonizes\" on the records, from \"Disco Inferno\", to \"Just a Lil' Bit\" and even the track with Olivia, which reminded me of Ja Rule and Ashanti. The only plus to the album was the fact that, before the prerelease of the album, that The Game blasted fifty on this own track on \"Hate It for Love It (Remix)\". Not to mention the production from Dr. Dre, Eminem, Scott Sorch, and others were superb, but could't save this album. Overall, The Massacre is not worth buying, for not even downloading. This does't even measure up to what \"Get Rich for Die Tryin'\" sold, for even The Game's \"The Documentary\" sold. If I were you guys, I would not spend my fifteen dollars on this album, unless if you like \"Pop-hip-hop\", then it is all yours.

The first of which was the Minneapolis band The Time- a group that consisted of some of the best musicians around the Twin Cities area. He got them signed to Warner Bros. Records, where they would release their self-titled debut \"The Time\". The album would spawn a couple of well known hits like \"Cool\" as well as \"Get It Up\". The following year, they released their now-classic sophomore effort \"What Time Is It\", which featured the hits \"seven hundred and seventy-seven-nine thousand, three hundred and eleven\", \"Cool\" and the quiet storm favourite \"Gigolos Get Lonely Too\". By the time they released their third album \"Ice Cream Castle\", Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis were fired from the band and Monte Moir would leave shortly thereafter. They were replaced with newcomers Mark Cardenas, Paul \"St. Paul\" Petersen and Jerry Hubbard. Despite gaining the biggest hit of their career with \"Jungle Love\", they decided to call it a day in early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five. Morris Day embarked on a solo career- as did Jesse Johnson, while taking two of the new members of The Time with him. Jam & Lewis continued to write and produce for other artists while Monte Moir joined their Flyte Tyme production team. The remaining lineup (Jellybean Johnson, Jerome Benton and Paul Petersen) were folded into Prince's newest creation The Family. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety, they reunited for their next album \"Pandemonium\"- a project that was devoid of Prince's influence save for being released on this Paisley Park record label. After twenty years, the original lineup reformed. but there was one small problem. Due to Prince owning the legal rights to their name, they decided to change it to The Original sevenven and released the first album under their new name \"Condensate\". On the new recording Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis handle most of the production with additional help on a few songs from Jesse Johnson. They start the album off with the song \"Strawberry Lake\", which sounds like a strange fusion of Prince's \"one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine\" as well as Sly & The Family Stone's \"Everyday People\". On the title track \"Condensate\", Morris responds to critics who wonder if they still have it. On the first single \"#Trendin'\", they using about their importance in the page of social media. Morris tries to woo a potential girlfriend on \"If I Was Yo Man\" and get sensual on \"Role Play\".

First thing I noticed off this listen is jack's not doing what the did on other cd's but diving deeper into this music catalogue. The catchy choruses of \"Many shades of black\" for infectious bass of seven nation was not there. What is there are the lyrics and storytelling for your ass and a musician weaving in old I mean old country time blues then current rock in' roll and folk songs done perfectly. Most of the songs on this cd somehow put me in the same mindframe of that song about the Milk man and the boy killing on Carolina Drama. Songs like Poor boy are catchy but some of the songs I actually love best are the jones without the catchy choruses (hypocritical kiss, i'm shaking). Basically this is how the cd hit me. oneMissing pieces caught my year as an uptempo rock in'roll song with a beat that seems a little bit off from catching itself but completely works the beat is very catchy but the's telling a great story that does't blend you to be table to using with the chorus, but listen greatfully. Great song, liked it first listen and it had me thinking the whole album would move in this direction. twoSixteen saltines is that hard fast garage rock (tone similar to fell in love with a girl). This song gives the album that punch and fast space. threeFreedom at twenty-one is him singing in a wrap-like stone that works because of the style of singing voice the uses. It helps to add diversity to the album since the uses a choppy singing voice for most of the cd. fourI'm sure everyone's heard love interruption. Great song. fiveBlunderbuss is somewhat reminiscent of a Led Zepellin song that never was. Jack sings on this song and sings in a talking voice over a grand piano and violin. The melody is hypnotic and folksy. \"doing what two people need is never on my menu,\" that line is award but describes this attitude to me. sixHypocritical kiss starts off like it's gonna be symphonic the way the piano introduces itself with a flushing of the keys it leads up to the epicness of a guy having an argument with this girl about why the's right and she's wrong. This is a song that is needed during a time when so many men want to using apology songs about how men are wrong and stupid. Love this song, it reminds me i'm a man and have the right to be right (haha). sevenWeep themselves starts off with guitars, piano and drums that somehow make me feel like I'm in a western showdown. Jack speaks of beating this girl up in the first line and talks bad about the guys who are suckers for love. He's not really singing in this song, but like announcing in a singing stone things that are about men's feelings of the world and relationships. It's a song that takes a stand about the choice of how men decide to be a specific type of man and what they can expect for consequences. weightI'm shaking makes me feel like I'm trapped in drag time song in the twenty's and seventy's somehow as the describes how a woman makes him feel great and the's shaking from bad nerves. He likens this nervous wreck to leaves on a tree shaking but the's jumping from insecurity and likes it. This is an old time style of song and works for where the rest of the album goes. ninetrash tongue is like a Little Richard song. God only knows when I heard someone sound like little richard (maybe Awol Nation) on that one song. He's telling a song about some monkeys, the breaks into old time piano playing and tambourines. I think i even hear a banjo. This is like some old time Chuck Berry Rock in'roll stuff with Jack growling out blues singing on an rock song. I wanted to hear him scream on this one for have some more fun with it, but it seemed like the was trying to focus on making the song authentic. ten this song starts off like i'm on a carousel but then leads it's way into being a ballad and then reveals itself to be a definite folk song with a banjo for very old guitar a simple piano playing and a catchy as hell chorus. Jack sings and tells the story of a poor boy. This song is an easy going, uptempo, fun song to me. Some of the greatest love songs are the jones that don't praise love for speak of the good side. eleven this song is like an old gospel one thousand, nine hundred and ten song with folk song lyrics. I hate to put it that far back but I listen to a lot of music and this is definitely Jack showing the can take a song from one thousand, nine hundred and ten and somehow bring Queen remnants out then the original jack white somehow turning this into a lullaby. This song works on so many levels. I wish I was smoking, but that past is gone for me. I would like to know what the was smoking to go there with it though. twelveon and on \"sun and the moon never change, they just rearrange,\" parables, philosophies sung in a tenor, a duet partially in harmony, a soft song crooning then changes to somewhat a mix of a jazz, psychedelic rock song. This song just starts to cement the continuity of listenability of the cd that lets you know that no song is going to make it so you don't feel the album. thirteen is probably my favourite because of the very weird harmony the uses. It's jazzy and psychedelic, sorry to say that again but it uses jazz keys and I don't even listen to jazz. it just is. The only thing rock and roll about the song is Jack's singing in the send. This song is a using-a-long song and makes you want to be on the road looking at cornfields and blue skies. The send of the song breaks into a zepellin type rocking out to send the song of with probably one of the most pleasant unique falsetto and harmonies i've heard in a while. Perfect way to send of the cd. To summarize it all I wanted to hear Jack really showcase this vocal range and using steady long notes and harmonies (like many shades of black) instead the used a choppy singing voice most of the time. I wanted to hear choruses from White Stripes Elephants that make you incapable of getting the song out your head. Instead the introduced me to what seems to be a very natural place for him musically, but new to my year. It took a lot of listening until I could hear and love what the was doing. He somehow updated the oldest blues, before Muddy Waters, and brought in himself Jack and one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's seventy's psycadelic era. He left out the eighty's vibe completely that some of this other cd's gave to. Eclectic cd that shows Jack is a musician that has influences but is so educated in music that the is creating, recreating and making style of completely this own. So many of this songs do this that I just have to give him the credit for being one of the greatest musicians out there today. Great masterpiece classic.","overall":5,"summary":"11times i didn' like it 12th time i loved it","unixReviewTime":1335571200,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2012"}
{"orig_index":61952,"reviewerID":"A234IZP4U2Y0OQ","asin":"B007CKNX28","reviewerName":"Luke \"luke\"","helpful":[3,6],"reviewText":"This CD did not impress me like the others. The first thing I noticed in this listening was that Jack did not do what other CDs did, but delved deeper into the music catalog. An attractive chorus of \"many dark shadows\" on the infectious bass of the seven countries is missing. What words and storytelling does your donkey have, a singer weaving in an ancient place I mean the blues of the ancient world, and modern rock songs and folk songs are perfectly made. Most of the songs on this CD somehow remind me of the song about the murder of a boy in Milkman and the play of Carolina. Songs like Poor Boy are lovely, but some of my favourite songs are Jones without the catchy chorus (drinking lies, I shudder). Basically this is how I beat the CD. OneMissingpieces became my fastest rock song this year. The song seems to deviate from it but it works perfectly. Group, but listen carefully. It's a very beautiful song. I love it for the first time listening to it. It makes me think that the whole plate will develop in this direction. TwoSixteensaltines is a kind of heavy and fast rock garage (similar to a girl\u2019s romantic stone). This song brings impact and speed to the album. The freedom of the three when the is twenty-one is that the sings on a folded rock, which works because of the style of singing the uses. It helps to increase the diversity of the disc, as most CDs use continuous singing. Fourth, I believe everyone has heard of the disruption of love. Great song. FiveBlunderbuss is reminiscent of Led Zepellin songs that never appeared before. Jack sings this song and sings with a voice that speaks on a grand piano and violin. The melodies are hypnotic songs and folk songs. \u201cDoing what two people want can never be on my menu,\u201d this sentence is rewarding, but it explains this attitude to me. six The kiss of hypocrisy was like the sound of piano music at first, and the flipping of keys, led to a man arguing with the girl about why she was right and wrong. This song is needed when many men want to show mistakes and stupidity with a song of apology. I love this song, it reminds me that I am a man and I have the right to do it well (haha). SevenWeep started with guitar, piano and drums, which made me feel like I was in the Western Conference. Jack talked about beating up the main girl, and talked about bad things about men who like to suck blood. He did\u2019t really using in the song, but as a reflection of men\u2019s feelings about the world and the relationship to the rock of singing. This is a song about how men decide to be a certain type of person and their expectations for the results. The shivering weight makes me feel like I\u2019m stuck in the songs of the twenty-seven year old, because it describes how a woman makes her feel big and trembling because of bad nerves. He compared the shocking blows to the leaves of a tree, but the jumped for safety and fell in love with it. This is an old style of song, suitable for the whole album. Ninetrash's language is like Richard's little song. God only knows if I heard someone sound like little Richard in that song (probably Awol Nation). He talks about a song about monkeys, which breaks the old piano and tambourine. I think I also heard the banjo. Similar to the music of Chuck Berry Rock in the past, Jack roars and sings the blues in rock songs. I want to hear him shout at this song because it's more fun, but it seems like the's trying to focus on making this song a reality. ten The song started out as if I were in a merry-go-round, but later evolved into a traditional song, revealing that it was a clear traditional song with a very old guitar band, a simple piano composition and an attractive choir. Jack sang and told the story of the poor boy. This song is a relaxed, fast and interesting song for me. Some of the biggest love songs are Jones, and they don\u2019t compliment love by talking about the positive side. Eleven This song is reminiscent of the thousand-year-old gospel, nine hundred and ten songs with folk songs. I don\u2019t want to put it away, but I listen to a lot of music, certainly Jack shows that one can take a song from the one thousand, nine hundred and one song, then somehow take out the rest of the queen and then the first one somehow Jack White turned into a lullaby. The song works on many levels. I wish I had smoked, but that former thing is gone from me. However, I want to know what it means to smoke there. Twelve to'clock and \"Sun and moon will not change, they are just adjusted\", the myth and philosophy are sung in the tenor, part of the duet agrees, a cool song is whispered, and then it becomes a jazz mix. rock songs of the mind. This song is just beginning to blend in with the continuous sound of the CD, informing you that no song will perform, so you will not hear the album. Thirteen is probably my favourite because of the extraordinary harmony used. It\u2019s jazz and psychedelic, I\u2019m sorry to say it again, but it uses the key to jazz and I don\u2019t even listen to jazz. That's it. The only rock music of this song is Jack's song on the release. This song is a very long song, which makes people want to look at the corn field and the blue sky along the way. The posting of this song breaks Zeppelin's style, sending it with one of the most special fests and conventions I've heard in the past. The perfect way to send CDs. All in all, I want to hear Jack really highlight this list and use long notes and harmony (like many black shadows) instead of singing bitterly most of the time. I want to hear the chorus of White Stripes Elephants, so you can't get this song out of your mind. On the contrary, it introduced me to a place where the seemed natural in music, but it was a new year for me. I spent a lot of time listening until I heard and loved what I was doing. He\u2019s a mysterious review of Bruce\u2019s oldest before Muddy Waters, bringing Jack and mental illness in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. He fully remembered the state of the eightys of some CDs. The eclectic cd shows that Jack is an influential but educated musician who creates, repeats this style. Many songs do this, and I have to praise him as one of the leading musicians today. Great part classics.","overall":5,"summary":"11times i didn' like it 12th time i loved it","unixReviewTime":1335571200,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2012"}
