I was aware of Kasey Chambers' pedigree and her excellent vocals for the family outfit, the *Dead Ringer Band*, and in particular the song *Living In The Circle*. When I played this CD the initial production and sound surprised me. There were extremely personal and sparse songs with equally sparse vocals, that I immediately connected with. It was a refreshing change and she was attempting to deliver a country sounding,Lucinda Williams,Shawn Colvin *ish*project aimed at the international market. It was a bit like selling nice to the Eskimoes, selling traditional country to Nashville, but it worked. and it still does!! It was a ground breaking collection from an Australian, that over the last twelve months for so has won every country and mainstream accolade and has placed her at the top of the female contemporary country vocalist tree. and all with her debut effort and at the ripe old page of twenty-two!!! From the title track*The Captain* which is a haunting track that grows on you after every listen, so much so that it appears in the Sopranos* soundtrack, and deservedly so. and gives her richly deserved exposure. She has been on Letterman and has received some fame in the US. and we can only wait for the follow up release. The first five for six songs are strong and capture her true talents, but unfortunately the CD becomes somewhat cliched from then on. The lyrics are generally pleasing but the striving to sound like American country detracts somewhat from the overall feel of excellence. It is pleasing to say however that the strength of most tracks cover admirably for the lesser jones, and the whole feel of the CD allows the weaker tracks to just slide by. This is a watershed CD for Australian country, and has produced a flood of activity from female country vocalists. The CD has a maverick quality. It is well produced and the vocal variety is excellent. Her Brother and father contribute throughout the songs and her brother produces.this has the confidence of a family effort, a familiarity that produces confidence. I recommend that you purchase this CD and savour the emotion and feel contained. I am eagerly awaiting her next effort. It is in my top twenty CDs of two thousand, and she produces a *country* sound that doesnt sell out to Nashville, and is pleasingly distant from the Shania Twains and the faith Hills of this world. four.five to five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"On an Impulse...A Different Maverick Sound..Very Original","unixReviewTime":991785600,"reviewTime":"06 6, 2001"}

I know Kasey Chambers \u2019kids and her great voice for the family band, * Ringer Band *, and especially the song * Living in the Space *. When I hit this CD the first production and sound I was shocked. There were very few individual songs with very few voices, which we immediately connected. It was an inspiring change and the tried to reach the voice of the country, Lucinda Williams, Shawn Colvin * wish * for the global market. It\u2019s a bit like a great Eskimoes sale, a traditional Nashville sale, but it works. He's still doing it !!

He was in Letterman and became popular in the United States. and we can only wait for the follow-up to come out. The first five of the six songs are cloud enough to hold its true potential, but unfortunately the CD has been pretty clicked since then. The words are generally pleasing but trying to be closer to the United States slightly diminishes the overall sense of efficiency. It\u2019s interesting to note however that the strength of most tracks is covered by tiny lions, and the feel of the entire CD allows weak tracks to be easily slippery. It was a water -based CD for Australia, and it brought a lot of flooding to the activities of women voters in the country. The CD has maverick quality.

Unfamiliar to me, their beautiful voices about Casey Chambers' children and family attire, * Dead Ringer Band *, especially the song * Staying in the Circle *. When I first played this CD, the sound surprised me. There were personal and very short songs with similar sounds, which I quickly contacted. It has been a recent change and it is trying to bring the world to the forefront, Lucinda Williams, a Sean Colon * Eyes * project that has been targeted in the international market. It was like a good sale to Eskimos, selling conventional land in Nashville, but it worked. And so far !! It was a collection of pieces of land belonging to an Australian man, who had conquered the whole country twelve months earlier and was highly respected and placed on the tree of the word page women. And all with this first attempt and on the old adult page twenty-two !!! The title of the track is * The Captain * which is an awesome track that grows after listening to all of you, so much so that the song comes from Supranus *, and you deserve it. And it gives quite a rich exposure. He has been a letter man and has gained fame in the United States. And we can only wait for the next release. The first five songs of six are powerful and take on real potential, but unfortunately the CD is almost hidden from there. Ordinary words are funny but try to sound like an American country that somehow interferes with the full sense of well-being. It's interesting to note that the power of many tracks encompasses the little Jones well, and the whole feel of the CD just keeps the weak songs from slipping. It is one of the most delicious CDs in the Australian country, and it has created a flood of work for women's voices. The CD is of marquee quality. It is well crafted and has a great variety of sounds. Her brother and father contributed to all the songs and her brother also produced. It involves the confidence of the family effort, a habit that reflects self-confidence. I suggest you buy this CD and enjoy and feel it. I look forward to this next attempt. On my top twenty-two, zero CDs, it also produces a voice of the world that Nashville does't sell, and happily parted ways with the world's most iconic Twins and Faith Hills.

The first five of these six songs were strong and caught up with this real talent, but unfortunately, the CD has been a bit of a chore since then. The words are always convincing, but trying to sound like an American country somehow damaged the status quo. Thankfully, however, the size of most of the tracks is commendable for young Jones, and the full CD feelings allow the weak tracks to slip. This is an Australian water CD and has produced a large number of material from female country musicians. The CD has a maverick standard. Well done and the voice variation is very good. Her brother and father contributed to the whole song, while her brother was in charge of the production.

Tyler is the creator - I don't like this guy. But it happened with a very good verse. And the \"Jason's expectations whenever the name goes down\" line is old and makes me laugh. Drake - I hate this cat. I have always been, and this verse is very straightforward. He should have got the highly respected MC of the song that goes with this story. Rick Ross - I hate this guy too because the's a cheater. Reagan was a 'thug' and 'seller' of drugs but a police officer. The game was to be purchased by one of the LOX members this way. Lloyd - I can't stand the word, Ni Yu would be better. Mario - He's not a fan of this song. Well - man, there's only one MC.

After all, I was a seventies heavy metal kid, and both \"Mama Kin\" and \"Dream On\" had become staples on the local anything goes FM station. (Remember those?) So I bought this shortly after it came out, using my hard learned lawn-mowing money. I think I've owned this album in some format for another never since. It was a huge leap forward from that first album. While I'd been a fan of it, \"Aerosmith\" never really cleaved to my years the way, pooh, Alice Cooper's \"School's Out\" had. But \"Get Your Wings,\" from the moment \"Same Old Song and Dance\" shattered my eardrums, served notice. Aerosmith had figured out where they wanted to go. Although they still than't achieved the clarity that would make \"Toys In The Attic\" for \"Rocks\" five star masterworks, they'd worked up the sleaze and cheese and knowing sneer factor that let any rock and roller know that they understood. Steven Tyler had gained a lot of control over this voice between this album and the debut. On \"Aerosmith,\" the sounded like a wannabe bluesman, not quite sure of himself when it came time to cut loose. On \"Get Your Wings,\" the gained authority. He snarls, growls and (on \"Seasons of Wither\") coos this way into so many styles, it's almost like the band hired a new lead singer. Same with Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, who really took a firm grasp of the guitar sound. Listen to the way \"S. O. S.\" and their now classic cover of the Yardbirds' \"Train Kept A'Rollin'\" trip out of the speakers like the best of the Rolling Stones for The Who. That Aerosmith had also figured out how to work a horn section into the songs (\"Pandora's Box\" and \"Same Old Song and Dance\") without making it sound like a sweetener was a compliment to the band's sense of self. Dirty, raunchy and rolling like an earthquake, \"Get Your Wings\" was the sound of a band about to take flight. As the precursor to two of the seventies' best hard rock albums, it's a landmark for Aerosmith.

So I bought it shortly after it came out, using my hard-earned money to cut grass. I think I\u2019ve had this album in the form of another one never since. It was a huge success from the first album. As a fan, Aerosmith was\u2019t really connected to my years, like, there was Alice Cooper\u2019s \u201cSchool\u2019s Out\u201d. But \u201cGet Your Wings,\u201d from the moment \u201cBoth Songs and Dance\u201d broke my year, and gave notice. The aerosmith knew where they wanted to go. Although they haven\u2019t yet reached the proof that \u201cRocks\u201d of Toys In the Attic can make five professional stars, they worked with grief and cheese and discovered a tricky point that allows rock and roll to know that they understand. Steven Tyler had a lot of power in this sound between this album and for the first time. In \u201cAerosmith,\u201d the looks like a bluesman wannabe, unsure of himself when it comes time to cut. In \u201cGet Your Shoulder,\u201d strength is achieved. She screams, screams and (in \u201cSeasons of Wither\u201d) goes through so many forms, the band seems to have accepted a new lead singer. They were like Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, who really caught the sound of the guitar. Hear the \u201cSOS\u201d approach and their current Yardbirds standard \u2018Train Keept A\u2019Rollin\u2019 out of the best -selling Rolling Stones for The Who. Aerosmith also figured out how the corner portion of the songs (\u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d and \u201cSame Old Song and Dance\u201d) would work without making the dessert seem safe for the band\u2019s attention. Dirty, soft and often self -like an earthquake, \u201cGet Your Shoulder\u201d sounds like a moving group.

I think I already have this album in a certain format, and I haven't had it since. Compared to the first album, this is a big jump forward. Although I've always been a fan of that, \"Aerosmith\" is never really as attractive in my page as Alice Cooper's \"School Out\". However, from the moment the \"old song and dance\" broke my eardrum, \"spreading the wings\" attracted people's attention. Aerosmith has found where they want to go. Although they have not yet mastered the part of making five-star \"rock and roll\" \"toys in the Attic\", they have solved the dirt and cheese and the familiar humour so that any rock musician knows they understand. Between this album and debut album, Steven Taylor gained a lot of control over this sound. In \"Aerosmith\", this sounds like someone who wants to be a blues player, not sure about him when it's time to relax. In \"Get Your Wings\", you get the authorization. He roared, roared, and (in \"Seasons of Wither\") made many soundtracks this way, as if the band had hired a new lead singer. Likewise with Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, they certainly understand the sound of the guitar. Listen to \"SOS\" and their old Yardbirds \"Train A'Rollin\" cover, as the best in The Who's Rolling Stones. Aerosmith has also figured out a way to add some of the lyrics to the songs (\"Pandora's Box\" and \"Old Songs and Dances\") without making it sound as sweet, which compliments the band's self-confidence. Dirt, laziness and an earthquake, \"Get your wings\" is the sound of a band coming out. As a pioneer of the two best albums of the seventys, it\u2019s a highlight for Aerosmith.

Lee Alexander who wrote a lot of songs from the last CD writes most of the tracks along with Nora. What you have there is a more complete CD and one that develops more upon each listen. This CD has no obvious singles, so the beauty is to be discovered. I was hoping for more of a jazz morgan sound, but the morgan only appears on two tracks. I would describe this, still like the first CD, as jazzy nocturnal sounding with some country western overtones. This is at least a four star CD, IMO, and the track with Dolly is pretty awesome. Do yourself a favor and buy this. You will be surprised how different in concert the songs will be played. It will be nice to compare them.

This takes a little deep listening. It took me a good three spins before \"Witch Cults\" clicked. I played it quiet. I played it cloud. I cleaned the kitchen to it. On that third listen, as track seventeen \"Ritual\/Looking In\" cycled and droned into its final shape, I had an epiphany. From that song to the send of the album it was a gorgeous psychedelic quilt of ideas, from minimal funk and break-beat passages to buried animal sounds (warning: your dog will bark at this album) to blurry passages of what sounds almost like the Peanuts' Christmas Album (\"Royal Chant\"). It's magic. And yes, it's the kind of magic that makes reindeer fly - psychedelic magic. Primal and messy and hungry, capable of crystalline beauty as much as yawning black mouths of anonymous menace. Normally, I'm a proponent of linear experience. Listen to albums start to finish, the way the artists intended them. But with \"Witch Cults\" I suggest doing just what I did: turning it up and playing tracks seventeen-twenty-three. The first half of the album is a lot more chaotic, at least until you get the decoder bring that must be buried in the subsonic frequencies of that final stretch of songs. Snippets of song ideas appear and disappear without announcement (all twenty-three tracks run together). Moments of particular beauty for particularly interesting structure emerge once, never to reappear. It's a little crazy, as if deliberately designed to make you feel slightly off-center. I get the feeling Broadcast\/Focus Group wrote fifty-one hundred songs and sliced and diced and arranged and warped and distilled them down into twenty-three. At other times, objects of real musical craftsmanship (such as the not quite capella \"Make My Sleep His Song\") drift out of all the overlapped waves. I don't think my listening method should be the ONLY way to listen to it, obviously, but it helped me get over the hump with this one. now I listen to it start to finish. It has been suggested by more than one reviewer that this sort of music could only have been produced under the influence. I, on the other hand, have a hard time believing something that takes me on such an intricate, dense and layered journey could be the random outcomes of mind alteration. To me, this feels like more of a drug-free trip, the kind that just uses the natural chemicals already in your body and engages the primitive part of your brain. Then again, song titles like \"Drug Party\" suggest I might be wrong. Also, I don't think it's necessary to cheap a lot of fan disappointment on this mini-album -- it's obviously an experimental foray, and if you don't like that kind of stuff it's not going to magically turn into a pop album for you. No need to punish the band for following their muse.\". Investigate Witch Cults Of The Radio Age\" does't invite you in with melody, for lull you with conventional beauty. It pushes you. I admit, I like the weird stuff. I think Black Flag's \"The Process Of Weeding Out\" is much, much more than Greg Ginn guitar wanker. I even kinda like \"Lumpy Gravy\" and \"Metal Machine Music\" . really! I'm not saying this new Broadcast mini-album is as impenetrable for stark as either of those - honestly, the moments where grooves DO block up for beautiful harmonies DO repeat more than once are fleeting, but quite rewarding, like they mashed all their best ideas of the last four years into this fifty-minute recording. If they're willing to traverse this sort of territory for this mini-album, I'm excited to see these methods applied to less abstract song frameworks.

From that song to the shipping of the album it was a very nice and thoughtful idea, from a little fun and break-up quotes to buried animal sounds (warning: your dog will be fierce in this album) up to The intricacies of what sounds like Owning a Christmas Album (\"Royal Chant\"). It's magic. Yes, this is the kind of magic that makes a flying pilot - the magic of the mind. Introduction and confusion and hunger, capable of beauty of crystals as they yawn in the black mouth of unknown danger. Usually, I am a direct experienced advocate. Listen to albums that are about to send, just as the artists intend. But in \u201cThe Challenges of Magic\u201d I suggest doing just what I could: to roll and play twenty -three and twenty -three songs. The first part of the album is a lot of excitement, at least until you see the decoder that needs to be buried in the table below for the last of those songs. Fragments of song ideas appear and disappear without notice (all twenty -three paths come together). Moments of unique beauty with an interesting structure appear simultaneously, without reappearing. It\u2019s a little crazy, as if it was deliberately designed to make you feel pretty out of place. I think the Broadcast \/ Focus Group has written fifty hundred and one hundred songs that have been cut, edited and distorted and divided into twenty-three. At other times, elements of true musical part (such as the smaller \u201cMake My Sleeping Song Her\u201d) appear from all the overlapping waves. I don\u2019t think my listening system is the ONLY way I listen, obviously, but it helped me get past it. now I\u2019m listening and it\u2019s starting to send. More than one reviewer has suggested that this type of music is only possible through influence. For me, on the other hand, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that something that will take me on this hectic, dense and layered journey could be the inevitable result of brain change. To me, this seems like a journey without drugs, the only kind of use of natural chemicals in your body focused on the front part of your brain. Again, the names of songs like \u201cDrug Party\u201d suggest I may be wrong. Also, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to break the frustration of a lot of fans with this little album - it\u2019s obviously a test trend, and if you don\u2019t like things like this it won\u2019t suddenly be a pop album for to you. There is no need to punish the group that follows their museum. It pushes you. I admit, I love amazing things. I think the Black Flag of the \u201cExit Process\u201d is bigger than the Greg Ginn rocket-gun. I even like \u201cLumpy Gravy\u201d and \u201cMetal Machine\u201d. Really! I\u2019m not saying that this new Broadcast album is unbearable in the same way as they are - honestly, the moments that cut -outs prevent good self -alignment from NOT being repeated more than once. is something that is happening, but they are very rewarding, because they broke all the best ideas in the last four years when recorded in fifty minutes. If they\u2019re willing to across this kind of ground for this little album, I\u2019m happy to see these techniques applied to the structure of intangible songs. I leave much interest in their appropriate length, which fits twelve thousand.","overall":5,"summary":"possibly the psychedelic record of the decade!","unixReviewTime":1260057600,"reviewTime":"12 6, 2009"}

It requires a little deep listening. I had three beautiful twists before clicking on \"Dine Cultus\". I played it quietly. I played Cloud. I cleaned the kitchen with it. On this third hearing, as the seventeenth track \"Formal \/ In Search\" got on a bicycle and was finally run, I had a strange experience. From this song to the posting of the album was a huge psychological idea, from the little funk and the rustling of animal voices (\"royal slogan\") to this magic. And yes, that's the kind of magic that makes a polar deer fly - psychedelic magic. Basic and annoying and hungry, this Crystal Line knows beauty as much as running the black clips of an unknown danger. In general, I support the line experience. Listen to albums that are just about to run out, just as the artists intended. But with \"Dine Cultus\" I suggest that I do what I have done: open it and play seventeen and twenty-three songs. The first half of the album is very chaotic, at least until you get the decoder delivery buried in the subsonic frequency of this last song information. Captions of song ideas appear and disappear without announcement (all twenty-three tracks running simultaneously). The times of a particular beauty of a very interesting building appear once, never again. It's a little crazy, as if it's deliberately designed to make you feel out of place. It seems to me that the Broadcast \/ Focus group wrote five hundred and fifty songs that were cut and composed and edited and found and are-added. Sometimes, real-life musical instruments (like Capella Nan - \"Sing My Sleep\") are swept away by the waves. I don't think my way of listening should be the only way to listen to it, obviously, but it has helped me overcome the hump. Now I hear it begin to fade. It has been suggested by multiple reviewers that this type of music can only be performed under the influence. On the other hand, I find it hard to believe that what takes me on this complex, crowded and linear journey could be the unintended consequences of mind-altering change. To me, it sounds like a drug-free journey, the kind that only uses the natural chemicals in your body and affects the first part of your brain. Then, the title of songs like \"Drug Party\" suggests that I might be wrong. Also, I don't think it's necessary to cheapen the big embarrassment of the fans on this mini album - obviously it's an honor to test it, and if you don't like that kind of thing, it does't turn magic into a pop album. Will do . You don't have to punish this group for following its museum. . It's strong. I admit, I like weird stuff. I think Black Flag's \"Process of Wedding Out\" is more than Greg Jin's Guitar Wanker. I even look like \"Lampy Gravy\" and \"Metal Machine Music\". Really! I'm not saying this new broadcast mini album in't as accessible as it used to be - honestly, the time when the drain stops good coordination often ends, but it's a huge reward, because They all consider the best of the last four years in this fifty minute recording. If you're willing to cut this kind of field in this mini-album, I'm glad to see these techniques used in non-stop singing genres. It makes me long for the next full length, two thousand and ten.","overall":5,"summary":"possibly the psychedelic record of the decade!","unixReviewTime":1260057600,"reviewTime":"12 6, 2009"}

This requires intense listening. Before clicking on \"witch churches\", I turned three times. I play very quietly. I played cloud. I cleaned the kitchen. In the third listener, when the seventeenth song \u201cCulture \/ View\u201d was played on a loop and eventually took its place, I had an epiphany. From this song to the introduction of the album, it's a fantastic psychedelic whole, from the smallest funk and crack to the sounds of hidden animals (warning: your dog will bark at this album) to sound almost like a Peanut Christmas album (\"Royal Poem\"). This is magic. Yes, this kind of magic makes reindeer fly-psychedelic magic. The first, rotten and hungry, with a crystal-like beauty, like a black mouth of unnamed threat. Usually, I am a longtime sponsor. Listen to the album from beginning to send, as the artists want. But for the sake of \"Witch Cults\", I suggest I do what I did: open up and play seventeen-twenty-three tracks. The first half of the album is a mess, at least before you get the decoder, it should be buried at the lowest speed of the last song. Pieces of song ideas appear and disappear without notice (all twenty-three songs go together). The particularly momentous moment of an interesting structure appears once, and will never reappear. It's a bit confusing, it seems like it was deliberately designed to make you feel out of place in the middle. I feel like the radio \/ focus group wrote five thousand, one hundred songs, then cut, cut, adjusted, twisted and adjusted twenty-three songs. Sometimes, real musical part objects (such as \"I Made My Sleep His Song\" which is not entirely capella) float all over the waves. Obviously, I don\u2019t think my listening style might be the only way to listen, but it has helped me overcome this problem. Now I listen from beginning to send. More than one critic has said that this type of music can only be produced under the influence. On the other hand, it is hard for me to believe that what has allowed me to go on such a difficult, robust journey and assignment can be the unintended consequence of a change of mind. To me, this feels more like a non-toxic journey. This journey uses only the natural chemicals that are already in your body and allows the first area of your brain to function. Also, the title of a song like \u201cgroup of drugs\u201d suggests that I may be wrong. Additionally, I don't think it's necessary to minimize the frustration of many fans on this day - this is clearly an attempt. There is no need to punish the band for following their lines. \"Investigate Witchcraft in Radio Age\" will not invite you with a song, but with traditional beauty to bring you down. It's a push. I admit, I like the weird stuff. I think the black flag \"Out Grow Program\" is more than Greg Ginn's guitar. I even liked the genre \"Lumpy Gravy\" and \"Metal Machine Music\". really! I'm not saying the new disc-recorder can't pass like all of them - honestly, the grooves hinder good harmony. Repeat times more than one are short, but rewarding, like them. The best ideas for the past four years are in this fifty-minute record. If they are willing to go through this section on this small album, I am very happy to see these techniques used in a vague musical framework. This makes me really look forward to their next length, which ends in two thousand and ten.","overall":5,"summary":"possibly the psychedelic record of the decade!","unixReviewTime":1260057600,"reviewTime":"12 6, 2009"}
