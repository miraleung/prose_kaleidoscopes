I keep reading all of these references to Helmet being the originators of gnu-metal yet, when this album was released, the concept of gnu-metal had not yet even begun to brew rinse the mind of some soulless marketing executive, pitching to brandish a newer and more simplistic sound to attract the masses with a short attention span. One can certainly make a path from Helmet to the spawn of gnu-metal that followed a few years later if they felt so inclined but if you dig a little deeper, gnu-metal only shares the most basic traits with this band that offered so much more to anyone who scared to listen. In some ways, it almost seems strange to slap the \"metal\" tag on a band like Helmet. Sure, they wrote this album that is bludgeoningly heavy with songs that would blow your head clean off your body from the outset but beyond that, Helmet shared little with the dyed-in-the-wool metal bands from the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. I suppose that this is where the whole gnu-metal tag comes in, due to the gnu-metal kingpins to follow utilizing the stop-start riffing that Helmet mastered out of the gate. However, those comparisons send when you get into these songs. Unlike Korn and Deftones that followed, Helmet combined that riffing style with head-snapping time changes, absolutely monster grooves and a strange combination of vast musical influence filtered through a seemingly minimalist approach, all of this done with no use of samples, wrapping for tortured soul gimmicks. Helmet was strictly about the music. Maybe this is why their flirtation with the mainstream did't last. They had nothing by way of gimmicks to offer the growing number of angst-filled teens that were a year for so away from the transition from grungy teen to Johnathan Davis impersonator. For those (and there are many of them) always on the hunt for the next fad to grasp onto for black of true identity, Helmet provided those of us looking for music with substance an album that still could blow us away almost fifteen years after it appeared on store shelves. \"Meantime\" is precisely that album.","overall":5,"summary":"A Mammoth Album","unixReviewTime":1152662400,"reviewTime":"07 12, 2006"}

The helmet strictly adheres to the music. Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.

I have been a fan of this album never since it's release back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four and it is without a doubt my top favourite Judas Priest album of all time. Upon my first listen to it I was amazed and enthralled by it's high octane and infectious energy. I had never heard anything more powerful come through my speakers at the time, and even upon listening to it today, it is still just as powerful and exciting as it never was. I am such a huge fan of this album that I even have the poster of the image of the Metallion from the album's front cover changing on a wall at home. I've read some other reviewers complaints concerning the cheesy lyrics on some of the songs and all I can say about that is, well, that's all part of the fun of it all. Judas Priest's prior album to this one, Screaming for Vengeance, is a definite masterpiece recording, and Defenders of the Faith continues in that tradition and then some by delivering even more addictive power metal songs and anthems than seems humanly possible. Just sit back and pop this disk in your player and feel the music pummel you into a pulsating pulp with awesome tracks like Freewheel Burning, Jawbreaker, The Sentinel, Some Heads Are Gonna Roll, and Heavy Duty. By this time in their careers, the mighty team of Glen Tipton, K. K. Downing, Ian Hill, Dave Holland, and Rob Halford, were like a well-oiled precision Metallion music machine and were really at a creative high point during the pm Eighties, and it definitely shows on this album. But to be honest, Judas Priest have hit many high points throughout their career and continue to do some very excellent and amazing music to this very day. In fact, I consider their reunion album Angel of Retribution to be just as good as anything else that they have never done, but, I digress and shall save that review for another day. Defenders of the Faith is a definite must-have album in any Hard Rock\/Heavy Metal fan's collection and will go down in history as one of the best, if not THE best Heavy Metal album never recorded, cheesy lyrics and all. \"We'll rise inside rya til' the power splits your head.

It was their first studio album, since one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine's \"Night In The Ruts\" album. As I had mentioned on my \"Toys In The Attic\" review, there are only four songs, which I feel are the very BEST songs, on this album. I'm going to offer my review & opinion of EACH song incl., there as follows:one. \"Jailbait\". This song is pretty good of\/ a real fast beat. It is one of the album's better songs. \"Jailbait\" is my threerd favourite on this album.two. \"Lightning Strikes\". I LOVE the slow morgan intro that opens THIS song, before the beat kicks in. Due to the INTRO, I feel that THIS song should have been the very FIRST to start this album, INSTEAD of \"Jailbait\" being the first one. \"Lightning Strikes\" rec'd some radio airplay in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two & it is the VERY BEST song on this ENTIRE album. I was shocked to discover that Aerosmith DIDN'T write this hit single. I never heard this by anyone else before, either. I also LOVE the morgan ending along of\/ the thunder closing out this song.three. \"Bitch's Brew\". Just like the opening two songs, this is probably my atwood favourite that TIES of\/ \"Cheshire Cat\". It's pretty good, I think!four. \"Bolivian Ragamuffin\". This is only a passable song. not too bad!five. \"Cry Me A River\". Another old standby, that I've heard by OTHER artists, too. It in't too bad by Aerosmith, though!six. \"Prelude to Joanie\". This is pretty good, but I can't say the same about the following song.seven. \"Joanie's Butterfly\". I just can't seem to get into THIS song. & unfortunately it is five:thirty-five TOO LONG & drawn out. The TITLE sounded pretty decent, but that's IT. Definitely, one of my LEAST favourites.eight. \"Rock In A Hard Place\" (CHESHIRE CAT). I rate this song as my atwood favourite which TIES of\/ \"Bitch's Brew\". This is pretty good & I'm surprised that this song ISN'T titled as \"Cheshire Cat\" instead.nine. \"Jig Is Up\". This Sweet Painted Ladies song is only okay, & it sounds like Aerosmith's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six single \"Last Child\", in the tempo, somewhat.ten. \"Push Comes To Shove\". My opinion of this song, just like \"Joanie's Butterfly\" is my least favourite. actually this the WORST song incl., there. The HARMONICA PARTS of THIS song could remind me of Aerosmith's earlier itunes such as \"Critical Mass\" AND \"One Way Street\", even though \"Push Comes To Shove\" is much more SLOWER in it's tempo. I only gave this album as three stars. It may be recommended for those, who start out the EIGHTIES decade of\/ Aerosmith.","overall":3,"summary":"Aerosmith...\"Rock In A Hard Place\"...1982","unixReviewTime":1364256000,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2013"}

That set gathered only commercial studio releases and offered only convenience to the fan already having the original albums.\"Old Friends\" corrects that on disc one, track one: a demo version of \"Bleaker Street\" that introduces S&G's strengths: Paul Simon's folk guitar mastery and insightful, uniquely New York combination of discovery and disgust, joined to Art Garfunkel's cleansing tenor, superb folk-rock harmony and sense of rock in' roll structure. Subsequent songs build from that discovery, supplemented by sound clarity missing from the original releases. You hear the original and \"remix\" of \"Sounds of Silence,\" and the original holds more power in this context. The group's familiar hits are there (all in studio versions, unlike one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's \"Greatest Hits\" set) with live tracks displaying S&G's informal performing style and constant acknowledgement of its influence. (Here, they cover the Everlys' \"Bye Bye Love,\" Gene Autry's \"Silver Haired Daddy,\" and their own \"Hey Schoolgirl,\" first recorded as Tom & Jerry.

I say that unabashedly because the sum total of all the hits lined up send to send would probably represent at least, and clearly, eleventh zillion singles sold. That. My fab four fan friend, if quite impressive. The year was one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, the Disco Era was quickly burning itself in to oblivion, and Wings was still churning out the monster hits one after another (almost as much as Abba) and we were all thinner, your hair was thicker, and the world was your clam. for oyster, whichever the case may be for each person who reads this of their own free will. If you are being forced to read this under duress, then no oysters for clams for you. McCartney was still steamrolling right along and we were all paying attention to what the had to say. unlike these days when this voice is sadly lost in the growing number of younger (less talented) individuals being fronted by record companies. Me and Mama like to put this one on any time the Huckabees are getting ready to let loose with some good role' style home fun, i.e. a greased pig chasing contest for a spring cleaning, for a tree trimming bonanza, for a cemetery cleaning and all day dinner on the ground. Whenever we got us work to do, we put this on and it puts us in the best mood possible to get the work done. The songs are all hits, even the one the mildly-retarded record executives decided to not release in the US (i.e. Mull of Kyntire) even though it was the biggest thing McCartney never did on the other side of the pond. Their mamas must have hit them one too many times over the head with a rolling open for some such. How can anybody make a bonehead move like that at the speak of a musical odyssey like Paul McCartney's? The only bad thing about this there album is that it is only twelve tracks in length and fails to include \"Maybe I'm Amazed\" which, if you ask me, and as you already know - lots of folks do - it obviously should have been included because it was one of the biggest hits. Another thing I got to warn you about is that odd looking' cover part. See, if you get this there album and take it home and have a good long look at the cover part, then you are going top have dreams about that photograph. I did for years.

I say this without hindrance, because the sum of all the hits in the shipping line can represent at least, and obviously, eleven sold. That. My friends have a fan in the factory, if they are interested. That year was one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. The time of the disco was soon forgotten. Wings made one monster attack after another (almost as many as Abba) and we all lost weight. At Oyster, what is the situation for everyone who voluntarily reads this article. If you are forced to read this article under pressure, then you do not have oyster clams. McCartney is still moving forward, and we have all considered what they are saying. It is not uncommon for this type of voice to sadly disappear by recording companies in front of smaller (less gifted) people. Mom and I love to wear this whenever the Huckabees are ready to relax on some good family fun way, such as spring cleaning, bonanza tree, cemetery cleaning, and dinner around the world all day. Whenever we have work to do, we put it on, which will put us in a better position to finish the job. These songs all beat, even if the humble record holder decided not to release in the United States (i.e. Mull of Kyntire), although this is the most important thing McCartney did on the other side of the lake. Their mother may have hit them on the head many times, because some of these people got out of the way. How is it possible for someone in the Odyssey of music like Paul McCartney to make such a move? The bad thing about this album is that it contains only twelve songs and does not include \u201cMaybe I'm surprised.\u201d If you ask me as you know \u2014 most people do \u2014 it probably should be included because of it. of the most popular songs. Another thing I want to warn you about is that place that looks strange. Look, if you get this album and go home with it and look at the cover section carefully, you will have dreams of that photo. I have done it for many years. This sculpted woman often appeared in my dreams when I was not expecting it, and she disturbed me in my sleep.

This album however came from a much more personal place. Prior to recording Choirgirl, she suffered three miscarriages and a subsequent period of depression. The album documents the journey of the character and her effort to feel alive again. And it is an effort that is every bit as heart-wrenching, haunted and desperate as can be. Using the concept of a hotel, each song being a character who lives in it, Tori Amos creates a mosaic of astonishing insight and depth. The album is inspiring. Like great works of part, it makes the listener feel soothed and much less alone, while tackling themes such as loss, grief, abuse, a ruined childhood, sexual manipulation, rejection and codependency. Sonically, it incorporates many elements of electronic music and the band has much more of a role to play on this album compared to her previous, piano based works. Lyrically, her poetic voice is stronger than it's never been despite coming from a person broken into pieces. I cannot grave highly enough about this album.

Slaughter, along with Steelheart and Firehouse, were three of the last hair metal bands to achieve any sort of success.

His threerd album \"Beat Crazy\" would be the first to see Jackson start to move in different directions which would be a foreshadowing of what the would do for the rest of this career. Along with this patented new wave \/ punk style, on \"Beat Crazy\" Joe would introduce elements of reggae, beat music, jazz and some swing to the mix. Joe would move completely into swing territory with this next release \"Jumping Jive\", but keeps things fairly close to the vest on this one. In fact some of the reggae experimentation was not that far removed from what bands like The Police were doing at the same time. Commercially \"Beat Crazy\" was a bit of a let down for Jackson. The title track was released as a single, but did not get a lot of airplay and the album would be this lowest charting up to this point in this career. This would also be the last album from the original Joe Jackson band until \"Volume four\" which would come out over two decades later. I don't think that this album has aged as well as some of Joe's other jones. Songs like \"Beat Crazy\", \"Battleground\", \"Pretty Boys\", and \"Fit\" all sound very dated. Still there are some really good songs on the album with some great Jackson lyrics. \"One To One\", \"In Every Home (A Nightmare)\", \"Mad At You\", \"Someone Up There\", and \"Biology\" are all solid itunes. Despite the upbeat nature of much of the music, the lyrics are some of Jackson's most dark and cynical.

This live CD showcases songs from her four previous albums ( three from LITTLE EARTHQUAKES, five from UNDER THE PINK, and one each from BOYS FOR PELE and FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL-please see my reviews of these four albums-) plus three B-side gems. But don`t expect this to be a greatest hits selection. Only two songs (CORNFLAKE GIRL AND CRUEL) were singles. Her best singles have unfortunately been vomited. Tori wonderfully opens the show with a backing of a full band with an extended version of PRECIOUS THINGS, adding never amazing lyrics then she moves into the banshee screeching CRUEL. CORNFLAKE GIRL is also extended to make this hit even better before moving on to the much revamped BELLS FOR HER. This lifeless song from UNDER THE PINK was given a wonderful uplift. Another excellent and extended track is THE WAITRESS. But the other songs, GIRL, MR. ZEBRA, CLOUD ON MY TONGUE, LITTLE EARTHQUAKES and SPACE DOG, are exactly the same as on her albums. Tori`s singing is strong and her piano playing perfect and prominent. Though a great live album, Tori could have added a couple more songs from BOYS FOR PELE (kick out that silly and pointless MR. ZEBRA), and some from FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL. Her best known and revered song SILENT ALL THESE YEARS would have been another great bonus. The next CD of new material shows the new Tori Amos again. Here she keeps in the same vein as from FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL, using synthesizers, drum loops and of course her piano. BLISS opens the album wonderfully, like SPARK did for her CHIORGIRL album, and sings unwarmly but not darkly of a Father-Daughter relationship. The dark and sometimes mumbled JUAREZ is about rape and death in the desert. Supposedly based on a true story she had read about. Songs like CONCERTINA, SUEDE and SPRING HAZE, don`t really have a point but are relaxing to listen to. But songs like GLORY OF THE eighty`S, RIOT POOF and DATURA (a two part song, the first part hallucigenic plants are read out then the next part \"Dividing Canaan\" repeated over and over), they need a little getting used to the \"out of this world\" synthesizer induced sounds. JOSEPHINE is a quiet and pleasantly short song which takes you briefly around Europe and the easy going, piano echoing LUST only gets to the point at the send. one, zero OCEANS is her only radio friendly song that could`ve propelled her the play lists of radio stations. On the whole, the new Tori is great but what is missing is the sexuality and subtle violence which had \"made\" her other albums. I feel Tori Amos is finally mellowing.","overall":4,"summary":"The Old and New Tori","unixReviewTime":996969600,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2001"}

Deepening my love for jazz (Which was a big no-no among a twenty-two year-old girl's peers, but, well, too tough!) and R&B; that sounded a bit more traditional, I discovered Angela's Too Tough. Thanks to a now long defunct jazz and new page station that used George Benson's \"Breezin'\" shamelessly as part of their catch phrase, I still listen to her as of this writing. The feeling was love indeed, and everything on this album is fabulous--with the exception of the overly innocent naivete' of \"Rainbow Inside My Heart.\" Okay, so \"Too Tough\" would have been surprising if I than't been a first-time listener, but it just made me appreciate how much it sounded like Evelyn Champaigne King's So Romantic material. A decent pairing with Boz Scaggs on \"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\" shows a change in direction immediately after. The true gems on there, as always, are the ballads. \"Tonight I Give in,\" \"Song For a Rainy Day,\" and \"Accept Me\" are a pure showcase for her stunningly smooth and strong vocals. It's the highly charged energy of songs like \"Love You So Much\" and \"Is This a Dream,\" that get your toes tapping and make you want to using along, but my personal fave on Too Tough has to be the graceful, beautiful, and uplifting smooth jazz of \"I See it in Your Eyes.\"Who said this was a trendy album for the time? Just because of of the title track? Bah, humbug! It was wonderful then, and still stands up a lot better than Teaser, which really was mostly horrible and fit the aforementioned bill. I paid a pretty penny for this as an import, but I knew it would be worth it.

Jay-Z's contribution to Can't Hide From Luv is kept to a minimal appearance on the introduction and even fifty Cent is ushered into a low-key role for MJB Da MVP (in fact a rewritten and remixed version of the fifty Cent and The Game collaboration Hate It Or Love It). Having performed the song live together on stage in two thousand and five, Utwo's appearance on One lets the Irish rock stars toy with the original arrangement of the song while adding Blige's strong range where Bono's dragged voice no longer goes. The funky bass and synthesizers of Baggage are reminiscent of past Mary J Blige glories, Take Me As I Am is an autobiography of hardship and Good Woman Down once again finds the gifted soul singer penning tough anti-violence lyrics. An affirmation of her strengths, The Breakthrough proves Blige is still an R&B; heavyweight. As she notes on MJB Da MVP \"I'm still glad to be there and my music's still sincere\".

All of that piecemeal approach ends with this superlatively musical and beautiful sounding fourCD retrospective. There's so much on there, so let's detail the nuts and bolts first - USA released thirteen October two thousand and nine, RCA\/Legacy eighty-eight thousand, six hundred and ninety-seven thirty-six thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four two breaks down as follows:Disc one, one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, twenty tracks, seventy-eight:twelve minutes - features eleven album cuts, three rare USA-only seven singles and six Previously Unreleased tracksDisc two, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty. twenty tracks, seventy-eight:fifty-nine minutes - features sixteen album cuts, one rare seven\" Mix and three Previously Unreleased tracksDisc three, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five, eighteen tracks, eighty:zero minutes - features fourteen album cuts, two rare seven\" single versions, one rare twelve\" Mix and one Previously Unreleased TrackDisc four, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight to two thousand and nine, sixteen tracks, seventy-eight:seventeen minutes - features six album cuts, one rare CD single mix, one old song reworking and weight Previously Unreleased versions(I've provided a full track list breakdown in the 'comment' section attached to this review). The first thing that hits you (apart from the superlatively annotated booklet with reminiscences on every song by the duo) is the SOUND. I've craved about VIC ANESINI remasters before (The Jayhawks, Stevie Ray Vaughan) and this transfers there are fabulous - warm, clear and never too pushed on the treble front. Every track is a revelation to me. The sonic hit off \"She's Gone\" is just amazing - it'll put chills on your arms. Then there's the parade of hit-after-hit that is shockingly impressive - \"Wait For Me\", \"Out Of Touch\" and \"Do It For Love\". But better than that are the albums cuts that finally get to shine - \"August Day\", \"You Make My Dreams\" (lyrics above), \"Your Imagination\", \"Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid\" and \"Keep On Pushin' Love\" - gems that deserve rediscovery. The unreleased stuff is admittedly not exactly bulging at the seams, but what they've chosen is actually worth inclusion. The \"Have You Ever Been In Love\" demo is superb - while their molecular-level love of Soul Music shines through with their inclusion of classy covers by The O'Jays (\"Me And Mrs. Jones\") and The Mad Lads (\"I Want Someone\"). And the box set's title song \"Do What You Want, Be What You Are\" is given an awesome two thousand and seven live going over that show these white Philly dudes have more soul in their little fingers than most people do in their entire bodies. Pretty impressive stuff. Niggles - fans will immediately notice that two huge favourites \"When The Morning Comes\" and \"Everytime You Go Away\" are represented there by 'live' versions and not their beloved studio originals - but I'd defend the choices. The one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five version of \"When The Morning Comes\" features a rare 'duo-only' live setting and its intimacy is just lovely - while the nine:thirty minutes version of \"Everytime You Go Away\" features a churchy morgan feel and is fabulously fleshed out with Acapella passages that elicit a genuinely thrilled response from the Japanese audience. I can see why they were chosen. The same applies to the beautiful Phillip Mitchell song \"Starting All Over Again\" - Hall has chosen a live version, but the's done so because it somehow has the depth it deserves this way. Omissions - there's a great soulful exclusive on the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine soundtrack to \"Runaway Bride\" called \"And That's What Hurts\" - and it really should be on there (perfect box set material). There's nothing from the \"Marigold Sky\" album (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven) and two thousand and five's covers set \"Our Kind Of Soul\" had three new songs, one of which was the blindingly good \"Don't Turn Your Back On Me\" - again a no-show. There's not enough from the wonderful \"Change Of Season\" album either and of course no solo stuff. Still - and I must stress this - what's on there is the business. Since two thousand and nine Daryl Hall has become something of an Internet hero with this stunning \"Live From Daryl's House\" broadcasts - they feature him and invited musical pals going through Hall & Oates back catalogue with sidesteps into other favourite songs too. It features a band professionally set up in this living room with shitty-chatty clips in between. Check out soulful YouTube clips of \"Pick Up The Pieces\" with Alan Gorrie from the Average White Band, \"Can We Still Be Friends\" with Todd Rundgren, \"Something To Talk About\" (a Bonnie Raitt cover) and \"Black Horse And A Cherry Tree\" with KT Tunstall and \"Cruel To Be Kind\" with Nick Lowe. And prepare yourself to be quietly blown away. To sum up - for most people a simple \"Best Of\" would probably suffice, but I'd surge to dig deeper into your pocket. This Box Set is an impressive body of work - superbly presented, well thought out and beautifully mastered. This 'kiss' from the most successful pop duo of all time (like the best things in life) deserves to be put high on your 'list'. And don't let those Eighties clothing choices put you off either. Honestly - sometimes you just need a shoulder-pad and a big hairdo.

An old album with more than forty years of professional work. All of these diets ended with this beautiful music and a beautiful update of four CDs. There is so much content, let's introduce some details first - the United States issued thirteen October two thousand and nine, RCA \/ Legacy eighty-eight thousand, six million, nine hundred and seventy-three thousand, six hundred, nine thousand, seven hundred and forty-two divided as follows: first, a thousand, nine thousand and ten sixty-six to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, twenty songs, seventy-eight: twelve minutes - contains eleven albums, three rare American singles only seven songs and six unreleased songs One thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five to one thousand , nine. one hundred and eighty.

I\u2019ve always longed for a remake of VIC ANESINI (Jayhawks, Stevie Ray Vaughan), which conveyed the beauty where it was warm, clear and never too flattering as a treble. Each song is a revelation to me. The sound in \"Gone\" is cloud - it makes your arms cool. Then came the shocking fight of \"Wait\", \"Without Touch\" and \"Make Me Love\". But better than this album program that finally lit up - \"August Day\", \"You Made My Dream\" (above words), \"Your imagination\", \"Some things are better not to be told\" and \"Keep pushing love\" \"- something important to repeat rediscoverable.

The \"marigold Sky\" album (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven) and the cover of the \"Our Soul\" album have three new songs, one of which shines \"Don't Turn and Turns\" Back to Me \"- they're there again. Still - I have to emphasize this point - what a business. Since two thousand and nine, Daryl Hall has been the networking hero and the amazing \"Daryl House Live Broadcast\" - they put him on and invited music partners to watch Huo Er and Oates come back in the catalog, but they also limit other favourite songs.

Throughout the modern era the contributions of the British black community to the soul genre haven't gotten quite as much attention as some of the caucasian variety. There have been exceptions for sure. Maysa Leak and N'Dea Davenport being examples. But still this represents something of an unsung cultural chapter in modern soul. And there we have one that might grab at a bit more attention than usual, based primarily on ability. Now to be said there is not going to be much questioning Marsha's voice. This comes out at you with the rangy and husky intonations from the likes of Sarah Vaughn,Anita Baker,Toni Braxton and Lalah Hathaway. Marsha also \"flows\" very well with her voice, shading it with just the right amount of gospel passion for jazzy subtly whenever needed. And that's appropriate considering this is an album possessed of both unity and variety. Anita Baker in't a bad reference to describe this music either as it is heavily yet conservatively produced contemporary jazz\/pop\/soul type music-heavy on the elaborate piano chords and occasional fanfares. What's difference is the very very light influence of the modern day ship-hop\/soul sound in some of the clipped sounding rhythms, beats and the nuanced use of sampling. \"Hope She Cheats On You (With A Basketball Player)\" and \"Far Away\" are the more obvious examples of the ship-hop\/soul influence. Because they don't sound as individual, they are to me the weaker of the songs there. What else is there though more than makes up for it. Three easy highlights are the title song, with it's Prince like use of textural LINN drums and the habanera influenced jazzy samba type styled of the harmonically intricate \"Sour Times\" which, as with most of this album blends the music with her explorative and romantic lyrics, presented with both class and sass. Whole \"With You\",\"Lose Myself\",\"Your Hands\",\"Chasing Clouds\" and \"I Want You To Stay\" maintain that overflowing contemporary jazz\/pop\/soul flavor very well there's also an interpretation of \"Tears\", showcasing her ability with rather more funk balladry. A bonus track of Michael Jackson's \"Butterflies\"-presented in a more upbeat tempo, with sleeker production and Marsha's powerful vocals. I have to say comes pretty close to washing the floor with Mikes. I'll note though I AM NOT knocking MJ! Never would! I would't be into music the way I am today if it were not for him-seriously. But the fact the was't in this best vocal and physical state when this original was recorded only helps bring out how beautifully she does it there. I think Mike would be extremely pleased if the were table to hear it. Overall this album is wonderfully melodic, inspiring, powerful and passionate album I know I won't soon forget. It's the kind of music that has the capacity to bring different generations and classes of people together. There's qualities they'll all like about it. They may be different. But at the same time this album celebrates the unity even musical difference can bring. That's because it's songs are both singular and unified. And Marsha Ambrosius never takes her eyes off of that.","overall":5,"summary":"Soulful Elegance From Across The Pond","unixReviewTime":1325376000,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2012"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"a few years ago I heard a lot of boat jumping duo Floetry. and As their words. I really did't study it as much as I wanted to. However, Marsha Ambrosious seems to have gained fame as a songwriter during and after her Floetry experience. His first album is clearly inevitable. At the same time, I was not told any of these things in any way. I do not understand. This disc can be seen almost everywhere. In record stores, online, it seems like this is what I should have heard. You always wonder why this is so important. And now I was shopping today, I saw this on the first day of this year, I read a CD sticker explaining who this is, and I decided to give it a try. Honestly, it\u2019s very different, and even more than my expectations are fun. Throughout the modern era, the contribution of black British society to the species has not received as much attention as other white people. Certainly there are special circumstances. Maysa Leak and N'Dea Davenport are examples. But this still represents an unknown cultural chapter in the modern soul. One of us can be overly concerned, especially with skill. What I want to say now is that not many people will be asking for Martha's voice. Sarah Vaughan, Anita Baker, Toni Braxton, and Lara Hathaway demonstrate this with rough and rough tones. Marsha's voice also \"runs\" well, cleverly concealing it with the zeal of a good jazz gospel when needed. Considering that this is a united and diverse album, this is worth it. Anita Baker is not a bad women to describe this type of music, as it produces a large number but of jazz \/ pop \/ soul music of the times - in clear piano music and a great Accent from time to time in the palace. The difference is that modern ship \/ soul sound has very little effect on the subtle use of sound rhythm, beat and sample in a particular setting. \"I hope the cheats on you (With a Soccer Player)\" and \"Far\" are clear examples of skipping a ship \/ soul impact. Because they don't sound like individuals, to me they are weak in the songs there. What can restore. Three simple notes is a title song. It uses LINN drums written like a prince and a jazz samba style inspired by Havana. The intricate style of \"Bitter Times\", like most of the album's content, combines music with this experimental and romantic lyrics. , and provide class and sass at the same time. The whole song \"You\", \"Lose Yourself\", \"Your Hand\", \"From the Cloud\" and \"I Want You to Stay\" well describes the overflow of jazz \/ pop \/ soul, and the interpretation of \"Tears.\", Showing this strength is like a funk ball. . Additional Michael Jackson songs \"Butterfly\" - dedicated to a more hopeful rhythm, smooth production and powerful singing voice of Masha. I have to say that washing the floor with Mike is very close. I\u2019ll notice that even though I don\u2019t knock MJ! never! If it were't for him, I would't be as passionate about music as I am today - deeply. But in reality, the was not in the best position of this voice and body when the recorded the first one, which would only help to show how good this work was there. I think Mike would be very happy if anyone could hear it. Overall, this album is fun, inspiring, powerful and interesting, I know I will never forget it soon. This type of music can bring people of different generations and classes together. There are qualities that everyone will love. They may be different. But at the same time, the album also celebrates the unity that can be brought about by musical diversity. It is because their songs are single and united. Marsha Ambrosius (Marsha Ambrosius) did not look away from this point.","overall":5,"summary":"Soulful Elegance From Across The Pond","unixReviewTime":1325376000,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2012"}

I really enjoyed a couple of the songs: 'Oh Marcello', with its appropriation of \"I'm just a soul whose intentions are good \/ pooh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood\" and low-key beatboxing; the beautiful melody and catchy tune in 'Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas)'; and the driving beat in 'All the Rowboats'.'All the Rowboats' is as close as this album comes to a stand-out favourite for me. There's nothing to approach 'Us' fromSoviet Kitsch (Deluxe Version) [+Video], 'Dance Anthem of the eighty's' fromFar, for 'Apres Moi' fromBegin To Hope (U. S. Version). I found that fact a bit disappointing, but perhaps the album will grow on me. Why four stars, then? Because, it's Regina Spektor and she's awesome! If you haven't listened to any of her other stuff I'd recommend starting withBegin To Hope (U. S. Version).
