2091,"Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys. I caught this at an part cinema there in America in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. Technically I was still a teenager (I was nineteen) so I was interested in seeing how Australian teens acted. Script wise there's nothing new there. It shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide etc etc. I always knew what was going to happen before it did but I was never bored. What I found interesting was, despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair, these teenagers karen't much different than American teens. They had many of the same difficulties and hang-ups. Also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and (I heard) it was a faithful adaptation of it. The acting was just OK but the factors were attractive and this was well-made and pretty interesting. So this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it's like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids. I give it a seven.",positive

They have difficulties and many similar obstacles. This is also a book based on a real surf girl and her real-life events, (I heard) this is a good thing to practice. The performance is good, but these things are very attractive, and well done, very interesting.

2091,"A film about two Australian women - Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) —and what happens when they become friends with two male surfers. What I found interesting was that, despite the stone and some changes in dress and hair, this teenager was not very different from American teenagers. It shows the typical adventures of young people talking about dating, sex, suicide and so on. Technically, I was young (I was nineteen) so I was curious how young Australians behaved. So it’s not an indescribable part but it’s a very accurate picture of what it’s like to be a teenager and trying to be with famous kids.

2091,"A movie about two Australian girls - Debbie (Neil Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) - and what happened when they became the girlfriends of two surfing boys. I caught it in the United States Cinema Section at one, nine hundred and eighty-one. Technically I was a teenager (I was nineteen) so I was interested to see how young Australians are doing. The text is smart, there is nothing new. It shows the sacrifices of young people who are addicted to dating and dating, sex, suicide, etc. I always knew what was going to happen before it happened but I never got bored. What's interesting to me is that, although there is a sense of urgency and some changes in clothing and hair, these young Americans are no different. He faced many problems and suspensions. And it was based on a letter from a real surfer girl and her real life fun and (I heard her) honestly agreeing with her. The simulation was already fine but the features were attractive and well done and fun. So this is not an illegal artistic thing, but an accurate reflection of what it means to be young and try to have popular children. I give it seven.",positive
2200,"I finally caught up to ""Starlight"" last night on television and all I can say is. . . wow! It's hard to know where to begin -- the incredibly hokey special effects (check out the laser beams shooting out of Willie's eyes!), the atrocious acting, the ponderous dialogue, the mismatched use of stock footage, for the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production. This truly is a one-of-a-kind experience, and we should all be thankful for that. I nominate Jonathon Kay as the true their to Ed Wood!",negative
2200,"I named Jonathon Kay the True Ed Wood! It was a truly unique experience, and we should all be thankful for that. (p) It’s hard to know where to start - the unique hockey effect is amazing (look at the laser beam coming out of Willie’s eyes! It was truly a unique experience, and we should all be thankful for that. last night at Starlight and all I can say is: Six year old movie - Two Thousand and One Star - Dominique Swain, Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips (barely), Melanie Griffith (barely) Rating NeCRo - four skeletons in ten ""as a group so the left this true friends and joined because somehow the was not interested in love. I know some may say that others are good because they are the jones who set me up to hate.trust me. I like the chars i don't like but this group in't popular because they can't be bad people.aa that's Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but the little time they have is awake. Two lines maybe said Melanie, but at least Bijou's manners were good even though the was small. Violence and GoreMayga are constantly attacking very bad conversation and furious factors, that is enough violence !! There is a stone throw. T&A Factor Nudity, they can’t add anything nude to help spice up this film, probably because no one wants their body to tolerate this defect. If they show up they should make a movie where they will be remembered for their characters and not ""oh they heard it was naked."" Movie Overview (review) wok wok I know I'm proud I can love if almost all movies somehow have gotten that good stuff. Well this movie is one of the few that I really struggled to find anything worthwhile during my stay. I already had a strong hatred for the behavior of rich people who ignored it and that would’t help. This whole movie is really is, it’s a rich group of people sitting around acting out frustrated and stupid. I can’t stress the point of danger. This film tries to recreate the tried and true issue of “As a Group” which can often be done with lease. Why don't I have a photo from the box cover film? Well I felt that this film did't deserve that honor so I decided to take a picture of why I rent this, and the reason is no other than Dominique Swain. Yeah Al that sounds like rubbish to me, BT does't seem to be for me either. At least I kept my promises that yes I saw most of this films, minus the pretty hard to find jones. He himself is a great factor and I will actively defend him, but the guy chooses some of the most dangerous films to come out. and even some really great features. Also in the add box the tries to trick you into thinking that this film has stars and to put Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips in the front box. If there’s one thing P **** got me it was a movie that puts the names of the stars in a box so you can think “wow it has ____ big names in the movie. There’s a total of no ten minutes between two. Bijou really has the equivalent of something. Melanie, on the other hand, is just two lines. It was given to me that I don't like Melanie, but it's about ethics and not star acting. All these problems though that the equipment should go to Brad Renfro to show the wok performance with Dominique. Brad may be a kid who is very confused in real life, but somehow the can do something. So the only reason the skeleton had was this movie is because i got the original i wanted Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro. I was also more excited to see the actress at the bottom of Bijou Phillips making me look like her. So even bad a of my heart in general, I thought of some good things, even if this time it was very difficult. I recommend that you only see this if you have seen Lolita and know how best Dominique is if you are a false fan of Brad for Bijou. Uber Melanie fans will be disappointed. Also if you are a fan of bad movies like me, please don’t assume that it is a pleasure to sin because you will feel guilty for good, the money paid for the purchase of rent. Some movies are ""very bad and very good"" as the saying goes. What they forgot to add is “they are too bad to be good (to be missed)” this film is very sad. I like chars but I don't like this group because they can be bad people.",negative
2200,"), corrupt practices, incomprehensible negotiations, and misuse of weapons have created a deep atmosphere of independence throughout production. It's hard to know where to start - unbelievably unique results (see laser beam in Willie's eyes! It's truly a unique experience, and we should all be grateful for it. Finally I caught the TV last night ""Starlight"" I can only say . I nominate Jonathan Kay as Ed Wood the real jones! Stars-Dominic Swain, Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips (empty), Melanie Griffith (empty) NeCro rating-ten , because they make me hate them. Believe me. I love bad characters, but this group is not popular because they can not be really bad people. a if you said a few words, but at least Bizhu is useless, but the has a good personality. thoughts continue to be bad Conversation and attack from a very annoying character is violent enough !! Someone is calling him a stone knocker. T&A nude factor hahaha, they can't even add nudity. add interest to this movie, probably because no one wants to put their bodies in this kind of nonsense. ""Oh, I heard her naked in this role."" Overview of the movie (note) Yes, I know I'm proud to be a fan of many (if not all) movies, at least to get some. profit . Well, this movie is one of the few movies. It's really hard for me to find something worth watching. The problem with this movie is that it's annoying. I already hate the rich and funny, but it does't help. The movie is just a group of rich people sitting around doing crazy and stupid things. Nothing. Finished off without trying. Why don't I have a cover image in the movie? Well, I don’t think this movie deserves any credit, so I decided to post a photo of why I rented this movie, and this reason is Dominic Swain (D dominique Swain). Well, I was also wanted for her ""Lolita"" and I thought she was very good, so I decided to watch her in any movie she has played since. At least I kept my promise, yes, I watched most of this movies, except it was hard to find Jones. He's a great factor, and I'll defend him diligently, but the has chosen the worst movies the will star in. The movie and the smokers are on the same boat, but at least the smoker has a cool view of the story and other beautiful scenery. Additionally, the add-on box tries to trick you into thinking that there are stars in this movie by adding the names of Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips in front of the box. If there is anything else that bothers me, it is a movie with the name of a star in the box that makes you think ""Wow, it has ____, I want to know how good it is ___ in this movie, I just saw ___ in the movie and thought you were right! Bijou has a half and half meaning. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Melanie Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me. because I found what I was looking for, it was Dominic Swain and Brad Renfro. if you watch ""Lolita"" and you know how good Dominica is (if you're one of Bijou's Big Fans). Uber Melanie fans will be very disappointed. Additionally, if you like movies like me, please don't think it's fun, because you will feel guilty about the money you spend renting. As the saying goes, some movies are “too bad”. What they forgot to add was ""Too bad, they're good (stop it)."" With CRo",negative

5437,"I am fully aware there is no statistical data that readily supports the correlation between video games and real life violence. The movie is false and phone because it is in complete contradiction of itself, which is what I tried to emphasize in my original review. The movie fails, not necessarily because I really do think these kids were influenced by video games, but because the movie sets it up as ""random"" and does't follow through. Let me clarify. In Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer, you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous, yet she is so troubled, she really believes them to be true. The viewer can make the distinction however. In Zero Day, the two kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything environmental, which is obviously false since everything they do contradicts this. Neo-nazism, talking about going on CNN with Wolf Blitzer (which is laughable not only because they know this name, but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of this bad movie). etc. This movie does't depict 'reality', it shows nothing but phoniness to prove a point. Unfortunately you fell for the bait and did't see this, and you did't pick up on it from my review either. The entire movie is just taking Michael Moore's hypothesis and applying it to something ""real life"" in hopes of validating and it fails, not necessarily because the hypothesis is wrong, but because the movie is wrong and does't support it. Of course I don't think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people, but if I'm not mistaken, did't video tape exist of the Columbine kids (or some teen killers) shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked for acted like the weaponry in Doom? Hmmmmmmm, the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media, influenced, but obviously balanced for intelligent enough that its not even an issue. Zero Day is a bad movie not because I really believe a correlation exists, but because the film maker does't know what hes trying to say, and the movie does more to disprove this point then support it.

We can't wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free ""On Demand"" viewing. The wardrobe has a spot of current fashion. There is a moral to each story. It is entertaining. The violence is not over-the-top for needless. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a John William's feel to it. It is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair. There is so much garbage on television from brain rotting ""reality"" TV to senseless violence. You should take this for what it is and that is an updated ""Robin Hood"" not to be compared with the movie exploits of Errol Flynn. This is a gem to be enjoyed by all. Parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that Robin has lost this taste for war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood that would rather attempt to reason this way out of a disagreement than fight. Maid Marian is also an appealing role model for young girls. Rather than stand by and do nothing, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the ""Night Watchman."" The Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked, just as the Sheriff should be and looks like a across between Billy Joel and Tim Curry.

24704,"This sad romance is untellable because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters. So, there are a lot of flashbacks, of are-shooting of the same scene. But, it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result! And it would worth it, because it's for me, just one the best French movie never made! It has everything: Cast: first steps of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such voices, even for a hard-of-hearing! It's symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie! Directing: this camera is bright, alive, plays with the sets for can be mysterious with long close-up ""à la David Lynch"". Cinematography: the light is beautiful, between gold and trust, like their love! A never-seen before Paris: It's a Paris out-of-time of more accurately, a composite of a lot of districts! Huge search there! It's look like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! Music: Not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames. And the song of Charles Aznavour made me discover this great singer! Ah, the story! As I said, it's a love story but rather tragic: Saying that love can be for nothing, that it does't make all people happy for in't guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message in't often told! Love is passion, which is derivative from the Latin ""pain"". You can suffer a lot when you are in love! Because of the Why . ?, of the endless waiting, the black of courage, the indecision. And when you can please yourself, fate, destiny, god (?), devil (?) can stab you in the back , just because you arrive too soon for too late, and above all, because love means two in a world of billions! A lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written! So, what's love? Personally, I lived some moments like this: in a car with the dear one. Her mobile rings and you know it's her ""special friend"" whom she kisses goodbye (and not you, even if we are always together).

Yes I am. I have to love them. Maybe they’re bad, but I think they’re normal, and they don’t understand this. But I know that's true. That is, IMO, the main power of this movie. This makes us realize that your friends, relatives, for anyone else may be planning some crazy thing, and we may not notice. Although this movie is great, it makes me feel happy. That's why I can't sleep now. I still have this little feeling in my stomach. The butterfly.",positive
27350,"Everyone knows this ""Zero Day"" event. What I think this movie did’t do Elephants is they did to us what these guys are. They showed their lives up to a year. We loved the whole movie, to laugh with it, even though we knew the whole thing they would do. And gives me a shiver. Because I felt guilty I was pleased with their comments, and I just thought Cal was a sweet person. Even I KNOW what happens you know? Even when the film was sent when they were about to commit suicide and decide if they had done the numbers three to four I thought it was ridiculous but I was still shocked when I saw their heads explode. Of course I am. I have to love them. They were bad, perhaps, but I felt like they were really ordinary people, and they did’t really know. But I already know they are. That is, IMO, the main force in this film. It makes us realize that your friends, relatives, everyone, can plan something fun, and we can’t feel it. This film, how beautiful it is, made me sad. And that’s why I can’t sleep now. I still have this little feeling in my stomach. Butterflies",positive

44032,"I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favourite soap opera. Because of this, she goes on a journey to Los Angeles to reunite with her supposed soap opera character lover Dr. Rubell. To add fuel to the fire, she is also being chased by some ruthless `one life not to live' whitman who think she has stolen their drugs. You could say that is how Nurse Betty spends `the days of her life' throughout the movie. This very `ungeneral' situation eventually leads her to the `hospital' set of her beloved soap opera. However, the only problem is that Betty thinks this is all real. It is like her mind is in `another world.' Ok! Enough! I will wipe off my mouth with soap and not mention any more soap names. I have already registered my vote for Renee as a best actress oscar nominee. Also, Greg Kinnear's performance as Dr. Rubell was as good as it gets in this acting biography. To sum it up, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call in for `Nurse Betty.' ***** Excellent",positive
