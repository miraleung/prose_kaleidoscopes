Dylan speaks of failed relationships with women throughout the entire album. One of the best things about listening to Dylan's music is listening carefully to each one of the songs. On this album this lyrical ability is perhaps at it's speak. Everytime I hear \"A Simple Twist Of Fate\" I can't help but imagine each one of the scenes Dylan has described about two people sitting in a park as the sky is growing dark. One of the things I like to do is listen to the words that Dylan emphasizes in this song. Words such as: gone straight, freight train, gates, and so on. Whenever you listen to Dylan it is very rewarding to listen to every word the sings. The reason why this album is well-regarded is that Dylan's lyrics are honest, real, and most of all beautiful. The guitar and harmonica work are also very beautiful and inspired. My two favourite songs on this album are \"Shelter From The Storm\" and \"A Simple Twist Of Fate.\" I would give this album five stars based on those songs alone but since there are other great songs on it as well it does not surprise me that just about everyone has given it five stars.

Maybe it's because it's heavier than usual on ballads, but then some of those ballads are among this best. Whatever the reason may be, it's worth more of a chance than most fans I know have given it. Somewhere Over China is obscure enough that if you're reading this, you're probably already quite a Buffett fan. Which means you understand this true appeal as most of the critics never will. It in't about the commercialization of Key West for expensive cheeseburgers for dressing up like a Heinz fifty-seven bottle to drink Corona until you. well, you know. Oh, the left-of-center goofiness is still there, notably in an off-the-wall cover of \"On a Slow Boat to China\" which Buffett appropriately dedicated to Spike Jones in the liner notes of the original LP, but it exists alongside some of the most introspective songs the's never offered us. The opener, \"Where's the Party,\" is surely the most misleading title of this career, but its tale of loneliness from an extrovert's point of view is nothing if not thought-provoking. On the lighter side, \"It's Midnight and I'm Not Famous Yet\" features the late Steve Goodman as co-writer and a lead character named Lester Polyester. need I say more? Goofier still is \"Lip Service,\" perhaps Buffett's all-time greatest double-entendre. (Is it about a co-dependent relationship for oral sex? You make the call!)

Yes, I know, you already have half of those songs if you own the box set. So why buy this CD as well? The title track, which as far as I know has never been released on any other album, is the best Buffett you've never heard. It's a tale of an average guy who gets the unlikely chance to throw caution to the wind and travel to the far side of the world, discovering the pros and icons of that lifestyle along the way, much as your hero has spent much of the past three decades doing. What's the moral of the story? Maybe we're better off staying with the dull but familiar; but then again, maybe there's real joy in the loneliness of wanderlust.

The slogan, \"Where is the party,\" is certainly the most misleading theme of this work, but from a supernatural point of view, the story of its loneliness is nothing short of irrational. On the simple side, \"It's Midnight and I'm Not Famous Yet\" features the late Steve Goodman as a well-known writer and factor named Lester Polyester. Need I say more? Goffier is still a \"lip service\", perhaps Buffett's biggest double extender. (Is it about a relationship that depends on oral sex? You're calling!) But the situation is more serious for the most part. \"Steamer\" is undoubtedly the most sensational number never, while \"I've heard I was in town\" is the highest in the lower genre of Lonely Star songs (which you've tried a few times before, but like this Never convinced). Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT saint for me either. Why did you buy this CD now? The title track, to my knowledge, which has never been released on any other album, is the best buffet you've never heard. This is the story of a man who has an unexpected opportunity to warn in the air and travel to the corners of the earth, to discover the virtues and signs of this lifestyle, as your hero has done for the last thirty years. Has passed What is the nature of the year story? We may be better off living with fat, but we get used to it. But there is also the real joy in wandering alone. Buffett does't really answer us, and the probably did't decide for himself when the wrote the song. This uncertainty creates the study itself.

Because I found it in the mid-seventys, this is my favourite album. This CD uses a collection of two discs and is mounted on a single CD. The sound to the master is beautiful, and the performance is now as powerful as it was then. One of the most important features of this group is the addition of a palace component to other songs. Hopefully songs like \"Don't Do It\" and quiet songs like \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\". I used to choose \"Rock of Ages\" in the farewell film \"The Last Walz\", which may be because that's what the band is all about, instead of describing the appearance of the Last Walz guests. As if the original recording is not enough, this deluxe version adds an additional CD of all living things. This is a collection of songs that the music group regularly played during this time, including some that were not on the original record (\"Up in Cripple Creek\" and \"I'll Be Free\"). Add four songs by Bob Dylan. An additional set is the icing on the cake and makes the great album even more important. Highly recommended!","overall":5,"summary":"A GREAT Live Album","unixReviewTime":1089331200,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2004"}

I heard Driftwood, off \"The Man Who\", and was immediately hooked. This is one of the most interesting bands around. \"The Man Who\" is one of my favourite albums of all time, and still gets quite a bit of play from a man with one, zero + cd. I loved it so much, I checked out their first album, \"Good Feeling\", and was confused. \"Good Feeling\" was a decent album, but lacked the instrumentation and emotionally deep songwriting of \"The Man Who\". I was concerned over what kind of an album I would be hearing next from the boys across the pond. Well, much to my relief, they did't change much from \"The Man Who\". They use their talents to the max. The production, and the use of instruments is incredible - far surpassing that of their last album. Amazingly, so is the songwriting. This is one of those albums that you can not get enough of. The album gives music fans everywhere reason to be hopeful. Travis is one of those bands that may never catch on in the mainstream, due to the overplay of annoying cookie-cutter punk rock, wrap rock, and teen pop stars. Travis does't fit into the modern radio mold of airplay. They are better than that. The album is blessed with many, many great songs. Sing has one of the catchiest hooks on the album, that you can't help but get into. The songwriting is best displayed on songs like Side, The Humpty Dumpty Love Song, and Pipe Dreams (\"I'd spray to God if there were heaven, but heaven sees so very far from there\"). The album also is helped out by the comforting power of Safe - which is a song I turned to frequently in the aftermath of Sept eleventh. Flowers in the Window is a fun, uplifting, song that always brings a smile to my face. Other greats are Last Train, and The Cage, both of which show off everything I love about the album - songwriting and instrumentation. My only negative comment about the album is the second song, Dear Diary. It in't that it is a bad song. It is most certainly a good song, and does belong on the album. I just feel as though after the great momentum that Sing brings with the first track, the space of the album hits a wall just two tracks in. The song should have been moved to later in the album. A small complaint, but a complaint nonetheless. This is a disc that everyone should own, if not for the great songwriting for the amazing musicianship and production.","overall":5,"summary":"Thank God for Travis!","unixReviewTime":1010448000,"reviewTime":"01 8, 2002"}

Travis does not deserve to be broadcast in today's broadcast. They are better than that. Lots, lots of great songs on this album. Sing has one of the most charming spells on this album, and you can't help but absorb it. Songwriting is best seen in songs like Side, Humpty Dumpty Love Song and Pipe Dreams (\"If there is a brain, I will sprinkle water on God, but the sky is far away\").

Other great works are Final Train and Cage, both of which show everything I love about songwriting and album material. My only negative reaction to this album is the second song, my favourite diary. This is not a bad song at all. This is definitely a good song, and it's really on record. I just think that after the great speed brought by the first song of Sing, the space of the album hit the wall with only two songs. This song should be delivered in the last part of the album.

After seeing four of their videos on MTVtwo, I decided to get the album. I am very pleased. While it's not as great as De Stijl, at least it's more varied than the honest album. This is where Jack and Meg begin to shine artistically. Dead Leaves is a very basic song with a very basic riff. Sort of like Green Day's Brain Stew, but with a touch of The Kinks. Hotel Yorba sounds like it came directly from The Kinks. It has a hooky chorus, and clever lyrics. I'm Finding It Harder To Be A Gentlemen is irritable because of that damn piano line. It's so good! Fell In Love With A Girl, the big single, is jangly sixty's punk. Kind of hard to describe, but you'll understand when you hear it. Straight out of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine. Expecting can be described in one word. swampy. I'm not kidding, it reminds me of a big swamp. It's cool. Little Room is filler. Plain and simple. The Union Forever is annoying. It has too much screaming, the same chords, and a trip-off of Citizen Kane. Didn't like it. Same Boy You've Always Known is a great tribute to The Beatles. That's what I thought when I heard Jack singing. Same thing with We're Gonna Be Friends. Offend In Every Way is a very sarcastic song, with a sneaky guitar riff. I Think I Smell A Rat is annoying and repetitive. Too much of the one chord thing. Aluminum has the best guitar riff never made. WHY was't this riff thought of sooner? I Can't Wait is too unoriginal, but it's still fun. Now Mary is a great folk song with some beautiful singing. I Can Learn is dull. It's nice, but I think this formula's over now.

Not because I don't like it; *that* feeling has never stopped me from writing a review before. Rather, it is the seeming inability of fans of the White Stripes to come to any other conclusion about the group other than that they are \"musical geniuses\" and the apparent savior of rock. In other words, what is the point in being a dissenting voice if you're simply going to be drowned out by people who did't want to hear your opinion in the first place? But then I thought again--I thought about how wretchedly awful this cd truly is. How the record-buying masses have been duped into thinking that the Siblings White truly *are* musical geniuses who write clever, engaging songs. About how Jack White has found not only fans of this tired brand of garage-blues, but has actually become a household name and celebrity off of it. And it made me nauseous. So, off to write the one-star review I go. I'll get right to the point: this is a terrible album. Pure and simple. The songwriting is below average at best--frequently dull, monotonous and recycled. The idea of garage-rock blues is nothing new, and Jack and Meg add absolutely nothing to a genre already filled to the brim with over-hyped and under-talented groups. Jack's guitar playing is mediocre, and by no means whatsoever worthy of the \"guitar god\" status that has inexplicably been placed on him. To place him on any kind of \"Greatest Guitarists\" list is an insult to everyone capable of playing more than three chords on their six string. Meg's drumming is equally yawn-inducing and very rudimentary. Some people hear rawness and energy in the White Stripes--I, on the other hand, hear a black of rhythm, talent and overall musical ability. Those are two completely different things people. So what is it, then? Why do so many people so *fervently* believe that this is legitimate boundary-pushing, genre-defining immortal music? I honestly have no idea. But the reviewer a few spots below me who noted that the White Stripes fan base is comprised primarily of Urban Outfitters shoppers looking for it-shirts with witty slogans was dead on. The White Stripes are defined as being \"cool\", so you must like them. Someone sitting high up in one of the record company towers had a brainstorm one afternoon, and decided that the pop world was in need of a band with a shred of indie cred to appeal to the Britney-Christina page group. And flo, the White Stripes fit the bill. So there we are. None of this would matter one iota, really, if it were't for the fact that a multitude of truly outstanding, talented bands are existing below the radar while these clowns are playing on TRL. But that's how it always has been in music, I suppose, and it's naive to think that anything would change now. I imagine, in the send, my criticisms will fall on deaf years, much like others on there. And fans of the Stripes will go on as before, blissfully ignorant to the fact that their rock savior are little more than corporate cash cows, promoted with a programmed image designed to brake in the $$$. But, they, if that's what it takes to stay with the \"in\" crowd, then I guess it does't matter.","overall":1,"summary":"Wouldn't be bad if they could play, write music and\/or sing","unixReviewTime":1098835200,"reviewTime":"10 27, 2004"}

It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like it; if emotion did not stop me from writing the study. On the contrary, apart from being \u201cmusic geniuses\u201d and explicit stone savers, White Stripes fans seem to be unable to get any conclusions about the band. In other words, if you are overwhelmed by people who do not want to listen to you in the first place, what is the point of making different sounds? But then I thought about it again - I thought about how sad this CD is. How can people who buy records be deceived into thinking that the white brothers and sisters are really talented, and they will write clever and interesting songs. About how Jack White did\u2019t get fans of this tired garage brand, but the\u2019s actually become a household name and celebrity. It makes me sick. So, write a review of the one star I went to. I'm going to get to the point: This is a bad album. Pure and simple. Songwriting is below average for the best \u2014 often tiring, fun and repetitive. The idea of \u200b\u200bgarage rock blues is nothing new, and Jack and Meg have nothing to add to this genre that is already full of overcrowding and talented bands. Jack's guitar is in the middle and should't be this mysterious \"guitar god\" status. Putting him on any kind of \"big guitar list\" is an insult to someone who can play more than three chords on the sixth string. Meg's drum beats are also yawn and very crude. Some people feel old and strong in the white lines \u2014 on the other hand, I feel the darkness of rhythm, talent and musical talent in general. These are two very different people. So what? Why do so many people believe * with interest * that this is a legitimate, immortal music that breaks boundaries and defines certain genres? Honestly, I don\u2019t know. But my commenter in the following areas explain that White Stripes fans mostly consist of Urban Outfitters buyers, who want a shirt with funny slogans. White stripes are described as \u201ccool\u201d, so you should love them. One afternoon, people sitting in a high-rise recording studio building had a vision and decided that the pop world needed a band with an independent celebrity track to attract Britney Christina fans. And the flo, white lines meet the requirements. I am there. It does\u2019t matter at all, in fact, if it were\u2019t for when these jokes were playing on TRL, most of the outstanding and talented teams were under the radar. But I think this is a normal part of music, and it does't make sense to think that everything will change now. I think in posting, my criticism will fall on deaf and dumb years, like others there. Lovers of Stripes will continue as before, happy not knowing that their stone savior is nothing more than a cow of the company's money to prevent the making of images of the dollar system. But, for them, if that\u2019s what it takes to be with the \u201cfor\u201d crowd, then I don\u2019t think it matters.","overall":1,"summary":"Wouldn't be bad if they could play, write music and\/or sing","unixReviewTime":1098835200,"reviewTime":"10 27, 2004"}

How the record-buying crowd was deceived into thinking that Sibling White was really a * musical genius who writes clever and catchy songs. About the fact that Jack White has not only found fans of this tired genre of garage-eyebrows, but in fact it has become a household name and fame. And it made me sick. So, I stopped writing a review of the star I was travelling on. I'll get straight to the point: this is a bad album. It's clean and simple. The lyrics are below standard - they are often faded, boring and reused. The concept of garage rock blues is nothing new, and Jack and Mag are not adding anything to the genre that is already full of interesting and unskilled bands. Jack's guitar playing is a middle ground, and the certainly does't deserve the status of \"guitar gods\" imposed on him in an incomprehensible way. Adding him to the list of \"greatest guitarists\" of any kind is an insult to anyone who can play more than three songs on this six strings. Playing Meg's drums promotes jamming evenly and is very painful. Some people feel flaws and strengths in the white stripes - I, on the other hand, feel the darkness of the overall rhythm, skill and musical ability. These are two very different things, people. So what is it Why do so many people sincerely believe that this is a legitimate, legitimate music? I don't really know, but in some places below me, a reviewer noticed that fans of the White Strips, especially the buyers of Urban Outfitters who want shirts with smart slogans, are dead. White stripes are described as \"cool\", so you should love it.

Game had an uphill battle from day one. I'm sure any star will testify that the problem with starting at the top is that almost everybody is waiting for you to fall instantly to the bottom. With Dre underscoring this credibility, Game's inherent buzz quickly became a \"hype\" and raised the pressing question of NOT wether the could meet your expectations but rather if the could EXCEED them. Let's face it. That's what the critics, and perhaps some buyers, are all waiting for: To have their expectations blown out of the water. Well. there's one vote that the did it. And this is coming from one wary and reluctant buyer. To be quite honest, my radar was phoning more on Dre and this label than the Game himself. As the mastermind behind everything that leaves the Aftermath, I was scared that maybe Aftermath was on it's way to becoming an After Thought (like DeathRow). I think many will agree that wrap has become painfully redundant, uncreative and unoriginal. Outside of the actual CD was an overwhelming amount of evidence that Game was doomed to the same tired pseudo-thug content of so many other wrappers - many of whom represent Dre's label. Of course, Game does in fact deliver the same old West Coast Game of low-riders, chronic, loose women, sneakers, guns ada, ada, ada. It would't be Game without it. But where I have to give him mad credit is that the stone of this lyrics seems to give the Gangster Lifestyle a three-Dimensional view and the masterfully gives us a glimpse of all angles. Some of the songs on there have a regretful stone that is probably more accurate of real gangsters than the pro-violent latitude exemplified by your vinyl thugs of past. No doubt, this more complex position is borrowed more so from Ice Cube and twoPac (who borrowed from Cube and Ren) than any of the other legends that Game acknowledges as this primary source of inspiration. And while Gangster Rap initially was morally claustrophobic and grammy like the NWA Straight Outta Compton Album, Game manages to maintain this feeling (as promised) as well as give us more uplifting and maybe even hopeful tracks. One track involves Game's voice cracking as if the's fighting back painful thoughts and regrets - a very clever delivery since the song itself is about all the things the would change, if the could change them. And then there's the beats. The beats are just incredible on this Album and stop just short of overshadowing Game's delivery. The Documentary is the best title for this album because so many of the tracks on this Album are cinematic in stone. \"Dream\", produced by Kayne West, is nothing short of a masterpiece. And \"Church for Thugs\", produced by Just Blaze is possibly the strongest production on this whole album. And I can't send this without giving a nod to the man who blueprinted this album. I must say that I was a little sad that Dre covers less than half of the musical output of this album. I was a little more sad when I had to admit to myself that many of the Guest Producer beats top some of Dre's beats. But if anything it only further underscores Dre's immaculant year for amazing material and this maturity for allowing that material to come before this own (no doubt the produced several tracks that the himself edited out from the final album). And as Executive Producer of this Album, Dre has orchestrated a CD that is even better than fifty's \"Get Rich. \" and far better than Eminem's Encore - both great albums in their own right. And where Drei is a true genius is that the seems to have added sounds for every listener from every corner of America, just to make sure that this West Coast Ressurection in't exclusive to just the West Coast. And finally, \"Higher\" and \"Start from Scratch\" are among the most memorable tracks on this CD. \"Higher\" is just downright infectious and so full of adrenaline that it almost promotes violence without any lyrics placed on top of it. Without a doubt, Aftermath is still on track and if they continue to put out this level of wrap, they might possibly dominate the airwaves of two thousand and five. If nothing else, it could breathe some much needed life into wrap.

Since the first day of the game, there has been an escalation fight. I believe that any star will show that the problem that starts from the top is that almost everyone expects it to come down quickly. As Dre emphasized this loyalty, the natural buzz of the Game quickly turned into a \"grace\" and raised the question of whether it could satisfy your expectations, but whether it could exceed them. Let's face it. This is what critics, and perhaps even some consumers, are waiting for: their expectations have been dashed. That's OK. One vote the thought the did. This came from a cautious and sceptical consumer. Honestly, my radar is more focused on Dre and brand than Game itself. As the mastermind behind everything that has left Aftermath, I'm afraid that Aftermath could be a part of Aftermath (like DeathRow). I think most people will agree that wrapping has been a very painful, invisible and unusual thing. In addition to the original CD, there is sample evidence that the Game is set to have the same pseudo-mob theme as other threatening objects - many of which represent Dre's labels. Yes the game offers the same West Coast games, including a low, endless rider, immoral rooms, it-shirts, guns, ducks, ducks. Without it, there would be no games. But the crazy title I have to give him is that the word stone seems to give a three-dimensional view of the gangster lifestyle, subtly giving us an overview of all the angles. Some of the songs feature remorse, which may well describe the real gangsters more than the violence perpetrated by the giants of the past. Without a doubt, this very difficult place has been borrowed from Ice Cube and twoPac (borrowed from Cube and Ren), instead of any other myth known by Game as the main source of encouragement. Although Gangster Rap was originally claustrophobic and Grammy as the NWA Straight Outta Compton album, The Game managed to keep that feeling (as the promised) and gave us a strengthening track and a full Hope. A track that involves the demise of the game\u2019s voice, as if it counts sad thoughts and regrets \u2014 this is a very clever act, because the song itself is about everything that will change, if it can be changed. There is also a rhythm. The rhythm of this album is amazing, almost surpassing the distribution of the Game. The document is the title of the album, since most of the songs on this album are like a movie. The \"dream\" produced by Kay West is a work of part. And \u201cChurch of the Thugs\u201d produced by Just Blaze could be the most powerful work on the entire album. I can't post this album without nodding to the person who created the plan for this album. I must say that I am a little disappointed because Dre covers less than half of the music on this album. When I have to admit to myself that a lot of guest producers beat some of Dre\u2019s beats, I feel even more sad. But if anything, it will focus even more on Dre\u2019s amazing year of amazing things and the growth of allowing these things to appear before him (no doubt, many of the songs the has edited on the last album). As the lead producer of this album, Dre's carefully crafted CDs are even better than \"Get Rich\" in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys, and much better than Eminem's Encore \u2014 both of these albums are great albums. Drei's true wisdom is that it seems to add a voice to all audiences across America to ensure that this West Coast revival is not limited to the West Coast. Lastly, \"Top\" and \"Start from scratch\" are some of the most memorable tracks on this CD. \"High\" is directly contagious, full of adrenaline, and almost no words are put in it to encourage violence. There is no doubt that the result is still in the right direction. If they continue to inform this packing stage, they can control two for five waves. If nothing happens, it can add a lot of life needed for packaging. Think of it as a classic.","overall":5,"summary":"This is beyond anything I expected.","unixReviewTime":1106006400,"reviewTime":"01 18, 2005"}

The game has been a difficult battle since day one. I'm sure any star will prove that the problem with starting from the top is that almost everyone is waiting for you to come down fast. As Drew made that reputation clear, game propaganda quickly became a \"hype\" and raised the important question of whether it could achieve what you expected, but only if it could. Let's face it. Critics, and perhaps some consumers, are all waiting for it: not to expect it out of the water. all right. There is a vote made by Jehovah. And it comes from a cautious and hesitant buyer. Truth be told, my radar was more scared of the game and running this label. As a genius for everything that comes out later, I was afraid that maybe after thinking about it later (like Detroit) on the way to becoming. I think a lot of people will agree that wrapping has become a very sad thing, it's not easy and it's not real. Aside from the CD itself, there was sample evidence that the game was about to be destroyed by the fancy memorabilia of many other wrappers - many of whom represented the horror label. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT saint for me either. This game would not be possible without it. But what I have to pay tribute to is that the rock of this song gives a three-dimensional look to the gangster lifestyle and artistically gives us titles from all angles. Some of the songs in it have a dubious stone that may be more accurate for real criminals than the violent longitude shown by the vanilla criminals of your past. Of course, this complex position is more borrowed from Ice Cube and Two PACs (borrowers from Cube and Rain) as game legends recognize it as an important source of inspiration. And although Gangster Rape was originally claustrophobic and grammy-like, as was the NWA Straight Outta Compton album, the game preserved that feeling (as promised) and gave us constructive and perhaps hopeful tracks. A track involves cracking the sound of the game, such as fighting bitter thoughts and regrets - a very clever delivery because the song itself is about all the things that can change, if they can change them. Then there are the bits. The bits on this album are incredible and turn off game delivery. The documentary is the best title for this album because most of the songs on this album are from movies. \"Dream\" says nothing about the artwork created by Key West. And \"Church for Thugs\" released by Just Blaise is probably the most powerful producer of this album. And I can't post without remembering the person who designed this album. I have to say that I was disappointed that Drew covered less than half of the music released on this album. I was shocked when I had to admit to myself that many guest producers were hitting some of Dre's beats on top. But if anything else, it really emphasizes Dre's amazing years of amazing things and its development by allowing what is needed before it (no doubt from the last album to this own Many tracks created). And as the executive producer of this album, Dre has produced a much better CD than the fifty's \"Get Rich\". And much better than Eminem's Encore - both good albums themselves. And while Drew is a real genius, the seems to incorporate the voices of every listener in every corner of the United States, just to make sure that this West Coast resurgence is not just for the West Coast. Finally, \"Top\" and \"Beginning\" are some of the most memorable songs on this CD. \"High\" is so contagious and full of adrenaline that it almost promotes wordless violence. There is no doubt that aftermath is still on track and if they maintain this level of fall they can control two to five thousand air waves. When nothing else, it can breathe the much-needed breath of life. Think of it as old-fashioned.","overall":5,"summary":"This is beyond anything I expected.","unixReviewTime":1106006400,"reviewTime":"01 18, 2005"}

With Dre emphasizing this confidence, the Game\u2019s real buzz quickly became \u201cexaggerated\u201d and raised the key question NOT to meet your expectations, but whether that could be more than them. Let's face it. That\u2019s what all the criticism is waiting for, and perhaps some consumers: To put their expectations on the water. Well with a voice made by Tanina it came from a careful buyer. In fact, my radar called it Dre and this brand is more than just the Game itself. As the mastermind behind everything that happens in the Afterlife, I feared that the Afterlife might be on the path of Reality After Thought (like DeathRow). I think a lot of people will agree that the recording has been excruciating, unnatural and unoriginal. Outside of the actual CD there is so much evidence that the Game has been convicted of both tired and fake stuff on many other recordings - many of which represent the Dre brand. Of course, the game really brings the same old West Coast game to low height, long distance, loose women, boots, woodpecker. It would\u2019t be a game without him. But where I have to give you a crazy reputation is that the rock of these words seems to give Gangster Lifestyle a triangular view that well gives us a holistic perspective. Some of the songs out there have a stone of remorse that may be more accurate than the real bandits in terms of violent latitude and for example your past vinyl thieves. Undoubtedly, this intricate space is heavily borrowed from Ice Cube and twoPac (both borrowed from Cube and Ren) more than any of the other legends that Games recognizes as a source of inspiration. And while Gangster Rap was originally cheeky and grammatical like the NWA Straight Outta Compton Album, the game manages to keep this feeling (as promised) as well as giving us a lot of uplifting and maybe even the hope. One path involves the sound of the game exploding as if the battle is back to painful thought and regret - a brilliant delivery because the song itself is about everything that will change, if it can change. Then there was the beating. The beats on this album are impressive and they stop bringing a bit of shade to the game. The documentary is the best title for this album because many of the tracks on this album are rock cinema. \u201cDream\u201d, produced by Kayne West, is superb. And \u201cChurch for Thugs\u201d, produced by Just Blaze is possibly the strongest production of this entire album. I can't send this without handing it over to the man who design this album. I will say that I am a little sad that Dre covers less than half of the music making of this album. I was a little sad when I admitted that many of the Guest Producers were hitting some Dre beats. But if this does increase the has underlined Dre\u2019s awkward years of amazing things and this era allows those things to contradict it (there is no doubt that the made some tracks that the himself released from in the album.last). And the top producer of this album, Dre has adapted a CD that is better than Fifty \u201cGet Rich\u201d that is better than Eminem\u2019s Encore - both with their own big doors. And while Drei is a true genius, it seems to have added sounds for every listener from every corner of America, just to make sure West Coast Revival in\u2019t just weird. West Coast. Finally, \u201cUp\u201d and \u201cStart from scratch\u201d are some of the memorable tracks on this CD. \u201cAbove\u201d is a direct contagious disease full of adrenaline that almost excites violence without any music. Undoubtedly, Aftermath is still on track and if they continue to make this level of recording, they will likely dominate the airwaves of two thousand and five. Without it, it can breathe the indispensable life of a recording.

A band of Funk and amazing melodies and never changing music.\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\" was their greatest achievement many will tell you, and in some since it was, but that does't mean they can't wop out a new album and still make it marvellous.two thousand and two's \"By The Way\" caught the band in a mellowed out predicament very played back featuring great melodies, this too follows that recipe with a few innovative twists worth relistining too for years to come. Opening with the catchy radio friendly \"Dani California\" The Chili's find them selves at the top of their game again. Featuring some of John's most amazing guitar work to date. Listen to \"Dani California's\" outdo\/solo for the breath taking solo to \"Turn It Again\" and be reminded of RHCP's earlier works. Oh don't forget Flea, stumbling out more quirky basslines like the intro to \"Charlie\" and the Tom Petty like bassline to \"Dani California\"(listen to \"Mary Janes Last Dance\" very similar)powerful basslines. Anthony too throws out catchy phrases and lines like \"Born in the state of Mississippi\/Pappa was a Copper\/Mamma was a hippy\". Even Chad who is often forgotten is at the top of this game banging this drum set like crazy with this own brilliant solo in \"Hump de Bump\". The albums comes in three doses,(the first) a slow as can possibly be tempo, for a funky all over the place good to be back tempo. The third is a weird surreal hard to describe sound. As if they wanted to make a follow up to \"Venice Queen\"(off of \"By The Way, last track) for an otherworldly moving sound.\"Animal Bar\" catches the best of all three of these attributes starting off with a bizzar intro seasoned with effects, thus leading to a slowish mid tempo arrival then sharply cuts to a rockfish section. Many of these songs were't derived to be hits like the funkafied \"Storm In A Teacup\" (my favourite so far). Yet they still manage to have radio play, because they are so good! Some songs have some residue from the past on them like \"Snow ((Hey Oh))\" and a \"Scar Tissue\"(on one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine's award winning achievement \"Californication\")like \"She's Only Eighteen\". It's truly not a bad thing but will be taken into consideration.\"So Much I\" could pose as a \"Californacation\" era hit. All these songs in many ways feel like a sum up of the bands career, holding true to each of their many albums by grabbing other potentials and shoving them into these songs. By this point you'll more for less think this is the ultimate album if so. not exactly, but close. Define the best album? High quality, a strong variety, no fillers, fantastic musicianship. Then yes this is the \"ultimate album\". When stacked up to classics like \"Let It Be\", and \"Dark Side Of The Moon\", this does't hold too well. It's amazing and in my opinion the best album of two thousand and six and possibly within the last few years, but will it hold up to the test of time? Peek at older RHCP material if you agree then more then likely you'll agree with this too. The point is the Chili's are finally back after what felt like the four longest years of my life, and are in their prime. It's nice to see they are still together after all these years and still as strong as never. A band like this will continue to grow and experiment with today music needs more then never.

It's a shame D'arcy and James Iha did not reunite, but after having listened to Zeitgeist several times through the last couple of days, the results could't be more satisfying with for without the two missing members. Ok, wok, that was a lie. I miss them! Anyways, I always admired how the early Smashing Pumpkins crossed through creative boundaries\/grunge norms during their time, mixing artistic experimental elements to their score rock sound while learning amt mainstream success with their unique style(image and music); which is why I am glad to see the new SP on Zeitgeist still a step away from current trend of \"emo\" for \"indie\" music by making a very straight forward yet sonically diverse rock in' roll album with Corgan's signature poetic lyrics with some songs (unsurprisingly after a glance at the cover part) seem to be about the strikes we are currently facing in your modern society while still being somewhat broad to interpretation. This is probably the Pumpkins most solid rock record since \"Gish\". The songs of Zeitgeist? \"Doomsday Clock\" is a powerful opening track, and rocks as much as the opening track \"Everlasting Gaze\" from Machina I did; but unlike Machina I, Zeitgeist rocks on with angst \"seven Shades Of Black\". \"Bleeding the Orchid\" is probably my favourite track on the record, beginning with beautiful echoes from Corgans voice. The song is very \"Adorish\", but with fantastic Camberlin drumming! A dream come true. \"Thats The Way(My Love Is)\" Is a cheerful sounding rock tune some what reminecent of \"Siamese Dream\" with some experimental elements, and ends beautifully. The mood is ruined(in a good way!) as \"Tarantula\", the first album single, rocks your brains out with its anthemic chorus and Corgans squealing guitar. \"Starz\" is a very stop-and-start song with cloud and quiet parts. I think Jimmy shows off lot in this track :). \"United States\", probably my atwood fax. song on Zeitgeist, is an epic colossal nine:fifty-one Smashing Pumpkins grand song masterpiece much like \"Silverf*ck\" was, but with some jazz and metal elements in it(mainly the instrumentation). The song is angry! \"Neverlost\" to me is kind of sappy softy with a bubbly noise(zilaphone?) in the background. \"Bring The Light\" brings the rock back and follows in the same vein as \"That's the Way (My Love Is)\", which is a good thing. \"(Come On) Let's Go!\" demands your attention like \"Tarantula\" did and rocks just as hard. \"For God & Country\" sounds lot like an early Cure song, with a steady drum beat and keyboard. The songs lyrics (to me) are very inspirational and have a hopeful message in them. ahhhh. the final song \"Pomp And Circumstance\" is the most old SP sounding song on the record and continues the SP's reputation of ending records with painfully beautiful grand finally song. Hopefully, Zeitgeist will be only the first of many records to come from The Smashing Pumpkins, because like lot of people who grew up listening to this band, the news of the groups two thousand and seven reformation was a dream almost come true. Maybe in the near future D'arcy and Iha will rejoin, but if not, whatever. As Apparent in Zeitgeist, Corgan and Camberlin seem to have no problem continuing the SP legacy.

Shapiro \"Deftones Worldwide\"","helpful":[2,4],"reviewText":"breaking pumpkins regenerates and moves more (or stronger) than never with the zigzag. It is a shame that DRC and James never met again, but the results were unsatisfactory. \"Doomsday Clock\" is a powerful opening track, and it moves like a machine. I jumped down, screamed, cheered, danced a little. On this day, Samsung Pumpkins played a farewell program in the metro. Despite the fact that this group helped explain my early youth, it abused my page in the last few years of the twentieth century. Over the years, I lost interest in band music and became disillusioned with Billy Corgan's singing style. So on this glorious winter day of two thousand, I celebrated the fact that the music group would no longer be there to erase my memories. I now remember my one hundred, nine hundred and ninety-six tablets without the constant interruption of new albums and songs. And on June twenty-one, two thousand and five, Mr. Corgan illegally announced that a band was being formed to make a new album, and I felt a little out of place. So now, after seven years of peace, Smashing Pumpkins is back. And not only has their list changed, but so has my opinion of them. As expected, the Pumpkins changed their stone dramatically. The sound of this strong salty rock, which I loved so much in the early nineties, had long since faded away instead of this heavy, constant sound. This is confirmed by \"Zeitgeist\", \"Central Peace\" of \"United States\", a ten minute epic that could be a deadly weapon of this tool if it were not for the words of Corgan that remain in the nose. Even the softest moments of the album are extremely painful, almost almost obscure clouds. Drummer Jimmy Chamberlain looks better than never on this album, perhaps released by the band's new direction. Since the band split into two thousand, my dislike of Billy Corgan's voice has only been reinforced by this solo album and Forgotten Zwan. So I did't expect Morgan to be surprised when I first heard \"Zeitgeist\" and surprisingly the has't been so surprised yet. Most of the time, it looks like these words are very different from other bands on the plane. Take, for example, the \"hour of judgment\" in which the difference between accent and band is noticeable. At the same time, however, Coron's lyrics have an extraordinary appeal to those who emerge as the album progresses. I was surprised to learn that although Morgan's words had bothered me from the start of the album, I would have stayed with him completely by the send of the album. They don't bother me at all anymore. The album begins with a very impressive \"Doomsday Clock\" in which Corgan sings in anticipation of the demise of a civilized world: \"Kafka may be proud to know that I am confident in posting.\" That's how I was shocked! \" Chamberlain's brilliant drum not only makes the song a good start, but also takes it along its length. \"That's the way it is (my love)\" is not very popular all around. The cat's voice play is not fun at all, and the music is worth forgetting. There is some relief that will be found in heavy synthesizer, however, in my opinion saving the song is not enough. Fortunately, the next two tracks, \"Tarantula\" and \"Starz\" are enough to clear your mind. \"Tarantula\" is an endless rock song that features really impressive guitar playing (in depth, someone calls and finds this song in the next guitar hero) and found the cat singing \"We're Real\" If the real never existed, and just because we say, \"Every living soul is doomed, we are a victim of someone else.\" It did't matter to me when I first heard it. It has since become my favourite song on the album. Going forward, despite the fact that \"Stars\" shared the name of the television network, it soon became my favourite song. On \"Zeitgeist\". Part of the song when Billy sang \"We are the stars, we are\" is so well-crafted that it is quickly absorbed into your memory. Add it to the last thirty seconds and amazing songs, and you've got yourself one of the best Pumpkins songs of the last fifteen years. And \"Bring the Light\" is a religious song in which the cat sings \"You can spit in the dust and mix my money and your blood\" before revealing the title, \"Son of God.\" This is what it is. What did I learn from \"Zeitgeist\"? I've learned that just because a band artist has't released a decent album in over a decade does't mean it's \"lost.\" Most importantly, however, I've learned that Smashing Pumpkins are back for good! The band has lost two very important members, but under the direction of Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlain, I can say that Jeff Schroeder and Ginger Reis performed well. Despite the fact that \"Zeitgeist\" may have a few longest tracks (depending on which version you buy), there is no doubt that it is the best rock album of two thousand and seven so far. This announcement is coming to you because of someone who did't expect much from \"Zeitgest\" and ended up getting something good. For fans of Smashing Pumpkins, you must buy! Recommended for fans of Smashing Pumpkins, even those who never got tired of the band after \"Adore\" and \"Machina\". Keywords: a. Two \"hours of doomsday\". Three \"Tarantula\". Four \"stars\". Five \"America\". \"Bring Light\" Seven out of ten stars","overall":5,"summary":"The (new) Smashing Pumpkins Return!","unixReviewTime":1184112000,"reviewTime":"07 11, 2007"}

The songs (not surprising after looking at the cover) seem to be facing these attacks in your modern society when they are still broad in definition. This is probably the strongest record of pumpkins by \"Gush\". Zeitgeist songs? \"Dom Day Clock\" is a powerful opening track, and it runs like Machine I's opening song \"Everlasting Guys\". But unlike Machina I, Zeitgeist angrily attacks with \"Seven Shades of Black\". \"Bleeding the Orchid\" is probably my favourite song on record, starting with the beautiful melodies of the word Corgans. The song says a lot of \"Adorish\", but it has great Kimberlyn music! A dream came true. A rocky rock song similar to \"Thats The Way (My Love Is A)\" \"Siamese Dream\" has some searching features, and it concludes well. Things are getting worse (well!) Like \"Tarantula\", the first solo album, it shakes your mind with your anthem and playing the Corgans guitar. \"Stars\" is a separate song with clouds and quiet parts. I think Jimmy is showing a lot in this line :). \"America\", maybe my Atwood fax. The song for Zeitgeist is a nine-song track: Fifty-one Smashing Pumpkins like \"Silverf * eck\", but with jazz and metal elements (especially instruments) on it. The song is angry! To me, \"Neverlost\" is a kind of soft noise in the background (zila phone?). \"Bering the Light\" returns to the rock and follows it as \"This is the way (my love)\", which is great. \"(Come on) let's go!\" It needs your attention as Tarantula does and moves hard. \"For God and Country\" sounds like the first healing song, with a strong drum beat and keyboard. The lyrics (for me) are very inspiring and have a message that you hope for. Ahh. The last song, \"Pump and Circumstances,\" is the oldest SP vocalist in the record, and at the send, it continues the SP's record-breaking completion with a particularly sweet song. I hope Zeitgeist will be the first of many records to appear in Smashing Pumpkins, because like many people listening to this group, the stories of two thousand seven revolutionary groups were a dream come true.

(Not surprisingly after looking at the router section) It seems to be the strike we are facing now in modern society, but the explanation is still broad. This could be the Pumpkins' hardest rock record since \"Gish\". A song of the spirit of the times? \"Doomsday Clock\" is a powerful opening song, as shocking as my opening song \"Everstanding Gaze\" in Machina; but unlike Machina I, the Zeitgeist moves with \"seven dark shadows\". \"Bleeding Orchid\" is probably my favourite song, which begins with the sweet sound of Corgans' voice. This song is very \"religious\", but with the amazing Cumberlin drums! The dream is coming true. \"That's the Way (My Love Is This)\" is a happy rock song, reminiscent of \"Siamese Dream\", with some experimental elements and a beautiful ending.

The song on Zeitgeist is nine outstanding songs: fifty-one Smashing Pumpkins songs are excellent, like \"Silverf * eck\", but have some elements of jazz and metal (mostly musical instruments). The song is cloud! \"Neverlost\" to me is a soft and soft background with a bubble noise (phones?). \"Bring light\" replaces rock and roll, and like \"That's the way (My love is)\", this thing is fine. \"(Come) Let's go!\" It demands your attention like a \"tarantula\", and it moves very much. \"To God & Earth\" sounds very much like an instant healing song, with stable drums and keyboards. The lyrics of this song (mine) are encouraging and have a message of hope. Tshotsho. The last song \"Pomp And Circumstance\" is the oldest SP song on record, and continues the SP fame to send the record with a sad and beautiful song at the send.

Although I might need some time to think about where to place them in my list of favourite bands, this album proves that they rank pretty high on the Richter scale.\"Icky Thump\" is an earthquake-shaker of an album, starting off with a title track with slamming guitar chords, Meg White's cloud cymbals and an angular guitar solo acting as the chorus. The solo is followed by a schizophrenic keyboard solo that adds much more excitement to a spectacular start. And the excitement never ceases. Jack White literally turns into a wannabe-Spanish tenor, with this cry on the epic \"Conquest\". Who would have thought that Jack would go so far with this cloud songs? Another original twist comes in the form of bagpipes. \"Prickly Thorn\" starts as a folk-song, complete with clapping. However, it changes gears in a psychedelic bagpipe melody, mixed with strange quotes and laughs. And it still features awesome exploding songs, such as \"Little Cream Soda\". Although I have heard Jack White give odd monologues alongside cloud guitar blasts, this coolest one yet came in this song. He spends time reminiscing about times when the wanted this nice cream soda a little colder, passing it off by saying \"oh well.\"I'd have to say that Jack White is starting to develop quite an lego, though. With \"Rag and Bone,\" Jack literally brags that \"If it's just things that you don't want, I can use 'em\/Meg can use 'em\/Make some money out of 'em, at least\". Still, I'd have to say that Jack White has every reason to brag--they're the hottest band out in America right now, and still as explosive as they were when they began. But still, back to rocking. In fact, \"Catch Hell Blues\" shows off Jack's wacky slide guitar effects. I love how inventive Jack is with high-pitched guitar squeals. I missed these squeals from bands such as \"Rage Against the Machine,\" and I'm glad White has made the squeals cool again (thank goodness!). And finally, Jack has never sounded so soulful as in the last jam, \"Effect and Cause\". There's nothing better than a simple acoustic guitar song, with excellent protest lyrics such as \"Well you can't take the effect\/And make it the cause\/I did't rob a bank\/Cos you made up the law\". This is, to date, The White Stripes' explosion album that shows them off at their best.

However, it changes gears to the mental song of the bagpipe, by discussing exotic quotes and jokes. It still has great explosive songs such as \"Little Cream Soda\". Although I have heard Jack White perform an unusual monologue accompanied by the explosion of a guitar cloud, this is the coolest monologue to this song. He gave himself time to remember when the wanted this sweet cream soda a little cold, passing it by saying \"Oh, that's fine\". However, I must say that Jack White started developing a few Lego bricks.

However, I must say that Jack White has good reason to be proud \u2014 now I see the hottest team in the United States, and they are still exploding as they were when they first started.

The solo is accompanied by a schizophrenic solo keyboard which adds a lot of excitement to the good start. And the happiness does not stop. Jack White literally transforms into a wannabe-Spanish tenant, with this slogan reflected in the slogan \u201cConquest\u201d. Who would have thought that Jack would go to these necessary songs? Another original twist came in the form of plastic bags. \u201cPrickly Thorn\u201d begins with a group song, ending with an applause. However, it changes the rhythms of brainstorming rhythms, mixed with surprising and funny quotes. And it still contains some of the most feared explosive songs, like \u201cLittle Cream Soda\u201d. While I heard Jack White provide an unusual melody along with a rhythmic guitar explosion, the coolest still came into this song. She takes the time to remind herself of the times that this creamy soda is pretty cold, passing it on by saying \"oh well.\" I would say Jack White is starting to build a legacy, though. In \"Men and Bones,\" Jack literally boasts that \"If it's just something you don't like, I can use 'em \/ Meg can use' mem \/ Make money from 'em, at least\". However, I have to say that Jack White has every reason to be proud - they are the hottest team to leave America today, and are still exploding like they were when they started. But still, back to shaking. In fact, \u201cCatch Hell Blues\u201d showcases the effects of Jack\u2019s soft guitar. I like how the creative Jack with the high guitar cried. I\u2019m not into this shout out from groups like \u201cAnger Against the Machine,\u201d and I\u2019m glad White calmed the alarm again (thanks!). Finally, Jack has never been psychologically like this latest sweetheart, \u201cImpact and Cause\u201d.

It is, until now, the explosive album \u2018Stripes White\u2019 that shows the best.

Hoffman \"artist and musician\"","helpful":[3,5],"reviewText":"Each IRON AND WINE album has been a slow progression from the previous, often reminding me of Dylan's evolution from folk, to folk rock, to country rock, each album moving into someplace new, utterly creative and yet honest to the score belief of the artist. Sam Bean's score music has never changed. His lyrics have always been, and are, about Love and Sex, Sin and Christian spirituality, and rural southern pastoral imagery. Sean Beam's harmonic sophistication has grown, and now resides definitely in the extended chords, and key modulation, that screams JAZZ! However, the melodic movements remain folk like, almost simplistic, yet open to vocal harmonies. (another key element to the IRON AND WINE sound.) If GHOST ON GHOST had stayed where KISS EACH OTHER CLEAN was, I'd have been really disappointed, something I've never experienced with this music. GHOST ON GHOST has brought it all together, piece by piece, which you've seen in each previous routing. The country\/folk elements still show up in \"Baby Backstage\". The electronica the explored on songs like \"Carried Home\" still pop up on the songs. The tight rock song, perfected on this masterpiece THE SHEPHERDS DOG still exists on songs like \"Grace for Saints and Ramblers\"(the hit video is on Utoob). The heavy use of horns which first surfaced on IN THE REINS with Calexico, appears on almost all the songs. However, the previous album, KISS EACH OTHER CLEAN, showed the jazz chops that Sam Bean loves, like the insane sax solo on \"Your Fake Name\". Now, everything has come together, all invention has risen, and GHOST ON GHOST gives the fans the ultimate IRON AND WINE album. (At least until the next album.) Songs at times remains space, lots of negative space, only to slide into sonic textures, using the orchestral color studiously, like brass chops, vocal harmonizing, strings, keyboards, stand up bass, percussion, back up singing, and Sam's acoustic guitar riffs, and pedal steel. This album especially explores vocal experimentation hitherto unheard on IRON AND WINE albums. AT times the voice has deep reverb, other times the instrumentation includes layered vocal parts, as the primary instrument of the song. Even the string charts, often the bane of production, flicker thru the soundscape subtle. \"Sundown\", for example, only has a small violin lead during the final four measures of the song. Overall, mid and slow tempo songs tend to predominate. However \"Lover's Revolution\" (My favourite song), starts out largo, SLOWLY increases tempo, until the song becomes a hard bop jazz tune, with sax solo dripping it up, until the last verse hits at PRESTO speed, all jazz chords circling your head. Only to RETARD back to the first tempo to finish. Amazing. GHOST ON GHOST presents as a relaxing, deep, introspective, jazzy, kaleidoscopic, cinematic album. If you're a fan of the IRON AND WINE sound, for rather, SOUNDS, then get it. It will amaze.","overall":5,"summary":"Sam Bean smokes the Jazz Cigarette","unixReviewTime":1366243200,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2013"}

Hoffman \"artist and musician\"","helpful":[3,5],"reviewText":"The entire IRON NEWANINI album has been slightly developed from the past. It always reminds me of Dylan's evolution from folk rock to folk rock to country. Sam Bean's song has't changed. His songs have always been about love and sex, sin and the Christian spirit, and the unflattering images of the countryside in the south. The complexity of the Sean Beam harmony continues to grow, and now it is definitely present in the extended songs and songs, which makes JAZZ bring! However, the movement of the music is still similar to folk songs, almost simple, but open to voice harmony. (Another great feature of the sound of IRON AND NINE.) If GHOST ON GHOST resides where KISS EACHANE CLEAN, I would be very disappointed. This is music I have never heard before. GHOST ON GHOST combines everything you see in each previous track, piece by piece. The country \/ person material still appears in \"Baby Backstage\". Electronic music explored in songs such as \"Caried Home\" is still appearing in the songs. Strong rock songs, the perfect shepherd dog for this masterpiece still exist in songs such as \"Grace for Saints and Ramblers\" (a popular video on Utoob). The widespread use of horns first appeared in REINS and Calexico, and appeared in almost every song. However, the previous album KISS EACH OTHER ACLEAN featured Sam Bean's favourite jazz, like a crazy solo saxophone under the name \"Fake Name\". Now that everything is in place and all the fiction has been revealed, GHOST ON GHOST is providing fans with the latest album IRON AND WINE. (At least until the next album.) Sometimes there is still a place for songs, a lot of wrong places, just slipping into a sound network, deliberately using orchestras, such as brass bells, symphony, strings, keyboards, vertical scratch. , percussion, backing vocals, enhancements and a percussion instrument for Sam\u2019s guitar sound. This album directly examines voicemails that have not been heard on IRON NEWANINI's album so far. Sometimes the sound has a deep sound, and sometimes the instrument includes the sleeping sound position as the main instrument of the song. Even the string charts, which are always in the fourth product, blink at hidden sounds. For example, \"Sundown\" has a short violin that leads to the last four bars of the song. In general, medium and slow songs tend to dominate. However, \"Lover's Revolution\" (my favourite song), started slowly, very fast, until the song became a heavy jazz song, and the saxophone just fell down until the last verse became PRESTO Speed \u200b\u200bhits, the rest. Jazz songs around your head. Only when RETARD returns to the original rhythm can it be completed. It's amazing. GHOST ON GHOST is a cool, deep, visual album, jazz, kaleidoscope, movie-like. If you like the sound of IRON AND WINE, exactly, SOUNDS, come and listen. It will be amazing.","overall":5,"summary":"Sam Bean smokes the Jazz Cigarette","unixReviewTime":1366243200,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2013"}

Hoffman \"artist and musician\"","helpful":[3,5],"reviewText":"Every IRON AND WINE album is moving slowly from the past, often reminding me of Dylan's evolution from man to man, to the human rock, to the rock of the world, every album in a new place. Moves, creating entirely but honestly from the artist's point of view. Sam Bean's point music never changed. His songs have always spoken, and the talks about love and sex, sin and Christian spirituality, as well as rural sculptures. Sean Beam's harmonic complexity has increased, and now definitely stays in the extended chords as well as key flexibility, which is the slogan of JAZZ! However, the movement of music is always human, almost simple, but open to the sounds of sound. (Another important feature in the sound of Iron and Nine.) I would be really disappointed if Ghost on Ghost lived in Aishwarya Klein, something I had never heard of in this music. Ghost on Ghost covers everything, every piece, that you saw in the previous way. The world of humanity \/ objects is still visible in the \"baby backstage\". Electronic tests for songs such as \"Creed Home\" still appear in songs. A solid rock music song, perfect for a masterpiece of part, still exists in songs such as Shepherd's Dog \"Grace for Saints and Ramblers\" (a popular video on YouTube). The heavy use of horns, which first appeared in Rennes and Calexico, appears in almost every song. However, the previous album KISS EACHOTHER CLEAN included Sam Ben's favourite jazz songs, such as the solo sex song \"Your Fake Name\". Now, everything has come together, everything has been created, and GHOST ON GHOST is giving fans the latest IRON AND WINE album. (At least until the next album.) The songs are sometimes left in place, a very painful place, just to skip over the sound performance, using orchestral orchestration, such as copper cops, with sound, strings, Keyboard, stop bass, beats, support song, and Sam's sound guitar beats, and a treadmill. This album focuses primarily on sound tests that have never been heard on IRON and WINE albums. Sometimes the sound is deep, in other cases the musical instruments include word-for-word parts, such as the main instrument of the song. Even cable charts, usually a production four, glow when the sound is muted. \"Sun Down\", for example, has only a small violin that moves between the last four stages of the song. Overall, medium and light tempo songs predominate. However, \"Lover Revolution\" (my favourite song), Caterpillar starts, slowly rises in the air, until the song becomes hard-boop music, and the sex solo drips, even the last verse of Presto's rapid collision. Yes, just go back to the original tempo to complete the head around all the jazz codes. It is amazing. GHOST ON GHOST presents as a relaxed, deep, self-aware, jazz, kaleidoscopic, cinema album. If you're a fan of IRON NEWINE audio, instead of sound, get it. That would be great.","overall":5,"summary":"Sam Bean smokes the Jazz Cigarette","unixReviewTime":1366243200,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2013"}
