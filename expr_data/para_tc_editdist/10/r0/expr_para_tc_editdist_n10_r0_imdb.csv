193,"I had before a feeling of dislike for all Russian films. But, after seeing this film I haven´t. This is a unique masterpiece made by the best director never lived in the USSR. He knows the part of film making, and can use it very well. If you find this movie: buy for copy it!",positive
193,"This is a unique work of part made by the greatest emperor of all time in the Soviet Union. He knows where to make the film and can use it well. If you get this movie: I remember thinking it was cool at the time and there were a few toys, but watching it now makes me cry. I never realized how boring and boring this cartoon show was before. This is bad! He is far from the He-man of ""Transformers"" and ""Thunderbolt Cat"", and when production ceases, almost everyone will quickly forget it. I only watched it at Fox Kids, because ""Ulysses thirty-one"" is close behind (if the mask does't make me fall asleep first). Cartoon from the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, once compared to Fox Kids, I hope I forget it again!",positive
1370,"I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Brontë's novel when I read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy BBC dramas. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be as bad as that: the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had. First of all, the music (and songs) seems totally out of place in a period drama (sounds as if it's been written for a contemporary horror film)and like another commentator, I was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun around the factors. I've seen some scenes filmed that way in ""North and South"" and it seemed all right there but in The Tenant, it's definitely overdone and simply annoying. Camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively. Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity. None of the characters were properly introduced at first. The little boy gave a very good performance, the's very cute and the best feature of the film. SPOILERS Tara Fitzgerald's characterisation of Helen Graham made her appear cold and harsh, letting no emotion pass through. She does't seem to be table to cry at all in a realistic way. I just could't believe Markham could have fell for her and I'm not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given. I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband! Fancy being married to such a virago. Besides, the was the only main factor that sounded right to me. Toby Stephens I found just OK, Helen Graham's brother not very good. Maybe it's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty. Besides, what is only hinted at and left to the reader's imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the TV adaptation: making some scenes both gross and comic, (like when Huntingdon's eye starts bleeding) and others far too sexed up for a period drama! I mean, don't we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas?",negative

1370,"I bought this change because I loved it so much when I read Anne Bronte's novel a while ago, and I always love the BBC TV series. But I never thought it would be so bad: the whole series made me laugh, it did’t move me like a novel. First of all, the music (and the songs) seemed completely out of place in the theatre (sounded like it was written for the current horror movie), and like any other commentator, I was particularly annoyed by the way the camera rotated. thing. I've seen some scenes shot this way in the ""North and South"", and it looks good there, but in ""Employer"", it's definitely passing and annoying. Camera movement cannot make tree activity live. Most of the second paragraphs are difficult to distinguish from the first, and the text is not clear enough. Initially, none of the roles were correctly identified. The boy’s performance is very good and very good, the main character of the film. The appearance of Helen Graham's Spoiler Tara Fitzgerald makes her look cold and bitter, without passing. She does't seem ready to cry in the right way. I could't believe that Markham could be in love with her, and I never mentioned her way of cutting her hair. I could't help but feel sorry for her husband! He wants to marry such a Virgo. Other than that, this is the only main thing that sounds good to me. Toby Stephens, I think that's right, Helen Graham's brother is wrong. It can be difficult to compile a novel that includes vague themes such as drunkenness and cruelty. In addition, the book offers advice and leaves the reader with an idea, but the TV show adaptation is full of compliments: some scenes are dirty and funny (e.g., when Huntington's eyes start to bleed), while others are very stimulating. drama! I mean, haven't we seen enough about sex scenes in current dramas?",negative
1370,"I got into the habit because I really liked Anne Brunt's novel when I read it in the past and I often enjoy BBC dramas. But very disappointing, I never thought it would be so bad: the whole series made me laugh more than the novel did. First, the music (and songs) seem out of place in a temporary play (it looks like it was written for a modern film) and as another commentator, I rotate the camera and rotate the elements. Was very upset by the way. I've seen scenes filmed like this in ""North and South"" and it looked like that but in The Tenant, it's exaggerated and disturbing. The motion of the camera cannot revive the grip of wood. Most of the other verses were difficult to distinguish from the first and the text blacks clarity. Initially, no character was properly introduced. The little boy played very well, the was great and the became a great feature of the film. The devastation of Tara Fitzgerald in the role of Helen Graham made him cold and cruel, not letting this emotions pass. She seems to have no table to literally cry. I could't believe that Markham could fight it and I was't going to fix the bad hair the was given. I can't help but feel for her husband! I like to marry such a Verago. Also, it was the only important factor I liked. Toby Stephens I got it right, Helen Graham's ugly brother. Perhaps it is difficult to combine a novel on topics such as alcoholism and cruelty. In addition, the book focuses on the reader's only show of imagination and complaining of forgetting to turn on the TV: something that makes the scene worse and more humorous, (such as when Huntington's eye begins to bleed). That other sex dramas are more involved. ! I mean, don't we get so much accommodation in modern sports?",negative
1370,"I bought this equipment because I really liked Anne Brontë's story when I read it a few hours ago and I especially enjoyed BBC dramas. But I was so disappointed, I did’t think it was going to be so bad: the whole series made me laugh more than it moved me as a storyteller. At first, the music (and the songs) seemed to have completely disappeared from the seasonal drama (it seemed to be written for a modern horror film) and like any other commentator, I was particularly troubled by the movement of the cameras. and they move on to issues. I saw scenes filmed like “North and South” and it seems to be right there but for the Tenant, it is definitely overlooked and easily offended. Wood cannot activate camera movements. Most secondary roles are difficult to separate first and the finger is not clear. None of the characters are portrayed well in the first place. The little boy put on a very good performance, the was very good and the look of the film was very good. SPOILERS Tara Fitzgerald’s portrayal of Helen Graham looks cool and rough, not allowing any emotions to pass. He does’t seem to be putting real tears on the table. I can’t believe Markham could have fallen without mentioning the bad haircut given to him. I could’t help but feel a little sympathy for her husband! Such a virago would love to get married. Besides, that’s just the big point valid for me. Toby Stephens I'm just OK, Helen Graham's brother in't very good. A new story about bad substances such as alcohol and cruelty can be difficult to adapt. Besides, the only one presented and left to the reader’s imagination in the book is sitting there complaining about TV adaptation: making some big shows and comedy, (as if Huntingdon’s eye started bleeding) and the others are very sexy during the concert! I mean, karen’t we bedridden in modern drama?",negative
2500,"But I can't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung. Where to begin. The film quality, there in't any. I've seen clearer pictures on America's FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS! The acting is substandard, the gore effects is okay. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least in a Friday THE thirteenTH for HALLOWEEN we stick with one main character for the most part. There is no main characters, just victims. Man, now we come to the worst part of all.

What kind of send do you call, stupid, of course. In my opinion, there is no reason to send the horror in a horror movie, this is a careless writing. The reason is, ""There must be a bad ending.

13834,"So many people have taken shots at Platoon and Born On the Fourth of July among other calling them ""leftist propaganda film."" Now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. To me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views. The acting and writing was a little to clickéd for my liking. Mel Gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by steaming up with this partner Randall Wallace for yet another one. Throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical ""Just tell my family I love them"" for ""Tell Ronny to spray before shoe goes to bed"" lines. The was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that I felt like I had to vomit. How about that scene were Gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this ""no color"" applies to what to put in the washing machine. Its in the mid-sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her. Another scene is were Gibson's daughter tasks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter. The directing displayed this all perfectly. The countless scenes of Gibson and this family for soldiers praying. I'm fine with showing that once for twice but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. The director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in Vietnam. What exactly was won their. The cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the American flag in the distance scenes spread throughout. I love America but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do. This may seem like a grant and maybe it is but I cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad. This movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. To me it says if your not Christian your wrong. Would God for Jesus want people to kill I don't think so. To me this movie was offensive. At first this movie was funny with the countless clickés and overacted scenes but then when I looked at what this movie was trying to say for not say it was really frustrating to watch. I guess though it is my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this comment offensively because I am not criticizing religion for patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else. If you want a real depiction of the Vietnam war watch Platoon, Born On the Fourth of July, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter for The Killing Fields. Even Full Metal Jacket which I absolutely hated was a better depiction. I have read a quote that in context says a true patriot does not go with everything the government for country does but questions it when its wrong. A real patriot loves their country too much to see it do bad things.",negative

13834,"Many people photographed ""Pai"" and ""Born on July fourth."" Some people call them ""Left Promos."" Now is my chance to make a film about politics. To me, this video has a profound effect on certain religious beliefs and their political views. In my choice, making and writing is fun. Mel Gibson seems to love to play roles in these violent movies, and the has shown this by working with this partner Randall Wallace again. Throughout the movie, there are garbage prototypes of ""Tell my family that I love them"" and ""Tell Ronnie to spray shoes before bed"". This waste disposal line makes me feel like I have to vomit. What about the situation where Gibson's wife went to the laundry? This “no color” applies to items that are installed in the washing machine. In the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys, the was trapped under rocks and did not notice the racism surrounding him. Another scene was Gibson's daughter telling him what the war was about, and the affair was filmed in a trivial matter. The director showed all of this perfectly. Many pictures of Gibson and the family praying for soldiers. I can show it once for twice, but after a while I wonder if this movie is trying to put something in my mind. How many scenes are the most glorious moments in the American flag photographed with stage music. The boss made us look like we were successful in Vietnam. What exactly won them over. Cinematography is the worst, slowing down to see the American flag in the distance everywhere. I love America, but a movie like this seems to compliment every little thing we do. This may seem like a funding, and it may be true, but when such a movie makes non-religious people love the country that they will admit anything that seems bad to their country, I can’t bear it. This movie is narrow for me, limited in many ways. To me, it says that if you are not a Christian, you are wrong. Does God want people to kill for Jesus? I do not think so. To me, this movie is annoying. At first the movie was funny, of countless clicks and extra-curricular events, but when I watched what the movie was about to say, I did't say it was annoying. I think even though it was my mistake that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one will offend this article, because I am not criticizing religion for being patriotic, but for some open-minded people who treat both and look out for others. If you want to show Vietnam images of the Vietnam War, born on July four, now the Apocalypse, hunters are rushing to the slaughterhouses. Even the full metal jacket that I hate so much is a better description. I read a sentence that says, in essence, real religions do not agree with what the government is doing for the country, but ask if they are wrong.

13834,"Many people picked up guns in Platoon and Bourne on July four, and others called it a ""left-wing propaganda film."" Now it's my turn to make a political film. To me, this film is very much about some religious beliefs and its political ideology. Acting and writing was a little click to my liking. Mel Gibson seems to like playing in these unnecessarily violent films and the proved it again with this partner Randall Wallace. Throughout the film, the trash method was ""just tell your family I love them"" for ""ask Ronnie to spray the shoe before going to bed."" I was so full of these reusable lines that I felt like I had to vomit. What about the incident when Gibson's wife went to wash clothes and this ""colorless"" applies to what should be put in the washing machine. In the mid-sixtys, the was trapped under a cliff without any prejudice. Another incident is that Gibson's daughter has become accustomed to what a war is and this incident has been shot with such a short story. The guide has shown it in its entirety. Countless scenes of Gibson and this family of soldiers praying. I won by showing it twice but after a while I wondered if this movie was trying to put something in my mind. In this Slim Hour, many scenes with the American flag were filmed with beautiful music. The director made it and it felt like we had some kind of victory in Vietnam. Which really defeated them. Cinematography was even worse when there were small scenes where American flags were flying everywhere in remote institutions. I love America but movies like this compliment every little thing we do. It may and may not seem like a government grant, but I can't stand it when a film like this convinces infidels of their country so much that they will agree with whatever their country looks like. To me, this film is a bit of a fantasy and is limited in many respects. To me, if you're not a Christian, it's your fault. If the God of Jesus wants people to kill, I don't think so. This movie was upsetting for me. At first, the movie was ridiculous with a lot of clicks and over-the-top scenes, but when I saw what the movie was trying to say, it did't mean it was too boring to watch. I think it was my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one will take this comment too seriously because I am not criticizing religion for being patriotic but there are some less intelligent people who cling to both of them and despise each other. If you want a real demonstration of the Vietnam War platoon, which was born on July four, Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter for The Killing Fields. Even the jackal metal jacket that I absolutely hated was a better picture.

What torture they went through and remained faithful. That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case. It was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that scared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him. I could tell when one the cops was flying. He would not look the defender in the eyes. His eyes moved to the side when the answered the questions. It is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of this skin. I read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men. They were finally found guilty after many years. I can't remember the title, but it was the same premise. Whites doing whatever they want with blacks. I am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and paedophiles are white. No comment from her.

Emma is a beautiful young woman who plays a confident, hardworking and proud role with good manners and good taste. He does't get caught up in the fashion competition around him. The building has a particular weakness, unlike Nancy Drew's literature, and an attempt to figure out where we are in a decade. (Like, what's that car, anyway?) I read the IMDb review before watching the movie, because I was researching Rachael Leigh Cook for other movies. It's not one of this best roles, but I will continue to look for some of this films. Rachel was too old to play the leader, but she did well as an adult orphan amidst a mystery. I am very disappointed with some of the reviews written there. Some expect a full connection with the books, others expect the most authentic scenes in the elders' action film. I got what I was looking for! Good fun is for young girls, and their fathers are looking for good kids with high morals and success. This is a tan PG movie, not James Bond!

43827,"Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly routine outdoor yarn ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-four) pits the Cheyenne against the U. S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was pleased in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies haired was inexplicably in black & white. The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of ""Black Spurs"") eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with this old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""), who has killing on this mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that this Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On this way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of ""Objective, Burma!""), about the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of ""I, Jury"") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally, Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has braided this ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, eighty-two-minute boater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag seventeen"") brings in this partner with an narrow in this chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the narrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and skills this helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and this partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after your heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives for everybody will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an narrow in the back for this efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a amiable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of ""West Side Story"") and Robert Bray of ""Lassie"" fame is on hand briefly as the will-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women, and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has been keeping a secret that the is a Native American, too! Ironically, the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what your heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after the has run out of bullets. ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity for yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to ""Casablanca"" scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately, ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of ""Broken Arrow"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty and the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty, makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of this early roles. Actually, Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called ""War Paint"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three) with Robert Stack. Incidentally, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both went on to become regulars on ""The Rockford Files"".",negative

43827,"""Yellow Tomahawk"" is a common external thread. The action opens with the escape of Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun) to many Indians. Katherine ‘Kate’ Bolden (Peggy Castle) is actually naked in her bathing suit. . The film shows love in all its glory, but does’t find one of the pitfalls that happens to most couples; and in other words the film is about two people who have a very close relationship to perfection as the relationship is not coming - just a problem, the problem of time. While most relationships send over time, it only gets stronger all the time, and time itself is the only thing that lasts. Before Sunrise is certainly not the usual feel of ‘Hollywood Love’, which is another aspect that precedes the titles of this film rather than the pretenders. The story follows two people, Jesse; America and Celine; The French girl meets on a train in Vienna. They immediately connected, and after being told this bad idea on a television show and getting off the train, Jesse caught Celine to go with him to the beautiful city of Vienna that day. Before Sunrise worked for two reasons - logical action and good writing that builds characters through their thoughts and feelings and therefore allows us to learn how people learn in real life. This allows the characters to be independent, and it’s easy to believe that these are real people and not issues that work with the text. It also allows us to feel who the characters are, and not just because they are the characters. This kind of reality is hard to come by because, when the day comes, we know they will be watching a movie and not looking at real life; but Before Sunrise is meant to be one of the real life shows never seen on screen. A really good article can’t work on its own, and it takes big issues to reach a fair amount of justice, and although I’m not a fan of Julie Deply’s Ethan Hawke; When you watch this movie, you can do nothing but respect the two of them. I don’t know if they’re used to playing just for themselves, but when the movie is like this; no problem. In this film, it is the writing of the most important thing, and in the text there are some observations about life, most of which I cannot personally relate. This is what Richard Linklater has achieved in this article because it has not only been table to create and develop characters, but it has also demonstrated what true love is, along with many other aspects of life.ah. The fact that all the stories don’t relate to me personally again means the beauty of the text. Everyone is different, so different parts of the text will appeal to different people. There may be certain aspects of a person that one person loves and another hates; That is the point of the poems in this article. Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna. The city itself in’t really important for the film because it’s a story that can happen anywhere - but it makes for some beautiful scenes and romantic, colourful love throughout the film’s flowers that fit the beauty of the avenue. . Before Sunrise is at once beautiful and enchanting. Richard Linklater did something rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without overwhelming intense emotions. Before the sun rises is what it is. And what it is, is the brilliance of pure cinema.",negative

This is one of the many unanswered questions by Richard Alan Simmons in this eighty-two-minute short film. Why did a cavalry bury their weapons in a secret place in the wilderness rather than put them in a castle? As soon as they discovered this, the Indians began to attack, knocking down the hero and making him the only survivor. Prior to the attack, a pair of white inspectors climbed into the castle. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag Seventeen"") introduced this short companion. When Adam uses hot water to help remove stenosis, the greedy Sawyer grinds the deep shaft and provides skills to the helpless partner. Later, we learned that Sawyer and this partner had mined gold. After your hero withstood the test, the problem of gold distribution was not solved. Adam and the Fire Knife have the last prisoner of war, and the Fire Knife tasks Adam to hand it over to Major Ives, because everyone will die. Naturally, Adam refused, and the Indians began to cut off the whites. James Best, as part of the cavalry support, has received limited support in this endeavour.

In this humble firing west of Kanab, Utah, the biggest surprise was the brutal cavalry officer Ives slaughtered Indian men, women, and children in the infamous Shaxi Massacre Swamp. It has always been a secret.

Naturally, Major Ives rejects Adam's warning from the fire knife until the commander sees that someone has set up a dumping ground far from the palace. This is one of the many questions left in the screenplay of Richard Allen Siemens who went on the boat for weight minutes without answering. Why would the cavalry bury their graves in a secret place in the desert instead of in the courtyards? As soon as they found out, the Indians attacked, took out the hero, and left him only as a survivor. Before the attack, white riders were riding in the fort.

It became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful, but it condescended below even those expectations. The movie was directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who also stars in the movie as a tourist guide on the African river, who ends up having to strand this team on a remote island called Snake Island until another boat comes down to pick them up.

Low, so my risk should be known. The only reason I was upset to watch this incredible movie was because I did't know it was going to get worse, it was really night, I could't sleep, and in the past, very bad movies made me dry. She could and made me drowsy. It was too early for the film to go bad, but it fell short of expectations. The film was directed and written by Van Crawford, who also acted as a tourist guide on the African River in the film, who eventually needed Snake Island on a remote island until another boat took him. Came to get They sit down, get drunk, and are attacked by venomous snakes that are on a mission to clear the human island. If your jaw drops to the last sentence of my second paragraph, don't bother to read it again, correct it first. Honestly, I like the characteristics of my creatures where creatures only attack stupid and crazy people out of hunger, not because they have any kind of activity. These are unchanging snakes. They are not giants as you see in ""Anaconda"". They are just ordinary African snakes like mothers and lizards with brains to work together to form armies, to participate, to tie people up, to understand your language and even to dance! Has your drawing fallen off again? Well, it will go down slowly. Price in the middle of this very bad B movie, about the part where I had already left, the human characters started drinking around the fire and all of a sudden, they went into a kind of joke. And while they were dancing naked, the snakes just tried and jumped on it. The combination of this scene and the place where we know that the snake, one of the most savage creatures in the world, has formed an alliance against humans for some strange reason, has proved my flawed mind. ۔ And as soon as I for the filmmakers could't get it to the very bottom, the snakes started using it. People in the movie? Well, let's just say I've never decided that creatures kill everyone so quickly. I could't stand it anymore. I don't think I need to move on. You got a picture. If there's one thing that makes ""Snake Island"" different from its rivals, it's that it's attractive to try and become a giant, and that's not a compliment. Why - why - I keep collecting these horror movies, I think I will never really know. But ""Snake Island"" fell dramatically. It's a cheap, mediocre excuse for a moving picture that makes ""Anaconda"" a silly snake movie, clever and complex, and looks as interesting as Steven Spielberg's ""jaws"". You are warned.",negative

The only reason I insisted on watching this incredibly bad movie was because I knew it was going to be bad, really late at night, I could’t sleep, before, bad movies would take away my energy while I was sleeping you miss me It turned out too early that this film was going to be horrible, but it fell short of expectations. The film is directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who also stars in the film as a travel guide on Africa’s drivers, who send up tying the group to a secluded island called Snake Island until another boat lands to pick them up. ito. They masturbate, get drunk, and then succumb to the attacks of venomous snakes in an operation to cleanse their islanders. If your jaw dropped on the last sentence of my second line, don’t bother reading it again, you got it right the first time. In fact, I prefer the properties of my creation when living creatures (resources) are only attacking people unintentionally because of hunger, they don’t have to have some kind of operation. These are not mutant snakes. Not as big as you see in ""Anaconda."" Normally, everyday snakes in Africa like mamas and snakes only have the brain to make an army, take excuses, work together to kill people, understand your language, and even dance! did your equalizer go down again? So, it will continue. In the middle of this bad B-movie, about the part I gave earlier, the human crew starts drinking around the fireplace and then suddenly, they break some kind of goat. When they dance naked, the snakes suddenly stop hunting and start biting. The combination of this scene and the scene we discovered that snakes, some of the worst creatures on the planet, formed an alliance against humans for no apparent reason, which was very clear to my poor mind. And when filmmakers did’t bring it to a lower level, snakes started using it. The people in the movie? So, let’s just say I haven’t rooted the creature to kill everyone fast. I could't stand it anymore. I really don’t think I need to continue; you get the picture. If there’s one thing that differentiates “Snake Island” from its rivals, it’s it should dare to try to be perfect and that is not a commendable achievement. The reason - the only reason - I keep giving myself to these horrible movies, I don’t think I know. But “Snake Island” has reached a new low. It’s a cheap, rubbish excuse for a photographer to make “Anaconda,” a psychedelic film, that looks bright and modern and interesting in Steven Spielberg’s “Jaws”. You have been warned.",negative
48786,"Just saw a are-screening tonight. What can I say? It lived up to it's mediocre trailer run, though that's saying nothing at all. It did absolutely nothing that any movie before it has't done, and it played out in such a clické fashion that eventually I got to the point where I stopped laughing only because I was laughing with the audience, and instead let the humourless movie play out. So let's see. we have the less-than-spectacular main character that is trying to get back with this sex-girlfriend but the's not good enough for her, check. We have the three buddies that all have their own ""personality"" with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character's best friend but is constantly rejected, another friend being the super awkward one that can't live down seeing the positive in everything twenty-four/seven and is thrown in for the one-liners (which in this case is just a bunch of movie references, specifically from Disney), and the third guy whose name you won't never remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen. check. We have the girl's sex-boyfriend and her parents ****-block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up, not to mention the awkward family members from the main character's side. check. We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed, check. We have the movie's ""funny"" moments come from incessant swearing, people falling down for being hit, scenes from the trailer, and homosexual innuendos. check. And dare I call it a spoiler, but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie. check. Honestly, this could have. no, wait. should have been a PG-thirteen movie. All that needed to be dropped were any F-bombs. Honestly, it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humour, would have gotten less media exposure, and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent R-rated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up. The humour in this movie is just so awkward that it does't fit in with what general people look for. I bet even the factors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera. Let's put it this way. in the theatre, it will help you laugh because it's on the big screen and others are laughing. When this movie hits Showtime and you're checking it out at two:zero PM on an off-day, you may be inclined to change the channel. The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eve's hotness (who is not quite a ten, but still very good looking). Aside from the main resolution, this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie, where everything else pretty much flies out the window. So there is a main resolution, but what comes of it? It's never really clear-cut, nor does it allow the ending to be ""feel-good"" with the abruptness. There was only one thing worth nothing in this movie, and that was the good soundtrack. Aside from the nice choice of ninety's alternative rock songs, there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie (more so the beginning of it) that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix up/compose. I'll give them props for a great choice of sound. One last thing, this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer, because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion. I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it. But I say hold onto your money. If this was PG-thirteen and you were fifteen years old on a Friday night with a group of friends, I'd say knock yourselves out. Otherwise, definitely pass. It does't try and compete with the R-rated movies of the past few years, and ideally it definitely in't as good.",negative

The humour of this movie is really tough and has nothing to do with chasing ordinary people. I bet these things are always interrupted by the conversations and actions they should have in front of the camera. Let's put it this way. In the theatre, it will help you laugh, because it is on the big screen and everyone is laughing. When this movie is shown on Showtime and you watch it at twopm on a day off, you can tend to switch channels. The only thing you can think of is Alice Eve's sexy (she's under ten, but she's still very beautiful). In addition to the main solution, the film kicked off many small plots along the way, seemingly forgetting to write the many stories they were trying to develop at the beginning of the film, where almost everything came out the window. So there is a better solution, but what? It can never be too clear, and it does’t allow the ending to “feel good” because all of a sudden. There is only one thing about this movie that has no value, and it sounds good. In addition to a good selection of other rock songs in the ninetys, other parts of the film (especially the opening scene) played a song with a beautiful hope that reminded me of something to be mixed / composed by David Holmes. I will give them props and let them choose different sounds. One last thing, this movie may have been shot sometime in late summer, because Pepsi's support for not showing off the yellow bottle hats they had at the time of raising the rock band. I just think you see it, a lot of rock band players will catch it. But I'm stuck with your money. If this was a PG-thirteen and you were only fifteen when you were with a group of friends on a Friday night, I would say you fell for it. Otherwise, it will surely pass.
