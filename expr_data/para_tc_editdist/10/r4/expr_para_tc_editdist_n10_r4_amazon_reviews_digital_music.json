Six months prior, she had released A Star Is Born, which was her greatest box office film success to date. The accompanying soundtrack was Number one for six weeks, (the longest running Number one album of her career) which included her co-penned opus \"Evergreen,\" which also learned her an Academy Award for Best Song after spending three weeks at the pole position on the Billboard Hot one hundred. By one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, Streisand was still delivering an album a year, but the fact that she delivered Superman just six months following A Star Is Born was extremely unusual, especially since the soundtrack was still bring high on the charts. The pop success of Streisand was now in full gear, and the songs on Superman were further proof that Barbra, a singer who barely scratched the pop singles chart a decade earlier, was now encroaching into new territory, and radio was finally embracing her. The press dubbed the six-month releases of A Star Is Born and Superman as \"Streisand's one-two punch!\"There were't many female singers (if any) that could release an album that carried a title such as \"Superman\" - and yet it seemed appropriate. Streisand was known for her chutzpah, and her pose on the album cover wearing a skimpy pair of white short-shorts with a tight white it-shirt emblazoned with the Superman logo seemed absolutely fitting. The title and the photo suggested that the queen of entertainment also had balls. And as successful as her career had been prior to 'seventy-seven, she seemed to have reached an even higher speak. It was fascinating to her fans and infuriating to her detractors. Now that I've exhausted the packaging and multiple interior Steve Schapiro photos of the empowered Streisand, let's get to the music. Streisand had finally delivered an entire pop album that was consistent and one that absolutely suited her. The songs ranged from pop ballads such as the hit single, \"My Heart Belongs To Me\" which reached Number four on the Billboard Hot one hundred, to gorgeous sonatas including \"Love Comes From the Most Unexpected Places,\" which was co-written by the prolific Kim Carnes, to rock and roll. From the opening title track, Streisand's vocals soared so effortlessly above the clouds, that when she sang the lyric \"I'm Superman\" with such conviction, you believed she WAS Superman! The entire album is so much fun; it's like cotton candy at a summer carnival. The only exception would be \"Don't Believe What You Read.\" Even though the track was co-written by Streisand and the lyrics were terrific, elucidating the details of her life in the tabloids, the steely rock guitar chords absolutely lacked a hook while repeating a monotonous rhythm. On the other hand, one other song that was co-written by the songbird was the gorgeous ballad \"Answer Me,\" which was originally written for A Star Is Born. Although, it did't make the final cut to the film and soundtrack, it luckily ended up on this album. Upbeat rhythms such as \"I Found You Love\" and \"Cabin Fever\" captured Streisand's playful side, and since she succeeded so well in this genre on \"A Star Is Born\" (despite what many critics said) it was a given that she continued to show off her versatility as a first rate vocalist that could capture just about every style of music. Speaking of versatility, she even sang a brilliant cover of the Roger (\"King of the Road\") Miller country-tinged ditty, \"Baby Me Baby.\" Two very bright highlights were the albums final two tracks, Billy Joel's luminous \"New York State of Mind\" and Rupert Holmes' divine code to independence \"Lullaby For Myself.\" Billy Joel was said to be \"over the moon\" with Streisand's dazzling rendition of \"New York State of Mind\" that the later commented, \"My mother now knew I had made it because Barbra Streisand had recorded one of my songs.\" Barbra Streisand had made it alright. She had conquered just about every medium of entertainment; it was just a matter of time that she dominated the world of pop music. If I had to choose one word to describe Streisand Superman, it would be \"confident.\" This is truly one of the best pop albums of Streisand's discography.","overall":5,"summary":"Superman Soars!","unixReviewTime":1126310400,"reviewTime":"09 10, 2005"}

Six months ago, the released A Star Is Born, which was this biggest film success in the office to date. The accompanying soundtrack is the number six album, (the longest running album number of this career) which includes the opus they wrote \u201cEvergreen,\u201d which also won the Academy Award for Best Song after spending three week in column position. on the Billboard Hot hundred. One thousand, nine hundred and seventy -seven, Streisand is still releasing an album of the year, but the fact that Superman spa for it six months after the Star was born is remarkable, especially since the music is in the chart still. . Streisand\u2019s pop success is now in full swing, and Superman\u2019s songs are further proof that Barbra, a singer who barely scratched the pop of her pop ten years ago, has already flooded the earth. before, and finally the radio was over. The media called the six-month release of A Star Is Born and Superman as \"Streisand's one-two punches!\" yet seems appropriate. Streisand is known for this chutzpah, this album cover-up look with a pair of short white shorts with a tight white shirt with the Superman logo emblazoned on it looks perfect. The title and photo suggest that the entertainment queen also has a ball. No matter how successful the was in this career before the seventies, the seemed to have reached a higher level. It was attractive to its fans and infuriated the founders. Now that I\u2019ve finished packing and lots of photos inside Steve Schapiro\u2019s mighty Streisand, let\u2019s move on to the music. Streisand finally released an entire pop album that was consistent and none of them matched it. Songs range from popular singers to the single-hit single, \u201cMy heart is mine\u201d which reached number four on the Billboard Hot Hundred, and beautiful sonatas including \u201cLove comes from places I don\u2019t know. expect, \"they wrote together.

From the trajectory of the opening title, Streisand\u2019s voices echoed in the cloud, that when the sang the song \u201cI\u2019m Superman\u201d with such a sentence, you believed it was Superman! The whole door was very interesting; like cotton candy for the summer carnival. The only exception is \"Don't believe what you read.\" While Streisand\u2019s way of writing and the lyrics together is beautiful, explaining the details of this life in the tabloids, the metal guitar strings completely close the hook by repeating the creative rhythm. On the other hand, another song written by song bird is a beautiful album called \u201cAnswer Me,\u201d originally written for A Star Is Born. Although, they did\u2019t do the final cut of the film and music, but luckily it ended up on this album. Beats like \u201cI Found You I Love You\u201d and \u201cCabin Fever\u201d captured Streisand\u2019s team, and because of its successful win over \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d (although many critics said it) it was a hit . because the continues to show this effectiveness as a first-class vocalist who can handle any type of music. Speaking of talent, the even sang a beautiful cover for Roger (\"King of the Road\") tiny of Miller's ditty country representative, \"Baby Me Baby.\" Two things that really shine are the latest albums on both tracks, Billy Joel's bright \"New York State of Mind\" and Rupert Holmes's sacred freedom code \"Lullaby For Myself.\" Billy Joel is said to be \u201cabove the moon\u201d along with Streisand\u2019s stunning translation of \u201cNew York State of Mind\u201d who later commented, \u201cMy mother now knows I did it because Barbra Streisand recorded one of my songs. \" Barbra Streisand is good.

Scene","helpful":[9,16],"reviewText":"When an album sells somewhere around thirty million copies and it is the biggest selling album in the history of the music business, it does garner my attention. Therefore, separating out Michael Jackson's personal life from this music - I deed to review this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two release \"Thriller\". Looking at this album strictly from a creative musical standpoint, I do think this album is overrated. For this album, Jackson and producer Quincy Jones assemble a powerful team of musicians. These musicians - while very talented probably were't the reason why this collection became the monster-selling album that it became. Simply put, this album sold because it came along at the right time - and was marketed very well to fit in with the times. The musicians that contribute to this album are big names. There probably karen't many names bigger than Paul McCartney. McCartney is well known for this entertaining duet with Jackson on \"The Girl is Mine\". However, there are many other big names that contributed collection as well: James Ingram (background vocals on \"Wanna Be Starting Somethin'\", songwriter of \"P. Y. T. (Pretty Young Thing)\"), Toto's David Paich (an arranger on \"The Girl is Mine\", Synthesizers on \"Human Nature\" and \"The Lady in My Life\"), Mega-producer David Foster (Synthesizer arrangements on \"The Girl is Mine\"), Vincent Price (provides the famous sinister 'rap' on \"Thriller\"), Eddie Van Halen (a guitar solo on \"Beat It\"), Toto's Steve Porcaro (Songwriter of \"Human Nature\", Synthesizer on \"Beat It\", \"Human Nature\", and \"The Lady in My Life\"), Toto's Steve Lutkather (Guitars and Bass on \"Beat It\", Guitars on \"Human Nature\"), Toto's Jeff Porcaro (Drums on \"Beat It\", \"Human Nature\", and \"The Lady in My Life\"), and LaToya and Janet Jackson (background vocals on \"P. Y. T (Pretty Young Thing)\" Finally, acclaimed keyboard player and studio musician Greg Phillinganes (who worked on Lionel Richie's \"Cant' Slow Down\" and Donald Fagen's \"The Nightfly\" - two outstanding albums in this era) contributes to several of the tracks on the collection. As for the Toto band members, I do feel their contributions are overlooked. They had only one year ago released their own critically acclaimed album - \"Toto IV\" and now they were working on \"Thriller\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" - two of the largest selling albums of this time period. I don't feel it was Michael Jackson's vocals for any of the outstanding talent that helped this collection become the blockbuster seller that it became. This album was released in December, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. This was a time the music industry was undergoing change. This was the beginning of the page of music video. I give Michael Jackson and this management team credit. They take what I consider a mostly average set of songs, but they marketed it with some very clever music videos. Say what you want about Michael Jackson's music - but the did make the most of this medium. The videos basically became a marketing machine for this album - and it resulted in seven Top ten hits of the nine songs on \"Thriller\" in the United States. (The title track \"Thriller\" is probably the best example of this). There are several reasons why this album is \"average\" at best:- The Percussions are awful. Despite having one of the best drummers and musicians in the business in Toto's Jeff Porcaro, this album basically takes a bunch of music and puts a disco dance beat behind them. There is very little in the way of any solid drumming on this album.- There is little in the way of any cohesion on this album. Yes it did have a mixture of styles (the Rock-edge on \"Beat It\" to the R&B; Style of \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\" to the campy \"The Girl is Mine\"). A lot of times this happens when there are \"too many cooks in the kitchen\" - while there was a vast array of talent, I do feel that eventually this impacted the final product (even Quincy Jones could't fix that).- There is nothing groundbreaking in terms of the music on this album. Yes, the music videos were groundbreaking - but not the music.- One thing I discovered is that Michael's songwriting did't really shine. I thought it was the songs written by \"outsiders\" that were better. The Steve Porcaro \"Human Nature\" penned song is probably the strongest effort on the collection. Rod Temperton is very underrated on this album. Many people don't realize that the wrote the \"Thriller\" track (while it in't my favourite, it is probably the only innovative track of the collection). Temperton also wrote the two underrated R&B; itunes - \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\". As for the positives:- The strong points are the contributions of the Toto band members. As mentioned, \"Human Nature\" is probably the strongest track. While I've never been a fan of \"Beat It\", there is some good instrumentation in there. I actually feel if \"Beat It\" was just done as an instrumental without the disco beat - it would sound good.- Eddie Van Halen does give a terrific solo on \"Beat It\".- If you are a Synth-Pop fan, this album (with the exception of \"Beat It\") is going to provide plenty of it. The liner notes include all of the lyrics and do a good job at providing musician and songwriting credits. Overall, when I look at this collection - I just don't think it is the greatest album of all time. I would even say that for the year it was \"Album of the Year\" that The Police's \"Synchronicity\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" were miles ahead of \"Thriller\". The bottom line is that if there were no music videos, this would have been just another heights Synth-Pop album. If you are curious on what all the hype is - then you may want to get this collection - otherwise I don't recommend it.","overall":2,"summary":"Came along at the right time - but not a lot of substance","unixReviewTime":1110153600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2005"}

So, to dive Michael Jackson's personal life into this music \u2014 I decided to check out the one-eighty-two \"Thriller\" released. A closer look at this album from the perspective of music creation, I think this album is full of more. In this album, Jackson and producer Quincy Jones make a strong band of musicians. These singers - although very talented, may not be the reason why this list has become the best-selling album. In short, the album sells well because it appeared at the right time - and it sold well to keep up with the times. The musicians who contributed to the album were all great names. There may not be many bigger names than Paul McCartney. McCartney is famous for her role with Jackson in the film \"My Girl\". However, there are many other great names that have contributed to the collection: James Ingram (the origin of the consensus \"You want to start something\", songwriter \"PYT\"), David of Toto Paper (The arrangement of \"Girls\" is mine \", synthesizer of\" Humanity \"and and \"The Lady in My Life\"), lead producer David Foster (set of \"My Girl\" synthesizer), Vincent Price (co-star of the famous \"rap\" on \"Thriller\"), Eddie Van Halen (guitar solo on - \"Beat It\"), Steve Porcaro by Toto (song and song \"Creation of Man\") Author, synthesizer of \"Beat It\", \"Creation of Man\" and \"Lady in My Life\"), Steve Lutkather of Toto (guitar and bass in \"Beat It\", guitar in \"Man's Creation\"), Toto Jeff Porcaro (drums \"Beat It\", \"The Creation of Humanity\" and \"The Lady in My Life\"), and background origins with LaToya and Janet Jackson (\"PY T (Pretty Young Thing) \"Keyboardist and studio artist Greg Phillinganes (who participated in Lionel Richie\" Cant ' Slow Down \"and Donald Fagen's\" The Nightfly \"- two great albums at this time) many songs in the series As for the members of Toto, I feel like their contribution is ignored. They only released their best album - \"Toto IV\" last year, and now they're doing \"Thriller\" with Lionel Richie's \"I Can't Be Slow\" - two of the best-selling albums of the time. I don't think it was Michael Jackson's singing about any great talent that helped the series become the best buyers. This album was released in December, one thousand nine hundred and eighty-two. A time of change in the music industry This is the beginning of a music video page. I believe in Michael Jackson and the management team. They used what I think is a collection of popular songs, but they used some very clever Encouragement Say what you think of Michael Jackson's music \u2014 but they used the full subscription. These videos became the selling machine for this album - leading to American \"Thriller\" seven of the top ten songs in nine songs. (The title track \"Thriller\" may be the best example) There are many reasons why this album is such an \"average\" perfectly: -Percussion is terrible. Oto Jeff Porcaro of soto has one of the drummers and musicians in the industry, but the album uses music and disco dance behind them. There is no solid cover on this album. -This album is not cohesive. Yes, it combines different styles (\"Beat it\" rock style to R&B; \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\" style to bumpy \"The Girl is Mine\"). Many times this happens when there are \u201ctoo many chefs in the kitchen\u201d \u2014even though there are so many talents, I feel like this affects the final product (even though Quincy Jones can\u2019t solve this problem). -There is nothing concrete about the music in this album. Yes, music videos are basic \u2014 but not music. -The only thing I found was that Michael's song did't shine. I think songs written by \"outsiders\" are better. Steve Porcaro's song \"The Nature of Man\" could be the most powerful work on the list. Rod Temperton is underestimated in this album. Most people don't realize that the \"Thriller\" track is made by them (although it's not something I like, it may be the only new way in the list). Temperton also wrote two low-profile R&Bs; iTunes- \"Baby Belongs to Me\" and \"The Lady in My Life\". In terms of benefits: -Profits are contributions of Toto band members. As mentioned earlier, \u201cpersonality\u201d may be the strongest track. While I\u2019ve never been a fan of \u201cBeat It\u201d, there are some good tools in it. I honestly think that if \u201cBeating\u201d was done just like instrumental music without disco songs \u2014 it sounds good. Eddie Van Halen has provided a big solo in \"Beat It\". -If you are a fan of pop music, this album (with the exception of \"Beat It\") will provide a lot of content. The liner notes include all the lyrics and do a good job of providing the musicians and songwriting credits. Overall, when I look at this album \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best album never. I would even say that this year's \"Album of the Year\", police \"Synchronization\" and Lionel Ritchie's \"Can't Slow Down\" travelled miles ahead of \"Thriller\". Most importantly, if there is no music video, this will be another pop-up album. If you are interested in all the hypocrisy - you may want this list - otherwise I would not recommend it.","overall":2,"summary":"Came along at the right time - but not a lot of substance","unixReviewTime":1110153600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2005"}

Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me I thought the songs written by \"outsiders\" were better. Steve Purcaru's song \"Human Nature\" is probably the strongest effort in the collection. Rod Temperton is very rare in this album. Most people are not aware of this track \"Thriller\" (while not my favourite, it is probably the only new track in the collection). Temperton also recorded two sub-R&Bs. ITunes - \"Baby Mary\" and \"The Lady in My Life\". As far as good things are concerned: - Strong points are the contribution of Tutu team members. As the saying goes, \"human nature\" is probably the most powerful track. Although I've never been a fan of \"Beat Beat\", there's a good resource. I really feel like \"Beat It\" was done as a character without a disco beat - that sounds great. The album (other than \"Defeat It\") will do most of that. The liner notes include all the lyrics and do a great job of giving credit to the artist and writing the songs. Overall, when I look at this collection - I don't think it's the biggest album never. I would even say that it was \"Album of the Year\" that was a few miles ahead of \"Police Harmony\" and Lionel Richie's \"Kent Slot Down\" \"Thriller\". Most importantly, if it were't for the music videos, it would be a highlight of the Syn-Pop album. If you want to know what all this hype is - you might want to get this collection - otherwise I would't recommend it.","overall":2,"summary":"Came along at the right time - but not a lot of substance","unixReviewTime":1110153600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2005"}

I would even say that for the year it was \"Album of the Year\" that The Police's \"Synchronicity\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" were miles ahead of \"Thriller\". I actually feel if \"Beat It\" was just done as an instrumental without the disco beat - it would sound good.- Eddie Van Halen does give a terrific solo on \"Beat It\".- If you are a Synth-Pop fan, this album (with the exception of \"Beat It\") is going to provide plenty of it. Yes it did have a mixture of styles (the Rock-edge on \"Beat It\" to the R&B; Style of \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\" to the campy \"The Girl is Mine\"). They had only one year ago released their own critically acclaimed album - \"Toto IV\" and now they were working on \"Thriller\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" - two of the largest selling albums of this time period. A lot of times this happens when there are \"too many cooks in the kitchen\" - while there was a vast array of talent, I do feel that eventually this impacted the final product (even Quincy Jones could't fix that).- There is nothing groundbreaking in terms of the music on this album. Therefore, separating out Michael Jackson's personal life from this music - I decided to review this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two release \"Thriller\".","overall":2,"summary":"Came along at the right time - but not a lot of substance","unixReviewTime":1110153600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2005"}

Scene","helpful":[9,16],"reviewText":"When an album sold nearly thirty million copies and it was the biggest selling album in the history of the music industry, it caught my attention. So, adjusting Michael Jackson\u2019s personal life for this musician - I deed to check out one thousand, nine hundred and eighty -two \u201cThriller\u201d releases. When I consider this album strictly from a creative music perspective, I think this album is overkill. At this door, Jackson and producer Quincy Jones bring together a powerful group of artists. These artists - they\u2019re so brilliant that maybe that\u2019s not why this collection has become the massive sales album it has become. In other words, this album sold because it came at the right time - and was well marketed to keep up with the times. The artists contributing to this album are big names. There may be more names than Paul McCartney. McCartney is famous for these two episodes of Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Girl is Mine\u201d. However, many other big names also took part in the collection: James Ingram (the original song \u201cWanna Be Starting Somethin\u201d), the song \u201cPYT (Pretty Young Thing)\u201d), Toto\u2019s David Paich (organizer \u201cThe Woman is Me \", Synthesizers in\" Human Nature \"and\" The Lady in My Life \"), omega-producer David Foster (Synthesizer's adaptation of\" The Girl is Mine \"), Vincent Price (offering the popular guilty of \u2018Thriller\u2019), Eddie Van Halen (solo guitar on \u201cBeat It\u201d), Steve Porcaro\u2019s Toto (\u201cHuman Nature\u201d, Synthesizer on \u201cBeat It\u201d, \u201cHuman Nature\u201d)., and \u201cThe Lady in My Life\u201d). \"), Steve Lutkather by Toto (Guitars and Bass on\" Beat It \", Guitars on\" Human Nature \"), Toto's Jeff Porcaro (Drums on\" Beat It \",\" Human Nature \", and\" The Lady in My Life \", and LaToya and Janet Jackson (background voices on \"PY T (Pretty Young Thing)\") Finally, keyboardist and musician Greg Philinganes (who stars Lionel Richie's \"Cant 'Slow Down\" and Donald F hagen \u201cThe Nightfly\u201d - two very good albums so far) contributes a number of tracks to the collection. To the members of the Toto team, I feel their contributions have been ignored. They experienced this a year ago with the release of their popular album - \u201cToto IV\u201d and are now working on Lionel Richie\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down\u201d - two of the biggest selling doors of the time. I don\u2019t feel that Michael Jackson\u2019s voice is one of the great talents that helped this collection become a blockchain seller. This album was released in December, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty -two. This was a time when the music industry changed. This is the beginning of a music video page. I give reputation to Michael Jackson and this management team. They take what I consider average songs, but they sell them on smart music videos. Say what you like from Michael Jackson\u2019s music - but the took advantage of this medium. Videos originally became the marketing engine of this album - and it made the top seven of the top nine \u201cThriller\u201d songs in the United States. (The function title \u201cThriller\u201d is probably the best example of this). There are many reasons why this album is the best \u201cmedium\u201d: - The defeat is horrible. Although the towns one of Toto\u2019s best drummers and commercials in the business, this album originally took a lot of music and brought it back to disc dance. There\u2019s very little in the way of the hard drums of this album. - There is little in the way of connecting to this album. Yes it has mixed shapes (Stone on R&B; \u201cBe a Baby\u201d and \u201cLady of My Life\u201d style \u201cGirl is mine\u201d). Many times this happens when there are \u201ctoo many cooks in the kitchen\u201d - with so much potential, I feel like it ultimately affects the final product (even Quincy Jones can\u2019t fix that). There is no basis for its music. album Yes, music videos are groundbreaking - but not musical. - One thing I noticed is that Michael\u2019s songs don\u2019t really shine. I thought they were songs written by \u201coutsiders\u201d that were better. Steve Porcaro\u2019s song \u201cHuman Nature\u201d is probably the strongest effort in the collection. Rod Temperton is far below this album. Not many people know that they wrote the track \u201cThriller\u201d (although I\u2019m not a favourite of it, it\u2019s probably the only creative way of collecting it). Temperton also wrote the two R & Bs below; itunes - \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\". On the positive side: - The strong points are the contribution of Toto team members. It is said that, \u201cHuman nature\u201d is probably the strongest path. Although I haven\u2019t been a fan of Beat It, there are a lot of great tools out there. I really feel if \u201cBeat It\u201d was made as a tool without playing a disc - it would be great. the album will pay a lot (except for \u201cBeat It\u201d). Rhythm includes all the songs and does a great job of providing music scores and song writing. Overall, when I looked at this collection - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the biggest album never. I would still say that the year was \u201cAlbum of the Year\u201d with Police \u201cSynchronization\u201d and Lionel Richie\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Slow Down\u201d miles ahead of \u201cThriller\u201d. The bottom line is that if there were no music videos, this would be another great Synth-Pop album. If you\u2019re interested in what all the hype is - then you might want to get this collection - otherwise I would\u2019t recommend it.","overall":2,"summary":"Came along at the right time - but not a lot of substance","unixReviewTime":1110153600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2005"}

Most people who listen to music will compare it. How does the given version relate to other works of the artist? How does that compare with the work of this contemporaries? What is its paper like? Like most arts, time is running out, perhaps when a task can no longer be compared to others, but can be measured by others, and you can again great popularity. This is Jackson Browne's one, nine hundred and seventy-four state of the part technology \"Sky is late\". Almost since its release, it has become a well-known classic and genre (time of artist-songwriter). In these songs, there are the sweetest words of love and the most painful way, to meditate on broken love, which has never been written. Throughout this career, Jackson's study of interpersonal relationships has had a profound effect on audiences because, as people originally understood, music is a gift. Once given, you will have a relationship with the life of the listener. artist. He will have no other choice. From listening to postings, LFTS leads audiences on a journey. Love is the main theme of this version, and it's also the theme that Jackson has returned from time to time. The theme song opened the record when the relationship was about to send (\u201cIt's scary to feel lonely.\u201d) But it also explores a young man's attempt to find a place to live in the world (\u201cNow the distance allows me. Going forward. I don't know what people will do after death. as much as I can \/ It's like a song I'm hearing this year but I can't use it \/ But I can 'help listen'). The last song is the horrible Apocalypse \"Before the Flood\", sounds good, because it probably should have been written yesterday. Beautiful, timeless and appropriate like all these songs, it's when it's designed and sung. The love that was always held by Jackson and will shine. The \"Fountain of Grief\" celebrates the beauty of the woman's path and the dinner, which continues to occupy a place in the heart of her lover's gratitude. ), A love problem is sung (\"Sometimes we forget that we love each other and fight for no reason.\") But this song describes this record. For me, Jackson Brown\u2019s work is an evening show. Among them singing a woman's song, the began to think that the would never be in the dream (\"I saw you laughing and making noise \/ Talking to the soldier and the boy \/ Although they persecuted me with your tired smile thinking of all the empty miles \/ years I spent looking into your eyes.\") this (see album cover). Will the come? We are waiting, Stop. Wait, then we hear Islam at the car door. Then! When beautiful strings are played on the sound of cars moving away, we also believe in the infinite power of love. Time and its nature. Jackson Browne's exploration of interpersonal relationships has been strongly felt by the audience because, as people first understood, music is a gift. on earth (\"Distance now allows me to move on \/ Although the reason I used to disappear \/ I always think I will find myself looking for something \/ sand in the morning\", trying to accept the death of a friend (\"I don't know what happens when people die \/ I don't seem to understand it. I hear songs that I can't use are played at my page \/ but I can't help but listen \u201d). more for less relationships with the lives of the audience. \"boys \/ when they meet because of your tired smile, I think of all the empty miles \/ and years I've spent looking into your eyes.\" the Deluge, \u201dwhich sounds reasonable, since it was probably written only yesterday. As in most arts, time determines, and perhaps when the work is no longer measured by others, but when it becomes a measure of others, the greatest praise can be obtained. There is also a free rock artist (Walking Slow) in which the sings a love story (\"Sometimes we forget that we love each other and fight for no reason.\"","overall":5,"summary":"Excellent Browne album","unixReviewTime":1325376000,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2012"}

I was single released maxwell and a decent hook, but not as deep as many of the other contemporary songs. \"Who Said I Would\" reminds a bit of Sussudio, it deaures horns and is also a funky uptempo. The hook is the weakness though but musically it's great with a good horn solo. \"Doesn't Anyone Stay Together Anymore\" is a midtempo song about breakups. \"Inside Out\" is a semi-ballad with a powerful chorus. Features a great guitar solo. \"Take Me Home\" is perhaps the best song there, it got this hypnotic percussion sound in the background, the song itself is a semi-ballad that could have been released much later (it sound like a ninety' song). It's almost six minutes long. The album ends with \"We Said Hello Goodbye\" Beatles inspired title?, however it's a classic ballad without too many cathy instruments used. Overall, this was this most commercial album and this biggest success maxwell. It goes in the same spirit as the previous but it launched more hit-singles and it's lot more positive to listen to lyrically.

I'm Maxwell with a one-time release and a good link, but not as deep as some of the current songs. \"Who said I would do it\" reminds Sussudio, who softens the French horn and is also a fast-growing fashion. Although the link is weak, speaking of music, only a good horn is good. \"No One Is Together\" is a medium song about separation. \"Inside Out\" is a classic song with strong lyrics. He has a beautiful guitar. \"Take Me Home\" is the sweetest song out there. It has sounds that indicate severity in the background. The song itself is a semi-folk ballad and can be released a long time later (sounds like nine out of ten songs). It's about six minutes. The album ends with the Beatles' inspired title track \"Sithi solo salami\", but it's a popular folk song and it does't use a lot of Casey's instruments.

You get a pair of songs that were't on CD before (save forPirate Radio), \"Porcelain\" and \"Cuban Slide.\" The demos are interesting in just how little they changed before they came on the original album. I chuckled at the \"Roxanne\" quote before the demo of \"Kid\" and was surprised that \"Brass In Pocket\" started out as a down-tempo number. The live tracks show The Pretenders to be incendiary in concert. The packaging itself is a blast, including lyrics! (I guess I was singing the wrong words all these years. )All the chemistry was in perfect coordination there. Even the one moment when Nick Lowe steps in for producer, a cover of The Kinks' \"Stop Your Sobbing,\" can't break the synergy of this album.

Remember the old quote from Pat Bennett \"You broke my heart and I will kick you **\"? Chrissy reached the send of the degree. The \"hypocrites\" combined hard rock and pop to make it feel so flawless that the band never came close to matching it. From the sweet anticipation of \"Brass In Pocket\" to the cool dismissal of \"Up The Neck\" (\"Everything was great. The running of the machines\"), Chrissie has honestly brought in the same amount of solid and tender. James Honeyman Scott really helped toss the riff behind almost every song, as Martin Chambers and Pat Freunden's undeniable power - listen to the bass in \"The Weight\" - as a rhythm band. (And why did Demet, James, and Pete have to do the OD themselves? When will we learn?) There's a Honeycomb bonus CD about the release of this double disc. You get songs that were't on CD before (Save Pirate Radio), \"Porcelain\" and \"Cuban Slide.\" Demos are interested in how much they have changed before their first album was released. I laughed when I heard the words \"Roxanne\" before the \"Kid\" demo and was surprised that \"Pocket in Brass\" started with a low speed number. The live track shows the hypocrites in concert as fanatics. The package itself is a blast, including the characters! (I think I've been singing the wrong words all these years.) All the machines were there. Even on one occasion when Nick Lowe joined the producer, \"Stop Your Sobang\" could not break the collaboration of The Kinks Core album. It's a timeless start, with Tom Petty, Elvis Costello, standing by Jackson and Carson's first attempts of the season.","overall":5,"summary":"Gonna make you, make you, make you notice","unixReviewTime":1186790400,"reviewTime":"08 11, 2007"}

I hacked Primus' biggest commercial attraction so far (comic title Anti-Pop). Now, before you get the wrong answer, please consider the following tips: a) Go back to Cheese and listen to this eleventh song. Do you know why it is called eleven? Because what you heard was eleven \/ weight to'clock! The unusual time signature was once a priority for Primus. That is the missing part of Anti-Pop. B) Rhythm - A strange rhythm disappeared. I think it has something to do with the shocking signature of the time, but I remember the changing motto of \"Welcome to this world\".

His influence is emerging and making this album more accessible than any previous record. And yet, I can still say that this is a good recording. Boss Ruff still hits the jaws. Lear's guitar is getting better. And Brain may not have herb caliper yet, but it's great there, adding a nice drum player to a crowded sounding wall. The funk tones there seem stronger than never (quite a good thing). The only part I did't enjoy was the weeding and cultivating. This is a good first kit for the first fans of Primus.

This album is produced by Em, then the sound is far from Dre's gangster beats, and is further integrated into Em's rock beats following me.

Amber Waves -- Great metaphor of America as a porn star, offering lots of empty excitement.two. A Sorta Fairytale -- Probably Tori's most commercial song to date but also one of the most haunting. The way Tori sings \"you lost me in the rearview\" is just heartwrenching.three. Wednesday -- It's nice to hear Tori kick back and have some fun once in awhile. Wednesday sounds like an old time party song.four. Strange -- an interesting look at the disintegration of a relationship.five. Carbon -- this is my favourite song on the CD. The poetry describing a woman's breakdown is stunning, and the baroque-ish piano is perfect for the song.six. Crazy -- a slow, jazzy kind of tune.seven. Wampum Prayer -- a short accapella piece. Not sure why this did't open the CD.eight. Don't Make Me Come to Vegas -- a sultry song about rescuing someone (a friend, an sex, a family member?) in Las Vegas. Fantastic musically.nine. Sweet Sangria -- Has kind of a seventy's Steely Dan sort of sound to it. Takes a while to get into, but definitely grows on you.ten. Your cloud -- this is probably the first Tori Amos song that could be played at a wedding. A very pretty, tuneful song. Perfect for the bride and groom's first dance.eleven. Pancake -- a song about religious intolerance. The \"I ordered you a pancake\" line in the context of the song shows Tori's subtle humour.twelve. I Can't See New York -- a very powerful and emotional song that seems to indirectly be about the nine\/eleven attacks. Hard to listen to. The view from the air part is especially poignant: \"from there, no lines are drawn. From there, no lands are owned.\"thirteen. Mrs Jesus -- I did not like this song at first but now it's one of my favourites. I love the sly reference to the Beatles: \"the gospel change meaning if you follow John for Paul, but could you never Let It Be, the Mary of it all.\"fourteen. Taxi Ride -- another \"hit\". The lyrics seem to reflect an ambivalence about celebrity culture. It was bizarre to see Tori perform this on Regis Philbin's show.fifteen. Another Girl's Paradise -- nice song, but probably my least favourite on the CD.sixteen. Scarlet's Walk -- perfect song that puts the CD into context.seventeen. Virginia -- really captures the flavor of the south. The banjo's are a nice, different touch.eighteen. Gold Dust -- this song brought tears to my eyes. The bittersweet yet defiant way that Tori sings \"I was there!\" always gets me choked up.

After listening to both this album and her debut thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that she is a decent enough performer, but all of this \"Alicia Keys is so great and so talented\" talk is a bunch of false media hype. This album has a few highlights such as the Kanye West produced (who by the way has much more interesting musical ideas even though the is not a trained musician anywhere near the level of Alicia. I'm referring to this original material of course. I'll take \"Get By\" from \"Quality\" by Talib Kweli over anything else on this album any day) \"You don't know my name\", \"If I main't got you\", \"If I was your woman\" has a really nice melody although I can't really give her too much credit for this remake, and the pooh so smooth and sweet \"Diary\", but most of this album is really lacklustre.

What is really fascinating and ultimately satisfying about \"Mirrored\" is unravelling its tapestry of execution.

As usual, the most publicly accessible song on the album is not necessarily the most representative. I think that \"Atlas\" is great. The video reflects the energy and experimentalism of the band very well. However, there are songs on the album that show \"Atlas\" to be the \"single\" that it is. \"Tonto\" is a beautiful piece of work, as is \"Race: In\" and \"Tij.\" \"Race: Out\" is a fun \"whack-a-mole\" game of \"who is playing what\" and \"Bad Trails\" shows Battles' potential for more atmospheric work. The only work that I could offer any critique for is \"Rainbows.\" It is wonderfully epic, and covers a great amount of musical ground, but seems a little repetitive. The same seven-minute song could potentially be done in five. The slowdown: Battles creates highly active music that is satisfying on intellectual and accessible levels. To the passive listener, \"Mirrored\" may bring to mind the work of savant-garde DJ's, like DJ Shadow for BT.
