867,"This movie is where the purchase of Batman series has stopped. While I agree that the concept behind ""Batman Forever"" is brilliant and can easily be understood by a competent director, it seems unlikely. Clearly, Warner Bros executives are disappointed with the darkness of Tim Burton's second Batman film. Aside from the idiots who had Burton’s expectations, and the cowardly retention they later decided to turn their marketing right into an honor in the sixtys television show, I don’t know how I would handle the “Batman Returns”. Admittedly, it is not exactly the same as the original movie — although it fixes all the minor flaws in ""Batman"" style, a weak script that combines not only two characters but three characters, This has led to an unpleasant comparison of Keaton's brilliant blend of factor Jack Jackolson as the first factor. However, despite this, it is still a beautiful black film, faithful to Batman's long-term goals, and very satisfying. Michael Keaton returns to Batman and Walter Lego Bruce Wayne, starring low-cost tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, whose name pays tribute to one, nine hundred and twenty German Silent Factors), crime partner Oss Wald Cobleport, Penguin (makeup of Danny DeVito reminiscent of Lawrence Olivier ""Richard III"") and Catwoman Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer)), Wayne himself and Batman. The four principals did well, especially Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer collectively explored the dark side of the two characters. There are some interesting concepts in this movie. The only weakness I can really point out is that the script is full in some places. I think this is mainly due to the way the film is a four-cornered struggle. There is not enough time to properly evaluate what is happening. However, this is a very good film. I suggest you watch it with the first one, and then understand exactly how good these series will be if they continue under the leadership of Burton and Keaton.",positive

Although I will admit that the ideas behind “Batman Forever” are very positive and can easily be verified by a capable director, as this is not the case. Apparently the Warner Brothers directors were angry about how dark the Batman movie was with Tim Burton. Aside from the stupidity of expecting others from Burton, and the cowardly cowardice of their decision to eventually make the had a tribute to the Sixties TV series, I can’t understand how “Batman Returns” can be considered offensive. . True, it’s not the same as the first film - though it fixes all the minor stylistic flaws found in “Batman,” a weak text that separates the conflict between not just two but three factors who invites a similar negative comparison of a great combination of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. But it will all be a dark and beautiful movie, true as Batman was always meant to be, and very enjoyable. Michael Keaton returns to Batman and walter lego Bruce Wayne, paired with billionaire nouveau Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honor of Thousands, Nine Hundred and Twenty Silent Things in Germany), the guilty mag married Oswald Cobblepot, Penguin (beautiful figure of Danny DeVito in Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III""), and Selina Kyle, Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is loved by Wayne and Batman. The four managers put on great performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer work together to explore the dark side of the dual identity. There are some interesting ideas in this film. The only weakness I can really point out is that it’s specifically written in certain areas, which I think is due to how this film is a quadruple war.

6713,"I've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time. ""Mystery Men"" takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on TV like ""Batman"" and ""Captain Nice"" and cartoons like ""Underdog"" and ""Super Chicken."" The same spirit lives in all of them: the comic tongue-in-cheek stone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries. It's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary, and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright there.""Mystery Men"" opens on a party at a nursing home. I wish Kinka Usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene. As it is, it looks like something George Romero might have devised. We need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else, for it feels patronizing. By the time the Red Eyes crash the festivities, you half expect Tom Waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout: ""Just what this party needs--a little excitement!"" If writer Neil Cuthbert had any sense, the would have had Waits mixing it up with the intruders and begging on the partners to do the same. It would have made for a rousing beginning, and a better introduction of the troublesome trio: the Shoveler (William Macy); the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria); and Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day. There are many other problems to ""Mystery Men"" than I care to go into; among them that the villain Casanova Frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie, and the does't. Geoffrey Rush is the wrong factor for the part; the needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one. And Rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre. You hope for the ripe theatrics of a John Lithgow in ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"" for the dry, debonair diffidence of a Paul Freeman in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Instead what we get is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully realized. There are too many ideas running through ""Mystery Men"" for anyone to tie them neatly together, and that may be its deepest problem. But whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess I love. Ben Stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles the takes. This one is no exception, but the goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that the'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. His Roy is related to all the put-upon, overly sensitive, chronically defensive types that Woody Allen made popular. And whether it's wheedling this way into the affections of the waitress at this favourite hangout (the sleek Claire Forslani), for questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero (Wes Studi as the Sphinx), for giving a new member of their ""elite"" group (Jeaneane Garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a hard time, the makes it always fun to watch. I could't exactly say that about him in ""There's Something About Mary.""Jeaneane Garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of ""One True Thing,"" not Renee Zellweger. I don't think I have never seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father (okay, so the's dead and this skull is in a bowling ball, so sue me) in the movies. And the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with God in ""Breaking the Waves."" And in this version, the girl does't die, and bells don't bring in your head. William H. Macy does something very difficult; the makes stolid magnetic. You understand right away what's attracted Jenifer Lewis' Lucille to Eddie. You can also understand her exasperation. The barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge, but when Eddie's adorable, half-breed son looks up at this father and says ""I believe in you, Daddy."" to which Lucille sighs and exclaims, ""Roland, don't encourage your father,"" you feel like standing and hailing Neil Cuthbert as a first-rate wit. With Hank Azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was this bare behind in ""The Birdcage"") and Louise Lasser (Has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in ""Bananas"" and ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman?"") as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing and Ricky Jay as this publicist; Kel Mitchell as ""Invisible Boy""; Paul Reubens as ""The Spleen;"" and Lena Olin who, if she did't have the few lines in this movie that she has, would seem to be visiting the set.",positive

6713,"I've been waiting for a movie of such heroes for a long time. Cartoons like ""Captain Nice"" and cartoons like ""Under Dog"" and ""Super Chicken"". They all have the same passion: Stone - Comic in Cheeks. Dare to aim. One surefire way for these characters to win is to be their enemies. It's a vague spark of bosses burning the weak and the common people, and it's amazing to see the light rising and shining there. ""Mysterious Men"" in the nursing home. Opened at a ceremony. I wish Kanka Usher to give adults more energy and health in the brain. As it stands, it seems that something can be planned by George Romero. These adults need to be as fast as anyone else, because they feel supportive. As the Red Eyes hit the festivities, you'd expect Tom Yates, the one-year-old women's in-charge, to stand up and shout: ""That's what the team needs - a little fun!"" If author Neil Cuthbert had understood, Waits would have mingled with the participants and persuaded the partners to do so. It will be a thrilling start as well as a better offer for a difficult trio: Shawler (William Messi); The Blue King (Hank Azaria) and Mr. Furious (Ben Stellar), who seem to have suddenly saved the day. There are more ""irrational male"" issues I want to get into. One of them, the villain Casanova Frankenstein, needs to have an incomprehensible mind like everyone else in the film, and she does't. Jeffrey Rush is the wrong side of this part. The conflict between good and evil needs to go into the water to make it galvanic. And Rush never showed off. He is hoping for John Lithgo's solid drama ""The Adventures of Bakaro Benzai"", Paul Freeman's Disagreement in ""Dry Kashkool"" and ""Readers of the Lost Arc"". Instead of the paste we get, some are half-cooked and not fully available. Beyond the ""mystery man"", there are many ideas that anyone can connect to correctly, and this may be the deepest problem. But I like any kind of chaos. Ben Stellar is always seen fighting for this role. It's no different, but you go there with great confidence that you go with the feeling that Jerry Steeler and Ann Meera have learned something about comedy at home. His opinion applies to all kinds of places, the most sensitive, long-lasting protection that Woody Allen made famous. And even if you go that route you fall in love with Terrace in this favourite hangout (admirable Claire Forsalani), questioning the intelligence of the hero (Weiss Studio as the Sphinx), this ""elite"" ""Giving a new member of the team ( Jeanne Garofalo what can happen in their comedy times on screen) is a difficult time, which is always fun to watch. I can't say anything about Mary. Jenin Garofalo testifies to the show that she should have been the star of ""One True"" Thing "", not Renee Zelweiger. I don't think I've never seen a funny joke between a daughter and a father in the movies (well, the skull is in the bowling valley, so I'm surprised) in the movies. And the funny thing about this quote is that it sounds like a twist to Emily Watson's blasphemous speeches on ""breaking the waves."" And in this version, the girl does't die, and the devices don't bring her to your head. William H. Macy worked very hard. Make a magnetic stool. He immediately understood what attracted Jennifer Lewis Lucille. to Eddie. You can understand this danger. The barbecue alone was't enough to take me to the shore, but when Eddie's cute son, half the child, looked at the father and said, ""I believe you, Dad.""

11453,"All right, let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and expects a little slice of part on a golden platter. If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time. So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well, there's what I was looking forward to:one) Bad acting. two) A fairly non-existent, clickéd storyline. three) Kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates this nostrils just found the potato salad the misplaced a month ago. four) Tons and tons of gore. Well, if you're hungry for some ""so bad it's funny"" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts. Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offences on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which jones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate. I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the send and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was one hundred and seven; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after thirty-five years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator? I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that does't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it. I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give weight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh. I think you pretty much know what to expect, but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of ""Kill him, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Chokeslam!"" echoed through the theatre, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others could be annoyed by it. Second, and this should't even warrant explanation, the film does't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude trip eyeballs right out of their sockets does't scream ""fun night at the movies!"" for rya then you know good and well to save your dough. I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme black of dialogue on Kane's part. I was't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but I was hoping the'd have some cute little catchphrase like ""Say goodnight"" (his character's last name is ""Goodnight"") right before the killed a victim. Instead the uttered four words in the entire film - ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I see it."" But they, the delivered them flawlessly! If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like ""Place your BETTS!"" for ""All BETTS are off!"" It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we'll just call 'em HOR-larious!",negative
11453,"""Extremely funny"" movie has an factor named Kane. The film is directed by a former sex director. Critics say it's a good movie, but it's not for everyone.",negative
11453,"Yes, let's be honest about this. No one enters the WWE-made film (the owner has challenged him in wrestling), led by an obscene manager (who brings trilogy between cheeks to the world), who faces wrestler Kane, and who is looking forward to a bit of gold on the plate. If you do, then you may want to find something other than watching a movie to pass the time. So what are we waiting for in such a movie? Yes, this is what I expected: a) Poor performance. B) Missing story, click-through. three. Kane frowned and turned around, this sour face showing that the nose had just discovered a potato salad that had been put in the wrong place last month. four) Tons and tons of blood. Yes, if you crave the ""worst, most fun"" entertainment, then this can be enough to satisfy your appetite because it satisfies all aspects of your needs. Obviously, those movies are better viewed for free, but if you choose to sacrifice your income at the box office, have fun and play games in it. The filmmakers were friendly and informed us of all the offenders who were outraged by their name and illicit behavior on the screen. This makes it easy for you to write down which Jones you would like to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see for yourself that the most accurate estimate is. I also suggest that you and your friends write down all the silly and ignorant time you can find. Count when you send them to see who puts you first. I think my total is one hundred and seven, can you beat it? I want to know for myself, after thirty-five years and a fire, does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and still lifts? I know, I know, the filmmaker thinks that when you pay to watch this, you certainly don’t think much about how much you spent, so you can’t think too much about the stupidity of this movie, but that does’t mean We can’t point and laugh. I also like the way the city is turning this large hotel (any wise inspector can criticize and recommend demolition) into a homeless shelter, and they think the best way to clean it up is to give the punk weight some other guns and broom. Um. I think you know exactly what is going to happen, but I feel it is appropriate to give you some warnings. First of all, if you hate crowd reunion, in any movie, you might want to stay away. The people present acted as if they were in a show of real wrestling. ""Kill him, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Breathing!"" it was heard in the theatre, indicating that I hope it is not the best that the United States can offer. I always disapprove of this kind of audience communication, but at a cheese festival like this, I think the comments add value to the entertainment. However, I can see that some people will get upset by this. Second, it does’t even need to be clarified, the film does’t escape the year. If you watch a big bad guy come out of your eye sockets and you won't shout ""Happy night at the movie!"" In rya then you know it is good and keep your dough well. I must say that I was surprised by Kane's very dark conversation. I did't expect him to go to the acting clinic, but I hope the does have some interesting slogans before the victim is killed, such as ""Say good night"" (last person's name is ""Good night""). Instead, four words for the entire movie- ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I have seen it."" But they, they delivered it perfectly! If I were a bad person in a movie, then my tag would be ""Bet!"" Because ""All badges are closed!"" It will rule, you know. We need a new word to describe horror films, such as ""Don't See for Leave"", which causes so much laughter that you have to write them as a joke. Please feel free to send me your suggestions. Now we call them HOR-larious!",negative
11453,"Well, let's face it. No one enters the films produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God in wrestling), directed by a former sex director (who gave the world Beethoven The Gales trilogy, in which an factor named Kane is playing the lead role, a part of the gold plate. Will need So what exactly should we expect from a film like this? Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT saint for me either. Two) Missing, clicked story. Third) The cane turns with a hard, sour face, indicating that these noses have received a salad of potatoes lost in the past month. Four) Tons and tons of years. Yes, if you are hungry for fun ""the worst is ridiculous"" then it can satisfy your hunger because it reflects all the counts. Obviously, movies like these look better for free, but if you choose to sacrifice box office money, have fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are so good that they introduce each troubled criminal to the screen with their names and legal cases. This makes it easier for you to write down which soldiers you would like to see consistently killed again. You and your friends can see whose predictions are more accurate. I also suggest that you and your friends write every single minute of stupidity and ignorance. Rate yourself by posting and see who gets the most. I think my total was one hundred and seven. Can you beat him? Personally, I want to know how, after thirty-five years and how the fire started, how is there still electricity, running water and active cash in this abandoned hotel? I know, I know, filmmakers think that when you pay to see it, it means you don't think much about what you spend your money on, so you We won't think much about how stupid the film is, but that does't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it. I also like how the city wants to turn this big hotel (which can be recommended to be demolished and demolished by any reasonable inspector) into a homeless shelter and in their opinion to clean it up The best way to do this is to put a few mops and brooms on the weights. . Oops. I think you know exactly what to expect, but I see the need to give you some warnings. First of all, if you hate social media, even if the movie likes to stay away. The audience pretended to be on a real wrestling show. Scream ""Kill him, Ken!"" And ""I hope you die first!"" And ""Awake!"" Theatrical applause shows that I hope there is nothing better that America has to offer. Usually I don't like the audience like that, but with something like this fest, I thought that commenting would increase the amount of fun. However, I can see how some people may get angry with it. Secondly, and it should't be a guaranteed interpretation, this year's film is no shame. When you see a big bad friend walking around with hair on this head, the shouts ""Happy night in the movies!"" Does not use the slogan In Rhea, you know and save your flour well. I must say that I was amazed at the butter darkness of the conversation by Kane. I did't expect him to enter the acting clinic, but I did expect him to have a script like ""Say Good Night"" (his character's nickname is ""Good Night"") before the victim was killed. Instead, four words were used throughout the film - ""Novooo!"" And ""I'm watching it."" However, Jehovah delivered them without fail! If I were a bad person in the movies, my direct sentence would be something like ""Put your bets on!"" ""All BETTS are off!"" It can rule and you know. We need a new name for horror movies like Cine Evil that cause so much unintentional laughter that you have to call them jokes. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now, we'll just call them HOR-larious!",negative
11453,"So, be we can be truthful about it. No one enters a film made by WWE Films (the owner challenges God in a wrestling competition), directed by a former swing director (the man gave the world between Cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and little expected him to cut a piece of gold plate. If you do this you will probably need to get something other than watching movies to reflect your time. So what can we expect from a film like this? So, there’s one thing I’m waiting for: one) Bad acting. two) To be fair, click on the story. three) Kane rolled this face at the super scratched, sour and pungent nose now saw a potato salad found in the wrong place. far) Tons and tons of gore. So, if you are hungry for entertainment “too bad it’s ridiculous” then it can satisfy your cravings because it gives all the numbers. Obviously, movies like this are best watched for free, but if you choose to donate at the box office then have fun and play. The filmmakers were great at introducing us to each of the offenders by highlighting their names and legal offences on screen. This will make it easier for you to write down the jones you want to see killed and in order. You can see your friends their predictions are the most accurate. I also suggest that you and your friends write down every minute of stupidity and insanity you find. Consider when shipping and see who gets the most. I think my total is one hundred and seven; can you beat that Personally I would like to know how thirty five years and a year after this abandoned hotel still has electricity, running water, and a working elevator? I know, I know, filmmakers think that if you pay money to see it then you don’t clearly think about what you’re spending your money on so you probably can’t imagine how stupid the film is. , but that does’t mean we can point the finger and laugh at it. I also like how the city wants to open this big hotel (which is criticized and recommended to destroy any possible supervisor) homeless and think the best way to clean it up is to give it a crib cage. Weigh some mops and brooms. Uh huh. I think you already know what to expect, but I feel the need to give you some warnings. First of all, if you don’t want to interact with people regardless of the movie you can avoid it. The audience acted as if they were in a real wrestling show. ""Kill it, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Chokeslam!"" sound in the theatre, showing what I hope is not the best thing the United States has to offer. I usually don’t appreciate the interaction of such an audience, but like cheese I thought the comment was included in the entertainment value. However, I can see how others can get angry. Second, and even if it does’t have to be explained, the film in’t far from embarrassing. If you're watching an ugly and ugly journey with their eyes straight from their holes they're not shouting ""happy night at the movies!"" for rya then you know well to save your money. I will say that I was a little surprised at the extreme darkness of the conversation on Kane’s side. I did’t expect him to close the clinic, but I hoped they would have a nice little phrase like “Say good night” (his character’s last name was “Goodnight”) before the victim was killed. Instead the shouted the four words of the whole movie - ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I see."" But they were blameless, and the Lord saved them. If I was a bad person in a movie then my sentence would be like ""GET IN YOUR PLACE!"" for, ""EVERYONE is dead!"" It will reign and you know it. I need a new terminology for scary movies like See No out there that brings unintentional laughter that you’re close to labelling as a comedian. Feel free to send me your suggestions.

While George Lazenby travels extensively in Hong Kong, who knows, you can guarantee that you won’t be bothered by that original music that fills the cinema today. Or any of that music that fills the elevators. I don't think anyone in this movie even chum. Now, this is not entirely true - there is a * voice trace. If you listen carefully, you will hear screams almost half a dozen times in filming. Of course, time is completely inappropriate, and it does’t last long, but something happens that can be described as “music”. Your best bet, however, is to sit with your baby armed with a wooden spoon in front of the TV with lots of dots and spots while you watch. The rhythm and flow will be better than anything the film has to offer. Watch Sammo Hung as a little lillian in this movie. Aren’t we happy that Jackie Chan and I got to work?",negative

Thanks to Travis Davis for taking on the double role as both director and star. This is the funniest since Woody Allen. And what a relief to see Richard Moll again.

48190,"Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favourites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I was't quite sure what I would send up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would across into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on. The acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. Brewer seems to be a master at getting this characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption. The first moment I knew I was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning. Like the did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer plays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically. The seventy's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema's best. From there we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both Lazarus and Rae, each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally across. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose. Rae's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and Laz's wife leaves him for this brother. Each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situationRae to sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from this farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile this life with God and that of the flesh and the spain it has brought him. There are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with this captive/patient. You never really look at the setup as comical for unrealistic because the sells what the is doing so well. Also, the character of Rae is not chained up for very long, despite what the trailers would have you believe. The situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day for two. As for that chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I never really saw her as anything special, but this role is a true breakthrough for her. This girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down. Any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and bitches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away. Her nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids. Ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism. Mention must also be made of Justin Timberlake, again showing some real acting talent. Where this guy came from I have no clue, but hopefully the will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music the churns out. While not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan still ranks equally to it, in my mind, because when it is on, it is spectacular. Towards the send we have a truly enthralling sequence with ""This Little Light of Mine"" singing out, and earlier, the interaction between captive and captor, when the chain is first introduced, shows some top-notch work. The truly magical moment, though, is when Jackson sings (yes that is him throughout, like it was Terrence Howard in Hustle) the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the flights flicker. If I don't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year, I won't be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing I think I really enjoy with Brewer's work is the fact that the does't show sinners becoming redeemed heroes. Instead the shows us that no matter how bad you have been, for how bad life has been, everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people. We don't have saints there, but fallible people looking to right their ship. If the course stays true for if it falls back into darkness, no one really knows, but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could.",positive

48190,"Craig Brewer is currently the author / director, and I will watch any movie, no matter how bad it may look. His first book “Hustle and Flow” was one of my favourite books of the year. It was full of emotional stories and real characters who loved mistakes. After seeing the efforts of this second class, I am not sure what to think of. The cement looks good, and the trailer uses the music properly, but it looks like it will soon be funny. Fortunately, the black snake growled and hit the nail on the head. The performance is amazing, the writing is excellent, the style of editing, and the sound of the music are delivered and interesting. Brewer seems to be a master who can allow these characters to properly mix sympathy and evil on the road to salvation. I know that the first minute I want to treat it is during the first short-term trial. Just as Hustle and Flow did, Brewer played music perfectly on a wide-screen lens and displayed a simple title font. The aesthetic of the seventys was very popular and helped to show that this would be another great character of the character, compared to other best films in a decade. From there we continue into the life of Lazarus and Rae with short clips, each episode showing another episode, and they go to the last minute they have finished. Arranging between them is smooth and convenient, rather than suddenly planning before the place sounds like it is fulfilling its purpose. Rae's boyfriend went to church, and Lazarus' wife abandoned him. Everyone felt lonely and recovered from what the knew in that situation — Rae tvs. sex with Laz tvs. the bottle. Only when Lei was left on the sidewalk waiting to die, and her savior came to take her to the farm, the reason for their actions finally became clear. Samuel L. Jackson, as a Bruceman elder farmer, tried to make peace with God, physical life, and Spain brought him, and it was great. The host / patient has a period of prior and kindness. You would never think of such a thing as an unwanted setup, since it sells well-made items. In addition, although the trailer will make you believe, Rae's character has not been disturbed for a long time. The situation became increasingly tense, until we realized that the link was designed for him, in fact it only lasted for two days. As for the girl tied up, Christina Ricci really shone. I did’t think the had anything special, but this role was a real success for him. The girl was so distraught that her previous sexual assault had left a deep impression on her heart. Whenever she left her lover, she would begin to see the glare that took the innocent man and the bitch of her childhood, and any man who could make the image disappear was touching her. Her eroticism is not a matter of pleasure, but of surviving a nightmare hidden behind her eyelids. Ricci is fully integrated into this role and shows all the emotional abuse completely. It should also be mentioned that Justin Timberlake (Justin Timberlake) also showed this playing talent. I don’t know where this person came from, but I hope they will continue to shoot more movies and avoid the production of substandard music. Although it is not as stable and stable as the Hustle and Flow, in my opinion, sighing is still the same, because when it is opened, it is amazing. Posting, we have a really interesting sequence, “This My Little Light” sings, and earlier, when the link was first introduced, the collaboration between the captives and captives showed first-class activities. However, the moment of real magic when Jackson sang this famous song while thunder roared and the plane flew (yes, it was him from beginning to send, like Terrence Howard in ""The Hustle""). If I than’t seen a good series of shots all year, I would’t be surprised. What these two people did for each other was amazing and showed the skill of the person. I think the one thing I love about Brewer's work is that it does't show that offenders became rescued heroes. On the contrary, it shows us that no matter how bad you are, no matter how bad your life may be, everyone can fight for salvation and become a better person. There are no saints in your area, but people with faults want to fix their boats. If this course stays true when it gets dark again, no one knows, but at least they can do their best.",positive
48190,"Craig Brewer is now officially the author / director I would watch a movie about, no matter how bad it looks. Her first film, Hostel and Flu, was one of my favourites this year, a story that touched on emotions and real, imperfect characters. I was't sure what I would post after seeing this second attempt. The characters sounded good, the trailer made good use of the music, however, there seemed to be a good chance that it would be funny, and fast. Fortunately, the sound of the black snake killed all its traces. The acting is great, the writing is excellent, and the style of editing, as well as the music, is well-connected. Brewer finds these characters adept at combining both empathy and cruelty as they move forward on the path to reform. The first time I knew I was enjoying it was when I was setting up a short credit line. Like Hostel & Flow, Brewer plays music on a wide screen with fonts with a title that already appears mathematically. The beauty of the seventy's is welcome and helps to show that it will be another episode of a useless character for the people of this decade of best films. From there we continue to have brief glimpses into the lives of Lazarus and Roy, each showing the other as the finally crossed their path to destruction. The arrangements between them were wet and compact, rather than abruptly disconnected before the scene ended for its intended purpose. Roy's boyfriend goes to work in the Ministry and Laz's wife leaves him for this brother. Everyone feels lonely and goes back to the situation they know - having sex with Laz in the Rae bottle. Only when Roy is left to die on the side of the road and this savior comes from the field to pick him up when the idea of ​​his deeds finally becomes clear. Samuel L. Jackson is as beautiful as an old blossom farmer trying to connect this life with God and flesh and Spain. There are times of hardship and heartfelt sympathy with this prisoner / patient. You would never consider setting up a funny joke because it sells what you do best. Also, Rae's character in't bound for long, unless the trailer wants to believe what you believe. The situation becomes more difficult until we realize that the shackles have benefited it and are actually only used for two days. As far as this girl is concerned, Christina Reiki really shines. I never saw it as something special, but this role is a real success for him. The girl is so upset that she has been deeply hurt by her sexual abuse in the past. Whenever the is away from this love, the sees the light of a man who has taken the tools of touch to let go of the innocence and image of this childhood. Her nymphomania is not for the fainting of the heart, but for the survival of the nightmares behind her eyelids. Ricci is fully in the character and shows that all emotional trauma has a positive effect and reality. It should also be about Justin Timberlake, who shows real acting skills. I don't know where this guy came from, but I hope the will continue to work in more movies and stay away from the crazy music that is often seen. Although not as strong and consistent as the hustle and bustle, in my mind Mawan is still equal to it, because it is amazing when it is open. Looking at the post we have a really interesting series in which ""This Little My Light"" sings, and before that, the conversation between the hostage and the kidnapper, when the series is first introduced, has some high-level work. Indicates Truly magical moment, that's when Jackson sings (yes that's all, as if it was Terrence Howard in a hostel) a theme song with thunder and lightning. I would't be surprised if I don't see a series of great shots all year around. What these two people do is amazing and shows what humanity can do. One thing I think I really enjoy about Brewer's work is the fact that it does't show sinners to be redeemed heroes. Instead, Jehovah shows us that no matter how bad you are for how bad your life is, everyone can try to be saved and become a better person. We don't have Sunnahs there, but mysterious people are looking to the right of their ship.
