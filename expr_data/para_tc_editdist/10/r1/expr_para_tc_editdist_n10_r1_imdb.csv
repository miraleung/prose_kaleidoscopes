867,"This film is where the Batman franchise bought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind ""Batman Forever"" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case. Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how ""Batman Returns"" can be considered at all disappointing. True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in ""Batman,"" a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying. Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and this walter lego Bruce Wayne, tangling with nouveau price tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honour of the one thousand, nine hundred and twenty German silent factor), this partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III""), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities. There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain plumpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply in't enough time to properly explore what's going on. Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then sweeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.",positive

Of course, it's not like the original movie - although it does fix all the minor style flaws found in ""Batman"", a weak phrase that separates the conflict between not only two but three characters that Keaton Invites unfortunate comparisons. Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Aside from the folly of expecting anything more from Burton, and the defensive cowardice of turning this subsequent commercial rights into a sixties TV series, I failed to understand how disappointing ""Batman Returns"" was. Can be seen Anyway, at least I did't go down without explaining myself first. The four principals turned out to be the best performers, especially Vulcan and DeVito, when they met with Keaton and Pfeiffer to explore the dark side of duplicate ownership. Although I will admit that the ideas behind ""Batman Forever"" were very good and the talented directors could not get it easily, because it turned out that it should not have happened. As far as I can point out just one weakness is actually the fat of some scripture in some areas, which I think is because this film is a four-box war.",positive
867,"This movie is where the purchase of Batman series has stopped. While I agree that the concept behind ""Batman Forever"" is brilliant and can easily be understood by a competent director, it seems unlikely. Clearly, Warner Bros executives are disappointed with the darkness of Tim Burton's second Batman film. Aside from the idiots who had Burton’s expectations, and the cowardly retention they later decided to turn their marketing right into an honor in the sixtys television show, I don’t know how I would handle the “Batman Returns”. Admittedly, it is not exactly the same as the original movie — although it fixes all the minor flaws in ""Batman"" style, a weak script that combines not only two characters but three characters, This has led to an unpleasant comparison of Keaton's brilliant blend of factor Jack Jackolson as the first factor. However, despite this, it is still a beautiful black film, faithful to Batman's long-term goals, and very satisfying. Michael Keaton returns to Batman and Walter Lego Bruce Wayne, starring low-cost tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, whose name pays tribute to one, nine hundred and twenty German Silent Factors), crime partner Oss Wald Cobleport, Penguin (makeup of Danny DeVito reminiscent of Lawrence Olivier ""Richard III"") and Catwoman Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer)), Wayne himself and Batman. The four principals did well, especially Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer collectively explored the dark side of the two characters. There are some interesting concepts in this movie. The only weakness I can really point out is that the script is full in some places. I think this is mainly due to the way the film is a four-cornered struggle. There is not enough time to properly evaluate what is happening. However, this is a very good film. I suggest you watch it with the first one, and then understand exactly how good these series will be if they continue under the leadership of Burton and Keaton.",positive

Michael Keaton returns as Batman and Walter Lego as Bruce Wayne, new treasurer Max Co (Christopher Walken, named in honor of one hundred and ninety-two Germans) and this criminal accomplice Oswald Koblepot, Penguin (Danny DeVito). Wayne dated her as Batman, reminiscent of Lawrence Oliver ""Richard III"" and Selena Kyle, Kate Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer) with beautiful makeup. The four principals turned to the best sports, especially Vulcan and De Veto, while Keaton and Pfeiffer explored the dark side of duplicate ownership. There are some interesting ideas in this movie. The only weakness I can point out is that there is a certain amount of text in some places, which I think is the way this film is a four-way war.

867,"This movie is where the bought the Batman franchise to stop. Although I will admit that the ideas behind “Batman Forever” are very positive and can easily be verified by a capable director, as this is not the case. Apparently the Warner Brothers directors were angry about how dark the Batman movie was with Tim Burton. Aside from the stupidity of expecting others from Burton, and the cowardly cowardice of their decision to eventually make the had a tribute to the Sixties TV series, I can’t understand how “Batman Returns” can be considered offensive. . True, it’s not the same as the first film - though it fixes all the minor stylistic flaws found in “Batman,” a weak text that separates the conflict between not just two but three factors who invites a similar negative comparison of a great combination of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. But it will all be a dark and beautiful movie, true as Batman was always meant to be, and very enjoyable. Michael Keaton returns to Batman and walter lego Bruce Wayne, paired with billionaire nouveau Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honor of Thousands, Nine Hundred and Twenty Silent Things in Germany), the guilty mag married Oswald Cobblepot, Penguin (beautiful figure of Danny DeVito in Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III""), and Selina Kyle, Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is loved by Wayne and Batman. The four managers put on great performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer work together to explore the dark side of the dual identity. There are some interesting ideas in this film. The only weakness I can really point out is that it’s specifically written in certain areas, which I think is due to how this film is a quadruple war. There is not enough time to properly explore what is going on. However, this is a very good film. I highly recommend watching it in conjunction with the previous one, and then clear up how good the series is if it stays Burton and Keaton.",positive

This movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department.

Without a doubt this is one of the best-looking Chinese historical young-fu epic never made. But alas, Tsui Hark has't improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialog are rather juvenile (his apparent obsession with the silly and overly-long depiction of the evil guys did't help either). To make it worse, this movie is very badly cast. They decided to use the ""hot"" popular Hong Kong idols as lead characters, but unfortunately both Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are totally unsuited for historical young-fu dramas because they black the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three version are infinitely better.

33679,"This was basically an attempt to do the same thing with ""Batman"" that was done with ""Gilligan's Island"" in ""Surviving Gilligan's Island."" For those of you who missed it (and shame!) ""Surviving Gilligan's Island"" (full title: ""Surviving Gilligan's Island: The Incredibly True Story of the Longest Three Hour Tour in History"") was a special from a few years back, where Bob Denver (""Gilligan""), Dawn Wells (""Mary Ann"") and Russell Johnson (""The Professor"") related the story of the show's creation, cancellation, rediscovery & rebirth. Along the way, stories were dramatized with factors portraying the original cast and crew. It was very well done. It was funny, well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show.""Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt"" is in a similar style. The are-telling of the history of the show, the are-enactments, the general feel are all the same. What's missing is the straightforward approach that ""Surviving"" took. In ""Return"", Adam West and Burt Ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited. After being allowed to stay, Adam and Burt witness the theft of the centrepiece of the show: the legendary Batmobile! Adam and Burt decide to chase after it themselves, leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show. This eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the Batmobile and why. Choosing to use this conceit (actually having a plot) is the biggest letdown of this show. Unlike ""Surviving"", ""Return"" forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline (the theft of the Batmobile) instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in (the history of the show.) It is the historical sections that work the best. The casting (as in ""Surviving"") is excellent. Jack Brewer (""Adam West"") and Jason Marsden (""Burt Ward"") capture the feel of the factors without looking *too* much like them. Brett Rickaby (""Frank Gorshin"") bears a stronger resemblance to this subject, but captures none of the late Gorshin's charm, only this characterizations. Other factors' portrayals are short and functional, with none standing out as especially good for bad. Many of the stories have been told before, but they mostly play out amusingly, with only the occasional clunky presentation. Another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of Lyle Waggoner's tryout for the part of Batman. The only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story. This downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly. The ""main plot"" (if that is what we must call it) is, of course, ludicrous. This is not really a fault in and of itself, but it's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall. Strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot (especially in these kinds of things) but we really get neither, there. The performances by West and Ward seem somewhat flat (even for them); the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural. Again, I think the comparison to ""Surviving Gilligan's Island"" can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback. In ""Surviving"", that's all it intends to be. In ""Return"" it tries to do double duty and, unfortunately, often fails. Gorshin and Newmar do well (although I agree with others that Gorshin had not aged well and that Newmar had - and what's Waggoner taking to look that good?) but karen't given enough to do. Again, I think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen there. Another odd point about ""Return"". This special is about the ""Batman"" TV series and its history, yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie. Even the Waggoner footage is technically movie footage. If you know you're ""Bat-history"", then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first, only to be delayed in favor of the TV show when CBS needed to fill time fast. So when Waggoner and West were testing for the role, it was for the movie, not the TV show. Why ""Return"" only uses movie footage is unclear. It most probably has to do with rights issues, but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know: seeing Julie Newmar in the present, but only footage of Lee Meriwether as Catwoman in the past. Overall, I liked the show, mainly for the flashbacks. I would have preferred the style used in ""Surviving Gilligan's Island"", but I can understand why they'd want a more story-oriented piece given the subject matter. Besides, I like these people. It's nice to see them out and about, still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history. I just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there.",positive

Along the way, a story was played, showing the original factors and crew. well done. It's funny, the cast is good, and it's a real documentary for the show. ""Back to the Batcave: An Unpleasant Experience for Adam and Bert"" is a similar approach. The history, performance, and general feeling of the show are the same. What is missing is a straightforward way to ""survive."" In ""Return"", Adam West and Burt Ward both received invitations to participate in car shows that they were not supposed to attend. After being allowed to stay, Adam and Bert confirmed the most important part of the show: The famous Bammobile was stolen! Adam and Bert decided to hunt on their own, guide them on the trails, and allow them to reflect on the history of the show. This led to the revelation of who stole the Batmobile and why. Choosing to use this selfishness (actually there is a conspiracy) is the most unsuccessful feature of this show. Unlike ""survival"", ""retrieval"" forces viewers to follow an interesting subtitle story (Batmobile stolen) instead of focusing all their attention on the things that are most interesting to the viewer (show history). The most active place in history. The cast (as in ""You Survived"") excelled. Jack Brewer (""Adam West"") and Jason Marsden (""Bert Ward"") took on the feeling of these things, but they did't seem to like us. Brett Rickaby (""Frank Gorshin"") is more like this theme, but the does't take the impression of the late Gorshin, just this article. The descriptions of some items are short and useful, none of which are outstanding. Many stories have been reported before, but most of them are very interesting, sometimes a funny introduction. Another feature of the historical component is the use of Lyle Wagoner's audit in Batman's department. The only place the flashback fails is when they enter articles that appear to have been created with the intention of furthering the main story. This will unnecessarily reduce the accuracy of the flashback. A ""master plan"" (if we have to call it that) does't make sense. This is not a real mistake in itself, but it does not just make mistakes. Good performance and good writing can be a masterpiece (especially for this kind of thing), but we really don't have it. The work of the West and the Ward seemed a little flat (and for them); the dialogue was very well written and sounded unnatural. At the same time, I think the comparison to “Gilligan Island Survived” shows that the discussion is mostly about setting a backlash. ""Survival"", this is the purpose of it all. In ""Back"", the tried to accomplish a duplicate task, but unfortunately, it always failed. Gorshin and Newmar did well (although I agree with others that Gorshin is not old, and Newmar is old — how does the Wagoner look good?) But karen has not done enough. Also, I think they can all work better with a specific definition than the one chosen there. Another strange point about ""return"". This special show is about the TV series ""Batman"" and its history, but all the clips shown are from drama movies. Technically speaking, Wagner's lens is the fourth lens. If you know you're a ""Bat History"", then you know that the movie was originally scheduled for the first time, but when CBS wanted to fill in the timeline as soon as possible, it delayed production to support the TV show. So when Wagner and West evaluated the role, it was for a movie, not a TV show. Why the ""return"" using only movie clips is unclear. This may be related to rights issues, but for those familiar with the matter, it is clearly disturbing: Julie Newmar is visible now, but previously there was only Lee Meriwether as the cat's wife. Overall, I love this show, mostly for the backyard. I would love the style used on “Surviving Gilligan Island”, but I understand why they want a more storytelling job. Besides, I love these people. It is wonderful to see them walking around enjoying the greatest work in the history of happiness. I hope they do better, while the other first players are still alive.",positive
33679,"This was an attempt to do ""Surviving Gilligan's Island"" with ""Batman"" from ""Gilligan's Island"". For those who missed it (and embarrassed!) ""Gilligan Island Survival"" (full article: ""Gilligan Island Survival: The Amazing Story of a Three-Hour Long Journey in History"") was a feature. A few years ago, when Bob Denver (""Gallagher""), Don Wells (""Mary Ann"") and Russell Johnson (""Professor"") related the creation, cancellation, rediscovery and rebirth of the show. Along the way, the stories were dramatized by depicting the main characters and factors. Very well done. It was funny, well played and came up as a real script for the show. ""Back to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt"" is similar. The narrative of the show's history, made, feels normal. What is missing is a straightforward approach to survival. In ""Return"", both Adam West and Burt Ward received invitations to a car show they did not intend to invite. After being allowed to stay, Adam and Burt witnessed the theft of the game's theme: the famous Batmobile! Adam and Burt decide to run after them, which leads them to the clues that make them think about the show's history. As a result, it was revealed who stole the bomb and why. Choosing to use this arrogance (actually being a structure) is a big downside of this show. Unlike ""Survival"", ""Return"" forces viewers to follow a less interesting story (Bat Mobile Theft) instead of focusing on what the audience might be most interested in (the program). History.) The most effective historical episodes. Hierarchy (like ""survival"") is best. Jack Brewer (""Adam West"") and Jason Marsden (""Burt Ward"") capture the characters' emotions without seeing too much of them. Brett Reckabi (""Frank Gorschen"") is very similar to the title, but the does't care about the late Gorschen at all, just this description. The display of other features is short and effective, no one is as impressive as good for bad. Many stories have been told before, but they are ridiculous with strange submissions. Another surprise from the historical stages was the use of a test video of Lyle Wagner by Batman. The only place flashbacks fail is when they enter clearly defined points to move the main story forward. This reduces unnecessary flashback accuracy. The ""main building"" (if we should call it that) is definitely funny. This is not a mistake in itself, but it does not do a good job of covering up shortcomings. Strong play and good writing can make a stupid structure (especially in this kind of thing) but we don't get it at all. West and Ward games seem less (even for them) the box is carefully marked to make it feel natural. Also, I think the comparison to ""Galigan Island"" can be seen in the fact that the conversation is mostly to prevent flashbacks. In ""survival"", that's all. In ""Back"" this duplicate tries to work and unfortunately often fails. Gorschen and Neumar did well (although I agree with others that Gorshin was not very old and Neumar was with them - and what did Wagner do to look so good?) But enough to make him do it. not given. Also, I think everyone will benefit from the live presentation more than the jones selected there. Another unusual point about ""return"". It's about the special ""Batman"" TV series and its history, but all the clips shown are from the theatre. Even Wagner's pictures are a professional film. If you know ""Bat History"", you know that the movie was originally scheduled for release, and then there was a delay in favor of the TV show where CBS urgently needed to fill the time. So when Wagner and West discovered the role, it was for a movie, not a TV show. It is not clear why ""Return"" uses only film images. It's probably about rights issues, but it's a different one for those who know: just watching Julie Newmar now, but only one video of Lee Marie Weathers as Kate Woman in the past. All in all, I loved the show, especially the flashbacks. I prefer the style used in ""Survivors of Gilligan's Island"", but I wonder why they want a piece that focuses on the story when considering the subject. Plus, I love them. It's great to see them coming out, having fun with one of the best parts of the entertainment history.

Until this collar goes on the blink. Fido is NOT a horror film, but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it IS.

44079,"The ugly coyote is a waste of ninety minutes. The plot, the text and the foundation are a joke. Bello must have been embarrassed by a few lines! I really don't know where to start when reviewing a tragic film like Ernest Goes to Africa. There is nothing good about this waste of time and life for an hour and a half, except for two-thirds of the comedy scattered throughout the film. Surprisingly, there was one at the collection table for a group dedicated to trash acting, filming and editing, and even more surprisingly, this is the eighth instalment of the Ernst series. At the beginning of the film, we see Ernest standing with various African objects, such as wooden masks and African animal heads, making gestures and gestures that can make many third graders laugh. This opening scene gives viewers a taste of Ernest's constant comedy efforts, and shows how this comedy comes to ninety-five percent of the time. The first thing that impressed me the most about this movie was how bad the copy was. Everyone in the movie is a regular feature of the C-movie, but Linda Cash is the worst. He is an example of more work. All of its lines are drawn with the utmost inhuman enthusiasm in a shocking way that you can see in a middle school game. Most high school theatre students are likely to change these features and bring more powerful performances. Jim Warney shows a certain sense of humour at least all the time, but in most of the movies the facts are like a giant, trying to make a fool of himself and make fun of talking in different voices. Ernest Goose travels from Africa to Africa, where an archaeologist has become one of the two most important gems of the African nation. The jewellery was then returned to the United States, where an unidentified man was seen running away from some people through a flea market. He hides in a ""two dollar"" bucket, then runs away from the scene. Ernest wants a waitress gift for Renee, so the goes to the grocery store and buys jewelry. He later takes them home, paints them, and connects them to ViewU. He gives a view to Ren and tells him that they will never be together because it is just a middle ground shoe, and the wants a man who likes to sacrifice. Renee and Ernest were later convicted, brought back to Africa to be held captive. Most movies don't make sense. When Ernest was in Africa, this truck fell into a river. In the next scene, we see him as a Hindu slave named ""Hey You"". His skin is black, and Jehovah has wrapped a cloth around this waist. At first I thought Jim Verney was playing a different role from Ernest in the film, but I soon realized that Ernest's stupidity when the said they you started talking. Another incident that always comes to my mind as a complete joke about chasing a car in the African desert. Renee and Ernest grabbed the ostrich farmer's truck and were chased by strangers. Walking straight on the road at a speed of about twenty miles per hour, the two hunters shot Ernst, who was behind the ostrich farmer's truck. Ernest, on the other hand, throws eggs and beards at ostrich eggs. The men did not hit Ernest once in the five-minute chase, but Ernest sat down at a table to prevent them from hitting this driver in the face, causing this car to veer off the road and smoke billowing. I should also add that Ernst plays two eggs at a time on a large bra. The design of the set in this film is also incredibly flawed. A big part of the film is where Renee and Ernest travel to Africa, trying to find a civilization. As they climbed up, we saw them walking in the fields and woods, probably shot somewhere in the United States. The fields are open grasslands, which have no evidence close to Africa (they can add at least some African trees to the background figure), and the forests look like the country's Connecticut forests in which P. M. which has stems, grapes and thorns that change trees. According to IMDb.com, the film was originally shot in South Africa, but I still can't believe it. The movie goes on, Ernest makes a joke after Ernest's joke. Every other movie does't matter. People of African descent all speak English for one reason for another, and Ernst was later challenged by a leading leader in ""True War"", already dressed as a ninja, but in a way polite. . In front of the guard is a table full of taxes, swords, knives and weapons, while Ernest has a table with matches, bears and a few other useless things. However, Ernest wins the war and somehow saves the day. Overall, this movie is painful to watch. I could't catch you once. I had to go to the center and do some useful work for a few hours to make up for the lost brain cells while I tried to compliment Verni's jokes. They should really put General Warning Warning in the box to let people know that they will be a little late when they finish the film. I would say that none of the movies I've seen have come close to being as sad as Ernest Goes in Africa.",negative

We were table to tell when it was the past, when it's current, etc. However, Nolan experimented with it a little, and it just does't work. Although the had a small budget and could't use color (which is one way Memento worked), it was just too hard to distinguish between time. On the DVD is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order. I intended to write my review after watching it, so hopefully it would make more sense, but, of course, it was't working. You can't blame Nolan for not coming up with original ideas. A young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored, so the decides to follow random people on the street. He finds one, Cobb (Alex Haw), that particularly interests him. Soon, Bill becomes friends with Cobb and goes with him as the breaks into houses and robs them. Then, a saucy young blond (Lucy Russell) enters, and the movie becomes even weirder from there. The ending of Following is one of the most shocking endings I've seen. Sure, Fight Club had an amazing ending, but the way that Following's ending played out was amazing. I felt like someone had smacked me on the head and given me a concussion. Nolan has a thing for making good endings (well, maybe not, I could guess Insomnia's from a mile away), and can really construct a great story. Following may not be the easiest to follow for look at, but it's such a finely crafted, original story with a shocker ending that you'll probably want to watch all of its seventy minutes again.
