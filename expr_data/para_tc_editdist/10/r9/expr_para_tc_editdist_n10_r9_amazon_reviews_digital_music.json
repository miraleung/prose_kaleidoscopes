One of the first true supergroups that I can recall - Wetton (most notably from King Crimson and UK), Howe (Yes), Palmer (ELP), and Downes (Buggles and Yes). Steve Howe and Carl Palmer were ungodly superstars in their perspective bands during the seventy's. I remember buying the vinyl based on the strength of \"Sole Survivor\". I remember thinking with these progressive musicians at the helm, there'd have to be some ten-twelve minute spacey head trips. That's where the mixed feelings came in. All the songs were in the four to five minute range (\"Here Comes The Feeling\" is the longest track at five:forty-two). Wetton and Downes were the main writers there. and Downes prior catalog with the Buggles was \"pop\" to the max. In retrospect, I now know why Asia had that pop feel - it was Geoff Downes all along. Not that it's a bad thing. Asia's sound just was't what I was expecting. This album is heavy on keyboards. Steve Howe's guitar remains mostly in the background house of a few shining guitar solos. The bass work is great. Carl Palmer's drumming is steady, but it's nothing flashy like this days with ELP. Wetton's vocals are top notch. It's the songs that eventually made me come around, as it did for so many listeners (and radio stations). Asia's debut spent nine weeks at #one on the U. S. album chart. \"Heat Of The Moment\" (reaching #four), \"Sole Survivor\" (#ten), and \"Only Time Will Tell\" (#seventeen) were huge Top forty hits. Billboard named the Asia debut as album of the year. Compilations are saturated with songs from their honest album - \"The Very Best Of Asia: Heat Of The Moment one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two-ninety\" has six of the nine songs from it's debut, and \"Asia - Gold\" (two thousand and five) incredibly contains all nine songs.

One of the top rock debuts from the past several decades. If you want to own one studio album of theirs - this is the one!

COMMENT: I \u200b\u200bfelt mixed emotions about the first Asian album when it came out in the 'eighty -two. One of the first real teams I remember - Wetton (especially the King Crimson and UK), Howe (Yes), Palmer (ELP), and Downes (Buggles and Yes) . Steve Howe and Carl Palmer were big and uneducated. who stars on their team in sight during the seventies. I remember buying vinyl based on the \u201cSurvival\u201d strength. I remember thinking these progressive artists, it should be about twelve minutes on independent journeys. From there came mixed feelings. All songs last four to five minutes (\u201cHere\u2019s the feeling\u201d is the longest five: forty -two). Wetton and Downes were the most important writers there. and Downes \u2019former book The Buggles\u201c pops \u201dto a maximum. Looking back, now I know why Asia felt pop - it was all Geoff Downes. This is no longer a bad thing. The Asian sound is not the only thing I expected. This album is heavy on keys. Steve Howe\u2019s guitar is often left with some bright guitars. The bass work is great. Carl Palmer\u2019s drumming is consistent, but not as glamorous as these days ELP. Wetton's voice is great. These are the songs that eventually got me close, as the cd for many listeners (and on the radio). The first Asian fight lasted nine weeks on the American album chart. \u201cHeat Of The Moment\u201d (reached#Four), \u201cSurvived Alone\u201d (#toban), and \u201cOnly Time Will Tell\u201d (#seven) were the top forty hits.

The gathering is full of songs from their faithful album - \u201cThe Most Beautiful of Asia: Heat Of the Moment thousand, nine hundred and eighty -two\u201d has six of the nine songs from, and \u201cAsia - Gold \u201d(two thousand and five hundred) amazingly contains all nine songs. Business success to say the least, and supporters of this former teammate shouted \u201csell\u201d. All I can say is - you can\u2019t make everyone happy. There is no denying that the songs are enticing. including my favourites \u201cOnly the Savior\u201d, \u201cOnly Time to Tell\u201d and the heaviest song \u201cTime Again\u201d. One of the first leading rocks in the last decade. If you want to have a studio album - this is it! Up to two thousand and six, I\u2019m still waiting for a revised version with extensive notes to be released.

Opinions: I had different feelings about my first Asian album when it first came out in the eighty-twond year. One of the biggest true bands I remember - Wheaton (especially from King Crimson and the UK), Howe (yes), Palmer (ELP), and Downs (Bugle and yes). Steve Howe and Carl Palmer were ungodly champions in their watch bands in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. I remember buying vinyl based on the power of \"Civil Survivor\". I remember having to travel twelve minutes with these evolving artists in mind. This is where mixed feelings came from. All songs were in the four to five minute range (\"Hair Comes the Feeling\" is the longest song: five: forty-two). Wheaton and Downs were great writers there. And the previous Downs catalog with the Bugles was more and more \"pop\". Looking back, I now know why Asia felt pop - it was Geoff Downs all the time. It's not that bad. The Asian voice was not the only one I expected. This album is hard on keyboards. Steve Hugh's guitar sits in the back without a few bright solos. The boss performs well. Carl Palmer's drum is strong, but it is not as bright as it is today with ELP. Vuitton's voices are very cloud. The songs that eventually made me look like I cd for a lot of listeners (and radio). Asian Debut spent nine weeks at # one on the U-Chart. S . \"Heat of the Moment\" (up to #four), \"Sole Survivor\" (#ten), and \"Only Time Will Tell\" (# seventeen) were forty successful films.

Yes, some of the content has already been added to the next collection, but if you\u2019re new to James Brown, there\u2019s no better place to start. By the time the first track of this set (It\u2019s New Day, a thousand, nine hundred and sixty -nine), JB was doing something that no one else could do. In fact everything placed goes straight to the top of the charts. James gathers these players, once in an empty shall where the show ends, and the will work out the method of getting one. Listen while the songs are non -stop. The interaction between James and the original JB (when they were young and hungry) was surprising. Just look at James \u2019community comments on\u201c Nothin Speech and Speech \u201d,\u201c Get Up, Get Involved, Get Involved \u201d, and\u201c Soul Power \u201d.

This \u201cI Got to Move\u201d cut is superior in all aspects including \u201cFunk Power\u201d. And let\u2019s not forget the top recording of \u201cHot Pants\u201d, because the whip helps James find your mind and don\u2019t let go. Both types are great. If you have some of the new software, try making an omega-mix for both! If you thought you were not alive, you will reconsider after entering this album. When you get Funk Introduction, you\u2019re ready to dive deeper into James Brown!

Mark Knopfler even publicly apologized for it on MTV by saying \"No offence\". Apparently even the could't believe how popular it became. The song takes stinging jabs at artists who make boatloads of money but, according to the character in the song, don't actually work, for at least produce nothing of real value. Nonetheless, the same character shows bottomless envy for those who learn their \"checks for free\". Background vocals by Sting (who was as big as solar prominence in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five) cd't hurt the song's popularity. The band's appearance at one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five's Live Aid, complete with Sting, led to a classic comment by an MTV VJ: \"Who would expect Sting and Dire Straits together?\" Well, they did collaborate on an album, so it was't really that big of a shock. Then the video (with its now blocky and primitive-looking computer graphics) came out and the song catapulted to nearly everywhere. No one could escape, even if they wanted to.\"Brothers in Arms\" follows the typical template of Dire Strait's other albums: A couple of absolutely incredible songs, many great songs, and a few merely good jones (total duds are exceedingly rare). Overall, the album begins with astonishing momentum, dips down quite a bit, and slowly climbs its way back to a level somewhat below the beginning. Without doubt the strongest songs are the first three. All were hits. Then \"Your Latest Trick\" suddenly dips the adrenaline down somewhat, and \"Why Worry\" dips it down even further, almost to a soporific level. Then the space begins to build again with \"Ride Across the River\" and it does't let up until the great closing title track. \"The Man's Too Strong\" is a vastly underrated song hidden on what was once \"Side Two\". Some of Knopfler's best lyrics also hide there. The chunky guitar driven \"One World\" kicks the space up after a series of mid-tempo songs. The closing title track is another unjustly overlooked song. It's disturbing, beautiful, and forlorn. Knopfler's trademark volume-pedal-assisted guitar appropriately pervades the song. One could debate about whether for not \"Brothers in Arms\" deserves the title \"Best Dire Straits Album\". In some ways it does and in some ways it does't. In the send, it really does't matter, it's still a great album with some of the greatest heights pop never recorded. Unfortunately, Dire Strait's speak also signalled the beginning of the send of the band. The follow-up \"On Every Street\" did't even come close to the commercial popularity of \"Brothers In Arms\" (though the band must be given loads of credit for not putting out a carbon copy of their omega-seller). Following a few live albums, Dire Straits appears to have disappeared altogether. Knopfler is still recording and releasing albums (his latest was released this past September and charted all over the world), but the reign of Dire Staits clearly ended sometime in the late one thousand, nine hundred and heights. Still, they left behind some great music, and provided a breath of fresh air in the sometimes stultifying one thousand, nine hundred and heights pop scene.","overall":4,"summary":"Helped make the 1980s tolerable...","unixReviewTime":1102377600,"reviewTime":"12 7, 2004"}

Mark Knopfler even apologized publicly on MTV saying \"no case.\" Clearly, even people do not believe that it has become so popular. The song criticized the artists for making a lot of money, but according to the characters in the song, it and't work, at least they did't produce any real value. However, the same characters show endless jealousy in those who read \u201cfree checks\u201d. The origin of the words Sting (sounding like the sun in one thousand and nine hundred and eighty-five) does not affect the popularity of the song. The band appeared on Live Aid of one thousand and nine hundred and eighty-five, and also featured Sting, which led to MTV VJ's statement: \"Who can expect Sting and Dire Straits to be together?\" they are not so frightened. Then the video (now with blocky and original computer graphics) came out, and the song went almost everywhere. No one can run away, even if you want to run away. \"Brothers in Arms\" follows the standard template of some Dire Strait albums: a few totally unbelievable songs, a lot of good songs, and just good songs (very rare to be completely stupid). Overall, the disc started at an amazing space, falling to the ground. very much, and slowly ascends back to a slightly lower level than before. There is no doubt that the most powerful songs are the three most important jones. All beats. Then \"your latest hobby\" suddenly dropped a little adrenaline, while \"why are you worried\" dropped more, almost to the point of hypnosis. Then, \"the crossing of the river\" began to rebuild the place, until the great song of closing the title never ceased. \"The Strongest Man\" is a very low-key song, hidden in the \"second half\". Some of Knopfler's best songs are also hidden there. After a series of high-pitched songs, \"One World\" driven by a thick guitar rocked the air. The last song of the title is another song that has been unfairly ignored. It is disturbing, beautiful and desolate. Knopfler's guitar accompaniment fits right into the song. People may argue that the \"Brothers in Instruments\" deserve the title of \"Best Dire Straits Album\". This is true in some ways, but not in other ways. In the post, it does't matter, it's still a good record and the biggest pop music that has never been recorded. Unfortunately, the Direct Strait speech also marked the beginning of the band's release. The following \"On Each Street\" did not come close to the commercial fame of \"Brothers In Arms\" (although the group should be highly commended for not releasing a copy of their omega dealer's copy). After releasing several live albums, Dire Straits seems to be disappearing altogether. Knopfler is still recording and releasing albums (his latest album was released in September last year and hit charts around the world), but Dire Staits' dominance clearly ended in one thousand, nine hundred, and Highland. However, they have left some good music, and they are giving a fresh air to the boring atmosphere of the thousand, nine hundred and most popular shows.","overall":4,"summary":"Helped make the 1980s tolerable...","unixReviewTime":1102377600,"reviewTime":"12 7, 2004"}

The song strikes a chord with artists who make money on the boat but, according to the song's character, it does't really work, because at least it does't create anything of real value. However, the same character shows endless jealousy in those who read \"their free checks\". The words behind the sting (which was as big as the sunrise of one thousand nine hundred and eighty-five) did not charm the sound of the song.

No one can escape even if the wants to. \"Brothers with Arms\" follows a specific template for some albums in Direct Street: a few incredible songs, a lot of great songs, and just a few good Jones (Perfect Odds). Overall, the album starts at an amazing space, goes down a bit, and then goes up a bit from the beginning to the bottom level. Undoubtedly the strongest songs are the first three.

Track the caption track for another song that has been illegally ignored. It's disturbing, beautiful and sad. Knopfler's trademark volume assisted guitar fitting is full of this song. One could argue that \"Brothers in Arms\" deserves the title of \"Best Dire Streets Album\". Somehow it does and in some ways it does't. Posting, no matter, it's still a great album with some great recordings. Unfortunately, Dior Strait's speech also started posting the band. The track \"On All Streets\" did not even come close to the commercial reputation of \"Brothers in Arms\" (although the group should be given great credit for not releasing a carbon copy of its Omega dealer). After a few live albums, Dior Streets seems to be disappearing altogether.

The obvious highlight is the pop-funk masterpiece \"Kiss\". Once mixed by David Z and Mazarati, this originally blues based song was given life. It's simple stripped down drums and funky was-wah guitar click couple with Prince's mischievous falsetto equal one of this trademark singles and most defining moments. NOTE: Tom Jones' version is to be avoided. Such a shame that some people associate the song with him before Prince. The album as a whole contains a big French influence garnered in so small part from the movie, which was set on The Riviera. This is best displayed in the funky and fun \"Girls & Boys\". There is also a lot of instrumental experimentation, plenty of hand cymbals and even a Big Band on the opening cut \"Christopher Tracy's Parade\". Soul however is as always at the root, with the horn section helping Prince give an old school soul review vibe, particularly for the album's tour. Another personal favourite of mine is \"Anotherloverholenyohead\". With it's P-Funk style title and swaying Stevie Wonder-esque sound it's a really cool track. The following \"Somtimes It Snows In April\" is a beautiful, patient, code to a departed friend and good closure to the album. In short don't associate this soundtrack with the negative feelings some hold about the film it's taken from. This album again showed Prince's rich diversity and ranks amongst this most essential work.","overall":5,"summary":"Come Behold Prince's Parade!","unixReviewTime":993945600,"reviewTime":"07 1, 2001"}

Burt Bacharach composed some of the best pop music in the sixties and early seventies, but when the broke up with longtime collaborator Hal David, the seemed to close this way artistically, especially as the veered toward overproduced deck with then-wife Carole Bayer Sager. Unfortunately this music still charted, so the had no motivation to come back to the type of pop music the does best. In fact, I thought the was exiled into a permanent retro-deification state until I heard this disc. Paired most uncharacteristically with Elvis Costello, Bacharach the composer sounds rejuvenated on this recording as if the last thirty years did not even occur. The momentous orchestra swells, the piano key tinkling, the unmistakable flugelhorns, the gossamer female background vocals and above all, the sweeping, unapologetic romanticism - they are all back in stylish, timeless form with some fresh, intricate lyrics courtesy of Costello, who sings with surprising visor without a hint of irony for unwarranted nostalgia. Each song is a gem. \"In the Darkest Place\" starts things off in a dusky mood with an intoxicating piano dictating the cocktail lounge rhythm. \"Toledo\" is a bouncy though more melancholy cousin to \"Do You Know the Way to San Jose?\" with its geography-driven lyrics. \"Tears at the Birthday Party\" has the silliest, double-entendre lyrics this side of Jimmy Webb's \"MacArthur Park\", but it has an infectious beat and a soaring chorus that its lightheartedness provides a welcome respite. The title track is a lovely ballad driven by a piano and guitar that reminds me fondly of \"Alfie\" with its escalating strings and swooning notes. \"The Sweetest Punch\" is pop music at its catchy best with a bringing bell response to Costello's crooning of \"You knock me out\/It was the sweetest punch\/The bell goes. \". Both \"This House Is Empty Now\" and \"What's Her Name Today?\" are powerful ballads that will remind you immediately of Bacharach classics like \"A House Is Not a Home\", \"A Message to Michael\" and \"One Less Bell to Answer\". Regardless, the closing track, \"God Give Me Strength\", is the artistic high point and the initial reason why Bacharach and Costello partnered for this recording. Written for Allison Anders' one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six faux-Carole King biopic movie, \"Grace of My Heart\", it was a poignant moment when the Denise Waverly character sings this ballad with such uncertain yearning and romantic fervour that the faux-Brian Wilson character could not help but be impressed enough to sign her up for this label. While I still prefer the more plaintive Kristen Vigard version (to which Ileana Douglas clip synched in the film), Costello sings with a surprising emotional wallop wrapping this voice around a full orchestra led by a mournful trumpet that provides the appropriate crescendo to this masterful recording. Strongly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Bacharach in Classic Form With Costello a Fine Troubadour","unixReviewTime":1114560000,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2005"}

Unfortunately, this type of music is still in the charts, so there is no reason to go back to the popular genre that I am doing well.

Sings without respect, weasel - the irony of unwanted nostalgia. Every song is precious. \"In the Darkest Place\" begins the evening with an intoxicating piano that resonates to the beat of the Cocktail Lounge. Toledo has a very angry cousin, \"Do you know the way to San Jose?\" In this words, driven by geography. Jimmy Webb's \"MacArthur Park\" at \"Tears at the Birthday Party\" has a low-key, two-way script, but it has a contagious rhythm and uplifting music that provides light comfort. The title song is a beautiful piano ball and guitar that lovingly reminds me of \"Alfie\" with growing syllable units and faint notes. \"The Sweetest Punch\" is a high quality pop song with a metallic response to Costello's cry \"You take me out \/ it was the sweetest punch \/ the bell rings.\" Both \"this house is empty now\" and \"what is its name today?\" There are powerful songs that will quickly remind you of Bacchus classics, such as \"A House Is Not a Home\", \"A Message to Michael\" and \"One Less Bell to Answer\".

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Combine Dido's clear, emotional voice with excellent production values and the result is marvellous music. While it is easy to compare Dido with artists such as Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins, and Sin\u00e9ad O'Conner, Dido has her own style. This CD opens with \"Here with Me,\" a heartfelt song of longing and love. The delicate music with Dido's soulful voice sends shivers down my spine. This song is haunting and ethereal, and deeply emotional, establishing the theme for this CD. All the delicacy is gone with the feral song \"Hunter.\" Dido has gone from singing about the person she wants to be with her to telling her love interest that she wants to be on the hunt again, away from him. Dido's voice is quiet, yet assured. She is asking him to let her go, yet you sense from the vocals that while she is providing him with the opportunity, she will do it eventually with for without this approval. She is the hunter. The third track is another relationship phase: after the breakup. The lyrics seem a bit strange after the heartfelt vocals of longing in the first song and the cat on the prowl strength of the third song. In this song she is more simpering and petty and thinking way too much about him. Given the strength of character in the first two songs, this song seems out of character. The next song, \"My Lover's Gone,\" brings Dido back on track. This time she sings the loss of her lover. The lyrics are poignant and mournful. The emotion she brings to her voice matches the lyrics well. The haunting instruments supporting the vocals are in sync rather than counterpoint. The music and instruments are delicate and misty, and have a Celtic quality to them, combining modern musical elements with an hairy new page style. Keeping with melancholy themes is a song to a departed lover in \"All You Want.\" The harmonies and the lyrics are the highlight of this composition. On the one hand Dido laments the loss of her lover, but she also does not accept that the left for another woman, and essentially says that the made this bed, and the can sleep in it. As in most of the previous songs she remains, while upset and regretful, in control. The next song did well on the charts, and is a pretty song about how someone can brighten a person's life. Dido's vocals are electronically manipulated to increase the complexity of this song, with overdubs and echo. This pop song is bright and friendly and has a catchy beat that combine to make this one of the most radio friendly songs on the CD. This song is also likely to show up in movies, if it has yet to do so. Getting back to a more melancholy stone is \"Honestly OK.\" The topic is loneliness and feeling the need to share life with someone. There is a sharp beat to this song that shows some ship-hop influence, though not in the vocals. This song turns depression into emotional part.\"Slide\" brings to mind Sade. The sumptuous mellow vocal overlays and the vocal style are reminiscent of some of Sade's music. Once again Dido's voice takes charge of the song and the subject, which is dealing with mistakes and the every day tribulations of life. The electronic touches are subdued and supportive and provide an interesting and unique feel. The drums retain just a touch of island beat, again similar to some of Sade's music. However, in the send this song is Dido's. The ninth track is melancholic, and yet the song keeps itself about a maudlin level to provide an enjoyable listening experience. \"Isobel\" is about love, regret and quiet resentment. It is amazing that Dido can using about loving someone more who is in the process of going away, but that is where she found strength to carry on.\"I'm no Angel\" says that regardless of whether she is an angel, she tries hard to do the right thing. The lyrics are interesting and well performed. However, it seems that the vocal style is less in charge and Dido seems to struggle just a little to keep up with the instruments. Because of the power of the other songs on this CD we know she has the ability, so it is perception rather than fact. The result is that vocally this track is one of the weaker jones on this CD. Dido reasserts herself lyrically and vocally in \"My Life.\" Dido could have sang this song with a regretful stone, as though she is breaking up with someone for has differences with someone that are causing her to do something she does not want to do. Instead she says she does what she does because she is in charge of herself. The steady beat is assured and is beautifully and quietly executed musically. This song also seems to reflect Dido's true personality, which shows up in earlier songs. Perhaps this song also dares anyone to criticize her music, advising everyone that this music is who she is and she cares not what anyone says about it.\"Take My Hand\" is a deep song, expressing the empathy that someone can have for another for whom they care deeply. When you are that deeply in love for someone there can be no lies because the emotions are plain to see; a wonderful and pretty song with a fast beat that proclaims the depths love can achieve. The music and the vocals in this song are strong to underscore the strength of the singer's love. Listen to this album without distractions, because these songs are emotional and complex. The music is beautiful, the lyrics are well written. The few moments of weakness are well outweighed by the strength of the remaining songs. This excellent album is for those who like Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins and perhaps even Enya.","overall":5,"summary":"Emotional Mood Pop","unixReviewTime":1106179200,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2005"}

While it\u2019s easy to compare Dido with artists like Sara McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins, and Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Conner, Dido has this own style. This CD opens with \"Here With Me\", a heartfelt song that expresses desire and love. The soft music of Dao's loving voice made my back tremble. This song is unforgettable, ethereal, and full of emotion, and set the theme for this CD. All the wonderful food disappeared with the wild song \"Hunter\". Dido went on to using if the wanted her to also tell this girlfriend that the wanted to get back together and stay away from her. Dido's voice was calm, but certainly. She begs him to let her go, but she can hear in the voice that even though she gives him a chance, the will eventually do it without permission. He is a hunter. The third clue is another stage of the relationship: after the breakup. After singing from the heart in the first song and the cat in the circling power of the third song, the words seem strange. In this song, she is thin, emaciated, and thinks a lot about herself. Due to the strength of the characters in the first two songs, this song seems to be out of place. The next song \"My Valentine's Gone\" put Di Duo back on track. This time, she was singing the song of the loss of her lover. The words are sad and dark. The stone of this voice that went with it was in perfect harmony. Sound-supporting therapies are compatible instead of case. The music and instruments are delicate and luxurious, with Celtic features, combining contemporary musical elements with a style with a new page. The melancholy theme is the song of the late lover in \"All You Want\". Harmony and songs are the best of the piece. On the other hand, Dido lamented the loss of this girlfriend, but refused to stay with another woman. Like many of the previous songs, the still maintains this composure, although the is anxious and remorseful, still in control. The next song performed well on the charts. It was a great song about how one enlightens one's life. Deo's voice is electronically processed to increase the complexity of the songs, in combination with the echo. This popular song is bright and friendly, and has a compelling rhythm, making it one of the most widely distributed songs on CD. This song may have appeared in a movie, if not already. Returning to a molten rock is \"honesty.\" The content is lonely and you feel the need to share life with someone. The song strikes sharply, showing some of the effects of shipwreck, though not on the voice. This song turns stress on the emotional part. \"Slideshow\" reminded me of Thad. The melodious sound of the voice and the style of speech are reminiscent of some of Thad's music. Dao\u2019s voice carries the song and theme again, dealing with the mistakes and daily tragedies in life. The electronic phone is soft and supportive, and offers an interesting and unique experience. The drum keeps only the beat of the island, again in the same way as the music of Thad. However, the song was posted by Dao. The ninth song sighs, but the song is kept at a sad level to provide a pleasant listening experience. \"Isobel\" is hatred for love, remorse, and serenity. It's amazing how Dido used to love someone in the process of travel, but this is how the found the strength to keep going. \u201cI am not an angel,\u201d the said, \u201cwhether you are an angel for not. The words are very interesting and the performance is also very good. However, it seems that the style of speech is not important, and Dido seems a little difficult to maintain the space of the device. Because of the power of some of the songs in this CD, we know you can, so this understanding may be true. The result is that this song is one of Jones' weakest on CD sound. Dido repeated himself with songs and the voice \"In My Life\". Dido could have sung the song with a stone of remorse, as if the had broken up with someone because of a disagreement with someone that made him do things the did not want to do. Instead, the said that the had done what the should have done because the was responsible for it. Sustainable beats are guaranteed, and are done with music well and quietly. The song also reflects Dido's true personality, which is evident in the original songs. Maybe this song had the guts to criticize this music, telling everyone that the music was this, the did't care what others said. \"Hold My Hand\" is a deep song that expresses the compassion of one person to another who they care deeply about. When you are deeply in love with someone, you will not lie, for the feelings are clear; a sweet and sweet song with a fast rhythm, which informs the depth that love can reach. The music and lyrics of this song are very powerful, emphasizing the power of the singer's love. Don't be distracted by listening to this album, because these songs are so emotional and complex. The music is beautiful and the lyrics are well written. The strength of the remaining songs transcends shortcomings. This great album is perfect for people who love Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins and Enya.","overall":5,"summary":"Emotional Mood Pop","unixReviewTime":1106179200,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2005"}

Although it is easy to compare Dido to artists such as Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins, and Sean O'Connor, Doe has this own style. The CD opens with \"Here With Me\", a heartfelt song of longing and love. Delicate music with Dow's soulful voice shakes my spine. This song is disturbing and sounds good, and it has deep emotions, setting the theme of this CD. All the delicious food ended with the wild song \"Hunter\". Dido released a song about the man the wanted to be with so that the could express this romantic interest that the wanted to hunt again. Dadu's voice is quiet, but reassuring. He begs her to let him go, but the hears in words that the will eventually do so without her permission. She is a hunter. The third track is another stage of the relationship: after the breakup. The heartfelt voice of Arzoo for the first song and the lyrics after the cat in the composition of the third song seem strange. In this song, the is very simple and thin and thinks a lot about him. Given the strength of the character in the first two songs, this song seems out of character. The next song, \"My Love Gone,\" brings Daddy back. In it the sings about the loss of this beloved. The words are disturbing and sad. The emotion the expresses in this voice is in harmony with the lyrics. Sound devices that support sound are synchronized rather than counterpoint. The music and instruments are delicate and fuzzy, and have Celtic quality, which combines modern musical instruments with a new wooden page style. Ending with frustrating themes is a song for the lover who goes to \"All You Want\". Harmony and alphabet are the main characters of this song. Dido, on the other hand, cries about the loss of this beloved, but also does not accept that this other woman has been abandoned, and in fact says that Jehovah made this bed, and one can sleep in it. \u06d4 Like many previous songs, the is still in control, even though the is angry and remorseful. The following song has performed well on the charts, and is one of the best songs on how to brighten one's life. Dadu's lyrics have been used electronically to enhance the complexity of the song. The pop song is bright and friendly and has a fun rhythm that makes it one of the most popular radio songs on CD. The song may also appear in movies, if not earlier. Returning to the sad rock is \"right and honest.\" The article says that loneliness and the need to share life with someone. The song has a fast rhythm that shows a certain ship shop effect even though it is not in the sound. This song turns depression into a part of emotions. \"Slide\" reminds us. The powerful soundtrack echoes some of Sad's music. Dadu's voice also captures the songs and themes while dealing with life's mistakes and everyday worries. The electronic touch is suppressed and supported and gives an interesting and unique feel. The drums retain the island beat, and resemble sad music. However, it is Dido who posted this song. The ninth song is sad, yet puts it on the modal level to make the song feel pleasant to listen to. \"Osobel\" is about love, remorse and silent danger. It's amazing that Dido can use it to love someone close to him, but that's where the gets the strength to move on. \"I'm not an angel,\" the says, trying to be an angel. It's hard to do the right thing. The words are interesting and do well. However, the soundtrack seems less formal and David seems to be just struggling to keep up with the musical instruments. Thanks to the power of some of the songs on this CD, we know you have the potential, so it's an impression, not a reality. The bottom line is that this track is one of the weakest pieces of this CD. Dido confirmed himself with music and lyrics in \"My Life\". Dido may have sung this song with a stone of remorse, as if the was breaking up with someone because the disagreed with someone because the was doing something the did't want to do. Instead, the says the does what the does because the is in charge of it. Constant rhythm is guaranteed and good and calm performance is performed through music. This song reflects the real personality of Dido, which is reflected in previous songs. Maybe someone in this song has the guts to criticize this music, advising everyone who this music is and what anyone can say about it. \"Take My Hand\" is a deep song that expresses the sympathy that a person can do for someone the cares deeply about. When you fall in love with someone from the bottom of your heart, you will not lie because your feelings are clear. A sweet and sweet song with a fast rhythm that announces the depths that can be achieved with love. The music and lyrics are strong in this song to emphasize the power of the artist's love. Listen to this album without interruption, because these songs are emotional and complex. The music is beautiful, the words are well written. A few moments of weakness go far beyond the strength of the rest of the songs. This great album is for those who love Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins and maybe Anya.","overall":5,"summary":"Emotional Mood Pop","unixReviewTime":1106179200,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2005"}

While Dido\u2019s artists like Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins, and Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Conner are easy to compare, Dido has this own style. The CD opens with \u201cStay with Me,\u201d a long -awaited patriotic song. The sensitive music with Dido\u2019s soulful voice sends it down. This song is complex, balanced, emotional, and sets the stone for this CD. All the sweetness came out of the monster song \"Hunter.\" Dido left the songs of the person the wanted to be with until the told her this interest in love that the wanted to hunt again, away from him. Dido's voice was calm but reassuring. She begs him to let her go, and you can feel from the voices that as the gives her a chance, the will eventually do it without her permission. He was a hunter. The third path is another stage of communication: after the collapse. The lyrics seem a bit weird after the offensive sound of the first song and of the cat holding the third song. This song is simpler and smaller and the thinks a lot about her. Due to the strength of the character in the previous two songs, this song seems to be out of character. The next song, \u201cLover My\u2019s Go,\u201d returns to Dido\u2019s track. This time she sings about the loss of her beloved. The words are emotional and sad. The emotion she carries in her voice mixes well with the songs. Dangerous devices that support voices are both rather hostile. The music and instruments are delicate and fuzzy, with a Celtic quality, combining modern musical elements with a new hairstyle. Following the surprising theme is a song for a loved one in \"All You Want.\" Alignment and songs are the hallmarks of this composition. On the other hand, Dido regrets the loss of this lover, but the also does not accept to be left to another woman, and usually says that the bed is made, and the ability to sleep on it. Like most old songs the remained, sad and remorseful, holding her hand. The next song is well on schedule, and it\u2019s a beautiful song about how someone\u2019s life is lit. Dido\u2019s voices are managed electronically to increase the complexity of the song, with exaggeration and singing. This pop song is bright and friendly and has a catchy beat combined to make it one of the best songs on CD radio. This song is likely to appear in movies, if they haven\u2019t already. Returning to the melancholy rock is \"Honesty OK.\" The theme is sadness and a sense of the need to share life with someone. There\u2019s a very beat song that shows some of the ship-hop effects, though none of the sounds. This song takes depression to an emotional side. \u201cSlide\u201d is on Sade\u2019s mind. The beautiful vocal cords and the vocal style are reminiscent of some of Sade\u2019s music. Again Dido\u2019s voice is responsible for the song and theme, addressing mistakes and problems in daily life. The electronic touch is minimized and supported and gives a unique and distinctive feel. The drums have a bit of an island beat, but are similar to some of Sade\u2019s music. However, the transmission of this song is to Dido. The ninth way is melancholic, but the song avoids the level of maudlin to give it an interesting listening experience. \u201cIsobel\u201d is about love, regret and quiet resentment. It\u2019s amazing that Dido can use someone\u2019s love more in the process, but that\u2019s where the finds the strength to keep going. hard to do right. The words are interesting and well presented. However, it seems the sound system is Dido\u2019s responsibility which seems to be having a hard time keeping up with the devices. Given the strength of the other songs on this CD we know it has potential, so it\u2019s a theory rather than a fact. The result is that the sound of this song is one of the weak one on this CD. Dido is recreating herself loudly and vocally \"My Life.\" Dido might using this song with regret, as if the\u2019s breaking up with someone because the has so many differences that the has to make up for something the does\u2019t want to do. Instead the said the does what the does because the is responsible for himself. The continuous beat is sure and beautiful and quiet music is played. This song also seems to reflect Dido\u2019s true personality, which can be seen in previous songs. Perhaps this song also encourages everyone to criticize this music, advising everyone that it\u2019s the music the is and the does\u2019t care what anyone says. which they greatly enjoyed. When you are overly in love with someone there can be no lie because the emotion is clearly visible; a wonderful and beautiful song with a quick checkmate that expresses the depth of love can be achieved. The music and vocals of this song are powerful to show the power of the artist\u2019s love. Listen to this album without interruption, because these songs are emotional and complex. The music is beautiful, the lyrics are well written. A few minutes weakness is heavier than the strength of the rest of the songs. This great album is for lovers of Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B.

A. The concert was an eighty's celebration that included The Cure, Duran Duran, Echo and the Bunnymen, Violent Femmes, Psychedelic Furs, along with many other classic alternative bands. A few new bands had sets in between the bigger well known facts. One of those was Hot Hot Heat, who I entirely hated. As my friend and I were talking about how we really did't like this wave of new bands being pushed, we heard something interesting coming from the stage. That was the sound of Interpol. The irony was wonderful. My friend and I both stopped talking, and really got into the music. The next day I ordered the album. I'm sorry to do this again because I know this comparison has been made to death, but honestly, the first thought I had when I heard this band was \"Wow, that guy sounds like Ian Curtis\" (of Joy Division). I guess this bothers some so-called JD purists, but I really enjoyed it. Ian Curtis hung himself over twenty-five years ago! So I, for one, am happy to have another vocalist around with such a characteristic voice. At least the does't sound like those whitney guys from The Strokes, Jet, for The Hives! When this CD arrived in the email, I was very pleased. The voice is where the comparison to Joy Division stops. The music has it's own character, and the delivery and content of the lyrics have a totally different message. These guys write very thick songs, with a lot going on. On the surface a few people have complained that all of Interpol's songs sound the same. When the volume in turned up and the listener pays attention, they can really hear the complexity of the rhythm section, and the great rhythm guitar work. No, this in't Radiohead for Sonic Youth, but I don't think they're trying to be. This is a straight ahead rock band, and they do it very well.

Eve just simply commands respect on this album. Tracks like \"Let This Go,\" \"Satisfaction\" and \"Neck Bones\" let you know she is not to be messed with. Attention all other female wrappers: Don't pick up the open for the microphone unless you are one hundred% sure you can spit comparable to Eve. The \"Ruff Ryder's' First Lady\" has always displayed a certain sense of class and grace not found in work by certain other female wrappers. Eve had broadening her talent in music and she has't been restricting herself to the same old Hip-Hop beats and chi hats. \"Eve-olution\" clearly proves that. She rhymes on beats different from the usual wrap beats and she does it well. Her collaborations with Swizzbeatz, Dr. Dre, The Lox, Truth Hurts, Alicia Keys, and others help this album come on top. The first collaboration with Dr. Dre on the album is 'What' and the beat sounds like one taken off the chronic and is a typical Dr. Dre beat good all the same and it matches perfectly with Eve's rhyming skill. \"Party in the brain\" produced by Swizz beat is something new completely. It will probably take a few listens in order for you to get used to it. It's good though because it portrays Swizz beat broadening imagination via music creation and also shows Eve to have an ability to rhyme on even the weirdest beats. \"Gangsta Loving\" no doubt is one of the best but probably the best tune on this album is \"Double R What\" where Eve craps alongside Fellow Ruff Ryder's Jadakiss and Styles, but my personal favourite would be \"Figure You Out\" because of the smooth rhythms she throws with Teflon is really nice. Eve can seriously hold it down on her own if she choose to. The issues she speaks of varied topics---love, jealousy, and hope, but the album is not preachy and does not take itself too seriously. From the intro to the send the songs from this album are strong and year catching. It's perfect for a partying, starting out your weekend for evening off right.

But a person should smoke in order to start anything. Great. A metaphor and a specific meaning. The national anthem of the Bonecrusher is not only a fist, but it has exploded. It is a global phenomenon. They pump water over the North and West Coast for Canada. His iconic \"KING KONGGGGG!\" made for him because this person is ready to take your city and crush anyone in this way. This person has a lot of charisma, and uses strong beats and a contagious chorus to play a better role, but only a measure of the songs. But this is not bad for me, because the power is the music you can ride, the music you can participate in, the music you can participate in, the music you can fight. Except for \"It's Not Scary\" Although the next one should definitely be Grippin The Grain. Just hitting a gangster, and the introduction is worthless. It will definitely make a noise. Do not think that this album is the best national anthem. The verb \"hate\". Goodie Mob (YES Goodie Mob) can be said to be the best song on the album.

I first came to know them from their contribution to the Hunger Games soundtrack, Abraham's Daughter, which was one of the best tracks on the cd. The first thing that struck me about Reflektor was all the lyrical imagery and references to not only the classic Orpheus myth but the film Black Orpheus as well. I won't bog you down with the details of the tale, but treat yourself to a quick refresh to help frame the context of the songs. Even if you don't, the album remains quite enjoyable. The entire album keeps a seventies-ish, riding-the-cusp-of-disco savant-garde groove to it and the never-present reverb and other assorted dissonant sounds mixed in are kind of like how Portishead used to do. Reflektor brought to mind classic efforts from bands like The Clash, Norman Greenbaum and even the Beatles among others. Some highlights:The title track, Reflektor, is fun to listen to, if a little long- built off a steady beat and bassline you can easily get with. Flashbulb Eyes- a little surfer-style rhythm guitar, snare drums, some FX. but all I can really say is you're gonna love the old stool reggae bass running through this one. Here Comes the Nighttime- an absolute slice of Black Orpheus there. Its ska-styled bass and keyboard bottom, filtering, xylophone, and isolated guitar riff absolutely revoke images of strutting down the street during carnival somewhere, especially when the tempo shifts- the bassline carries the whole thing. Awesome. Normal Person- off to a fun start with some nightclub dialogue before switching to a true classic style; bass, rhythm guitar and drum with some piano included. And the the lyrics were fun. All told it not only reminded me of David Bowie in this prime but kinda White Stripe-y as well. Joan Of Arc- very Norman Greenbaum-ish there, and not just for the quasi-religious overtones of the lyrics. There's a definite Spirit in the Sky thing going on there. Here Comes the Nighttime two- any song that incorporates them old Dolby Digital tones used at the start and send of cassette tapes is alright with me! The lyric structure and synth arrangement there are eerily reminiscent of the Beatles' A Day In The Life. Check it out and see if you agree. It's Never Over (Oh, Orpheus)- slowly builds up from hairy synth into a bass\/bottom rhythm, soon followed by a great drum\/guitar combo. The lyrics are wholly derived from the Orpheus myth (. just wait until it's over\/wait until it's through. no turning 'round too soon). And that's a nice pulse beat bridge dropped in before coming back to the instruments. Supersymmetry- wholly a keyboard composition, the half-whispered lyrics of the duet strikes yet another chord, this time the Rolling Stone's Emotional Rescue. Even the chorus is done in a similar vein. You might think I'm calling this album derivative, but I'm not. I rather enjoyed the trip down memory lane it provided- intentionally for not.

My first encounter with them was their contribution to the first song of The Hunger Games, Abraham's daughter, this is one of them things stand out that. Songs on CD About Reflector, the first thing that impresses me is all the pictures of songs and references not only in the ancient myths of Orpheus but also in the movie Black Orpheus. I can\u2019t let you fall into the details of the story, but let yourself refresh yourself quickly to help build the origin of the song. Even if you don't, this album is still very interesting. The whole album retains the style of the seventys, rides a discard of savant-garde style, unprecedented repetition, and some conflicting sounds mixed together, similar to what Portishead did before. Reflektor reminiscent of ancient works according to teams like Clash, Norman Greenbaum and the Beatles. The song Reflektor sounds very interesting, if you can easily find a stable beat and bass line, it will be a long time. Flashbulb Eyes would love to walk in this old reggae bass chair Night is there - there is definitely a piece of black Orpheus. His style of ska bass and subtitle board, filter, xylophone and various guitar upgrades. During the festival, especially when the rhythm changes - the bass line carries the whole thing. the bass, the rhythm of the guitar and the drums, including the piano And its catchy lyrics. All in all, it not only reminds me of David Bowie in the golden years, but it also reminds me of white stripes. Joan of Arc \u2014 mostly Norman Greenbaum \u2014 exists, not just because of the religious color of the words. There is a clear wind blowing in the sky. Two come at night - any song with old Dolby Digital sounds used at the beginning of the tape and when sent will be good for me! The word structure and synthesizer arrangement are reminiscent of Life Day by the Beatles. See if you agree. Never Ending (Oh, Orpheus) - Slightly builds up from a wooden synthesizer to a bass \/ bass rhythm, and then a big drum \/ guitar. The lyrics of the song come from the Orpheus myth altogether (wait for it \/ wait for it to send. Don't turn around immediately). Before you return to the device, this is a good pulse hit bridge. Super symmetrical \u2014 is a completely keyboard music, the lyrics of the duet\u2019s semi-low-voiced song hit something else, this time the emotional rescue of the Rolling Stones. Even the chorus is made in the same way. You may think that this album I call the album is out of it, but I am not. I prefer to go with a memory-supportive memory channel - no intentionally. Even if they quote references from other groups, as they do with Greek mythology, I have no complaint. All of this is very good and brings new fans.","overall":4,"summary":"Mythical Music","unixReviewTime":1383004800,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2013"}

The first thing that struck me about the Reflector was all the pictures of the songs and references not only the usual Orpheus legends but also the Black Orpheus movie. I won\u2019t bother with the details of the story, but treat yourself quickly to help structure the songs. Even if you don\u2019t, the album will still be enjoyable. The whole door holds the seventies, riding-the-cusp-of-disco savant-garde groove with him and the endless sounds and different mixed sounds are similar to what Portishead did. Reflector keeps in mind the typical efforts of teams like Clash, Norman Greenbaum and even the Beatles and others. Important and important thing: The title track, Reflector, is fun to listen to, the longer it is built into a consistent beat and bassline you can easily adapt. Flashbulb Eyes- is a surfer-type guitar, strap drums, pretty FX. but all i can really say is you love the old reggae bass that goes through there ann. Here is the night-complete Orpheus Black there. The bass style and low key keyboard, filter, xylophone, and isolated guitar completely eliminate street -drawn images during a carnival avenue, especially when the tempo -bassline -changes altogether. Amazing. Ordinary people - start having fun with a little conversation outside at night before moving on to a more normal and real form; Bass, rhythmic guitar and drums including piano. And the words are fun. They all told me that not only did David Bowie remind me of this idea but also White Stripe-y. Joan Of Arc- you\u2019re Norman Greenbaum-ish there, and not just religious monuments of words. There is a certain spirit in heaven, and it is moving. Here\u2019s to Night of Two - Any song that adds the old Dolby Digital sound used to start and send recordings is great for me! The alpine structure and synth arrangement there is very reminiscent of Beatles Day of Life. Check and see if you agree. Never ending. The words are entirely derived from the myth of Orpheus (just wait for it to finish \/ wait for it to finish. As for the keyboard composition, the half -hearted words of the duet hit another puzzle, this time in Rolling Stone\u2019s Emotional Rescue. Even though the chorus was made with the same root.

The title track, Reflector, is fun to listen to, a bit old with a strong rhythm and bass line. A split guitar riff completely removes images of movement on the road during a carnival somewhere, especially when the tempo changes - the bass line takes everything. Other highlights: The title track, Reflector, is fun to listen to, if the song is built with a long strong rhythm and bass line that you can easily find. Never Ended (O, Orpheus) - Gradually formed from hairy synth to bass \/ low rhythm, followed soon by drum \/ guitar. Supersymmetry - The full name of the keyboard, the words of the whisper in half of the couple using another song, this time the emotional rescue of Rolling Stone. I asked him to help me with the music for Hunger Games, Daughter of Abraham, which was one of the best songs on the album.
