6584,"This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring this `vision' to the screen. He has done it with `Batman', `Sleepy Hollow' and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo). Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership. The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. During the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's America was struggling to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms. It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal. In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify this intelligence to a species the considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious. Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties. This is Apes for Dummies. It is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. The `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `I know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent. The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding (though I continue to dislike this dark look). However, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script. The story has been reduced to a monster movie. The humans band together behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous Apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoat (notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari). The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality. The acting is mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a fine factor who is simply miscast in this role. Walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong. This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant factor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable. She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a across between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager. Then there is Tim Roth. His is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin. Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade. He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time. Additionally, this physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists. This film is a great disappointment. It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. I rated it a three/ten. From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a nine/ten. However the story is an insult to the original franchise. It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius the is. Of course it's true, but it would be great if the used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.",negative

6584,"This movie is another film in which director Tim Burton tried to use a common theme to bring this ""idea"" to the screen. Completed ""Batman"", ""Sleepy Valley"" and current work. This is not a problem. The only thing that is consistent with the original version is that it has a talking monkey (Charleton Heston made a cameo). Burton rearranged the whole story and played it for today's popular levels. The first Monkey planet was the product of that era. In one thousand, nine hundred and sixty, the United States worked hard to redefine its culture. It was a time of turmoil for rethinking and rethinking local customs. During human rights, historically marginalized groups demand equal treatment. In this context, POTA is a metaphor, reflecting the chaos of philosophy that plagued the audience at the time. POTA is a very clever movie. By allowing white people to express this wisdom in a way that is considered inferior, it poses a problem and subtly puts American society under pressure. Dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charlton Heston), Drs. Cornelius (Rody McDowell) and Dr. Zilla (Jim Hunter) are thought-provoking, intelligent, and humorous. Burton's version is a modern product, just as POTA is a one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys product. This is a stupid monkey. It is absurd and irrelevant, replacing intellectual dialogue with politically correct adjectives, focusing more on form than objects. The ""Unexpected"" ending is not fully adjusted, and there is no contribution to the movie without suspicion of stopping further progress. While the send of the original POTA combines all of the content into a powerful space, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, saying, ""I know what you don't know, you'll have to wait for something to come"" from a technical point of view, like the Burton movie, the movie is outstanding. The shading is good, and Burton’s photography is great (though I still don’t like this darkness). However, thirty-three years of progress in prosthetic makeup cannot do this without the insult. This story has been narrowed down to a monster movie. The people rallied behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) and fought fearsome monkeys with the help and influence of other divers (especially Ali, played by Helena Bonham Carter). The show shows a simple and easy way, it is very violent, very good for the fast food mindset today. Acting skills are not equal. Mark Wahlberg is a good thing, the played this mistake by mistake. Wahlberg is very good at playing black, depressed, bullied but strong characters. The section is looking for an inspiring hero, a character who is not on the Wahlberg register. Helena Bonham Carter (Helena Bonham Carter) is an outstanding factor, her character is far below her ability, so this breakup is a funny one. He desperately wanted to do something about this weak man, but this description was like a contradiction between a peaceful university overseer and a sick youth. Then there was Tim Rose. He is an factor who has delivered with this hand a movie to complete destruction. Like the wicked General Thad, Rose is very hateful. He created one of the worst atrocities in my memory. In addition, this type of body movement is the most advanced, making chimpanzees the perfect combination, so that people almost believe in the existence of this type. This movie is very disappointing. This is a dignified pleasure, if you look at your mind at the door. I gave it three points / ten. From an artistic point of view, it’s much better than that, maybe nine/ten. However, this story is an insult to the first franchise. This is just another Burton's attempt to elevate himself, using a common theme to draw an audience to the box office, so that more people can see what this genius is all about. Yes this is true, but it would be good for them to use this talent to make more movies instead of sensible paps that are easy to use in bulk.",negative
6584,"This is one of the efforts of film director Tim Burton who uses a common theme to bring this 'idea' to the screen. You called it 'Batman', 'Sleepy Hollow' and now it's done. This is not a repetition. The only thing that remains the same is that the Siemens are table to speak (and Charlton Heston made a cameo). Burton recreated the whole story, drowning out the views of most people today. The first Apes planet was a product of its time. Over the millennium, nine hundred and sixty Americans struggled to redefine their civilization. It was a difficult time finding the soul and rethinking social norms. This was a time of civil rights when parties were long regarded as inferior and demanded to be treated equally. In this context, Pota was symbolic, reflecting the philosophical turmoil facing the audience at the time. POTA was a very clever film that raised difficult questions and carefully portrayed the pressures of American society, representing a so-called inferior white man. The valley between Colonel Taylor (Charlton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Rudy McDowell) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was considered mindful and cunning with hidden and obvious tools. Burton's version is a modern-day product because the grandson was sixty years old. This is a monkey for dummies. It is superficial and ridiculous, embodies the true political issues of intelligent dialogue and focuses on form rather than content. The result of ""Surprise"" is completely opposite and it gives the film nothing but the setting of the next film. Although the send of the original puppet put everything in one powerful place, Burton's ending made fun of the audience, sarcastically saying, ""I know what you don't know, and another poem to stop you. We have to wait. "" From a technical point of view, as always with Burton's film. The design is fun and Burton's camera work is great (although I still dislike this dark look). However, thirty-three years of progress in artificial construction cannot afford the astonishing script. The story is limited to the movie Beast. After Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), people gathered to fight the giant monkeys, with the help and support of a few turncoat (especially Helena Bonham Carter as Arie). Presentation is a simple and easy way to deal with a lot of violence, which is great to consider in today's fast food. Imitation is mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a good character who is simply misguided in this role. Wahlberg specializes in playing black, angry characters who are painful but powerful. This section requires an inspiring hero, a non-profiling profile in Rehlberg's collection. Helena Bonham Carter is a great character whose character is far below the ability to say that cutting is funny. He tries this best to do something about the loose character, but this interpretation presents him as falling in love with a college peacemaker and a sick young man. Then there's Tim Roth. His virtuoso work, which saves the film from ruin. Ruth hates the devil like the tyrant General Thad. You create the worst and most despicable people I can never remember. In addition, there is a lot of physical activity, which makes the chimpanzee a perfect environment for anyone to think that this breed exists. This movie is very disappointing. It's fun, as long as you look your brain in the door. I rated it three / ten times. From a technical point of view, it is much better, maybe nine / ten. However, this story is an insult to the first franchise. This is just another Burton's attempt, using a common theme to attract a crowd at the box office so that more people can see what is easy.

6584,"This is another film where director Tim Burton tried to take advantage of a popular title to bring this ""theory"" to the screen. He did ‘Batman’, ‘Sleepy Hollow’ and now this one. This is not a reform. The only thing they have is it has a speaking simian (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo). Burton rearranged the whole story, watering the large audience today. The original planet Apes was a product of its time. During the Thousand, Nine Hundred and Sixty America struggled to redefine its civilization. It is a confusing time for self-examination and rethinking of social norms. This is a time of civil rights and groups that have long felt humiliated to be asked to be treated equally. At that point, POTA is figurative, reflecting the philosophical crisis facing the audience that day. POTA was a very clever film that posed tough questions and elegantly captured the oppression of American society to investigate by clarifying the white man to this kind of intelligence that was considered inferior. Dialect between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) is both provocative and clever with both subtle and clear jokes. The Burton brand is as productive today as POTA was in the sixties. This is Apes for Dummies. He’s a skinhead and jejune, changing the right policy into smart conversation and committed in a way that’s more content. The “surprising” ending is inconsistent and nothing is added to the film other than the rock that sets the series. While the ending of the original POTA politely put it all together in a strong setting, Burton’s ending just taunts the audience, taunts him, `` I know something you don’t know, and you have to wait for the series to find out ""From a technical point of view, as always happens in a Burton film, the film is very good. The decoration is amazing and the Burton cameras are very good (although I still hate this dark scene). However. , thirty-three years of progress in the make-up can not pay the insulting text.

Mix acting. Mark Wahlberg is a beautiful element that is easily mistaken page al this. Walberg is great at playing dark, boring characters who are suffering but strong. This section requires an inspiring hero, a character not found in Wahlberg’s book. Helena Bonham Carter is a beautiful element whose character is far below her potential and the cut is ridiculous. He desperately tries to do something about the aggressive nature, but this interpretation presents it as a gap between a peaceful protest in college and the love of the sick youth. Then there’s Tim Roth. He is a virtuoso performer, who alone saves the film from total destruction. Roth hates it like the evil General Thade. He creates one of the ugliest and ugliest things I can remember for a moment. In addition, this physical action is very high, making human digestion perfect for anyone who can almost believe the species exists. This film is a big disappointment. It’s pure pleasure, until you check your mind at the door. I rated it three. Technically it's better, maybe nine / ten. However the story is an insult to the original auction. It’s another attempt by Burton to be arrogant, using a familiar title to attract a lot of people to the box office so a lot of people can see what makes sense. Of course this is true, but it is better if that ability is used to produce concrete films, than the creative pope prepared for mass use.",negative

At least sixty movies you can laugh at how included plastic animal suit. However it was’t as bad as the sixty scary movies so it did’t get the comedy appeal. Sure, you have payroll reviewers who offer brilliant reviews and vote heavily for these disgusting jones but it’s easy to tell who the sellers are.",negative
11771,"What would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having this bachelor party with some of this closest friends at a Hawaiian guy bar?

What would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of this finance? A new low, right? Well Paul Coleman, played comically by Jason Lee, leads this experience of a nauseous blur and a new low. I got to say this is one of this good leading roles. However I do believe this role in Vanilla Sky was better acted. His finance named Karen is played by the up-and-down actress Selma Blair while Karen's character, Becky, is played by the lovely and talented Julia Stiles.

I longed for a movie and feared that reading it would take away my enjoyment of watching it. If I haven't read the book, this movie can be confusing and indescribable. The best part of the book was not released from the movie and the characters were weak because Hatsumo (Lee Gong) was the worst. Forget the movie and read the book. I did't expect the movie to be so bad. The film's plot outline states that ""Neta Severi tells how she runs her fishing business."" UP AT THE VILLA, a beautiful but shallow piece, one of which was created for the sole purpose of reading Oscar nominees for beautiful dresses. Design and partial guidance (also welcome for a film and a scoring). It has the same basic concept that occurs thousands of times each year from pieces that are made: a beautiful, intelligent woman trying to find love in a place she does't know. He faces many difficulties but in the send finds happiness in the hands of a man who has not achieved it. In this case, your wife is in Florence shortly before World War II. She is an English widow who is engaged to a rich but old man (who obviously does not love her). One day she meets another man, who has a bad reputation but falls in love with her. She certainly has a friend who will help her with the evil and a third man - who commits suicide when, in the woman's room, the puts her in a dangerous situation. Guess how the story ends. ? UP at the Villa is not a bad movie. I was always interested in the subject, but I was not happy. The problem is not the small space but the screenplay. Taken from the novel, it should be somewhat spicy, interesting, twisted and suspicious. Whenever you think the story will get hot, it gets cold again. If you think there is a conspiracy to involve a Florence police officer, fine, but that does't change much. It just kept going, still an unexpected ending. Like I said, UP UP EVILLA is not bad. If it's a little soft, she's never been happy and she loves it. The process is half and half, but it is definitely convincing. Kirsten Scott Thomas made a really bad choice after becoming an ISIZULU patient. The villa is undoubtedly better than these pieces and Kirsten is better, but she can do more. Sean Penn is as good as never, though this character is a great doctor. Anne Bancroft is an amazing character (Graduate, My God!), And there she does't let her character become a joke. Now, the supporting stuff is so bad (Jeremy Davis is angry soooooooooooo!). Guidance is good, but it does't make sense. It was interesting to know that the director was similar to Engels & Lucky (who also plays Kirsten Scott Thomas), another drama of the time, but even more daring. Important where content exists. Florence is amazing, the dress is beautiful, the beauty of the place, the music. In the post, UP AT The VILLA is a love drama in the middle, but then it could have been much better. It looks and feels great, but don't expect a dubious movie - it's not! This kind of film fails because it wants some mystery, some will see it. However, not much is said because of the shallow screen. Now, don't worry about the Oscar nominations - you'll get them.",negative
18828,"When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel turned film, I was intrigued. Being a fan of the book, I assumed she'd be playing Tony, Roz, for Charis, but more so, I was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head-y, almost psychological (but not psychological thriller) novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who than't read the novel, and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had. The book is a complex reflection of society, women, and modern life, and I was interested to see how they used the three different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film. What they actually did was a crime. The biggest error and confusing issue is: Why would Oxygen, a network that advertises as being for women, take an amazing book about how complex, wonderful, and terrible women are and can be, and change the protagonist from three women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story? It seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask Roz, Tony, and Charis about how they knew Zenia and in doing that, they brushed through bulk of the book. In doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it, aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with. In the film, these women karen't people, they are characters. In the book Zenia does fake her death, but the book mentions it to get this point across, while the film wastes thirty-forty-five minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use. They tried to make this complex book an episode of Law and Order for CSI. It turns out that Mary Louise Parker played Zenia, which was SO wrong. Zenia is a Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, for maybe even a Scarlett Johnasson type. She is a woman men can't not adore, and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by, but in a ""keep your enemies closer"" kind of way. And once she gets closer, she seems totally genuine and trust worthy, despite your better judgment. She's the kind of woman who, even when she closes, she wins: she's always still beautiful, still rich, and there are always still people out there who don't know her game. In the film, Zenia did't take Charis's man (the blonde American draft dodger who was using Charis in the first place. ) but instead took August and tried to become her legal guardian (and apparently came back to be her Lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies). And Zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with August, but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed. It's was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book, but I think had I not read the book, I would have spent the whole movie confused, if I had bothered to stick with it at all. And Roz's husband was dead before Zenia came in to the picture (which was weird since Zenia took Roz's business AND home life in the book, which is why Roz hated her so much) and she and Zenia had conspired to kill Roz's husband years and years back. And according to the film Tony and West had been dating forever. even at the party where Zenia and West (in the book) had painted the whole place black and they made Tony seem like this totally with it (and evil, bitchy) person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it. Tony's character was SO wrong in this film. she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky, mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book. The film basically implied smart women are evil, beautiful women are evil, powerful women are evil, and women who teach yoga are off their rockers. They basically tried to make it so Zenia was't necessarily as awful as she was in the book, and then, in the send, the three women convince this former cop (who, of course in the process of researching this, meets Zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to send with them moving to Barbados for something ridiculous, which of course Zenia bails on) to hide Zenia's body (which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at, but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony, for they conspired together to do it. ) and then Zenia also managed to take all of Roz's money in the process. By the send of the film I was only half paying attention between commercials of/c it had aspirated so far out in space from what it could and should have been. If you karen't confused by this breakdown of the film, then maybe you would like it, because I have read the book and seen the movie, and from the movie alone I am ridiculously confused. It was terrible. I get that making a film out of that book is quite a task, but if you are going to take on the task, you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary, instead of creating some useless character to be your Alice in wonderland.

18828,"When I saw Mary Louise Parker related to this film taken from an epic novel, I was very interested. As a fan of this book, I thought you were going to play Tony and Rhodes in Charis, but most importantly, I would like to know how they put together this very interesting, almost psychological (but not psychological) novel turned into an understandable movie. for those who do not read novels, which will at least satisfy those who have read novels. This book is a complex picture of society, women and modern life. I would like to know how they used the three narratives to tell the story in the film. What they were doing was committing a crime. The biggest mistake and confusing question is: why Oxygen, a network advertising women, can hold an amazing book about how tough, amazing and scary women are, and change the protagonist from three women to a stupid predecessor who has no real motivation to participate. the story? Apparently no matter who changed it, by using this person to directly ask Roz, Tony and Charis how they got to know Zenia, this seemed easy to resolve. In doing so, even though they confuse the story and cut off all the benefits of the characters in it, without leaving the audience without a reliable connection. In the film, these women are human, but not characters. Zenia made the impression of her death in the book, but it is mentioned in the book to convey this, and the film spent three hundred and forty-five minutes, focusing on the former police officer running around, useless. They are trying to make this difficult book a part of CSI Law and Order. Apparently Mary Louise Parker played Zenia, which was wrong. Zenia is Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, and possibly Scarlett Johnasson. You are a woman who can help but praise you, a woman who is attractive and threatened, but in a way that ""draws your enemies closer"". When you are close, even though your sentence is better, you seem more honest and trustworthy. She’s the kind of woman who can succeed even if she closes the door: she’s always beautiful, rich, and there are always people who don’t understand her game. In the movie, Zenia did not remove Charles' husband (using Charles's blonde American Dodgers first.) Instead, she took August to try to be her legal guardian (and apparently came back to be her sex lover) at a coffee shop). Zenia killed the chicken before she left in August, but because all the collections had been removed, there was no reason. It’s as if the script writer is holding the straw to please those who have read the book, but I think I have never read this book and would be confused throughout the movie, if I bothered to stick to it all. . And before Zenia appeared, Rhodes' husband was already dead (which is strange, because Zenia took Rhodes' life and family life in a book, that's why Rhodes hated her so much) and she and Zenia plotted to kill Rhodes' husband many years ago. According to the film Tony and West were dating. Even at the party, Zenia and West (in the book) paint all over the black area, making Tony look like this person (cruel, bitch), always because of him His wisdom is respected by everyone and loved for it. Tony's role is wrong in this movie. He seems a little crazy, like the plotter of this conspiracy, rather than a dull, regular teacher reading a book. This movie basically means that smart women are cruel, beautiful women are cruel, powerful women are cruel, and women who teach yoga are rock and roll. They basically tried to make Zenia not look as bad as in the book. Then, in the transfer, the three women confirmed to the former police officer (of course, in the process of investigating the matter, the met Zenia and fell in love with her.) They had to move to Barbados with them on bail) to hide Zenia's body (they found the body in the hotel where she was staying, but the film showed that one of the three women pushed her away. on the balcony because they had conspired to do so.) With the distribution of the movie, I have only considered half of the pc commercials, which are already far away from where they should be and should be in place. If you are not confused about the demolition of this movie, you will probably like it, because I have read this book, watched a movie, and I feel funny in the movie alone. it will be very frightening. I know making a movie with that book is hard work, but if you want to take on this job, you should first decide what content in the book is unnecessary, instead of creating other useless characters to be Alice Dreaming in Wonderland. Is there really no longer a flexible book that allows Oxygen to make at least half of a good TV movie?",negative

Used to Tony's situation was wrong with this film. He looked like a mentally disturbed man, and as the mastermind of the conspiracy, it contradicted the kind, gentle-speaking teacher in the book. The film claims that smart bad women, good bad women, strong bad women, and women who teach yoga are no longer working.

As they do this despite the twisting of the story and cutting out everything that is good for the characters in it, other than doing it so that the viewers have no trustworthy person to relate to. In the film, these women are not human, they are actresses. Zenia’s book denies her death, but the book mentions getting to this point, as the film closes thirty -five minutes by focusing this former police officer around and using nothing.

It showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters. Because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience, and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government, who you can not sympathise with.

Presented this year as the Cannes “Un Cer Consideration” Selection, it is also the Swedish entry for two thousand and seven Best Foreign Oscars. It’s hard to say what Bergman would think, but Andersson worked with him; He is known for these high-profile TV commercials, some of which can be seen on YouTube. Bergman called it ""the best ads in the world."" It will be interesting to see if this director, whose approach is as tricky as this theory, will start working on the long section over time.

All of this makes the film more accurate for the person who uses it to learn about racism. As observers, we should criticize the way colourful history is presented. As I said before, you become more empathetic with students - it makes you less trustworthy and purposeful. Also, it changes some information from other accounts. There was an uproar in Sarafina when a police officer broke into their classrooms and shot the students. Police and soldiers were very aggressive in the Soviet Union, but this was probably an exaggeration. Police and the army shot the students, but there is no evidence that they went to school and killed people like that. The war was raging in the streets. This is done in movies. You may feel more sympathy for the students of the school. This film will be very useful if it contains various details about racism. The teacher was arrested for opposing the government, and the mother had to work in a white house. But there is no information about the government and why they were doing this to get information about racist policies and laws. - by George S., Chris and Finlay Show. Because you see them as real characters, you love them as much as the audience. In Surfina, the students' clothing is very similar to the clothes shown in the Soviet photo, which makes them more accurate in many respects.",positive

'Man About The House' was also a flat-sharing sitcom and iran from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three-seventy-six. It was the brainchild of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular sitcom 'Father Dear Father'. When it ended, they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times. In the first episode, Chrissy ( Paula Wilcox ) and Jo ( Sally Thomsett ) are tidying their Myddleton Terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath. He is Robin Tripp ( Richard O'Sullivan ), a Southampton cookery student of no fixed abode. While this clothes dry out, the puts on a ladies' dressing gown and prepares them a meal.

C.-two's 'I Love one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three', shown in two thousand, Julie Burchill claimed that 'House' showed her a way of life she envied. She was not alone. One of the most iconic ( for me, anyway ) images of 'seventy's British television was Sally Thomsett coming out of the London Underground carrying a parasol, and a 'blind' man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past. A man living with two girls was a risqueé subject for the time, but Mrs. Mary Whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar, it was innocent, good-natured fun. Mortimer and Cooke's scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it. Richard O'Sullivan was still playing 'Bingham' in I. T. V.'s 'Doctor In Charge' when this got started. In fact the second run of 'In Charge' overlapped with the first of 'House'. He was born to play the sex-mad Robin. Paula Wilcox's 'Chrissy' was more streetwise than 'Beryl', her character she played in 'The Lovers', while Sally Thomsett's 'Jo' was a lovable dizzy blonde. As time wore on, the became almost like an older brother to them. For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as the warring Ropers. George had lost interest in sex, but Mildred had not. They went on to their own show - the aptly titled 'George & Mildred'. The late Doug Fisher was good value as as Robin's wideboy friend Larry. He worked so well the was made into a regular. Within a year of its debut, there was the inevitable movie spin-off. I am not a big fan of the 'Man About The House' movie because I think it was stretched to fit the big screen. Most of its characters had never appeared in the series. The format was sold to America, where it became the long-running 'Three's Company' starring the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was far more suggestive than the British original, with Somers often seen in sexy clothing. After six seasons, 'House' ended with Chrissy marrying Robin's older brother Norman ( Norman Eshley ). Fans were devastated to see Robin failing to get the girl the loved, but there was some consolation in the fact that the too landed this own show - 'Robin's Nest'.",positive

C.-two's ""The Love One Thousand Seventy-Three"", haired in two thousand, Julie Burchill said ""The House"" showed her the way of life she loved. He was not alone. One of the best (my) best British television shows in the ""seventys"" is Sally Thomsett from the London Underground with parasol, and the ""blind man"" to me I did a double shot when my ass was drooping. Living with a man and two girls was obscene at the time, but Mrs. Mary Whitehouse had no need to keep warm under the collar. Mortimer and Cooke's script was nearing completion. Richard O'Sullivan was still playing ""Bingham"" in I. T. V's ""Doctor in Charge"" in the beginning. In fact, the second cycle of ""responsibility"" combines with the first cycle of ""house"". He was born to play Robin. Paula Wilcox ""Chrissy"" is more of a street than ""Beryl"", her role in ""The Lovers"", and Sally Thomsett's ""Jo"" is a sweet and dizzy blonde. In time, they became almost brothers. To many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yusha Joyce stole the show as Roper fighting. George lost interest in sex, but Mildred did't. They have successfully continued their show called ""George and Mildred"". The late Doug Fisher is as important as Robin's friend Larry. He worked very well and was made a regular customer. In just the first year, the products from the movies really emerged. I'm not a big fan of the movie ""Man About the House"" because I think it's stretched out to fit the big screen. Most of its characters did not appear in the series. The format was sold in the United States, where it became a long-term “three-person” company with the late factor John Ritter and Susan Summers. It is more informative than the original British version, and Somers always wear attractive clothes. Six times later, ""House"" ended with Chrissy marrying Robin's brother Norman (Norman Ashley). Fans are shocked to see Robin fail to find the girl the loves, but in reality there is comfort, for they too are riding on their ""Lair Robin's"" shows.",positive
