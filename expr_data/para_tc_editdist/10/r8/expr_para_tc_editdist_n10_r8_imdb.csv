650,"People watch movies for a variety of different reasons. This movie did't have the big budget, there's no special effects, no car chases and there's no explosions. Actually reality does't have much of these either. At least not in my life. This is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since I'm neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain. So watch this movie for the characters. It is brim-full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk. Within the first three minutes Kiefer Sutherland enacts Detective Michael Hayden's life superbly and the keeps developing the character throughout the movie. Excellent acting, very believable. Henry Czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between this 'Harvey' and Kiefer's 'Mickey' enhances the oppositeness of their characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady, 'Mrs Ramsay', I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends!!! There's a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited there so watch the movie and enjoy them.",positive

650,"This movie has a limited budget, no special effects, no running cars, and no shots. This is a real movie about real people. They are not perfect in any way, but they are united in a situation where they learn to explore and accept different things, thus restoring order to chaos. I love the annoying homeowner ""Mrs. Ramsay"" so much. I believe she and my mother-in-law are good friends! ! ! There are many more amazing characters, but the space is limited, so watch a movie and enjoy it. In the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland (Kiefer Sutherland) interpreted brilliantly into the life of detective Michael Hayden (Michael Hayden) and continued to develop roles throughout the film. The dismissal of Henry Czerny could not be better, and the relationship between ""Harvey"" and ""Kiefer"" of ""Kiefer"" strengthens the opposition to their role.

I’m not ready to limit my psychological possibilities, because I’m not an expert and I don’t use my whole mind. Watch now this film by the factors. It was completely discharged full of funny people. For the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland made Investigator Michael Hayden this entire life and continued character development throughout the film. Great staff, very trustworthy. Henry Czerny could’t have been better thrown out and the relationship between ‘Harvey’ and ‘Mickey’ with Kiefer intensifies the rivalry between their factors.

2470,"Fiction film (it lists as based on a story though it does have a ""documented by"" credit) about a group of scientists going into the wilds of Canada to try and find a Bigfoot.(They want to capture one and then attach a tracking device). Its lots of scientific mambo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of people wandering around in the wilderness. There are some attempts at creating tension and scares, but to be perfectly honest there is nothing there worth seeing outside of some great looking shots of the wilds. This is a perfect definition of an exploitation film, it promises you so much, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it delivers very little. Recommended for insomniacs only",negative
2470,"suggested just for insomnia. It is only recommended for those who sleep, but it brings very little. Highlights examples of the kind of ignorance that perpetuates racism and includes references to ""Hill Cat"" and Irish immigrants who were also mistreated because of their race. The plot of the film is based on Richard Brooks' book ""The Brick Fox Hole"" while the victim was gay. Ironically, the issue of intolerance should be linked to intolerance by researchers who have said that in the screen version, the type of prejudice should be changed to anti-Semitism. Also surprising is the behavior of a soldier who is apparently proud of this military prowess against the Nazis but who accepts the hatred of the Jews. The film's director and producer also faced some form of intolerance after being acquitted after being summoned to appear before the House in American Activities Committee. All of these points seem to emphasize the strong and unshakable state of the whole problem of racism, as shown in this film. When Police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigated the murder of Joseph Samuels (Sam Leone), the found that on the night of the murder, Samuel was having fun with a group of soldiers and one of them, Corporal Arthur ""Mitch"" Mitchell. had lived. George Cooper was immediately identified as the main suspect. Further details were gathered at Montgomery (Robert Ryan), one of the soldiers present that night and a friend of Sergeant Kelly (Robert Macham) Mitchell. Kelly, with the help of other soldiers, then searched for Mitchell and when the was found, the heard the story of what happened on the night of the murder, including a meeting and dance with Jenny Tramine (Gloria Graham). Kelly helps Michelle escape capture and tries to identify the killer. Jenny Tremain has been questioned but the details are not enough to prove Mitchell's innocence. Led to the disclosure of the case. A movie with a message and the identity of the killer appear at the beginning of the story. The ""message"" is conveyed in a way that no doubt was appropriate for the occasion, but by today's standards it seems difficult. Jay Roy Hunt's cinematography is excellent with low-key lighting and careful use of many well-placed table lamps, including a retractable shape that fits perfectly with on-screen drama. Despite being a low-budget producer, ""Crossfire"" has been a huge success at the box office and has benefited from having an interesting and relevant story with amazing factors, two of which are Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan) and Best K Nominated for Academy Award Additional nominations from co-stars (Gloria Graham), Edward Demetrick (Best Director), Producer Adrian Scott (Best Image) and John Paxton (Best Writing, Modified Screenplay) are further proof of the film's identity.",negative
3718,"Comparing this movie to anything by Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I can say about it is it tries desperately to be like an Almodovar movie and fails miserably.

20058,"In my mind the best of the Ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time. The theme of workers of. management (with lots of talk of unions and rights) perhaps dates the film a bit now as it's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that does't stop ""White Suit"" from being a show stopping classic. The plot, about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil, does't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true Ealing comedy. The fabric repels dirt and can never wear out! The titular white suit that Alec Guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences, such as Guinness being table to use this indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall! The script itself is full of dry wit - ""Is the all right?"" ""Yes."" ""Pity."" - and characterisation is first rate. I'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well. Comedies of later eras would adopt a ""point the camera at the factors and let it roll"" mentality but the Ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations. This film is no exception. Of course, it's the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights. Alec Guinness gives a fantastically understated performance, with eyes that convey wonder, joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it. Stratton is a man oblivious to everything except this work. Such an insular character could quickly have become boring for irritating but Guinness effortlessly makes him likable, so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as Stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything the's never worked for. Joan Greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual, as are befuddled Cecil Parker and slimy Michael Gough; everybody gets laughs without even trying to. It's comical British understatement at its finest.""The Man in the White Suit"" is eighty-one minutes of sheer brilliance, with a great plot, great cast, sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism.

The plot, about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil, does't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true Ealing comedy. Such an insular character could quickly have become boring for irritating but Guinness effortlessly makes him likable, so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as Stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything the's never worked for. management (with lots of talk of unions and rights) perhaps dates the film a bit now as it's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that does't stop ""White Suit"" from being a show stopping classic.

The latest comedies will take the mind off ""pointing the lens at objects and letting it roll"", but Ealing movies are always trying to capture interesting light, angles and innovations.

Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast I picked the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage.

40686,"-That's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this film. I just saw this baby at the Munich Film Festival and it rocked the house. Director Doug Pray is never seen in this documentary, nor I think the is even heard, but the has done a very intimate look into the lives and history of the ""mixer."" He has segmented this film into about weight chapters and then this motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be spiced throughout according to what they are talking about. I was never big into ""scratching"" but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know little, and infusing in-jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area. Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys is in this film, but it was't until after the film that I could name several heavy hitters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q- Bert, etc).

The amazing games of Cher and Nicolas Cage (as usual) gently push the plot in one direction. The two organizations are in an out-of-the-box world, and the threat (in the traditional name) will never pass. Unfortunately, it is the basis of most Indian traditions. But why? What makes women hate traditions so much that women often suffer the most horrible tragedies, including rape, murder, infanticide, illiteracy, infidelity and spiritism. Women's name? the required level in the story. If you show a painful legend, the necessary sensitivity is not achieved, but aside Face the problem of abuse instead of dealing with the problem. Santoshi recently said the film was not made for the International Film Festival, but for the public in the country. Unfortunately, the cheesy is shown, and the film penetrates deep into the blood of good action Santoshi. The film is influenced by the location of the jerky plot, and its ending is a very well-made one. Compared to male athletes, female athletes are given friendships and broader features. The main character is dictatorially played by the great Manisa Koirala. One wonders if this video was created by an administrator with the proper purpose of designing and appreciating the problem at hand, you might be right. Mahima Choudhary's performance is commendable and the continues to show that the has untapped talent. Madhuri Dixit, who plays with Janki, has played with unprecedented interest and fun, and really deserves the title of ""working"". Among the canons of this singing and dancing roles, the role of street performers who find solace in alcohol and the promise of unborn children are the greatest risks. The final and most disturbing performance in this potential female legend is the talented Rekha performance. Lajja is a movie by Manisa Koirala. There is no doubt about it, but Rekha controls the entire process in the game. It penetrates your bones and sends a frightening echo to the vestibule of your heart. Rekha shines like Ramdulari, leaving something empty and careless, providing a play full of reality and originality, emotional nudity has become the score of this part of the movie. The comparison is really annoying, especially when you are face-to-face with one of the biggest heroes in the world, but before the beauty of this screen myth, everyone disappears into its shadow. """" Pinjar "", even celebrating the Queen of Hell"" Eat "": Has achieved the feminine goal of the first two minutes: Mahima rebuked her in-laws for abusing her father who did not commit any other crimes. Her grandmother saw her abuse in silence, and comforted her, ""Why are you crying?"" You have no reason to mourn. There is nothing wrong with that. My case. Not every woman's mistake is wrong. Who is in front of you, because if we had the courage to say what you said today in your time, there is no need for you to say anything today. ""In this scene, the importance of feminism is clearly evident in the text. Another subtle moment appears in the early stages of the film, when Vaidehi (Manisha) flees from her abusive husband to her parents' home in India. If an abusive woman seeks protection from her parents (family, business, children, etc.) complacent. She is not as human as a sign of family respect.

47771,"THE CHOKE (aka AXE in the UK) is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight-to-DVD movie. I say ""supposedly"" because the title of the movie does not have the ""V"" in brackets to indicate that it was a made for DVD movie (even though it does have the appearance of one). The plot is simple  a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one. I think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece, but this does not excuse the faults there. Even straight-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so-called ""so bad, they're good"" movies. However, THE CHOKE falls far short of being either a serious slasher (such as HALLOWEEN) for being a ""so bad it's good"" movie (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE). The movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill. The blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget. But, from there towards, it's downhill all the way. There are so many faults in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them. But, a few obvious jones stand out and I'll go into them. The aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around fifty people present but after the music stops, there seems to be only around weight people left (and yet they're all meant to be locked in!). The characters in this movie are not likable at all. Most of the band members are aggressive foul-mouthed morons for just downright weird. No one really cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they've been dispatched. The highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church (seriously!). He spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But sadly, even this presence can't save the movie. There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation. Around sixty-five minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking. Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in other straight-to-DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all. There are plenty of over-the-top outbursts (mainly from the male characters) and one nearly results in a full-blown fight. In fact, the format could be said to go as follows: characters walk around--murder takes place--characters walk around--murder takes place. You get the idea. The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the of-word being used. Perhaps this was meant to be funny, but it just comes off as sad. And more to the point, we have all seen this done a thousand times before (usually to much greater effect). The movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all. The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons. They make little attempt to get out of the factory for find a weapon with which to protect themselves. And much of the time, they don't even pretend to be scared. In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed (with the exception of the final murder when the killer's identity is revealed). A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. There is no one seen stalking the characters at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this served to make the film funny (unintentionally of course), but there it is not funny at all. And, as another reviewer has pointed out, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. The extras look uncomfortable dancing to it. The score (at the send, there is no music at the beginning!) consists of a band of Sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie. Don't misunderstand the points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classics (such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE thirteenTH). But, it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either. And even as straight-to-DVD movies go, this is a poor effort. On a positive note, the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes. But, when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes close their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion. Fans of the traditional one thousand, nine hundred and heights B-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE thirteenTH should do everything in their power to avoid it!",negative

47771,"CHOKE (also called AX in the UK) is a horror film called a direct DVD movie. I say ""presumed"" because the title of the movie does not have a ""V"" in the brackets to indicate that it is designed for a DVD movie (even if it has a profile). This is a simple plot - the band caught the game in a place that was made for meat production, and they were killed on their own. I think most people will agree that this movie will never be a work of part, but this would not be a false excuse there. Even a direct DVD movie such as the BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (with a very low IMDb standard) has many advantages and is sometimes considered one of the so-called ""worst, best"" movies. However, CHOKE is far from being a serious killer (like Halloween) because the movie is ""very bad, beautiful"" (like ""Nail Gun Massacre""). The start of the movie is really good, the character was killed by a drill. The impact of blood is very cheesy, but considering that the budget is very low, this is understandable. But from there, it went all the way down. CHANGE has many shortcomings, and I can spend the whole day talking about them. However, the clear Jones is visible, and I will read them in depth. The performance of the aforementioned band seems to have been about fifty people in the beginning, but after the music stopped, it seemed like only eight people were left (but all must be locked!). The characters in this movie are not fake at all. Most of the band members are violent, insulting idiots, because they are so weird. No one really cares about what happened to them, not even the so-called friends they forgot about after they were sent. The plot in this movie is about the presence of a homeless person who seems to treat the meat processing industry as a kind of church (deep!). He spit on very interesting lines for no reason. Unfortunately, even this presence cannot save the movie. There are so many displays of people coming and going, talking about the world, and no sign. Nearly sixty-five minutes of film is spent watching the characters walk away talking. The character disappeared for a long time without explanation. Like all movies directly on DVD such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time cursing each other without annoying. There were extreme explosions (especially from male characters), one that almost led to a full-scale battle. After all, it can be said in this form: character goes-kill happens-character goes-kill happens. the understood. The dialogue is awesome, it seems like saying a few lines without using a word. Maybe it was fun, but it came out of the spain. More importantly, we have seen this approach a thousand times before (usually the result is better). There is no doubt at all in this movie. The corpse is the only sign that the character is in danger. The madman runs around, but the character behaves like a complete fool. It is rare for them to try to leave the factory to look for protective equipment. In most cases, they will not pretend to be afraid. Like DRIVE-IN MASACAC, the killer is not visible when it happens (except for the last murder when the killer is identified). Unusual weapons that suddenly appear can kill innocent victims. No one sees the tracking character at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this makes the movie interesting (intentionally unintentional), but not funny at all. And, as one critic put it, music in a bad way is bad, even for those who love punk rock. The factor looks like the dances uncomfortably. The sound (at the time of posting, no music at first!) Was made by a group of diabetic infants, who sang the worst songs that had nothing to do with the movie. Do not misunderstand the main points of this update. The critic enjoys bad movies (such as ""Nail Gun Massacre"" and ""The Bachelor Party Massacre"") as much as classic movies (such as ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the thirteenth""). However, it seems that CHOKE has tried very hard to get used to any of these categories and has never been familiar with any of them. Even playing a DVD movie directly is an awesome effort. The film, on the other hand, contains a number of deadly scenes. However, if the surviving characters do not ignore this situation, the significance of these places will soon disappear because the power they show will disappear without a trace. Proponents of the B-rated movie killer in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of classics like HALLOWEEN and Friday TthreeTH should do everything possible to prevent that!",negative
47771,"CHOKE (also known as AX in the UK) is a slasher that is thought to be a live movie on DVD. I say ""it is understood"" because the title of the film does not have a ""V"" in brackets indicating that it was made for a DVD movie (although it has a look). The plot is simple - the team caught a gig from a former meat packing factory and they were killed one by one. I think a lot of people will agree that film will never be part, but it does't forgive mistakes. Even DVD-specific movies like Bachelor Party Massacre (with a very low IMDb rating) have a lot of redemption merits and sometimes appear as so-called ""very, very good"" movies. Are However, being a ""very bad"" movie (like the Neil Gun Massacre), CHOKE is far from being a big slasher (like HALLOWEEN). The film begins with a character who is killed by a drill. The effects of blood were very sweet but understandable with a very small budget. But, from there, it went all the way down. There are so many mistakes in CHOKE that I can spend the whole day talking. But, a few Jones are clear and I'll get into that. The gag band seems to start with about fifty people in attendance, but after the music stops, it seems that only weight people are left (but all of them are meant to enter!). The characters in this film are not popular at all. Most of the band members are strangely dirty-faced slaves. No one really cares what happens to them, and even their friends who think they forget about them when they are sent. The highlight of the film is the presence of a homeless man who seems to see the meat packaging industry as a kind of church (deeply!) He draws really funny lines for no reason. But unfortunately, even this presence cannot save any film. There are so many scenes of people wandering around without explanation. Used for about sixty-five minutes to see the characters in the film talking. The characters disappear without explanation for a long time. Like other movies, CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND live on DVD, the factors spend a lot of time insulting each other without getting angry. There are a lot of explosions (especially from the male characters) and some are almost completely out of battle. In fact, the format can be described as: characters move - kill - characters move - kill. You think The dialogue is bad and it sounds like a few lines of speech without the use of a word. Maybe it was meant to be funny, but it's just sad. And beyond that, we've all seen it a thousand times before (often with very serious consequences). There is no doubt in the film. The bodies only indicate that the characters are in danger. The madman runs but the characters just act like donkeys. They make little effort to get out of the factory to get weapons to defend themselves. And most of the time, they don't even say they're scared. Unlike DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer is not identified during the murder (except for the last murder when the killer is identified). A random weapon appeared outside the scene of the victim's murder. No one has never been seen with the characters. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the worked to make the film funny (unintentionally), but there it is not funny at all. And, as one reviewer put it, a music track contains some of the worst music never, even for those who love punk rock. Also, dancing sounds weird. Points (in the posting, no music at first!) We have a group of Sugar B fans singing very bad songs that have nothing to do with the film. Don't misunderstand the points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (like Nile Gun Massacre and Bachelor Party Massacre) like in the past (like Halloween and Friday Thirteen). However, it seems that CHOKE has tried very hard to enter one of these categories without including both. And since the movies go live on DVD as they go, it's a futile endeavour. Well, the movie has good scenes of murder. However, when the rest of the characters do not take the situation seriously, the scenes soon close their significance because the flexibility they provide is lost forever. Nine hundred and eighty viewers of the movie one thousandB should take steps to avoid this movie. And classics like Halloween and Friday Thirteen should do their best to avoid it!",negative
