My favourite song by the band, \"Hot for Teacher\", is featured on this album and is a sparkling example of how talented Van Halen is with its wild guitar, clever drum beats, and humorous vocals as well (aside from that, it's also horrendously catchy). Also on one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four are the classics \"Jump\" and \"Panama\", which have good reason to be played often on the radio since they're two of Van Halen's finest pieces. This CD additionally has more synthesizer use than the typical Van Halen album, and they're pretty good with it too. Overall this is an outstanding classic rock album that I would rank second in a line-up of good are-ninety's CDs (first would be AC\/DC's \"Back in Black\").

I love jazz fusion and progressive rock to pieces but every so often I really need to take a break with that and just loosen my nerves with music intended to be innocent melodic pop\/rock. for your perverted pleasures in this case! Devo's debut is absolutely cool! The man on the album cover is cool! Devo's the coolest band never, omaha!\"Gut Feeling\/(Slap Your Mammy)\" provides nonstop fun. Immediately the vocals and rhythm section remind me of several new wave artists I could name such as the Pet Shop Boys and Dexy's Midnight Runners. Maybe even the Clash as well- they this stuff ROCKS! It comes as no surprise the creative genius himself Mr. Brian Eno is the producer of this band. I somehow did't know this until tonight after doing a little research. He's the man of the hour and it shows. But that's not to take anything away from the members of Devo who are all really swell as well! Whether with David Bowie, the Talking Heads for even this solo career, the man (Brian Eno) just can't be denied for this ability to be involved with such excellent talents time and time again.\"Mongoloid\" has a really cool intro with a groovy beat and robotic vocals in the back of the mix before revealing what the song is all about- upbeat, catchy, creative vocal melodies! \"Come Back Jonee\" reminds me of the Clash. Really amazingly awesome vocal melody. You'll be table to hum it almost instantly. Wow how did I go so long without realizing Devo were really inventive new wave\/punk artists? Someone should have informed me sooner!\"Jocko H***\" indicates that the eighty's were right around the corner. This song reminds me of such classic robot films like Short Circuit and Chopping Mall. The funky almost incomplete-sounding guitar riff that the song is based around is beyond strange. It works though. I really don't know how but it does, omaha. Brian Eno I have a message for you- you're your GOD! Weirdest (and hardest to get into) song there by FAR! \"Uncontrollable Urge\" well, I think I speak for everyone when I say we ALL have uncontrollable urges! In this case it's to dance the night away. Forever young!\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" is actually more enjoyable than the Stones classic! This one is based around an exceptionally groovy beat. Can't beat it either! It's so drastically different from the Stones version that you might not even recognize that it's a cover. Job well done! \"Praying Hands\" has cool lyrics. \"You got your, left hand! You got your, right hand!\" I dig this stuff, baby. \"Sloppy\" (I Saw My Baby Gettin')\" is definitely enough to put anyone in a bad mood when they come home early and see that their wife is. this is the opposite of a bad mood! This is simply delightful! REALLY heavy guitar riff too.\"Shrivel-Up\" has an eerie guitar riff based around that feeling when you're alone in an amusement park and the clouds roll in front of the full moon and. you're all alone! Oh goodness don't never find yourself in such a predicament, omaha. \"Space Junk\" is really cool with the quick stop\/start vocal melody writing. The song gets weird as the lead singer burst out. something I can't really understand, omaha. Oh well, the riff is catchy and that's all that really matters. \"Too Much Paranoias\" is INSANE! Reminds me of David Bowie's \"Scary Monsters and Super Creeps\" with the screechy guitar playing techniques. Cool beans! However it's so short and the second half of the song is messing around in the studio trickery! Anyway, pick up Are We Not Men? We Are Devo! for pure new wave excitement from the very first note to the very last note.","overall":5,"summary":"are we not men?  no we aren't!","unixReviewTime":1355875200,"reviewTime":"12 19, 2012"}

Soon the sound and rhythm section reminds me of the new wave of artists that I can call names like Pet Shop Boys and Dexy Midnight Runners. Maybe even a collision - these things are rocks! Not surprisingly, the creative master himself is a producer for Mr. Brian Inno Group. Somehow after doing a little research I did't know it until tonight. He is a man of time and it shows. But that should't take anything away from the Dave members and it's all really swollen! Even if you have David Bowie, Talking Heads and even this own career, a man (Brian Enno) will not be denied the ability to engage again and again with such wonderful abilities. \"Mongoloid\" has a great introduction to grocery rhythms and robotic sounds before this song talks about composing sounds, songs, musical songs. \"Come back Johnny\" reminds me of the controversy. Praise for a wonderful voice. You will almost immediately become a smack table. How did I go so far without knowing that Dev was a new wave \/ punk artist? Someone should have told me right away! \"Joko H ***\" indicates that the was in the corner. This song reminds me of old robotic movies like Short Circuit and Chopping Mall.

There are some beautiful words in \"Praying Hands\". \"You grabbed your left hand! You grabbed your right hand!\" I'm digging this thing, baby. \"Mela\" (I saw my daughter) is really enough to put someone in a bad mood when the arrives home early and sees that she is this wife. This is the opposite of a bad situation! -You're \"fun and the clouds revolve around the full moon again. Alone! Oh no! Never find yourself in such trouble, ooh so much paranoia\" Crazy!

I love the combination of jazz and progressive rock but most of the time I really need to relax just relaxing my sense of music meant to be an innocent pop \/ rock melodic. for your crooked comfort in this case! Devo's first game was absolutely cool! The man on the knob is cold! Devo is the coolest team never, omaha! Immediately the vocal and melodic section reminds me of the many new wave artists I can name like Pet Shop Boys and Dexy\u2019s Midnight Runners. They can even collide- they bring these products to ROCKS! Not surprisingly, the creative work with Mr. Brian Eno created this group. Somehow I did\u2019t know it until tonight after doing a little research. He is the man of time and it shows. But that should\u2019t take anything away from Devo members who are all really bloated! Through David Bowie, the Head of Speech and even this solo profession, the man (Brian Eno) is undeniable in this ability to are -engage with great talents time and time again. Rhythmic beats and robotic sounds behind the mix before revealing what the song is all about - inspiring, enticing, and sounding creative! \u201cCome back Jonee\u201d reminds me of Conflict. Really amazing soundtrack. You\u2019ll get to the table to underestimate it right away. Wow how long have I not been aware that Devo is really a new creative \/ artist? Someone should let me know right away! This song reminds me of classic robot movies like Short Circuit and Chopping Mall. The ridiculously almost incomplete sounding guitar riff that the song is based around is not surprising. It works though. I don\u2019t really know how it is, but. Brian Eno I have a message for you - you are your God! The most amazing (and hardest to enter) song is FAR! \u201cUncontrollable call\u201d well, I think I\u2019m speaking for everyone when I say ALL of us have uncontrollable motivation! In this case you need to dance the night away. Young boy! \u201c(I can\u2019t get Hindi) Fun\u201d is actually more fun than the Rock classics! This one is based on a beat. I can\u2019t beat it either! It\u2019s very different from the Stones type and you might not recognize it as a cover. Great job! \u201cHands of Prayer\u201d has cool words. \"You got your left hand! You got your right hand!\" I take these things, baby. \"Intelligence\" (I Saw My Baby Gettin ') \"is definitely enough to put everyone in a bad mood when they come home early and see that they are their spouse. It's the opposite of a bad mood! It's fun it's cool really of the guitar in recording the start \/ start speeds of the songs. The song came as a surprise when the lead singer exploded.

It's not at all bad, its just a development. This one finds them slightly beyond the \"Virgin\" sound. A little more acoustic.

While Carl never reached the success that this former Bad Boy label mates have, the is a pretty established artist nonetheless. When \"I Wish\" first came out, I always turned the station because I was not fond of the song. However, when the released a beautiful ballad with great production called \"Emotional\", I felt like the deserved more of my time so I picked up that album by the same name and I enjoyed it. Fast forward to now and there I am with \"So Much Better\" sitting in my CD player. Hmmmm. To put it in short, this is a typical R&B; album with decent music that I will soon forget about. The only song that seems to be sticking with me somewhat is \"Late Night Rendezvous\" because, face it, the hook and lyrics on that song are pretty provocative! That is easily the best moment on the album. Thomas tries this hand at reggae with \"Oh No (You Can't Be Serious).\" I appreciate him coming outside this box of R&B; the song is alright. The harmony on the hook is really nice, though. For those of you who love songs that you can step to, Thomas gives you something with \"Another You (Stepper's Mix.)\" I enjoy this song but it can't touch R. Kelly's stepper songs. \"two Pieces\" is another good moment on the album. The production is very \"Bad Boy\" and Thomas's vocals are on point. Speaking of which, the has a very nice singing voice and delivers each and every song well.

I actually see this CD as rather like a of-side thing, a bonus compilation of some sort because each track on this CD is from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. Each song, though, is different from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy such as instrumentation as well as some shifts from the melodic structure of the songs.one. CD-ROM Multimedia Presentation.two. Elsewhere: this song is driven by the bass, drum, and guitar, and light piano. This piece sounds very \"bluesy\". The melodic structures of the verses have changed a bit, while the chorus does sound like the original track.two\/fifty-three. Plenty: the piece consists of very little instrumentation at all. There is some screeching sounds in the background, which is annoying. As the song progresses, about two minutes in, there is dramatic drumming that is introduced as well as the keyboard, although very gentle. This song focuses is rather around vocals. The melodic structure of the song is rather the same as Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. This piece is quite haunting.three\/fifty-four. Mary: this song is driven by the guitar as well as the piano. The song is sung rather with much more dramatic pose. The drum machine sound from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is gone and makes this piece much more intimate. In my opinion, this song is much better than Mary that could be found in Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. Sarah's vocals are demonstrated in this song.five\/fifty-five. Good Enough: this song starts off with organs that sounds very much like a Psalmody, church music. Later on the piano is introduced. The melodic structure of the song is kept from the original. This piece though seems very boring.two\/fifty-six. Hold On: The song as a very long piano introduction, as well as entering around the piano. This song is much more softer than the original piece. No longer emotionally driven by drum beats and the guitar, the vocals of Sarah takes the place of all of them. Her voice is very clear and emotional in this particular piece. My opinion, this piece is much better than the original. Hold On from this track is much more intimate.five\/fifty-seven. Ice Cream: this version is quite similar to Ice Cream from Mirrorball. Ice Cream is recorded as to how Sarah would perform it live. This song is driven by the bass and guitar. Background vocals do a great job complimenting Sarah quite well, which is accompanied by Ashwin.four\/fifty-eight. Ice: this song is driven the bass and electric guitar, as well as percussion. The vocals are diminished as they are overpowered by the instruments within this piece. There is very much less dramatic pose than the original. The melodic structure of the piece is kept from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.three\/fifty-nine. Ol'fifty-five: the only cover song on this CD, which was originally written by Tom Waits. This song sounds very country-ish. This piece sounds quite different with what Sarah would write for using. This piece does show another side of McLachlan, but not something I would like to listen to.two\/fiveThis CD, I would recommend to Sarah McLachlan fans who have developed a liking to Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and want to hear a different side to some of the songs from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. They are quite different, some of which are good and some of which one would be happy that they were't released in Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. If you are a new fan to Sarah McLachlan, I would recommend Sarah's other CD: Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Surfacing, for even Afterglow. This CD just shows another side of Sarah and basically the original structures of the song. In the cover sleeve, Sarah writes:\"Most of the songs on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy began as acoustic pieces. Early in the recording process we thought about putting out two records: one record of the original acoustic songs and another with more produced and\/or layered songs. In time, one version usually presented itself to be the stronger for just more interesting in its instrumentation and direction, whatever felt right at the time. I love Fumbling Towards Ecstasy recording and would't change a thing, but I love these versions as reminders of where the songs started and of the various paths we wandered down to discover their identities.

After all, I was a seventies heavy metal kid, and both \"Mama Kin\" and \"Dream On\" had become staples on the local anything goes FM station. (Remember those?) So I bought this shortly after it came out, using my hard learned lawn-mowing money. I think I've owned this album in some format for another never since. It was a huge leap forward from that first album. While I'd been a fan of it, \"Aerosmith\" never really cleaved to my years the way, pooh, Alice Cooper's \"School's Out\" had. But \"Get Your Wings,\" from the moment \"Same Old Song and Dance\" shattered my eardrums, served notice. Aerosmith had figured out where they wanted to go. Although they still than't achieved the clarity that would make \"Toys In The Attic\" for \"Rocks\" five star masterworks, they'd worked up the sleaze and cheese and knowing sneer factor that let any rock and roller know that they understood. Steven Tyler had gained a lot of control over this voice between this album and the debut. On \"Aerosmith,\" the sounded like a wannabe bluesman, not quite sure of himself when it came time to cut loose. On \"Get Your Wings,\" the gained authority. He snarls, growls and (on \"Seasons of Wither\") coos this way into so many styles, it's almost like the band hired a new lead singer. Same with Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, who really took a firm grasp of the guitar sound. Listen to the way \"S. O. S.\" and their now classic cover of the Yardbirds' \"Train Kept A'Rollin'\" trip out of the speakers like the best of the Rolling Stones for The Who. That Aerosmith had also figured out how to work a horn section into the songs (\"Pandora's Box\" and \"Same Old Song and Dance\") without making it sound like a sweetener was a compliment to the band's sense of self. Dirty, raunchy and rolling like an earthquake, \"Get Your Wings\" was the sound of a band about to take flight. As the precursor to two of the seventies' best hard rock albums, it's a landmark for Aerosmith.

I heard the first album of Aerosmith and thought it was good. After all, I was a heavy-metal kid in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. Both \"Mama Kin\" and \"Dream On\" have become anchors for any local radio station. (Do you remember those?) So I bought it shortly after it came out, using my hard-earned money. I think I already have this album in a certain format, and I haven't had it since. Compared to the first album, this is a big jump forward. Although I've always been a fan of that, \"Aerosmith\" is never really as attractive in my page as Alice Cooper's \"School Out\". However, from the moment the \"old song and dance\" broke my eardrum, \"spreading the wings\" attracted people's attention. Aerosmith has found where they want to go. Although they have not yet mastered the part of making five-star \"rock and roll\" \"toys in the Attic\", they have solved the dirt and cheese and the familiar humour so that any rock musician knows they understand. Between this album and debut album, Steven Taylor gained a lot of control over this sound. In \"Aerosmith\", this sounds like someone who wants to be a blues player, not sure about him when it's time to relax. In \"Get Your Wings\", you get the authorization. He roared, roared, and (in \"Seasons of Wither\") made many soundtracks this way, as if the band had hired a new lead singer.

I had just heard of Aerosmith's first album and thought it was a weekend. After all, I was a very active child, and \"Mama Qin\" and \"Dream On\" both became the staple food of everything that went on the FM station. (Do you remember that?) So I bought it right after I came out, using my hard-earned money to mow the lawn. I think I brought this album in another format from there. It was great to move on from this debut album. When I was a fan of it, \"Aerosmith\" never stopped with my page, Pooh, Alice Cooper's \"Out of School\". But \"Get your wings,\" from the moment \"the same old song and dance\" broke my years, a notice was sent. Aerosmith knew where the wanted to go. Although the had not yet been told that the would be the \"toy in the attack\" of the five-star \"Rocks\" part, the used a slice and cheese and the knew something funny that would make any rock and Roller knew the understood. Steven Tyler got a lot of power from this sound between this album and the original. In \"Aerosmith\", the looked like a wannabe bluesman, not sure when it was time to leave. \"Get your wings,\" the authority said. He screams, screams, and (in \"Weisser's Seasons\") the says it in many ways, it's like a band hiring a new lead artist. Like Perry and Brad Whitford, they do not fully understand the sound of the guitar. Listen to the high quality covers of the \"SOS\" track and the Yard Birds \"Train Capt. A Rolling\" tour that come out of the speakers as the best holes rolling stones. In fact, Aerosmith also understood that the horn part in the songs (\"Pandora's Box\" and \"Old Old Song and Dance\") was a compliment to the band's self-confidence without making a joke sound. Dirty, noisy, and rocking like an earthquake, \"Get Your Wings\" was the voice of the group on the plane. As a prelude to two of the seven hard rock albums, this is a notable feature of Aerosmith. You need three things.","overall":4,"summary":"Not your same old song and dance","unixReviewTime":1078617600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2004"}

I had heard Aerosmith\u2019s first album and I thought it was wok. After all, I was a heavy metal kid in my seventies, both \u201cMama Kin\u201d and \u201cDream On\u201d being the foundation of everything locally happening on FM. (Remember those?) So I bought it shortly after it came out, using my hard-earned money to cut grass. I think I\u2019ve had this album in the form of another one never since. It was a huge success from the first album. As a fan, Aerosmith was\u2019t really connected to my years, like, there was Alice Cooper\u2019s \u201cSchool\u2019s Out\u201d. But \u201cGet Your Wings,\u201d from the moment \u201cBoth Songs and Dance\u201d broke my year, and gave notice. The aerosmith knew where they wanted to go. Although they haven\u2019t yet reached the proof that \u201cRocks\u201d of Toys In the Attic can make five professional stars, they worked with grief and cheese and discovered a tricky point that allows rock and roll to know that they understand. Steven Tyler had a lot of power in this sound between this album and for the first time. In \u201cAerosmith,\u201d the looks like a bluesman wannabe, unsure of himself when it comes time to cut. In \u201cGet Your Shoulder,\u201d strength is achieved. She screams, screams and (in \u201cSeasons of Wither\u201d) goes through so many forms, the band seems to have accepted a new lead singer. They were like Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, who really caught the sound of the guitar. Hear the \u201cSOS\u201d approach and their current Yardbirds standard \u2018Train Keept A\u2019Rollin\u2019 out of the best -selling Rolling Stones for The Who. Aerosmith also figured out how the corner portion of the songs (\u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d and \u201cSame Old Song and Dance\u201d) would work without making the dessert seem safe for the band\u2019s attention. Dirty, soft and often self -like an earthquake, \u201cGet Your Shoulder\u201d sounds like a moving group. As a prologue to two of the best rock solid albums of the seventies, it is a symbol of Aerosmith.

Hell, just to hear her vibrantly soulful vocals further enliven R&B;\/Soul classics like \"Fallin'\", \"You Don't Know My Name\" & \"If I Ain't Got You\" was well worth the money I forked out to purchase this album. \"Alicia Keys: Unplugged\", which temporarily revives MTV's long-gone \"Unplugged\" series, further testifies to Alicia Keys' immense talent as a singer, songwriter and musician. Unfortunately, this album does not live up to the greatness of its two predecessors (\"Songs In A Minor\" - two thousand and one, \"The Diary Of Alicia Keys\" - two thousand and four). That does't necessarily mean that this album is terrible because it's anything but. Alicia Keys consistently sounds as soulful, powerful, emotional and captivating as she's always been -especially on \"Fallin'\", \"If I Ain't Got You\" & \"A Woman's Worth\"- but I was hoping that she'd apply some more creativity and\/or effort into the musical and\/or instrumental arrangements. Apart from the \"the stripped-down \"You Don't Know My Name\" and the insightful soul ballad \"Diary\", which chucks in a laid-back flute, the songs hardly sound any different from their original forms. I guess she preferred to stick to the \"if it main't broke, don't fix it\" theory this time `round. Another thing that I disliked about this album was its black of new material. Yes, lead single \"Unbreakable\" is a beautiful R&B;\/Soul tune, but with all the name-dropping going on in the lyrics, I find it hard to find out what she's really talking about. The only other solid new tune on this sixteen-track-long disc is \"Stolen Moments\", another beautiful R&B;\/Soul ballad where Alicia Keys ponders on the beginnings of her loving relationship and grandly urges to her lover \"lets get away\" over a beautiful assortment of horns, flute and percussion. Apart from hits and songs from her past, as well as a guest-festive celebration with Common, Mos Def, Damian Marley & others on the album-closing tracks \"Love It Leave It Alone\" & Damian Marley's \"Welcome To Jamrock\", the rest of the songs consist of covers (Branda Holloway's piano-driven \"Every Little Bit Hurts\" & \"Prince's \"You Don't Know My Name\"). However, there's no denying the sheer sublimeness and brilliance of her piano-driven duet with Maroon five's Adam Levine on their cover of the Rolling Stone's \"Wild Horses\", which beautifully converts a Rock song into a spiritually exploratory R&B;\/Soul classic. Ditto in terms of brilliance for \"Streets If New York (City Life)\", a stunning piece of deeply thought-provoking poetry over a beautifully arranged melange of moody instrumentals. The final problem I had with this album was with her lacklustre performances of \"Heartburn\" & \"Karma\". It's a shame that she started off a great show on the wrong foot by turning two beautiful songs into vocal trainwrecks, especially after beautifully opening the show with \"Alicia's Prayer (Acapella Intro)\". Nonetheless, this is a great CD and is well worth the purchase, despite its flaws.

This is a rare and beautiful album; the themes of hate, injustice, and, in particular, the atmosphere are one hundred% true today as they were forty years ago when this album was released.

This is a great recording of Sam in concert at a black nightclub. Sam holds the audience in the palm of this hand for the whole show. He sings in a grittier, more \"urban\" style than the used on this hit records. Amazingly, this great recording was unreleased at the time it was recorded, and did't come out til over twenty years later. But it's available now, and all Sam Cooke fans should get it.","overall":5,"summary":"The young man you've all been waiting for, Mister Soul!","unixReviewTime":1137974400,"reviewTime":"01 23, 2006"}
