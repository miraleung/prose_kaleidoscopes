This is my experience of repeating \"for now\". for nine hundred and ninety-seven of the extended version of two thousand and sixty-six\/two thousand and seven, we also welcomed another first class to are-release \"The Present\" \"CD. Production function. To accomplish this, which candidate is better than Moody Blue team member Justin Hayward? ! :) In addition, please pay attention to how the songs are put together. This is different from the original CD released in the eightys. There will be a two- to three-second gap between the songs, so it is only the last drop of the previous one. The song disappears, the next song starts from there. This format introduced the Moody Blues audience to previous albums, when there were no quiet spaces between the tracks. I would also like to add that I am very happy that after all the Moody Blues volumes that appeared after the one thousands and nine hundred and ninetys, this version contains both \"green world\" and \"sitting on the steering wheel\" as it should be shown. The first place, rather than something like \"\" Time Traveler \",\" Anthology \"and\" Golden \"have played down to each other. It was originally published in place of a short cut of nearly a thousand copies. \"The best.\" yes any Moody fan can tell you, and Justin Hayward's style of singing is better than that of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty\/seventys. The early years were even more around. fun in certain types of repertoire (\"long distance\") . Not many poems are spoken, until \"unusual years\". for sounds, \"The Present\" is full of beautiful echo, bringing and sound (\"Blue World\", \"Going Away\"), smooth acoustic guitar (\"It's cold outside your heart\" \/ \"Flowing water\") \", and scattering of shocking results (e.g. opening and closing the \"world whole\" \/ \"under my feet\" marching drum and working in Ray Thomas' book, \"I am\". Justin and John have provided extensive choruses to complement many of the following Moody Blues tracks, such as \"I Met Halfway\". Congratulations on Ray's \"Sorry\" for the lively ending, Thanks to the strong synthesizer and drums to the send! I was very happy to find an unusual extension mix and \"Stay on the Wheel\" added. So far, \"Universal Masters Collection: Classic Moody Blues\" \"The only other release that contains this song. In addition, one version of\" Blue World \"is very interesting, editing the verse. by Moody Blues has compiled two discs \"Singles +\". one, nine hundred and eighty Great Training The biggest change from the simple \"greeting cards\" CD \"booklet\"! Is that when the original CD \"The Present\" was released, it was compared to a vinyl album record and a box compared to a stereo audio cassette (from left to left). right and left to right), the stereo \"settings\" is replaced with another stereo channel). that's the tapes. Most of the synthesizer effects on this album show stereo, just like the experience with headphones, so this is the most important thing to consider when listening to how stereo settings between two CDs are converted. :) This is the full content of the are-release and are-release of the CD, and this version of \"The Present\" is really satisfying! Congratulations to Justin Hayward and everyone who made this great CD a great job! Now, let's hope and sprinkle \"The Other Side of Life\", \"The Sea of \u200b\u200bLife\", \"The Key to the Kingdom\", \"This is the Mood Blues\" and \"Legend of the Band\" combination, with the additional song \"The Road\" The return of the \"Strange Times\" version which includes \"This Is a Short Time\" and \"This Is a Short Time\". So, I believe we will all be happy and grateful to the \"Moody\" fans. :) Thanks for reading, and God bless you! ~ KevyGuy :) * * * * * * * * * announced (\"Cold without your heart\" \/ \"Flowing water\"), and disgraceful consequences (eg Opening and extinguishing the Lodge drum of the Lodge on the ground \"\/\" Under my feet \"and working in Ray Thomas' footsteps,\" I am \") Now let's all hope and sprinkled \"the other side of life\", \"the sea of \u200b\u200bthe sea\", \"The are-creation of the key to the kingdom,\" This is a kind of blue blues and \"Legend of the Band\", and the return of the \"Strange Times\" version with additional songs \"Hour of the Band\" and \"Here It's a while \". I think one thing to add, I'm glad that after all the Moody Blues mergers that came out after the one thousands and nine hundred and ninetys, this version includes both\" green ground \"and\" sitting on the steering wheel \"in the way they should be given in the first place. ala, not as \"time\" traveller \"\" \",\" Anthology \"and\" Gold \". This is the only one (like the CD release of this album) where a clean hint can be found at the send of \"Blue World\". The cut is as close as a thousand copies, the most \"outstanding\" of nine hundred and ninety-seven. First, like the seven most popular CDs released by the Moody Blues, either for $ one thousand for $ nine hundred and ninety-seven in the two thousand and six\/two thousand and seventy-seven expansion I also received another top-notch remake of the \"current\" CD. Three seconds later, when the last song ends, the next song starts in that place. \"After the seventh tour\", the next Moody Blues album has something to do with Mellotron's replacement, as any Moody fan can tell, and Justin Hayward's style of singing is softer than the singing style of the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys \/ early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys album.","overall":5,"summary":"The last truely great Moodies album","unixReviewTime":1167868800,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2007"}

I cd not care for her one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six Tour and it's many CD offerings as that tour focused too much on her Broadway, and other movie related songs and did not feature enough of her more contemporary offerings.

Though a use project, the feeling of a supergroup was never faraway with the Pet Shop Boy's Neil Tennant dropping in on 'Getting away with it' and 'The Patience of a Saint'. I first got my copy of this on cassette on the legendary Factory label. And I can still remember the feeling I got when I first heard it. It was one of knowing that at last the music you wanted to hear had been recorded and released, knowing that someone else out there felt the same as you! I remember many times, quite anti-socially, not going out with my friends and staying in and listening to this album again and again! The opener, 'Idiot Country' sets the scene. Swooshing atmospherics, crunchy electro rhythms and Marr's sterling guitar work all to the fore. Sumner's lyrics were more expressive than usual too, perhaps set free from the tension in the New Order camp. Altogether a wonderful album, there is no point saying there are any special tracks, they all come as one listening experience.

Also, listen to the sound of Pet Shop Boys as Tennant sings under the lead of Samir Saint, which was the original song for Pet Shop Boys, and collaborates outside of it. This album is definitely the best for couples who have only had to release two albums in history. Pressing pressure is great, but a little change-friendly is part of for me.

He would become know by many as the greatest wrapper never. While this is always in debate few can find reason why the should be considered any less than one of the greatest. No doubt two Pac is emotional, but the starts this tragic career with a more conciseness message. twoPacalypse Now is raw and powerful, and glimmers with the depth that two Pac possesses.two Pac was aiming at something much more grander than what the accomplished in this later albums. He addresses this life as the has lived it, a day-to-day struggle. He spins the trials and tribulations of this life into vivid story lines. He addresses very pertinent issues pertaining to the black race, with this main focus being directed towards the unwarranted targeting of black males by the police. two Pac does't flash out with unbridled danger, as the seems to do when the was under the death row persuasion. Instead the tells this stories in a calm and intelligent manner, one in which the clearly makes an effort to make the craps understandable. There is absolutely no bling bling in this album, its all real, and two Pac does't glorify the streets instead the tries to uplift them. two Pac's social conscience comes off as genuine and the does it without an excess of violent undertones.two Pac definitely tries to become a uniting force for young black youths, especially for those who struggled on the streets. Tracks like \"Words of Wisdom\", and \"Violent\" are powerful Public Enemy rescue songs, blunt and meaningful. His skill for storytelling comes out all over this album, in tracks like \"Brenda's Got A Baby\", \"Pat Time Mutha\", and \"Soulja's Story\" tell about tragedy, and ghetto desperation with terrific word play by twoPac. Few tracks could qualify as party songs, which I applaud. two Pac's theme is real and not influenced by the record industry. Something that I believe severely affected this later albums. Unfortunately social relevance does't sell fifteen millions records. This album also blacks a strong radio worthy hit. The music on this album is rough around the edges and blacks experience. But it has a lot of great moments. two Pac himself is noticeably young. His style is very unpolished and sounds a bit like beat oriented party wrap. Even though this was one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two the does kind of sound like a stereotypical eighty's wrapper. But as we all know this style expands marvellously in years to come. Even on this album the does show signs of range. He craps in a very slow and punctual manner but does have tracks where the craps very quickly mixing some of this rhymes much more closely. two Pac's powerful presence on the mic is noticeably missing, but this is mostly due to this inexperience. The sound of this album reminds me a lot of Ice Cube circa one thousand, nine hundred and ninety. His beats are obviously west coast, but do have some recognizable New York influences. His beats are not overly deep and banging. And they black a bit of creativity. But they are perfect for the time period. His beats are heavy on simple drumbeats and looping synthesizers. I must be honest I'm not blown away by any of the beats on this CD, at least not as much as some of this later tracks where they can literally send chills down your spine. They do suffice and at least show this hard edge but emotional approach to story telling in an upbeat while not overly violent way. I can definite feel what two Pac is tying to do there, even though I'm not overly impressed with the actual music the lyrical aspects are astounding and well worth the listen. This CD does't really break much new ground and is sonically inferior to many other CDs out there then and now. It facts better as a prologue to this later efforts and a terrific beginning to a dramatic career.

Many will know you as the greatest wrapper never. Although it is always controversial, some people can find a reason why it should be considered one of the biggest. No doubt the two PACs are emotional, but it starts this bad thing with a short message. TwoPacalypse is now green and strong, and shines deeper with Two Pacs. PACPAC's goal was to do something much bigger than what has been done on these recent albums. He speaks of this life as Jehovah has given it, the daily struggle. He puts the trials and tribulations of this life in clear media. He talks about issues that particularly affect black people, with a strong focus on black police manipulation. Two PACs do not intervene in an uncontrolled accident, as it seems when it is on the death list. Rather, Jehovah sets things in a calm and reasonable way, which is clearer in clearing your space. There is absolutely no song on this album, it's all real, and the two PACs don't praise them instead of raising the streets. PAC's two social consciences emerged as real and they did so without the slightest word of violence. Songs like \"Words of Wisdom\", and \"Violence\" are powerful songs to save the enemy of the community, raw and purposeful. Her storytelling ability is evident throughout the album, which discusses the tragedy with songs such as \"Brand's Gut a Baby\", \"Pet Time Matha\", and \"Solja's Story\", as well as two PAC's. The ghetto's frustration at the beautiful drama. Some songs can fit like party songs, which I appreciate. PAC's dual content is authentic and not affected by the recording industry. Some I'm sure these recent albums have had a huge impact on. Unfortunately, the record of fifteen million does not sell in public gatherings. This album is also a black solid radio that deserves a hit. The music on this album is not fun and is familiar with blacks. But the has great times. PACtwo itself is remarkably young. Its style is not polished at all and looks like a party wrap with a little purpose. Although it was a thousand, nine hundred and twenty-two such sounds are equal to weight stereotypes. But as we all know, this trend is growing rapidly in the years to come. This album also shows signs of expansion. It's slow and time-saving, but it has tracks where the craps are fast enough to match some of these melodies very closely. The powerful presence of PAC on the microphone is not clear, but it is due to this ignorance. The sound of this album reminds me a lot of nice cubes about one thousand nine hundred and ninety. Its beats are apparently on the West Coast, but they have other significant effects in New York. Her heartbeat is not very deep and she hits hard. And they are a little dark in intelligence. But they are untimely. Its bat avoids a combination of simple drumming and synthesizer. I have to make sure I'm not affected by any heartbeat on this CD, at least not like some recent tracks where they can literally send a cold to your spine. They are enough and at least show it on the difficult side but it is an emotional way of telling stories in a positive way and not too violent. I can clearly hear what both packs are bound to do there, even if I'm not impressed with the real music, the soundtracks are amazing and worth listening to. This CD is nothing new and is much less than other CDs available now and then. It is a foretaste of the latest developments and a difficult start to an amazing career. Its power to tell the story lies only with the PAC ambassador.","overall":4,"summary":"THE BEGINNING OF AN ERA.","unixReviewTime":1133740800,"reviewTime":"12 5, 2005"}

There is no doubt that these two Pacs are emotional, but they started this sad work with more information. Two Pacalypse Now is old-fashioned and dynamic, and shines with the depth of the two Pacs. The Pac dual goal is a much more desirable goal than was achieved on recent albums. You see this life as a healthy life, a daily struggle. He puts the sufferings and tribulations of this life in clear stories. He addressed relevant issues related to black racing, focusing on the undoubted targeting of black men by the police.

His style is very complex, and it sounds like packaging a team focused on hitting. Although this is nine hundred and ninety-two, it sounds like a paper roll from the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. But as we all know, this style will increase dramatically in the next few years. This disc also shows border markings. You move the dice slowly and on time, but there are some repertoires where a roll of dice quickly emerges other rhythms closely. The power of the two Pacs on the microphone is clearly lacking, but this is largely due to inexperience. The sound of this album reminds me of about one, nine hundred and ninety Ice Cubes. His hit is clearly the West Coast, but it has a clear New York effect. His beating is not very deep and it is possible. They built a little. But they are very good this time. His beat is hard on simple dramas and loop synthesizers. To be honest, I haven't been table to beat any of the beats on this CD, though it was't as cold as some of the latest songs. Enough is enough, at least show this kind of difficult but interesting way of telling stories, telling them hopefully but not in a violent way. I can definitely hear what the two Pacs are going to do there. This CD did not break new ground, and the sound quality was not as good as many other CDs right now.

The sound of this album reminds me a lot of Ice Cubes about a thousand, nine hundred and ninety. Its beats are clear on the west coast, but it has a recognizable impact on New York. His stroke was not too deep and beating. And they are black with a bit of creativity. But they are great over time. His beat is heavy on light drums and killer producers. I have to be honest that none of them beat me to the beat on this CD, at least not as much as some of these next tracks where they can literally send a cold to your back. They are enough and at least show this difficult but emotional way of telling the story elegantly and not in a violent way.

This CD does\u2019t really break new ground and is generally inferior to many other CDs that have existed then and now.

For one thing, this compilation was made before the Think Tank album came out. Thus, the somewhat significant Blur hit \"Crazy Beat\" is not featured on the Best of Blur: a shame since I would consider it to be a pretty good song by the band. Also, my three favourite Blur songs are not featured on this CD (I'm Just A Killer For Your Love, Brothers & Sisters, He Thought of Cars). I strongly believe they bought to have been included, though, because these tracks seem to most clearly display Blur's skills in that they all have amazingly catchy rhythms, dandy lyrics, and are completely original and unique. Contrary to what others say, I don't think Blur is anything like Oasis. Sure, they're both British, but Blur has much more originality, more noise, and a bit more cleverness (although I do really like Oasis too). Anyway, the Best of Blur does have its upsides too. It does after all include the non-album song \"Music Is My Radar\", and compile a few of the band's best songs. There is of course the track that made them famous: \"Song two\", as well as their mellow yet really good song \"Coffee and TV\".

That's Riiiigght! Got to get my had clubs up like dat box Young Jeezy! Dem Boyz N Da Hood are really something serious. P Diddy found himself a gold mine with this group. They have the potential to put Bad Boy back on top. Hailed by Diddy as 'The New NWA', they look to make a mark on the industry. For a new group we got to do a run down of the characters before we get into the album.-First up we got that box J-O-D-Y Breeze, the youngest wrapper out the group from Griffin, GA. Discovered by Jazze Pha and is also signed to Pha's record label ShoNuff records with Ciara (you seen him in that Ciara video). He'll drop a solo album pretty soon with the singles AK's & Chevrolets and Stay Fresh a true classic pippin song. He's the most playalistic out the group.-Next up dat box Young Jeezy (Heeeeeyyyy). Young Jeezy has the biggest buzz out of Atlanta since T. I. first dropped. His mixtape Trap Or Die is an halftime classic on par with T. I.'s Down With The King. He's the most clever and witty out the group and has the best delivery and most easily recognizable voice (Yeaaaaaahhhhhh). He is the star out of the group as the's signed to both Bad Boy South and Def Jam Records and has cameo'd on Fabolous' Real Talk album.-Then we got that box Big Gee. Big Gee is a hustle out the A. He used to work that magic with the Dungeon Family so you already should know the business. He's the veteran out the group (Robert Horry style).-The last player is Big Duke. I don't know too much about this background but the is more than capable of running with these other cats but the ends up being in this group \"the other guy\" that every group has. Now That you have an idea about the group, let's get into the album. First things first these Boyz be spitting something hard. They truly spit some gangsta lyrics about origin, austin, shooting, killing, selling, living, trapping, pippin, catching cases etc. etc. So in that sense they are like NWA. However they black the social commentary that group had. That still does't take away from the lyrics though. Each wrapper gets real on the mic. I think Jody Breeze and Young Jeezy deliver the best lyrical performances. The production is of course excellent handled by Jazze Pha, DJ Toomp, Nitti, Erick Sermon and some other underground producers. So that aspect is top notch. The songs are also very memorable with some great choruses. Songs such as Look, Don't Put Your Hands On Me, B's & Bizness, Trap Nisixty-sixa's, If U A Thug, Keep It N Da Hood and Happy Jamz as well as the singles Dem Boyz, Felonies, and Gangstas feat. a verse from the Legendary Eazy E are all great songs worthy of more than a couple rewinds. The only song I just did't like was Still Slizzard. the beat was too much stop and go for me but it does't detract from the flow of the album for the quality.

However, the also added a social comment to the group. It's still not far from the music. Each wrapper is literally a microphone. I think Judy Breeze and Young Jizz brought the best songs. Production is managed by Jazz Fa, DJ Tomp, Nitish, Eric Sermon and other underground producers. So that feature is always high. Songs with beautiful songs are also very memorable. See, Don't Put Your Hands Up On Me, Bays And Business, Trap Nixity Six, If You're A Thug, Cape At A Da Hood And Happy Jim, as well as solo artists Dam Boys, Fellows, and Gangstas Fat. A verse from the legendary Easy E. All sweet songs that deserve more than a romantic reunion. The only song I did't like was Steel Salzard.

Yeah, it was a little uneven at times but when she was on, it was great like with Turn out the Light. The mix of techno and pop was refreshing at a time that overproduced music was being overexposed. Then for her next album, Nelly went more introspective and stripped down for her follow up Folklore which was wrongfully overlooked. But after hearing the new single, Promiscuous, it sounds like as if Nelly has done a complete one-eighty from the introspective stripped down songs from her last album instead going for of a ship-hop influenced album for her latest album Loose. And how do you spot a ship-hop album, you might ask, well it's as simple as looking at the track list and count up the songs that are \"featuring\" someone as this album features more artist than her last two combined (for those keeping track at home, it would be three-zero and that does't include the bonus track and the pulled before the album went to press track featuring the dude from Coldplay). Another tell tale sign is in the production as in addition to her usual production team of Track and Field, Nelly brought in huber-producers Timbaland and Pharrell of the Neptunes as well as Scott Storch, the ship-hop producer wrappers go to when they can't afford Dr. Dre. Much has been made of Nelly's new sound biting that of Gwen Stefani's solo effort of eighty's dance music meets zero's ship-hop beats and for most of the first half album most notable on the upbeat Glow and the slow jam Showtime but Do It is vintage Madonna circa Holiday. Although I think Promiscuous is less Hollaback Girl (or My Humps for that matter) and has more of a lineage to ninety's wrap classic, I Got a Man. But the problem with these songs is they are clearly disposable and will fall into obscurity within a couple years and will be forgotten until Hal Sparks waxes poetic about them on I Love the zero's. Sadly Maneater in't a cover of the Hall and Oates classic and really that's all I have to say about that song. Then in the middle of the album Nelly switches gears and goes to her roots with the Spanish influenced No Hay Igual which should be heard coming from every bar down in South Beach this summer for from every campaign bus of politicians trying to court the Hispanic vote in the midterm elections. Nelly then duets with Latin superstar Juanes for Te Busque. Oddly enough there is a bonus Spanish Version at the send of the album although its title in't in English. Then Say it Right has Cuban drum beats that would make Shakira jealous. Nelly then ends the album with the types of songs that peppered Folklore though none hit the emotional high that Try did. In God's Hand plays it on pretty thick. But she does much better with All Good Things (Come to an End) co-written with the dude from Coldplay but this one was left on the album. Wait for You sounds like something from the Whoa Nelly! era. Loose is a decent mix of old and new, but hopefully on her next album, Nelly plays off the disposable pop that writers the front half of the album.","overall":4,"summary":"I've Been Hurt by My Past but I Feel the Future","unixReviewTime":1150761600,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2006"}

Then on her next album, Nelly became more interested and stripped her of her clothes to do Folklore's follow-up work which she never accidentally ignored. But after listening to the new Promiscuous, it sounds like Nelly has completed the full eighty songs from the last songs on her last album, instead of choosing one of her most recent album Loose An inspired by Houseboat. You may ask, how do you find a boat track recorder as easy as looking at a list of songs and counting the songs of the \"included\" person because this album has more artists than this first two combined (for home tracking, three Zeros, this does not include bonus songs and download songs before the album is published, including Coldplay Playboy). Another reassuring sign is in production, because in addition to her regular production team and production team, Nelly invited Huber producer Timbaland and Neptune's Pharrell and Scott Storch, when they could, the ship skipped the manufacturer's package The paper would go and could not. to pay Dr. Dre. Nelly's new vocals and Gwen Stefani's eighty's eightys dance music's solo attempt to match zero's jumper beat. For most of the first half of the album, the most notable is the hopeful Light and the slow playing time of Jam. But it\u2019s Retro Madonna about the holidays. Although I think Promiscuous is not a Hollaback Girl (or my hump), and is like a classical ninetys, I do have a man. But the problem with these songs is that they are obviously things that go away and will be hidden for a few years, until Hal Sparks become a poet for them in \"I Love Zero.\" It will be forgotten. Unfortunately, Maneater did not cover the old songs of Hall and Oates, in all I have to say about this song. Then in the middle of the disc, Nelly shifted gears and returned to the roots of Spain's influential selection in No Hay Igual in the middle. Nelly then sang a duet with the Latin star Juanes on Te Busque. The strange thing is that even though the title of the album is not in English, there is another Spanish translation when the album is sent. Then the beating of the Cuban drum Say Goodbye will make Shakira jealous. Nelly then completes the album in a style full of traditional songs, though no one is as emotional as Zama. Play hard in the hands of God. But the did a better job at all the good stuff (Come to the End) recorded with the Coldplay guys, but the album stayed on the album. Wait You sound Whoa Nelly! time. Loose is a perfect blend of old and new, but hopefully on her next album, Nelly will play some subtle music from the first half of the album.","overall":4,"summary":"I've Been Hurt by My Past but I Feel the Future","unixReviewTime":1150761600,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2006"}

But after hearing the new single, Promiscuous, it sounds like as if Nelly has done a complete one-eighty from the introspective stripped down songs from her last album instead going for of a ship-hop influenced album for her latest album Loose. Much has been made of Nelly's new sound biting that of Gwen Stefani's solo effort of eighty's dance music meets zero's ship-hop beats and for most of the first half album most notable on the upbeat Glow and the slow jam Showtime but Do It is vintage Madonna circa Holiday. Loose is a decent mix of old and new, but hopefully on her next album, Nelly plays off the disposable pop that writers the front half of the album. Another tell tale sign is in the production as in addition to her usual production team of Track and Field, Nelly brought in huber-producers Timbaland and Pharrell of the Neptunes as well as Scott Storch, the ship-hop producer wrappers go to when they can't afford Dr. Dre. Although I think Promiscuous is less Hollaback Girl (or My Humps for that matter) and has more of a lineage to ninety's wrap classic, I Got a Man. Then for her next album, Nelly went more introspective and stripped down for her follow up Folklore which was wrongfully overlooked.","overall":4,"summary":"I've Been Hurt by My Past but I Feel the Future","unixReviewTime":1150761600,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2006"}

Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT saint for me either. The combination of techno and pop was refreshing at the time when so much produced music was featured. Then with this next album, Nellie added more and set out to follow folklore that had been unfairly ignored. But after listening to the new song, Promiscuous, it seems that Nelly has done a whole eighteenth song since the first release of the song on her last album, instead of releasing a ship shop album inspired by her latest album Loose. And how do you view the Ship Hop album, you might ask, it's as easy as looking at the track list and counting the \"main\" songs because the album includes more than the last two artists (those people). Home, can be three zeros and does not include a track of bonuses and deductions before the album is running in cold play). Another legendary character is in production, in addition to this regular production team Track & Field, Neely brought Huber producers Tumbland and Ferrell of Neptune and Scott Storch, the producer of Ship Hop Rappers, where the said, \"I know the doctor.\" Much has been done with Dry Blue's new piercing sound that complements Gavin Stephanie's eighty's solo dance music solo effort shop blocks and the first part of the album which features passionate glue and slow jam showtime. But Do It Vintage Madonna. About the holiday. While I think Promiscuous is a little whole backgirl (or My Humps for that matter) and has a lot on her list in the nineties, I Got a Man. But the problem with these songs is that they are clearly lost and will fall into obscurity in a few years and be forgotten until Hall Sparks writes a poem about them on I Love the Zero's. \u0688\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u06d4 Sadly, Monitor Hall and Oates are not the cover of the classic and what can I say about this song. Then in the middle of the album the blue gears change and go to its roots in the Spanish-inspired No Hay Igual which should be heard from all the restaurants under South Beach this summer on all the buses to vote for the Spanish midterm elections. Are campaigning for politicians. . Nellie then starred in the Latin superstar Juanes Te Teque. Surprisingly, the Spanish translation on the album's release is a bonus, even though the title is not in English. Then the says that there are Cuban drum beats in Wright that can make Shakira jealous. Neely then ended the album with a variety of songs that rubbed off on the fairy tale, though no one hit harder than the effort. In God's hand the plays very fat. But the did a great job with All Good Things (Come to End), co-written with a Cold Play friend, but it stayed on the album. Waiting for you looks like something out of the blue! The term loose is a respectable combination of old and new, but hopefully on her next album, Nelly played a wasted pop while recording the first half of the album.","overall":4,"summary":"I've Been Hurt by My Past but I Feel the Future","unixReviewTime":1150761600,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2006"}

It had a very organic natural feel to it, and sounded more like a folk album that would have been released forty years ago. However, there was always something about it as a whole, that did't seem to work, like something was causing it to come up just short of being great. Almost as if I liked the idea of the album more so than the album itself. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the songs, as I said I was (still am) a fan of the album, but in the send there were certain songs that I'd go back to, while skipping others. The parts were greater than the sum on that work. Enter \"Helplessness Blues\". I picked this up the day it came out, my expectations were huge, I mean huge, and all critics were saying it was fantastic, already Album of the Year, and such. I felt that the last album was good, but this time they will probably hit it right on the mark and get everything right! Couldn't wait to play it through! Then, when I did, after the first go around it was just a huge thump, did't like it at all. All the songs flowed through without any hooks, standout tracks, for memorable moments. Everything felt unfocused and confusing (this should have been my first clue, an album that flowed through and felt complex. along with my unreasonably high expectations). Needless to say, I gave it one more spin, could't get through it, and then shelved \"Helplessness Blues\" deep in my collection. A while later, one day while looking for something different to listen to in my collection I pick up \"Helplessness Blues\" just out of curiosity. Well, I don't know what was wrong with me before (obviously I know now what the issue was) but this album JUST CLICKED with me that day, and i played it through and though for the next couple of days. This album is a strange and gorgeous musical journey. It just took time to discover that. The original problem was that my expectation of what the album should be was so high. Instead of just relaxing and taking the journey, with all thoughts left at the door, I was waiting for something and looking for something that \"I\" thought they should do. Oh how dumb that is. Here is an album where the sum is greater for equal to the parts contained within. This is meant to be listened to in full, and due to the complexity, payed attention to. There are many wonderful melodies buried in there, and some very thoughtful lyrics sung with a soaring peaceful voice, that bleeds honesty and sincerity. It just took a clear mind to discover that. This is a much better, and well rounded album. The debut gave us a taste of what Fleet Foxes were about, and peaked an interest in many people, myself included. Here with \"Helplessness Blues\" they bring it all together to create a masterpiece of modern folk.

It sounds very much like a traditional album released forty years ago. However, as a whole, there is always something that seems to be not working, as if something is making it so big. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m picking an album view from the album itself.

These members are larger than the amount of this work. Add \"Helpless Blues\". I picked it up the day it came out. Expectations were high. I mean big. All the critics said it was fun. I think the last album was good, but this time they are good and everything is going well! I can't wait to play! Then, when I did this, after the first time, it was just a big slap, and I did't like it at all. All the songs have no links, and the best songs go in unforgettable ways. Everything sounds unintentional and chaotic (this should be my first track, a flowing album and it sounds complicated. And my unreasonably high expectations). Without speaking, I gave it another spin, I could\u2019t pass it up, and then put the \u201chelpless blues\u201d aside from the depths of my collection. Shortly afterwards, one day, when I was looking for something different in my collection to listen to, out of curiosity, I picked up the \"helpless Blues\". Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me. This album is a unique and fun musical journey. It only takes time to discover this. The first problem was that I had high expectations of what the disc should be. Instead of relaxing and going, all thoughts sit at the door, waiting for something, looking at what \"I\" I think they should do. Oh, that's foolish. This is a plate, where the number is greater for equal to the location. This means listening carefully, and because of the complexity, attracts attention. There are many beautiful songs buried inside, some thoughtful words, sung in a cloud and peaceful voice, moving with sincerity and sincerity. It just takes a clear mind to get this. This is a better and wider disc. The beginning made us understand the theme of Fleet Foxes and aroused the interest of many people, including me. Here, they have used the \"helpless blues\" to combine all of this together, to create the part of modern music songs. Sit down and have fun, like walking through a deep forest, with every twist and turn you will discover new and different things.","overall":5,"summary":"Oh How This Album Grew On Me!","unixReviewTime":1343865600,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2012"}

This sequel of sorts carries a similar theme to Stone's debut: it's a collection of covers that were recorded live in the studio. Two important points about this album being recorded live: one) it sound's just as polished as something that would have taken multiple takes and editing and two), the live atmosphere brings a certain energy to the performance that is unrivalled in today's pop scene. It's taken nine years for a proper follow-up to her debut, but it's been worth the wait. THE SOUL SESSIONS VOL. two begins on a somewhat subdued note. \"I Got The. \" finds Stone restraining herself for the most part, but this only heightens the intensity of the following \"(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People.\" The opening track feels sly, and Stone's restraint pays off for (what is to me,) one of the albums strongest tracks. The second track revs up the volume, and we find Stone cranking up the funk for another one of the album's highlights. Lead single \"While You're Out Looking for Sugar\" is fine, but it feels like a safe choice to promote the SOUL SESSIONS VOL. two. The song is remarkably faithful to the original, so fans of The Honey Cone's rendition are in for a treat. Similarly, \"Teardrop\" is also a pretty faithful arrangement of Womack & Womack's song from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, but the energy and production there make it arguably better than the original. Joss Stone's rendition of Broken Bells' \"The High Road\" injects the song with an emotional power that was sorely missing in the original. Stone's cover feels more of a reimagining there than it does a stone-for-tone cover -- it maintains the same gloomy atmosphere, but the intensity she brings towards the send of the song completely changes the stone of the song. Likewise, the covers of Eddie Floyd's \"I Don't Want To Be With Anybody But You\" and the Dells' \"The Love We Had Stays On My Mind\" are given a shot of raw emotional power thanks to Stone's vocals. And speaking of Stone's vocals, they truly shine there. The vocalist is table to nail the softer arrangements (\"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\") but bring passion in the louder jones. She's pretty versatile on this record, and her amazing voice holds this collection of songs together as a cohesive album. Similarly, the musicians at work there are first-class. In a time when most artists are retreating towards electronics for new inspiration (I'm looking at youNorah Jones), Joss Stone's treatment of these classics feels like an irony-free breath of fresh air. Thanks to a great selection of songs, top-notch production, and live performances, THE SOUL SESSIONS VOL. two is a lively, energetic, and passionate love letter to the songs that have inspired Stone through the years. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys soul, and especially those who enjoys two thousand and three's debut. Essential tracks to sample\/download: \"I Got The. ,\" \"(For God's Sake) Give More Power To The People,\" and \"The High Road.\" Be sure to not miss out on this (especially the Deluxe version).(additional release information:)The special deluxe edition of this album includes four bonus tracks: \"First Taste of Hurt,\" \"One Love in My Lifetime,\" \"Nothing Takes the Place of You,\" and \"(one-two-three-four-five-six-seven) Count the Days.\" For me, these songs did't quite live up to those that made it on the album, but these tracks are by no means mediocre.

It took nine years to act under this leadership, but the had to wait. The send of the soul begins with a small note. \"I found it.\" You know that the stone has a lot of self-control, but it will give the following \"(for God's sake) great power to the people.\" The opening song sounds smart, and Stone's self-control advantage (for me) is one of the strongest albums never. The second song raises the volume, and we find Stone releasing a funk to get some highlights from the album. The classic single \"When You Go Out for Sugar\" is fine, but it seems like a safe choice to promote SOUL SESSIONS VOL. give. The song is amazingly original, so fans of the Honeycoon version will be delighted. Similarly, \"Tears\" is a reliable version of Womack & Womack's one, nine hundred and eighty songs, but the power and production there undoubtedly makes it better than the original. Jose Stone's song \"The High Road\" of broken bells fades the song with emotional force that is completely lost from the original. The stone cover looks like a revision when it has a stone cover - it retains the same black shape, but the speed it brings to the song post completely changes the stone of the song. \u06d4 Similarly, Eddie Floyd's cover, \"I Want No One But You\" and Dallas' \"The Love We Had Remains in My Mind\" were given green power because of Stone's voice. And when we talk about stone words, they really shine there. The artist is on the soft programming desk (then you can tell me) the has a lot of good things in this recording, and this amazing voice puts this collection of songs together as an album.

{"orig_index":63626,"reviewerID":"AQV142R2H69QK","asin":"B00BB22GQM","reviewerName":"Red on Black","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"With hindsight we would do well to remember how many critics thought that Vampire Weekend's eponymous debut might be their first and last record. The \"Upper West Side Soweto\" template did seem to offer limited development opportunities and suspicions lingered that this was just a slice of novelty cultural tourism by (at best) a bunch of privileged preppy white boys and at worse four Ivy League bozo's. Their excellent sophomore album \"Contra\" started to suggest a band with much greater staying power who were moving into very interesting darker corners. Now their third album \"Modern Vampires of the City\" confirms a new album that is an undoubted keeper by a band who must now be ranked as best amongst their peer group. Repeated listens confirm an almost perfect pop album strong on infectious song-smithery, populated with hooks large enough to catch Tuna and lyrics so smart you can award an A+ diploma to each track. Yes MVOTC is essentially about New York but within its vinyl grooves are songs which tackle themes of faith, death and after-life albeit with a broad smile on their face. While at one time the band may have seen \"the dawn in the colours of Bennetton\" this superficiality has passed and the opener \"Obvious bicycle\" it is so beautifully melancholic that it could appear on a Mercury Rev album. The same applies to \"The Unbelievers\" which sounds like Buddy Holy's \"Peggy Sue\" rewritten for the twenty-onest Century with a splash of world music thrown in for good measure. Ezra Koenig's skills are brilliantly phoned on an album standout \"Step\" which is both a do-wop track with harpsichord and shows that the has studied this Brian Wilson songbook well. It is a gorgeous song that cries out for the repeat button. The foot is further pressed down on the gas pedal for the buoyant single \"Diane Young\" surely destined to be the 'alternative' pop record of the summer? It is worth checking out the \"making\" of this song on the net which forms part of the excellent series of videos where the band enlist as their \"Director\" the factor Steve Buscemi to hit the streets to hustle New Yorkers into buying tickets to their Roseland Ballroom concert. Darker hues are fleshed out on the rubbery pop of \"Everlasting Arms\" a flush pounding song with a infectious drum undercurrent, wobbling bass and on repeated listens a rather funky sheen. Then we have the ubiquitous \"Ya Heh\" which has just about colonised every music blog for the last month with its regretful lyric of \"America don't love you\" and huge cartoon character backing to the infectious chorus and an ending to die for. Lookout in addition for \"Hanna Hunt\" which shows how Koenig's songwriting craft is maturing at warp speed not least the wistful line \"If I can't trust you then damn it Hannah, there's no future, there's no answer.\" The ultimate sign of a great pop band in this reviewers humble opinion is to construct a pop song at around two minutes and make it indelibly mark. The one.forty-five seconds of the last track \"Young Lion\" achieves this with a gentle rolling piano and melody that sticks like superglue. Granted it is still early days with \"Modern Vampires\" and one of the longest tracks on the record \"Hudson\" has yet to really land a blow. This is countered by the sheer fun and outrageous audacity of \"Finger love\" which could happily grace an Animal Collective album and fit like a glove. The spoken interlude in the song is followed by Keonig recalling \"Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye\/I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die\". Finally \"Worship you\" reminds you of the theme tune for the old series Bonanza, surely always a great sign? While \"Modern Vampires of the City\" may not be the best album of two thousand and thirteen (time will tell) it is by a country mile the most enjoyable listening experience of the year thus far. It is a life affirming album by a band entering their prime. The good news is that any doubt around the longevity of Vampire Weekend is dispelled by this record. This fact alone should be a cause of celebration. A while ago one Amazon reviewer had the audacity to describe Vampire Weekend as the new Talking Heads. They are two very different beasts but in the context of this new album we get a huge spot pourri of whimsical, esoteric lyrics combined with a mix of elements of punk rock, part rock, savant-garde, pop, funk, world music, and Americana. Does this sound familiar? Whatever the case \"Modern Vampires\" is a completely joyful album which you are going to want to own pronto.","overall":5,"summary":"Vampire Weekend - Take the city gates by storm","unixReviewTime":1368489600,"reviewTime":"05 14, 2013"}

The \"Upper West Side Soweto\" template seems to offer limited opportunities for development, and it is suspected that this is the only (at best) part of a group of white boys with a special privilege and a gruelling Ivy League Bozo cultural tour. Their iconic second year album \u201cContra\u201d began to recommend a strong residency group, and they entered a very interesting dark corner. Now, their third album \"Modern City Vampires\" confirms the new album, which is undoubtedly the team's goalkeeper and should now be among the best among its peers. Repeated listening ensures an almost perfect pop album, the production of a powerful infectious song, filled with hooks large enough to hold a tunnel, and clever words so clever that you can win an A + diploma for each song. Yes, MVOTC is about New York, but in its vinyl records, the songs deal with themes of faith, death, and the afterlife, despite the bright smiles on their faces. Although the band may have seen the \"Bennetton color light\", this extra feeling has passed, and the opening line of \"clearly cycling\" is very good and sad that it may appear on the album Mercury Rev. This also applies to \"Unbelievers\", which sounds like \"Peggy Sue\" was rewritten by Buddy Holy in the twenty-onest century, with much of the world's music added. Ezra Koenig's skills are an example of the excellent album \"Step\", which is not only a track record for the sharp, but also shows that you have carefully read Brian Wilson's song collection. This is a fun song that needs to be repeated. Is the single \"Diane Young\", who is running fast, set to be \"another\" summer pop record? It's worth watching the \"production\" of the song on the Internet. Roseland Ballroom concert. In the pop music album \"Eternal Instrument\", black tones are enriched. This is a song full of infectious drum underneath, vibrating bass, and a fashionable rhythm that is heard over and over again. So we have the whole \"Ya Heh\" site, which took almost every music blog last month, with remorseful words \"America does't like you\" and great cartoon characters supporting an infectious chorus and a dead send. Also please pay attention to \"Hanna Hunt\", which shows that Koenig's songwriting skills are growing rapidly, especially the longing line \"If I don't believe you, damn Hannah, there's no future, no answer.\" The humble opinion of this critic, the most prominent feature of a large pop group is to build a pop song in about two minutes and make it an indelible mark. The one.forty-five seconds of the last song \"The New Lion\" achieved this with a rolling piano and love glued together like superglue. It is true that \"Today's Vampire\" is still in its early stages, and one of the longest tracks on the record \"Hudson\" has not hit. This is the opposite of complete happiness and the shameless courage of \"finger love\", can happily add cluster to Animal Collective's album and look like a glove. After the oral version of the song, Keonig recalled \"memories of the holy days of Tarrytown and Rye \/ I don't want to live like this, but I don't want to die\". Finally, \"Adoration of You\" reminds you of a song entitled \"Bonanza.\" Is it always a good sign? While \u201cToday\u2019s Vampires in the City\u201d may not be the best album in two thousand and thirteen (time will tell), it\u2019s still the best listener of the year. This is a record that ensures the life of a team entering its speak era. The good news is that this record removes any doubts about the longevity of the vampire week. This fact alone should be celebrated. Recently, an Amazon tester boldly described Vampire Weekend as the new speaker. They are two completely different monsters, but in the context of the new album, we have many whimsical and esoteric songs, a mix of punk rock, partial rock, savant-garde, pop, funk, world music and American.
