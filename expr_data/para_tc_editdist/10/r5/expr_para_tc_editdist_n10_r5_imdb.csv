23,"First of all, let's get a few things straight there: a) I AM an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact (I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool). of) I DO like several B-Movies because they're hilarious. pc) I like the Godzilla movies- a lot. Moving on, when the movie first comes on, it seems like it's going to be your usual B-movie, down to the crappy FX, but all a sudden- BOOM! the anime comes on! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill. The animation is VERY bad & cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie I ""vividly"" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school. & it's the same kids over & over again! The FX are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices(especially the English dub that I viewed) was horrid & I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & Joel/Mike on MSTthreeK (you pick the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time. Heck, I'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it's stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I'm giving this movie a three/ten, an improvement from the zero.five/ten I was originally going to give it.(According to my grading scale: three/ten means Pretty much both boring & bad. As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting to fifteen.)",negative

23,"Plus, the transition to live action animation is not organized, the conversations and voice (especially the English version I watched) are horrible and I ask my dad to remove the tape from the DVD / VHS Player; The only survivors of me were jokes and comments like robots and Joel / Mike on MSTthreeK (you pick the season). Because it is stupid, excruciating to watch & intentionally and funny at the same time, I give this movie thirteen, a development made from zero.five / ten I would originally pay. Going forward, once the movie comes out, it looks like your regular B-movie, down to FX, but suddenly- BOOM! In fact, very cheaply, one of the few scenes in the film that I “clearly” remember is when a group of kids finished school. First, discuss a few things directly: a) I’m a fan of anime- this is always true (I always watch speed running in Kindergarten). The animation is so bad and cheap, worse than I remember from SPEED RACER, for the excitement! As much fun as counting to three if you have no way to have fun, it will be as much fun as counting to fifteen.) Clap at least then! I think she just got that kind of recognition based on the amount of familiar material in the film. It’s fun to see J. Beals but the’s only a few minutes into the film. M. Parker is a better factor than the allowed category. The rest of the cast is hard to judge because the film is so fun and predictable. The main character is completely ruthless and therefore tedious to watch. The story blacks depth and emotion. A film about something I can’t find a job for does’t seem original to me. As well as police development. It looks like one of the many live-action movies I watched in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. Nor is it great at those levels.",negative

8686,"Madison is not too bad-if you like simplistic, non-offensive, ""family-friendly"" fare and, more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing. If, like me, you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., prepare to be disappointed. Professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports clické in the book. I need't repeat what they've said. What I felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the ""glory years"" (which many would argue were already past in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one). Yes, it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast, though it was clear that the restored versions (hats off to the volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum) were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed. But where was the sound? Much of the thrill of the old hydro was the mind-numbing roar of six Allison for Rolls-Merlin aircraft engines, wound up to RPM's never imagined by their designers, hitting the starting line right in front of you. You did't hear it, you FELT it. Real hydro buffs know exactly what I'm talking about. There's none of that in Madison. Instead, every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a ""heroic"" musical score. And then there are the close-up shots of the drivers, riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home-town hero. Or, in one particularly ridiculous shot, taking time to spot Jake Lloyd giving a ""Rocky"" salute from a bridge pier. In reality, some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock-hard water at speeds above one hundred and fifty mph.

I don't have to repeat what they said. I regret that in the ""glorious years"" (many would argue that it is already the year one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one) the true sense of urgency has disappeared. Of course it is nice to see old boats roaring along the trail, although it is clear that the restored report (tax on Seaplane volunteers and the Row Museum) is caring for the situation at a reduced space. But where is the sound? Much of the excitement of the old Hydro is the confusing roar of Roll-Merlin aircraft from the six Allisons, which reach an unexpected RPM by its designers, hitting the first line in front of you. You never heard it, you heard it. True hydro lovers know exactly what I'm talking about. Madison does not have these. Instead, the rest of the race is buried under the music that should be “hero”. Then there is the driver's shuttle, a nice and comfortable ride in the cockpit, as if they are relaxing in a modern car, in some cases, taking a moment to smile and thinking of a better way to avoid the homes of the poor — —the city hero. Or, with a funny shot, take the time to see Jack Lloyd pay homage to ""Rocky"" at the pier. In addition, some unrestricted pilots wore bulletproof vests to reduce the impact when the ship flew over the green water at a speed of more than one hundred and fifty mph.

10395,"After Watergate, Vietnam and the dark days of the Nixon and Jimmy Carter eras, what the world needed was a good old-fashioned chapter-play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the America of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six for the jungles of South America in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures. Unfortunately what it got in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five was Doc Savage, The Man of Bronze. Perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer George Pal's final film is that this often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of Kenneth Robeson's pulp-paperback novels probably had George Lucas and Phil Kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other ""We can do better than that,"" and adding a bullwhip, a battered Fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix. A big part of the problem is that Doc Savage is in many ways even harder to write for than Superman  explorer, adventurer, philanthropist, a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach-blonde bulletproof muscle-bound body of a Greek God (or rather the form of TV's Tarzan, Ron Ely, a rather dull Charlton Heston clone there), there's simply nothing the can't do and, more damagingly, nothing that can charm him. The man is the virtual incarnation of Hitler's Aryan ubermensch (no surprise that the DVD is only available in Germany!), albeit with all-American values. And just in case there should never be anything the's overlooked (not that there never is) the has not one but five sidekicks in this entourage, the (less than) Fabulous Five. A chemist, an electrician and even an archaeologist I can accept, and at a stretch I could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer, but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on this adventures? In reality Doc's brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way  even Kryptonite would't put a dent in him - there needed to be someone at risk in the stories, though with the exception of Paul Gleason they're all so horribly badly cast and overplayed (as are most parts in the film) you'd happily kill them all off during the opening titles. The villains fare no better, with Paul Wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as Captain Seas, Scott Walker (no, a different one) delivering one of cinema's worst accents (is it meant to be Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Greek, Pakistani for some nationality no-one has never heard of?) while Robyn Hilton's Marilyn Monroe-ish dumb blonde moll gives Paris (no relation) a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes. Even with those drawbacks, this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients  lost tribes, a pool of gold, a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive, all wrapped up in a quest to discover why Doc's father was murdered. Unfortunately it's a question of stone: in the sixty and seventy pulp superheroes were't brooding figures prone to state-of-the-art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low-budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought, the films aimed purely at the matinée market: you know, for kids. There have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight-faced  and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post-production, be it the Colgate twinkle in Doc's eye, the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust-up with Captain Seas for Don Black's young-ho lyrics to John Philip Sousa's patriotic marches  but plenty was in the film to begin with. After all, it's hard to see how one of the villain's underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was never intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat, while Doc's explanation to Pamela Hensley of why the never dates girls could be a scene written for Adam West's Batman. Instead, the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional, such as Doc displaying this sixth sense by, her, bobbing this Adam's apple. Perhaps an even bigger problem is that, while promising on paper, the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion, be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of New York skyscrapers for escaping from a yacht full of bad guys. Even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director Michael Anderson: having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier, Doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them. Still, aside from Doc's various vehicles all stamped with this logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze, the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously L. A. standing in for New York while Fred Koenekamp's cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget. And it's good to see a superhero movie that does't spend most of its running time on an origin story, though one is left with the suspicion that Doc sprang fully formed from the loins of Zeus himself. It's a film I'd really like to like more, but it just feels like one hundred minutes of lost opportunities. No wonder Doc Savage, The Arch Enemy of Evil, the sequel so optimistically promised in the send credits, never happened.",negative
10395,"A big part of the problem is that Doc Savage is harder to write than Superman in so many ways. This person is Aryan's avermensch avatar, unless the has all American values. This man's thinking tank is probably because the is never bored, and the is perfect in almost every way.",negative
10395,"After the dark days of Watergate, Vietnam and the Nixon and Jimmy Carter era, the country that needed it was an old-fashioned war hero who killed poisonous snakes and a thousand criminals in the United States. Took Nine hundred and thirty-six in a series of magnificent rocks in the forests of South America. Unfortunately for one, nine hundred and seventy-five, Dr. Savage was the man of the bronze. Probably the best thing about producer George Paul's latest film is that it is often well-designed, but sadly, the evolution of Kenneth Robison's pep-paperback novels is possible with George Lucas and Phil Kaufman. Left the field and said to each other, ""We can do better than that,"" and added, Fedora strikes and spelling errors are much needed in this collection. A big part of the problem is that Dr. Wild is harder to write than Superman in many ways - the Explorer, the Lover, the Humanist, the Scientific Intelligence, and the Greek God's Bronze Bleach Golden Bullproof Bulletproof Muscle Intelligence (or rather Tarzan TV) The series (Ron Ellie, Charlton Heston's mysterious genre), there's nothing the can't do, and what's worse, the can't do anything to please her. This man is the birthplace of Hitler's Aryan Bermanish (no wonder the DVD is only available in Germany!), Although it has all American prices. And in the unexpected case of not paying attention to anything (not that it has never happened) in this meeting the has no one but five, (below) brilliant five. I would welcome a pharmacist, electrician, for archaeologist, and when the time came I could see the possible need for a civil engineer, but what kind of hero is there with the criminal lawyer in these cases? In fact, confidence in the doctor's mind can increase because this hero was not painful and perfect in every way - even the cryptonite did not disgrace him - someone in the news had to be a threat, though not Paul. The whole Gleason played badly in a horrible way (like most parts of the movie) you can happily kill them all at the beginning of the titles. Criminals don't get better, Paul Wexler removes all the dangers of one of the worst film scenes of a geography teacher like Captain Says, Scott Walker (no, different) (whether about Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Greek, Pakistani nationalism) Has anyone never heard of it? Despite these disadvantages, it should have been much better than considering the various ingredients - the lost tribes, the pool of gold, the fight with the flying dogs, and the deadly poison, trying to figure it all out. I was wrapped up. Why was my father killed, Doctor? Unfortunately, this is the question of stone: for the sixty-seven powder heroes who were not among the personalities who created the latest action scenes with special effects but on a low budget. The camp was considered a ridiculous joke. Quick Action Scenes Matinée: You know, kids. There's been a long-running rumour that the original cut had a straight face - and certainly much more after production. Camp has been added, it can make Colgate blink in the doctor's eye, funny gestures that identify different styles of fighting in the last dust. In the patriotic march of Captain Blake's young songs with Captain Says - but the film had a lot to start with. However, it is difficult to see that one of the low callers in the Great Earthquake was never intended as a joke for another fall, and Dr. Pamela Hensley explained why the girlfriends who never dated Didn't, a scene was written for Adam West's Batman. Instead, the fun moments are often unintentional, as Dr. Adam's sixth sense of it is revealed by destroying this apple. Perhaps the biggest problem is that, as promised in the paper, the act has been handled in an unusual way, it is to chase a killer from the proof of a New York apartment building to avoid a boat full of bad guys. ۔ Even the successful sight of bright green snakes hovering in the air when they poison their limbs fails to arouse any interest in director Michael Anderson: as the has shown a few of this previously unaffected scenes. The doctor managed to get him out of the chair. And an electric fan just pulls the curtains on them. However, with the exception of the Doctor's various cars, all are sealed with the logo and look more like plastic than copper, the production design is better, although the LA clearly represents New York, while Fred Quincke's cinema The graphics confirm that the film looks good on a low budget. And it's nice to see a movie about a hero who does't spend much time on the real story, even though some suspect that the doctor himself came out of Zeus's back. It's a movie I love the most, but it feels like a hundred minutes lost. Not surprisingly, Doc Savage, The Arc Anime of Evil, the next most promising prospect in Doc's credit, never happened.",negative
10395,"After Watergate, Vietnam, and the dark days of Nixon and Jimmy Carter's time, the world's most sought-after veteran snake-fighting hero and villains in the United States for a thousand people, nine hundred and thirty-six South America A series of spectacular cliffs in the jungle. Unfortunately, the jones you get at one thousand and nine hundred and seventy-five are Doc Savage, the Bronze Man. Perhaps the best thing to say about the late film producer George Parr is that this pseudo-novel modification by Kenneth Robeson is always well-designed, but unfortunately, it could cause George George Lucas and Phil Kaufman to leave the stage and say to each other: ""We can do better than that,"" and add bullwhip , shabby Fedora and other much-needed character flaws. A big part of the problem is that Doc Savage is harder to write than Superman in so many ways - explorers, tourists, talents, scientists and intellectuals, have Greek deities (or Tarzan instead of TV, Ron Ely, something like Heston clone form), nothing that can be done at all, and something destructive. is that nothing can attract him. This person is Hitler's Aryan ubermensch avatar (no wonder DVD is only available in Germany!), Although it has all American prices. In the case of no negligence (no) in the institution there are only five, (less) five good partners. A pharmacist, electrician, for archaeologist, I would accept it, and I would even go and see if a construction engineer would be needed, but what kind of hero would take a criminal lawyer to risk it? After all, Doc's thinking tank may have been added, because the hero is infallible and perfect for almost everything - even if Kryptonite stone does't affect him - one has to be in danger in the story, though With the exception of Paul Gleason, depth and acting skills are very similar ), and is happy to kill them all in the opening title. The villain's performance in't much better, Paul Wexler removes all threats from a geography lecturer like sea captain, Scott Walker (no, someone else) brings Some of the worst genres in the movie (Scots, Irish, Welsh, Greeks, Pakistanis have never heard of certain nations?) And and Robin Hilton's Marilyn Monroe-style blonde blonde Moore Rangpa Liz (no relatives) competed for her money on a luxury bet. Aside from these shortcomings, it should be better than ignoring a variety of things - a lost nation, a pool of gold, a melee with biplane and the deadly poison of the resurrection, all of which are involved in investigating why Doc's father was killed. Unfortunately, this is a stone problem: in the sixtys and seventys, vulgar superheroes were not imaginative of people who preferred to take the most advanced action and unique results, but were regarded as a slender budget camp with fast-paced entertainment almost in the background, these movies focused on totally on the matinee market: you know, for kids. For a long time, there were rumours that the original adjustment was straightforward — yes, most of the camp's value added to the background product, whether it was Colgate's light in Doc's eyes, for humorous subtitles that identified different combat techniques in the last dust — and Captain Sea Choir Don Blake wrote John John Susa's parade patriotic — but there is a lot of content at the beginning of the film. After all, it’s hard to see how a less-than-evil person calls a call from a giant, not just a joke, and Doc’s explanation to Pamela Hensley as to why a girl who has’t dated could be something Adam West’s Batman wrote. In contrast, the most exciting times are often unintentional. For example, Doc expresses this sixth sense and drops Adam's apple. Perhaps the biggest problem is that even though the promises were made on paper, the actions were handled harmlessly, even chasing a murderer on the proof of a New York suburb building to escape a ship full of bad guys. Even the fiery green snake floating in the air and a successful view of the victim's poison failed to arouse any enthusiasm for director Michael Anderson: after showing this best shows before, Doc was only table to use them to kill them with a chair and electric fan, just draw the curtains. However, all the cars except Doc are printed with this logo and look like plastic folded rather than copper. The product design is always very good, although it is clear that Los Angeles represents New York, and Fred Koenekamp's photo ensures that the film always looks good. well, despite the low budget. It is interesting to see a great movie that did not spend much time in the history of the origin, although some people suspect that Doc was made entirely at the waist of Zeus himself. This is a movie I want to love more, but it feels like a missed moment of a big minute. Not surprisingly, Doc Savage, the Arch Enemy of Evil, this promising approach hoping to file a lawsuit has never happened.",negative
10395,"After Watergate, Vietnam and the dark days of the Nixon and Jimmy Carter era, what the world needs is an old -fashioned patriotic game that captures evil snakes and evil Americans. one thousand, nine hundred and thirty -six for the forests of South America in a series of adventurous adventures. Unfortunately it was found in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy -five, Doc Savage, The Man of Bronze. Perhaps the best thing to say about the legendary maker of George Pal’s latest film is that this one is almost beautifully designed but sadly the adaptation of Kenneth Robeson’s books could have George Lucas and Phil Kaufman left the stage and say to each other “We can do better,” adding a bull, a beaten fedora and some necessary character defects to the stir. One of the problems is that Doc Savage is in many ways harder to write than Superman - explorer, adventurer, philanthropist, scientist and psychic in the muscle of the Greek god. (or rather Tarzan TV, Ron Ely, where Charlton Heston is lazy there), the simply has nothing to do and, more destructively, something that might appeal to him. Hitler’s real favourite Aryan ubermensch (no wonder the DVD is only available in Germany!), Despite all the American values. And in the event of ignoring (not that nothing) I do not own any of the five surrounding, (less) amazing five. The pharmacist, electrician and even the archaeologist I can accept, and when extended I can also attend to the possible needs of an engineering building, but what kind of brave criminal lawyer is involved in these events? The fact of Doc’s mental confidence can be added because the hero is tired and intangible and still genuinely perfect - even if Kryptonite won’t make him - the needs someone to risk the stories, even if other than Paul Gleason they are all badly discarded and overused (like most parts of the film) you will be happy to kill them all in the opening stages. The damage in’t great, with Paul Wexler threatening all of the geography of a geography teacher like Captain Seas, Scott Walker (no, another one) delivering one of the worst accents in cinema (does that mean Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Greek, Pakistani some Racing no one heard of?) While Robily Hilton’s Marilyn Monroe-ish bomb blonde moll gave Paris (no contact) to get her money from an unknown bimbo stake. Even with these difficulties, it would be better than considering the various elements - lost tribes, a golden pool, a blog war with two planes and a resurrected poison, all are wrapped in the search to find out why Docs' father was killed. Unfortunately this is a rock-and-roll question: the sixty-seven legend is not attracted to people vulnerable to modern performance scenes and special effects, but is regarded as a number of camp comedians who low budget with quick scenes nah. knock out cheap almost like a review, movies only for the market matinée: you know, kids. It has long been rumoured that the original cut-off was straightforward-and certainly most of the camp was added after the production, with Colgate keeping Doc’s eye out, comic notes pointing to Different styles of battle in the latest post - including The Captain Seas in youth songs - who Black by John Philip Sousa’s patriotic walk - but much more in the film to get started. After all, it’s hard to see how one of those ugly callers from big bed shaking phones in’t meant to be anything but a joke, while Doc’s description of Pamela Hensley is why I did’t become a girl in history. written in Adam West’s Batman. Instead, the funniest moments are usually accidental, as Doc demonstrates the sixth sense by, with him, pressing Adam’s apple. Perhaps the biggest problem is that, at the promise of a letter, the action is handled almost to a ruthless one, let alone chasing the deadly mother on the proof of a New York building to escape her boat. Full of bad people. Although the winning idea of ​​bright green snakes rising to poison their prey fails to revoke any enthusiasm from director Michael Anderson: showing their weakness in many previous scenes, Doc manages to send in them no more than a chair and an electric fan simply pulling the curtains on them. However, other than Doc’s various cars that are all branded with this brand and look more plastic than brass, the product design is often beautiful even though it’s clearly LA and represents New York while the film’s Fred Koenekamp is sure. That film often looks good despite its low budget. It’s great to see a superhero movie that does’t spend most of its time running the original story, even if one leaves the suspicion that Doc is completely out of the heart of Zeus himself. It’s a film I want to achieve more, but I feel like a hundred minutes of missed opportunities. Not surprisingly, Doc Savage, Shar’s Arch Colne, the well -promised series of sending points, did’t happen.",negative

There have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight-faced  and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post-production, be it the Colgate twinkle in Doc's eye, the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust-up with Captain Seas for Don Black's young-ho lyrics to John Philip Sousa's patriotic marches  but plenty was in the film to begin with. After Watergate, Vietnam and the dark days of the Nixon and Jimmy Carter eras, what the world needed was a good old-fashioned chapter-play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the America of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six for the jungles of South America in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures.",negative

15720,"The movie is amazing. It shows a man's natural understanding of work and natural harmony in the desert. Definitely not a very difficult story. It's no secret, because it's a conspiracy to spend time watching because you lost the dinner part of the conversation. The search for a movie has to be watched many times so that 'Find It' can be applied to very few movies, but it is not one of them. These types of movies have context and it's easy to miss an important part of the conversation, so you get hidden information to edit information that you may not have noticed. It does't seem to work with ghosts. The main flaw in this film is the black of details. It jumps from one factor to another, not providing enough content for any set of scenes to engage the audience. As a result, you are not associated with any character. You don't get where you care. Either the important thing is gone as the film redeems itself, because their actions are contemptible and you are not inclined at all. Goya's refusal to go too far to help Anis is a good example. The refusal to commit it also reflects the whole stone of this part. The only character you can feel for a while is nineteen, when the is questioned and tortured. No attention was paid to her role after her rape with Lorenzo. The dinner with Anis's family reveals only the second deepest connection to the best movie scenes never published after Lorenzo's invitation, and her father all forced Lorenzo to sign a confession and return the daughter. Tried As soon as things start to get better again, they leave the movie. I read a lot of ideas there about how the film did't know what it wanted to be, and so on. I have found that it actually manages to not be too much. From Lorenzo's return and Goya's association with Anis's daughter, it all seemed like a myth. Without most of the story, no attempt is made to really review the turbulent times in which they lived. It is as if the context of this identity did not emerge, apart from these movements, from the blacks in it, which showed that the thinks of himself more than anything. In terms of this component, the purpose of the film was to test some of the drawings but also missed another opportunity to test the reaction to the work. To make matters worse, the film had nothing to do with its covered historical. Scenario research was desperately needed, and at the send of it all, you felt like what you just saw was a series of cancelled attempts to engage viewers by changing from one thing to another. Can't see this kind of thing a few times and expect it to get better with more testing. Just wasting time is not enough. It does't matter if you miss something, it may be further proof that the ingredients needed to make this film look good, Karen, are there. About the best movie never?

19882,"Pam Grier is the super soul sister of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, appearing in many blaxploitation films that have recently been discovered and appreciated by a new generation.

Grier is Lee and Margaret Markov is Karen; they are two female prisoners who escaped from prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked the paddy wagon. Chained to each other, the film becomes THE DEFIANT ONES for women, but has three separate plots: a fat criminal (Filipino sleaze star Vic Diaz) wants Lee dead, a cowboy bounty hunter (the excellent Sid Haig) searches for the two girls; and Karen's revolutionary friends search for her. The film eventually becomes so convoluted and uninvolved with the two women that the title should have been MEN CHASING WOMEN. Grier, an action star, is not given any chance to participate in any of the many (overlong) action scenes. Markov is excellent as Karen and Grier is OK as Lee, but both are eventually forgotten in the many subplots. One interesting scene has the bounty hunter forcing a police officer and this chief to drop their pants so the can shoot the one with the smallest penis (judged by this whore), but is easily forgotten amidst all the mayhem.

24496,"******WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**************So who are these ""Mystery Men?"" Simply put, the Mystery Men are a group of sub-Heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves this wife and kids at home while the cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with this extraordinary and unique Shovel-fighting style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villains by night, if this from in't keeping him busy with the latest snooping. Mr. Furious works in a junk yard to learn this pay, then takes out this frustration on this friends at night, tossing will-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, So What?). Ben Stiller breathes such life into this character, you can't help but love him. These three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about. becoming real Super Heroes. Obviously, it could happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all. a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on this costume to stop an extra bullet for two. Greg Kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture this fans attention in the twilight of this career. To bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again, C. A. frees Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by Goeffrey Rush. This lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp Champion City into a reflection of this own insanities. and ends up capturing C. A. within hours of this release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help. Recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who CLAIMS to turn invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is looking at him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown to be table to cut guns in half with this mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise. This film really is a across-genre romp. Anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a closing battle. This is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up. But at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. Both at once. While not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of D. C. Comic's short-lived Inferior Five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. It offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. If the Big Guy with the S were flying around New York City, you'd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis. Sure, the Shoveller fights pretty well, and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world. But does that make them genuine super-heroes? Only in their minds. This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. Inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics. One-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. Particularly marvellous is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball/father. Yet, it in't a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter for eternally memorable jokes. It mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it. What really makes Mystery Men a good film, in the send, is that it is very engaging. The weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that greeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp. Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani comes off as bored and directionless as Mr. Furious' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as this conscience. Tom Waits seems somehow confused by this own lines as the mad inventor Dr. Heller, although this opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. And the villains are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). The cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well. Yet, overall, this film is incredible. You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.eight/ten in my opinion.",positive

24496,"****** Warning: may contain spoilers ************** So who are these ""unknown people"" In short, the mysterious people are a group of slowly heroes who live happily never after. , while distorting their testimony of truth and supremacy. Spade (Bill Macy) works in construction during the day, and leaves this wife and children at home at night, while roaming the streets, looking for criminal activities in this unusual and brilliant bucket. Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silver items to newlyweds during the day and throws cut-outs to crazy people at night, if that does't keep him busy with new victories. Mr. Furious worked at a garbage dump to figure out the reward, then dumped the problem on this friend at night, threw unpleasant energy at a friend and enemy, and threatened to be really angry (make everyone want to know, then what?). Ben Stiller has breathed life into this character, and you can’t help but love him. These three people can't sleep all night, trying to take the ""moment of glory"" they dream of. Be a real hero. Clearly, it is possible. After all that, Champion City has Captain Marvel. A flying, combat police officer has enough company logo in this outfit to stop two more bullets. As a middle-aged ticket seller, Greg Kinnear tried to win the interest of fans on the evening of this career. In order to recapture the ""extra magic"" that might win the contract again, C. A. bring out Casanova Frankenstein, the most dangerous WAAAAAY played by Goeffrey Rush to cool off. This crazy genius has made a ""psychofrakulator"" who has challenged Champion City to prove this madness. And I finally caught C. A. within a few hours of this release. Only the mysterious people are left to abandon Frankenstein's evil plan, but with someone as loyal as a disco boy to protect Frankenstein, the trio needs a little help. At the start of the grind, after a painful grinding party, the team sat down with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who had real talent in this team. An unidentified boy (Kel Mitchell), says the is invisible when no one is looking at him; duck (Paul Rubens), the amazing and powerful deception given by noisy gypsies; and the unused Sphinx as (Wes Studi), the was shown to be table to cut a gun in the middle of this idea, and then spent most of the rest of the movie discussing silly tricks and acting very wisely. This movie is really playing. Anyone who wants to split a movie into a clean slate is fighting a final fight. This is a spoof / spoof of the superhero genre — from Burton's pseudo-updated endless pseudo set (sometimes decorated with spoof accessories) to comedy costumes, a kind of comic book that is well publicized. But at the same time, this is also an important movie. Two at the same time. While not a special one in itself (for example, the film shows the short-lived DC Comic ""Five Bad"" in some ways), it's something new on the big screen. It provides a world of comic book where you have to stop believing and accepting, and then join the unstoppable people who want to — we all know that if the heroes are really powerful, then these people are also real. If there's a big S man walking around New York City, you'll see six stories about idiots in regular underwear. Of course, Shoveler's fight is pretty good, and Blue Raja can throw forks right - all over the world. But does this make them heroes? Only in their hearts. The movie is also a comedy, though black. This is inevitable when you try to show the folly of patents. When a comedy genius on stage throws multiple play clips, one plane. The most interesting is the conversation between Jane Garofalo and her soccer / dad. However, for jokes that will never be remembered, it is not a joke. It includes drama, discovery and love, but never set foot in it. The thing that makes ""The Amazing Man"" a good movie is that it's very interesting. Weak / bad people will eventually be judged, and they will pass away and become great heroes; justice has been done; the movie ends with a Greek scene (as a real possibility in the world of flying flying and hidden glasses). If the audience stops trying to write this movie, then this movie could be an amazing game. Of course no movie is perfect. Although Claire Forlani plays an important role as a conscience, she is bored and confused as Mr. Furious's lover. Tom Waits seems confused by this lines as a crazy composer. Dr. Heller, although the opening for retired ladies in a nursing home is worth a look. The villain is always a running dog with a gun (this is mentioned in the movie). Photography is in the middle (just as it happens in a normal nickname, so it sounds), music sometimes overpowers the beauty of places, and unique effects have never been well combined in some places. However, overall, this movie is amazing. You’ll have to be a fan of the superhero and kind of superhero to appreciate this movie, but it’s a fun game and a great way to kill a few hours and relax the mind.

Mr. Furious works in a junk yard to read the charge, and then at night removes this frustration from this friends, throws a one-liner at friend and foe, and threatens them with rage (to everyone's surprise). Do, then what?). Ben Stellar breathes life into this character, you can't love him. The trio spent the night trying to capture the ""wonderful time"" they had dreamed of. To become a real superhero. Obviously, this is possible. The captain at Champions City is amazing. A flying, highly aggressive police officer with a company logo on this uniform is enough to stop two more shots. Greg Knier is incredibly transforming into a middle-aged salesman trying to regain the attention of this fans in the evenings. To bring back this 'extra spell', whatever definition can win, pc. A. Casanova releases Frankenstein, the WAAAAAY high profile threat that Gofrey Rush played in a fun way. This crazy genius has made War City a 'psychofoculator' to make it a champion, a symbol of this madness. And ends the occupation of C. A. A few hours after release from prison. It leaves only the mystery men to thwart Frankenstein's evil plan, but while men like the Disco Boys defend Frankenstein, all three will need a little help.

And the rarely used Sphinx (Wes Study), shown as a cutting table in the middle of the concept, and then spent most of the film talking about useless puzzles and working very cleverly. The film manages to entertain as well as inform. Anyone who wants to put pigeon movies in small clean parts is fighting a war of temptation. It's a superhero type spoof / parody - from fake sets - to Burton's frequently used (and sometimes very deceptively adorned) silly costumes, this kind of comedy sends well. Is. But at the same time, it's a superhero sky. Both at the same time. While not a groundbreaking contribution to the genre, for example, the film somehow captures the short-lived work of DC Comics' Inferior Five, it does fit well on the big screen. It delivers world-class comic books that require a suspension of disbelief to be accepted in any way, and inevitably throws Wana into the base - and we all know, if the heroes really existed, these people would be real. ۔ If the big man with the S flies around New York City, you'll see dozens of reports of idiots kicking underwear regularly. In fact, Chevalier fights well, and the Blue King throws the fork with great accuracy - all parts of the world of great heroes. But does that make them real heroes? Only in their minds. The film manages to entertain as well as inform. This is a must have, for any Affiliate, promoting any program. The liners are flying because comedians make a lot of pieces to play on stage. Especially amazing is Jane Garofalo's conversation with her football / her father. However, this is not a joke with a sense of humour towards unforgettable jokes. It blends into drama, drama and romance, but never fits perfectly into any of them. The thing that really makes Mystery Men a good movie, in posting, is that it's very popular. Good boys who are weak / disabled are finally forgiven and, in a bright moment, become truly great heroes. Justice done And the film ends with a scene of real reality (as realistic as possible in a world where bowling balls and mirrors disguise themselves). A movie can be a great thing if the viewer stops trying to label the movie. Not really a great movie. Despite such an important role and conscience, Claire Forlani is angry and incomprehensible as Mr. Furious's love interest. Tom Waits looks a bit confused about this lines as a psychiatrist. Heller, although this forum opens for retired women in a nursing home, it is worth noting. And the villains have never been more than gun-keeping lucky (their point of view is made in the film). Cinematography is contradictory and contradictory (as is the case with comic books, so it is excused), music sometimes overlaps, and special effects are never well integrated into anything else.

This movie is really a romp of any kind. Anyone who wants to split pigeon films into smaller parts is fighting a war of leadership. It’s a parody of the superhero genre-from pseudo-Burton altered to endless (sometimes decorated with lots of sprays) in comics, the comic-book genre will get your delivery. Good. But at the same time, it’s also a serious superhero flick. Both at once. While it’s not a unique concept in itself (for example, this film in some ways reflects D. C. Comic’s short work on Inferior Five), it’s something completely new on the big screen. It offers a world of comedy-comedy that has to stop infidelity to accept it anyway, and then discard the inevitable lust-we all know, if heroes are real, then these people are not it will be true. If Big Guy S is flying around New York City, you’ll see half a dozen news stories about idiots in underwear constantly kicking their tails. Sure, the Shoveller fights well, and the Blue Raja throws a fork right - all over the world of heroism. But does this make real superheroes real? Just their minds. This film is a comedy, even if it is dark. Inevitably, when trying to point out the patent of the humorous nature of super-heroics. One-liners fly when comedians throw multiple pieces on stage. Janeane Garofalo’s conversations in the bowling valley are remarkable. However, this is not a joke more than a part-time joke that will always remember the joke. It combines dramatic proportions, discovery and love, but I haven’t fully embraced one. What really makes a great Mystery Men movie, is the posting, it should be fun. The good / weak men were eventually allowed and, in a moment of brilliance, really became great heroes; given justice; and the film ends with a real Greek scene (as far as possible in a world where bowling balls fly and mirrors are carefully hidden). If the viewer stops trying to label the movie, a movie could be a big romp. Of course, there is no perfect movie. Claire Forlani has emerged as lazy and unfocused as Mr. Furious in love, even though it plays an important role in this conscience. Tom Waits seems to be confused by this particular line as the crazy creator of Dr. Waiting. Heller, even the opening scene for retired women in home care is worth watching on its own. And the evil is never greater than the guns (bar where the film was made). Cinema is cheap and cluttered (as is the case with a regular comic book, so it can be forgiven), music sometimes obscures the visuals, and the special effects don’t really mix with the rest. But overall, this film is surprising. You may be a fan of comedy and the kind of hero who would really appreciate this film, but it’s a fun and a great way to kill some time and let your mind relax.

43261,"""little nikki"" was the hottest at the time. Prince’s music at that time transcended all genres and forms. This is normal and seems ‘clické’ now, says John Sutter who made Britain ‘modern’ at the time. Many Holmes purifiers praised the first two entries in the series (produced by FOX), but removed the twelve characters that followed. I myself have never been a reader of David, so I praise these films because they have no prior bias. In fact, the World War II scene in this entry sets the stage for a time with British propaganda appearing throughout the film. Modern Holmes executives are managed more carefully than the previous entry (Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror) which is better for two reasons. First, Roy William Neil is on hand to take the lead (and will be the rest of the series), and second although Holmes is against the Nazis, Professor Moriarty’s inclusion suggests that it was a logical battle between the two rivals. . Lionel Atwill’s performance has been criticized by many for being inferior to George Zucco and Henry Daniel, but I think it is more of a text in the interpretation of nature. Especially after seeing that Atwill is very capable of being very diverse and passionate about other surprising roles. Basil Rathbone on the other hand is a unique entry. He seems to enjoy Holmes ’role, but I blame that on the text. Example: Holmes ’introduction to The Voice of Terror tries to quickly prove how smarter Holmes is once the appears on screen, as this film shows Holmes’s beautiful cut, as well as these flaws. Even the top of Holmes was above the hand, and then this blood slowly came out of this body. Now there are some shortcomings in this film that I thought I would point out. First opening; Isn’t it easy to deceive the Germans? Maybe it was just me, but the book seller just waltz inside the bar, saying the found Tobel not only answering this door after a week of hiding, but letting him in and accompanying him? What's that!? Second, Tobel seems to be endangering everyone around him. Leaving parts of the secret bomb to smart scientists. It left francé text. How was the thought? He is ruining them all. I thought this great scientist was trying to save England? And the whole idea of ​​‘using them before they use us’ is pretty complicated. Clear propaganda. Third, how does God’s name fit Holmes under the breast? Its really small! In fact Holmes ’performance in all of Moriarty’s secret-con sex capture does’t really explain itself very well. I’ve watched this film over fifty times and there are still parts like this that I think are played out in a very chaotic way. Fourth, Holmes then found out that the first three scientists had died so the immediately assumed that Moriarty did not know the name of the fourth person because the had not yet died. If Holmes did’t know the name, how would it get? The man faces the lake very well. Good luck. Fifth, the confusion again. When it is thought that Holmes is dying at the Moriarty operating table, how can the recover so quickly? He was sure the was acting like they had lost a few pints of blood, but it was’t enough to stop him from saving the day. So despite these flaws it is a very interesting film. The suicide bombings were well done, the dancers ’secrets were well done (especially the recurring scenes of Holmes and Moriarty each realizing they had passed their assessment) and Dennis Hoey of Lestrade Supervisors are always overtime. And as of the last script, the question area still bothers me, I always thought it was one of the best series of the whole film. Overall, this film keeps me in a special place because it fuelled my Rathlaf as Holmes obsession. A classic. seven.",positive
43261,"""Little Nikki"" was the hottest thing at the time. At that time, Prince's music had surpassed all other genres and styles. ""It was normal and now it's clicking,"" said John Sturr. Placed in the 'modern' Britain of the time. Many Holmes fans praised the first episode of the series (made by FOX), but missed the next twelve features. I myself have never been a student of David, so I admire these films because there is no real prejudice in them. In fact, preparations for this World War II intervention are setting the stage for the British era and the propaganda that appears throughout the film. The performance of modern homes is handled more carefully than previous entries (Sherlock Holmes and Voice of Terror) and is much better for two reasons. First, Roy William Neal is on this way to directing (and will be for the entire series), and second, despite Holmes' rivalry with the Nazis, Professor Moriarty's involvement makes this sound a clever battle between two rivals. Makes like. Many have criticized Lionel Atoll's performance for being so inferior to George Zouko and Henry Daniels, but I think there is more to the script than just the character description. Especially after realizing that Atwal was very capable and very passionate about other great characters. Basil Rathbone, on the other hand, is different. He seems to be enjoying Holmes' space, but I doubt the text. Example: Holmes' introduction to the Voice of Terror quickly seeks to know how clever Holmes is when the appears on screen, and Holmes's good grip on the film, but also shows this flaw. Even at its speak, Holmes is initially strong, only when this blood is slowly released from the body. Now there are some flaws in this film that I can point out. Open first Don't Germans cheat easily? Maybe it's just me, but the bookseller just stands in line, saying that after weeks of hiding Donna Tuble will not only answer the door, but let her in and out? This !? Second, Tubal appears to be endangering everyone around him. Leaving the secret parts of the bomb with smart scientists. It leaves a note with France. what did you think? He was putting them all in danger. I thought this great scientist who is trying to save England? And not every idea of ​​'using them before we apply them' is complicated. Explicit propaganda. Third, how could Holmes come under this box in the name of God? It's too small! In fact, not all of Holmes' murders describe Moriarty so well in the guise of sex. I have seen this movie more than fifty times and there are still some parts of it that are confusing me. Fourth, it is correct for Holmes to know that the first three scientists have died and soon assume that Moriarty could not know the name of the fourth man because the was not yet dead. Well, if Holmes did't know the name, how could the take it? The boy could not be dragged to the lake. Guess the luck. Fifth, and confusion. When Holmes is said to be dying at Moriarty's work desk, how can the recover so quickly? It certainly worked like a pint of lost blood, but not enough to stop him from saving the day. Now, despite these mistakes, it is a very interesting film. The disguise is well done, the mystery of the dancing men is well done (especially the Holmes and Moriarty series, each of which thinks they were too smart). Lister is always involved with as an inspector. And as a final note, the investigative incident still haunts me, I always thought it was one of the best performing sequels in the whole film. Overall, this film holds a special place for me because it strengthened my chariot bone as Holmes' interest. Old fashioned Seven / ten",positive

He speaks of two important themes as just two creatures that can be seen: they may be afraid of the oppressive and degenerate society in which they live, Ingmar Bergman, during this early period, and two other extremes. Following the psychological films Persona and The Horse of the Wolf, they take a keen interest in the effects of war on ordinary civilization, exposing the worst of them, and, sadly, in life. It's a reminder of what's important. Its two most important characters are regular participants and friends Max Avon Saido and Leo Alman (such as Rosenberg's Strange), who live on an island. There are artists living on M (very different from 'Wolf' if anyone thinks about it). They see the tanks moving, and some old friends are already tired, but they try not to take it too seriously. It's a fun scene where the couple just talk, clearly but heartily (each shot, as repeated in the movie, probably evokes a sense of resentment). Trouble follows, including a fake gun-making film with Rosenberg, the psychological turmoil of being a prisoner of war, and the horrors associated with a military 'friend' (one of Gunnar Bournstrand and Bergman's secret duties). Needless to say, it's not one of Bergman's easiest films, yet for some it may be the most accessible. In this regard, their religious themes are important, as the idea of ​​maintaining a certain kind of faith overshadowed the spirit of the film. When a war takes place, it moves in an unusual, fast-paced way, and the rebuilding of the relationship between Jin and Eva takes place against the backdrop of a kind of battlefield chaos where lines have never been drawn. Somehow this film, which was shot in Vietnam at a very bad time, is even more relevant today. I can't see the cold, contradictory events between Iraq and elsewhere through the scenes of John and Eva and the fighters being 'in charge'. The last scene, by the way, is one of Bergman's best, around (acting, directing, lighting).
