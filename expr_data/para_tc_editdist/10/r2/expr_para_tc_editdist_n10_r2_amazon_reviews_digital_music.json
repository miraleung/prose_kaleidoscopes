Outkast has really represented the hometown since 'ninety-three when Vone hundred and three (ATLiens know this station) used to bump \"Player's Ball\" on the radio airwaves. And \"Southerplayaisticmuzik\" back in pm 'ninety-four help place Atlanta on the map. Two years later, they come out with their sophomore album \"ATLiens\" in Sept one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. This time, they flipped their whole concept around compared to their first one. While their debut was mostly about pippin and smoking weed, this one was more \"out there\". The production by Organized Noize was more laid back and smoother sounding. Their first single \"Elevators (Me & U)\" was heavily rotated back in summer of 'ninety-six, and everybody was trying to memorize that hook \"Me & U\/Your mommy and your cousin too. \" (lol). Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton and Andre \"three thousand\" Benjamin's rhymes took a side step (not saying they did't improve, but just went a different direction with their rhymes). On the song \"Two Dope Boyz In A Caddilac\" would be a good example of what I'm saying, as well as their second single \"ATLiens\". The most \"out there\" concept on this album would be the two songs \"Millenium\" and \"Extraterrestrial\" that will garuntee to have you head nod. The latter song may sound weird to many listeners because the song does't have any drums, so it sounds like they're freestyling accapella. Guest wise is pretty dope too. Goodie Mob's Khujo and T-Mo appear on \"Mainstream\" as well as Cee-Lo, Big Gipp, and Cool Breeze on \"Decatur Psalm\". Witchdoctor would handle the hook on the song \"Ova Da Woodz\". As much as I LOVE this album, I have to gripe about one thing (and I may come back and edit this to a ten rating, because this should have been on the greatest hits album). \"Jazzy Belle\" was the third single back in early 'ninety-seven, and if you remember it was remixed with Babyface singing the hook to the song. On this album, that in't on there (eventhough the original was a good song) I believe that this album should be breasted and that should be on there. Thats my only tiny gripe on this album. Otherwise this is an awesome album to catch musical vibes off of. If you're new to this Outkast, I highly recommend \"Dre and Big Boi Presents: Outkast\" before you buy any of their albums.

The idea for \"There\" on this album will be the two songs \"Millennium\" and \"Extraterrestrial\" which will give you an important start.

As much as I love this album, I have to focus on one thing (and maybe go back and change it up to ten ratings, because it\u2019s supposed to be the album\u2019s biggest hit). \u201cJazzy Belle\u201d was the third comeback in early \u2019ninety-seven, if you remember it added Babyface singing to the knees of the song. This album, which is not included (even though the original was a good song) I believe this album should be breastfed and there it is. This is the only little I have on this album. Otherwise, this is a wonderful album that can be extracted from the vibration of the music. If you\u2019re new to this Outkast, I recommend \u201cDre and Big Boi Presents: Outkast\u201d before you buy any of their albums.

Like most other L P.s. Justin Hayward's \"Love to See You\" is the highlight of the album, full of energy, joy and perfectly executed - certainly two minutes away. Other notable rock musicians include \"Send Me Wine\" and \"Sharing Our Love\" by John Lodge, and \"So Deep In You\" by Mike Pinder. These are songs that are relaxing, relaxing, free from the restrictions of the famous cosmic images of the early Moodis. Justin's \"Never Comes the Day\" was quiet at first, but later it turned into a rock and was very successful. Ray Thomas \"Dear Diary\" is really \"moving\", the closest thing the band has never done since the birth of their original band. The strong sound of the flute is enough to make a foul sound underwater. Suspicious use. \"Are you free to stay?\" Very good - one of the best songs this band has never recorded. It refers to the magic Merlin, which is reflected in the part of the cover. Normally I don't care about Moody's \"ordinary\" poems, but Graeme's \"Dream\" satisfies me, both in its seasonal images and Mike's amazing orchestral sound. \"Have you heard of it?\" sounds like the limit of the \"two thousand and one\" Soundtrack. It's not bad, but it does't fit the whole album, and it's annoying after listening to it a few times. The best feeling is that they have reached the point where they know they have achieved a satisfying initial success and enjoy it instead of being overwhelmed as they will become famous a few years later.","overall":4,"summary":"Birds Sing and Colours Melt;  The Threshold Awaits!","unixReviewTime":1115251200,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2005"}

Well, not literally, but I really enjoy this album because it almost seems like the prototypical Simon album. Well no, each of this solo albums have been so unique. But anyway, \"Rhymin' Simon\" has just about everything you could ask for, this time around with a really great gospel-ish slant. So, let's see what we have there:-Kodachrome: the commercial hit of the album, and it's a great song; fun, upbeat, and truly unique. It's a classic; there's no other song like it. and I love the lyrics--this man could write a song about AnYthinG.-Tenderness: Here's some of the gospel element (thanks to the Dixie Hummingbirds--they rule), a slower, more pensive song dealing with a reality of human relationships--now you've got to love the way the writes songs not about \"LOVE\" but you know, tenderness\/brutal honesty\/truth. -. Mardi Gras: Here's a little Cajun flair, a song that I almost wish would move more, but it's fun and an interesting departure for Simon.-Something So Right: Pretty. honest reflection on personality\/relationships. but too flush and produced for my last.-One Man's Ceiling. : I love this song. My favourite on use one (ok, I admit I'm sticking to the LP) Simon sounds isOUlful on this, man. gospel-y, fun, but not ToO fun :) The title sums up the song, which is a quirky little insight but works amazingly well for the topic of a song!-American Tune: I think this is a very beautiful song, a really simple melody, weary, almost timeless I think. The words are simple but powerful (though some say pretentious). But this is not pretentious--it's indescribably 'what it is.' Oh well, the bridge is my favourite part, it's earnest but never cloying. HOWEVER, I wish they could LAY OFF THE STRING SECTION! Find a live version, simpler=better for this song, in my opinion.-Was a Sunny Day: This song sounds quite perky, but it's eerie. An odd little story of a \"navy man\" and a \"high school queen,\" but it fits. I like this song. I admit I like the way the says \"speedooo.\" You've gotta love the way this dude says this vowels :)-. How to Fall: a good solid LESSON, but come on, it's a nice song. great dark beginning, then melts away, then back. -St. Judy's Comet: I adore this song. I'm a sap, but I do. NOT that it's a sappy song, I'm just a sap that a song about this kid can get me like this one does. anyway, it's a great tune, sounding almost reminiscent of the later \"fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover\". except more wholesome because this is an endearingly self-critical bedtime song for the kid. (\"'Cause if I can't using my boy to sleep, well it makes your famous daddy look so dumb. \") Low key but it moves. very nice.-Loves me Like a Rock: I always think of this as the companion song to \"Kodachrome\"--they're almost like one song in my mind. This song is awesome: more gospel influence, Simon's really getting into it, and the words have that funny-serious feeling that unifies all the songs on this album. SO, it's fun, quirky, and serious.

But too much flush and ready for my last. - A man's proof. : I like this song. On the other hand, what I like (well, I admit I'm sticking to the LP) is that Simon sounds right man. gospel-y, it's fun, but it's not much fun :) The title summarizes the song, which is a bit weird in the title of the song but amazingly functional! Simple but powerful words (although some say they are hypocrites). But this is not just a fantasy. Well, the large is my favourite part, it's honest but it does't stop. However, I want them to leave the stage of truth! Get the live, easy = best version of this song in my opinion. Strange story of \"Man of the Sea\" and \"Queen of High School\", but it goes hand in hand. I like this song I admit that I like the \"speedoooo\" method. You should like how this guy says :) -. How it falls: A good solid lesson, but let's go, a good song. A big black start, then melts, and then goes back. - East Judy Comet: I love this song. I'm a pill, but I do it. It's not that it's a fun song, I'm just a soap opera that I can find a song about this kid like this. However, a beautiful song, which sounds almost identical to the latest \"Fifty Ways to Leave Your Boyfriend\". Except it's great because it's a child's self-deprecating song before bed.

This song is amazing: the extra effect of the gospel, Simon really gets involved in it, and the lyrics have a deep sense of humour that includes all the songs on this album.

I also love the words - this person could write a song about Everything. -Sadness: Here\u2019s the gospel composer\u2019s part (thanks Dixie Hummingbirds - they lead), a slow, very powerful song about truth of human relationships -now you have to like the way the songs are written, not \"LOVE\" but you know, tenderness\/cruelty\/truth. -. Mardi Gras: It was a wonderful little cajun, a song close to me that I wanted to continue, but it was fun and an interesting departure for Simon. honest reflection on personality \/ relationships. but very squeaky and finally done. - The Roof of One Man. : I like this song. My favourite on one use (ok, I admit I\u2019m sticking to the LP) Simon expressed it that the was quite pleased, man. gospel-y, fun, but not fun ToO really simple melody, tired, almost no time I expected. The words are simple but powerful (though some say pretend). But this is not a sham - it is indescribable 'what it is.' Well, the bridge is my favourite part, it\u2019s true but not closed. However, I want them to release the HELP PART! Find a straightforward, simpler type = better than this song, in my opinion.-Was a Sunny Day: This song is audible, but it\u2019s surprising. An unusual little story about a \u201csea man\u201d and a \u201chigh school queen,\u201d but it fits. I like this song I admit I like the saying \"speedooo.\" You have to like what this guy says to these staff :) -. How to Do It: A hard and good lesson, but wait, this is a good song. big start in the dark, then bright, then back -St. Judy Comet: I like this song. I\u2019m fluid, but I do. It\u2019s not a soap song, I\u2019m just fluid that the song about this baby can get me like this. however, it\u2019s a massive melody, its sound seems reminiscent of \u201cfifty ways to leave your loved one\u201d. except healthier because it's a bedtime song for the baby. (\"'Cause if I can't use my son to sleep, your famous father is well and very dumb.)) The key below but the moves. Very well.-He loves me like a Stone: I always thought that it\u2019s a companion song \u201cKodachrome\u201d-almost one song I have in mind. This song is so beautiful: so many gospel effects, Simon really gets in, and the lyrics have an interesting feel that unites all the songs on this album . SO, it\u2019s fun, complex, and dangerous. This album finds songs of all kinds, but they all have a sense of delay, great lyrics and gospel language combined a great album by Paul Simon!","overall":4,"summary":"Fun, Quirky, Serious...Rhymin' Simon","unixReviewTime":1049500800,"reviewTime":"04 5, 2003"}

I chose this previous album, yes, but it went well with the \"I Can Hurt the Fly\" soundtrack of \"Reliable Second Part\" and even the \"Randy Described Eternity\" sound drone.

In fact, Built to Spill teeters into prog-rock territory, a dangerous place to be even for those that cd it well (hell, even King Crimson released some really bad music). For more proof beyond the song length, look at the bluster of some of these songs, particularly on the lyrical side, where frontman Doug Martsch goes for the occasional bombastic-supersonic vision. it still IS Built to Spill, and even though only a couple of songs check in under six minutes, even their messes can be glorious. And not all of Martsch's songwriting has a flair for the over-dramatic--sometimes the music and lyrics are appropriately stark and odour (quite the contrast from the usually upbeat work on \"There's Nothing Wrong With Love\").

I own seven of the band's fourteen Cds but haven't bought one in thirteen years. I'm a music junkie. I'm decidedly not a musical nationalist. As I now have more time on my hands I have decided to plough my way through as much of my record and Cd collections as I can before I go (or my hearing disappears). I use the word plough, not because the task that I have set myself is unpleasant, but merely because it is daunting. I have thousands of records and Cds and hardly know where to start. So far I have listened to all of Steely Dan, well, up to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, and about fifteen Neil Young recordings. As I was perusing the \"B\" section of the Cd wall I was surprised to discover that I had seven Blue Rodeos. I was surprised because I could't recall a single one as being sufficiently remarkable to require a replay. Yet, somehow I had managed to buy these seven between one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. I was inquisitive and that is why you find yourself reading this review. Outskirts is one terrific debut. It really is! There are ten excellent songs stretched over just forty-five minutes. This is the perfect length - the equivalent of an \"A\" side and a \"B\" side - just enough music to satisfy without overstaying its welcome. I would call the style rock-country, a hint of Tom Petty, a dash of Steve Earle. The playing is incredibly tight (these guys were't kids, had been around the music scene for quite a while).

Bobby Wiseman's keyboards are an essential element and give Blue Rodeo a sound that distinguished the band from the more generic practitioners in the genre.

About half of the songs would not seem inappropriate for any of Earl's albums. But with the title song and a few others, the sound intentions are closer to modern rock. He also throws bluegrass numbers to keep the style mix really different. But whatever the style, it does't matter if the song smells bad. Best songs on the title track \"Under Town\", \"Hello Around the Moon\", \"Over Under\" and \"The Galway Girl\". The latter is an Irish song that will not find a place in Pogues' albums. It is true that some songs don't really work, but that's not enough to make them a solid track. Credit Earl for trying to make everything different.

RHCP is now following the very popular \"Californication\", the multi-platinum \"By The Way\". Underneath your face, \"All Around the World\" relies heavily on \"BTW\" flexible plans, and critical maturity, rather than \"give it all away.\" The title track is soft and captures the sound of Anthony Caddis' old page.

Over-amped, distorted guitars, melodic songs with soaring choruses and plaintive vocals are all in evidence. On \"Carnavas,\" their debut, they're at least closer to the Pumpkin's early albums, eschewing the grandiosity that made Corgan's later work such a chore. Actually, they seem to have more in common with another young L. A. band, Autolux. Both are clearly indebted to the noisy soundscapes of My Bloody Valentine and the more melodic moments of Sonic Youth. Listen to \"Carnavas\" back-to-back with SY's recent \"Rather Ripped\" and you'd think the two bands could be cousins. Mind you, SY's songs are stronger and their guitars more gloriously of***ed up, but Silversun Pickups have plenty to offer as well. Like Autolux, the Pickups manage to fold their more experimental tendencies into their songs, and when they stretch things out, like on album closer \"Common Reactor,\" they drone instead of jam. Sometimes they're even genuinely hypnotic, but even as Brian Aubert's guitars soar into the stratosphere, they keep their feet on the ground (actually, they kinda have to; otherwise, they could't reach their effects pedals). Another nice touch are the keyboards of Joe Lester, which curiously makes the sound warmer (as opposed to the chilliness of say, Radiohead). Lyrically, the band traffic in the vague, elliptical imagery that have been a staple of indie rock for more than twenty years. At the very least they're modest, not self important. The propulsive \"Future Foe Scenarios\" begins \"The things we laid do not amount to much\/made of abandoned wood and stones and such.\" All things considered, while Silversun Pickups are anything but original, they survive comparisons to their inspirations fairly well.

Like Autolux, the Pickups manage to fold their more experimental tendencies into their songs, and when they stretch things out, like on album closer \"Common Reactor,\" they drone instead of jam. On \"Carnavas,\" their debut, they're at least closer to the Pumpkin's early albums, eschewing the grandiosity that made Corgan's later work such a chore. Mind you, SY's songs are stronger and their guitars more gloriously of***ed up, but Silversun Pickups have plenty to offer as well. Another nice touch are the keyboards of Joe Lester, which curiously makes the sound warmer (as opposed to the chilliness of say, Radiohead).

Embedded, distorted guitars, evolving music and catchy voices all testify. In \"Carnavas\", this first film, at least close to Pumpkin's first albums, explores the extent to which Crangan later did such work. In fact, they look very similar to another small LA group, Autolux. They both deal with their confidence as they choose to embark on their play activities. Listen \"Carnavas\" came back with the latest SY \"rather cracked\" and you think both groups could be cousins. Note, SY songs are powerful and their guitars are very bright *** add-ups, but Silverson pick-ups also have a lot. Like AutoLux, pickups are table to wrap up the experimental tendency to add more to their songs, and when they pull things up, like on an album near \"Common Reactor,\" they pull down instead of jam. Sometimes they're really intoxicating, but as soon as Brian Obert's guitar climbs into the stratosphere, they keep their feet down (actually, you should; otherwise, they could't reach their pedals). Another nice touch is Leicester's keyboards, which warm up the sound (as opposed to the cold, radio head). Literally, band traffic in a vague, elliptical image that has been the basis of indie rock for more than two decades. At least they are trivial, not important. The beginning of future hostile conditions \"The things we have kept are not much \/ made of wood and the rest of the stones.\" All things considered, while Silverson pickups are not real, they are alive against their good counterparts.
