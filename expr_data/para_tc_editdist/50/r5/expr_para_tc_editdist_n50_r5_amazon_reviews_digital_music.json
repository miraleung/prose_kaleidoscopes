These songs, too, in less than five minutes, are composed by two short melodies by Berry and rely heavily on pop hooks and song frames, and none of them close their signature sound along the way. \"Oh love, we finally made it\" and \"I love you more than anything in this world girl\" both go in the form of out-of-pocket symphony: both songs with a cinematic soul flavor but Too short in length. \"I Can't Believe You Love Me\" is a ten-minute symphony of funk agreed and the only song available as it tracks the action of the first two albums. The album is limited to two short orchestral songs called \"Melo Mode\" which are part one and two. Booking an album in this way is tantamount to giving the album a taste of a long site, even though it contains a lot of short songs.","overall":5,"summary":"Can't Get Enough!!","unixReviewTime":1273017600,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2010"}

While their previous album (Songs from the Big Chair) gave the band a succession of memorable hit singles, The Seeds of Love shows Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal reaching their musical speak. Also worth noting is the inclusion of then unknown gospel singer Oleta Adams, whose soulful vocals added another great dimension to their sound. The song that everyone knows there is \"Sowing the Seeds of Love\", a brilliant track that may be the most complex hit single of recent times. From its Beatlesque arrangements and intelligent lyrics to the soaring vocals of both Orzabal and Smith, this, along with \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" and \"Shout\", is among the best songs penned in the `eightys. Just as impressive musically is the excellent \"Badman's Song\", where Smith, Orzabal, and Adams trade vocals throughout as the tune bounces from progressive rock to gospel to jazz before reaching its climactic send. \"Advice for the Young at Heart\", an excellent new wave tune with a great lead vocal from Smith, is the best of `eightys British pop and should have been a huge hit. Another highlight is the awesome \"Swords and Knives\", another dramatic tune with a lot of twists and turns and great guitar work from Orzabal.

Although their previous album (Songs from the Great Seat) brought a series of unforgettable songs to the group, Seed of Love featured music talks by Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal. It is also worth noting that the addition of Oleta Adams, an unknown gospel singer at the time, has added another dimension to their voice. The popular song there is \"Sow the Seed of Love\", and the sweetest song may be the hardest hit lately. From the Beatles' arrangement and the clever lyrics of Orzabal and Smith's flying sauces, the song, \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" and \"Shout\", is one of the best songs never recorded in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's. Equally amazing is \u201cThe Song of Badman\u201d, in which Smith, Orzabal and Adams exchange songs from beginning to send, from savant-garde rock to gospel to jazz, and then to the climax. \"Advice for Young People at Heart\" is an excellent sound for the new Wave, with a key voice led by Smith. It is a masterpiece of British pop music of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys and should be loved. One extreme character is the awesome \"Swords and Knives\", and another modification with lots of twisted elements and giant guitars from Orzabal. All other iTunes are almost as attractive as the opening line \"Woman in Chains\", and it shows the deep relationship between Orzabal and Adams, and \"Year of the Sword\" is pushing and very difficult. One of the most important things is to stand on the corner of the third world. \"Jazz is much more powerful than rock music, and it sounds like something Sting will record. There is no such thing as a sunset.\" is a great jazz instrument, and \"Tears Roll Down\" is a very difficult song, similar to their updated wave material. > The seeds of love show tears of fear from the new eightys pop \/ costume wave to the big band at any time. .","overall":5,"summary":"A masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1222041600,"reviewTime":"09 22, 2008"}

A landmark album in its own right, Layla is perhaps one of the most well disputed LPs in terms of how proper mastering was and is to be done on CD. The first known CD release was in the early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's in a two-disc format; production capabilities of this then-new format could only allow a maximum play time less than seventy-five minutes, roughly two-and-a-half minutes short of the entirety of this masterpiece. This issuing was, by and large, not well-received by fans and audiophiles, because there was too much noise and tape hiss, signaling that duplication and reproduction had been done from a source quite removed from the original masters. Since then, serious attempts have been made to issue CD's properly remastered from the original source recordings. Thankfully, Polydor has followed through with the \"Clapton Remasters\" series, which includes Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. In this version, the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, twenty-bit production has a rich sound far better than the first generation of CD's to never come forth. Contained are the introductory \"I Looked Away\" and the album rock staple, \"Bell Bottom Blues\". Quite noteworthy is the band's version of Jimi Hendrix's \"Little Wing\". The album was released only three months after Hendrix's death, so many thought that this cover was an immediate tribute to the guitar icon. In fact, the track was recorded about one week before this passing. Near the send is the immortal \"Layla\", arguably one of the greatest rock songs, if not the greatest rock song, never recorded. Collectively, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs is a most enjoyable, though sometimes poignant, listen. On a parallel with the sorrow that would emanate from witnessing the passing of young, promising stars, including Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Brian Jones, and the aforementioned Hendrix, one cannot help but feel the great loss the music world would suffer less than one year after the completion of Layla when, on October twenty-nine, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident. All in all, the album has, again, the finely tuned, top-notch guitar work of the great Clapton\/Allman combination.

Ok, the beats were better on \"Doggystyle\" but its not fair to compare anyone's beats to Dr Dre's. Beses DJ Pooh (who produced most the album) did a very good job. The one thing I did't like about Snoops honest one was that none of the songs had any personal meanings. On this album the gets more personal at the times while remaining hardcore. Also think about what the had just gone through. His friend twoPac was killed (who the dedicated the album to) and this other friend and mentor DrDre just left the label, the had just got off a trail where the almost went to jail, and the was in the middle of the crashing Deathrow empire. But the still put together a great album. The album starts with the title track switch is a great song. This one was produced by Daz and its very good. \"Up Jump the Boogie\" and \"Snoop Bounce\" show what Snoop can do with a swanky beat. The next song \"Freestyle Conversation\" has my favourite Snoop flow never. Hes just wrapping real fast about random stuff and is undicribable. One of my favourite wrap songs. \"Gold Rush\" is a great song with Kurupt on it who always makes the best songs with Snoop Dogg. It has a western film fell to it. \"Me and My Doggz\" is another one of the swanky songs on this album. \"You Thought\" is another good song with some smart and funny lyrics. Strong beat too. \"Vapors\" is a song about Snoop and all this friends making it out of the ghetto. This is what i mean by the album is more personal. Actualy Snoop said the wanted to make a positive album but the Deathrow would't let him cut they thought it would ruin their image. \"two thousand and one\" is great song and is one of the standout tracks. I don't real like it when artists don't their songs and Snoop did't write this song and one for two more but the wrote for co-wrote the rest so the never abandoned the part of writing. I love \"Sixx Minutes\". Its always been one of my favourite songs on the album. its very calm and quite. Its kinda about how everyone tried to steal this style after this honest album. \"Wake Up\" is another good one and has Tray Dee who is now in Tha Eastsidaz now. \"Snoops Upside Ya Head\" is another great song with an exeptionaly catchy chorus. \"Doggyland\" is another good one with a unique sound. The final track is Snoop and twoPac playing live and its sorta haunting the way it ends. you'll see if you get it. Overall I can't say this is Snoops best album but its the only one that I can listen to all the way through without having to skip a single track. Overall its well worth having. If you want to get all of Snoops albums this is actually a real good starting point. Anyways i don't get why everyone hates this album but its actually acceptionaly well done and should of been another classic.

Yes, the \"Doggystyle\" beat is better, but it's not fair to compare anyone's beat to Dr. Dre's. In addition, DJ Pooh (who has produced many albums) cd a great job. I don't like Snoops. The fact is that no song has a personal meaning. In this album, it becomes more personal while keeping the hard score. Think again about what happened now. His friend TwoPac was killed (the album was handed over to him), and another friend and adviser, Dr. Dre, had just left the recording company and had just left the road almost to prison, in the heart of the dying Death Death But tied together. Put a good plate. The change of the main song at the beginning of the album is a great song. This one was made by Daz and is very beautiful. \"Get Out Jump Boogie\" and \"Snoop Bounce\" show what Snoop can do with stylish bets. The next song \"Freestyle Conversation\" has my favourite Snoop. She just packs up unexpected things quickly and she\u2019s indescribable. One of my favourite packing songs. \"Gold Rush\" is a beautiful song, and Kurrupt always performs the best songs with Snoop Dogg. It has a western movie. \"Me and My Doggz\" is another ongoing song on this album. \"Do you think\" is another good song, with clever and interesting lyrics. Beat up. \"Vapors\" is a song about Snoop and all these friends from the slums. That\u2019s what I mean by making albums more personal. After all, Snoop said they wanted to make a good album, but Deathrow did\u2019t let him cut it and they thought it would ruin their image. \"two thousand and one\" is a beautiful song and one of the best. I do not like artists who do not write their own songs. Snoopy did not write this song. There is one for two songs, but some are written together, so they do not give up part of the writing. I like \"six minutes\". It has always been one of my favourite songs on the album. It is very quiet and quiet. It's like everyone trying to be this way behind this faithful album. \"Wake Up\" is another fun activity, Tray Dee is now at Tha Eastsidaz. \"Snoops Upside Ya Head\" is another great song with an interesting choir. \"Doggyland\" is another good work with a special sound. The final track is the performance of Snoop and twoPac, and its send is unforgettable. You will see that you get it. Overall, I can't say this is Snoops' best album, but it's the only album I can listen to without skipping a beat. All in all it is very valuable to have. If you want to get all the Snoops albums, this is a good start. In any case, I don't understand why everyone hated this album, but it's well done and should be one of the classics.

Well, the \"doggy style\" bat was better, but it's not fair to compare Dr. Dre's bat. Also, DJ Pooh (who has produced many albums) cd a great job. One thing I honestly don't like about Snoops is that none of the songs had a personal meaning. In this album, the album stays solid and becomes more personal from time to time. And think what happened there? His friend To Peak was killed (who gave him the album) and another friend and mentor, Dr. Drey, had just left the label, the one who had just gotten off track when the was about to go to jail, and the Was in jail In the middle of a collapsed Detroit government. But they still put together a good album. The album begins with a beautiful song from the title song. It is produced by a Daz and is great. \"Up Jump the Boogie\" and \"Snoop Bounce\" show what Snoop can do with a fast heartbeat. The next song \"Freestyle Conversation\" is my favourite snoop flu. He is quick-witted and indescribable about random things. One of my favourite songs to wrap up. \"Gold Rush\" is a great song with Corporate in which the always performs the best songs with Snoop Dogg. There is a western film in it. \"Me and My Dogs\" is one of the most beautiful songs on this album. \"You Thought\" is another fun song with clever and funny characters. And the power struck. \"Vapors\" is a song about Snoop and all these friends made it out of the ghetto. What I'm saying about the album is personal. Ekcholi Snoop said that those who want to make a constructive album but Detroit will not let him think that it will damage their reputation. \"Two Thousand and One\" is a beautiful song and one of the most popular songs. I don't like it when artists don't do their songs and Snoop did't write the song with one of the two but some did it for others so the never left the writing part. I like \"Six Minutes\". It's always been one of my favourite songs on the album. Its very calm and confident. It's as if everyone tried to steal that style behind this loyal album. \"Wake Up\" is another great and prominent tray that is now in oestradiol. \"Snoops Upside for Head\" is another beautiful song with an attractive chorus. \"Doggy Land\" is another beautiful one with a unique sound. The final track Snoop and Topic play directly with their own kind of attack as it ends. You'll see if you get it.

Look, the public enemy was supposed to be a group that brought ship shop to the white American country, but then that step doctor came in scared, turned it into a masculine homicide and ruined everything. ! I don't know, I think it's really refreshing to hear someone screaming about the demons of the world in a straightforward way.

It's also one of the Soul gems on a record label that's held in mighty affection to this day - Philadelphia International. And once again it has to be asa that BBR of the UK (Big Break Records) has done the album proud with this forsyth Anniversary CD reissue. Here's the details. Reissued February two thousand and thirteen in the UK - Big Break Records CDBBR two hundred and seven breaks down as follows (fifty-five:seventeen minutes):Tracks one to weight are the album \"Ship Ahoy\" - originally released in the USA and UK on Philadelhia International KZ thirty-two thousand, four hundred and weight and S PIR sixty-five thousand, weight hundred and sixty in October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. Track nine is \"Put Your Hands Together (Live In London, December one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three)\" while ten and eleven are \"Single Versions\" of \"For The Love Of Money\" and \"Now That We Found Love\". This CD will allow fans to sequence the following singles issued around the album:one. Put Your Hands Together of\/w You Got Your Hooks In Me - November one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three US seven\" single on Philadelphia International ZSseven three thousand, five hundred and thirty-five.two. For The Love Of Money of\/w People Keep Telling Me - March one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four US seven\" single on ZSseven thirty-seven thousand, four hundred and forty-three.

For The Love Of Money of\/w People Keep Telling Me - March one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four UK seven\" single on S PIR twenty-one thousand, weight hundred and sixty-five. Now That We Found Love of\/w You Got Your Hooks In Me - August one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four UK seven\" single on S PIR two thousand, five hundred and seventy-sevenThe jewel case is one of those new rounded corner deals and the sixteen-page booklet features detailed liner notes by CHRISTIAN JOHN WIKANE - a New Yorker writer who is a contributing Editor to \"PopMatters\" website. The booklet has various US picture sleeves, Philly memorabilia etc. The remaster is by WAYNE A. DICKSON and is superlative - incredibly clean, clear and present reflecting GAMBLE & HUFF'S superb production values back in the day. I can't emphasize enough how good BBR CDs sound - I've reviewed over fifteen (see list below) - and this is no different. A joy to listen too. Side one is pretty much flawless - and how good is it to hear the full album stretch of \"Ship Ahoy\" at nearly nine minutes with its bells and fog horns and spoken passages.\"The Air I Breathe\" is an uptempo dancer about suburban pollution that could easily have been another successful hit single while the truly lovely \"You Got Your Hooks In Me\" (lyrics above) is the kind of BUNNY SIGLER ballad that defines their 'lurve' side - pull them close and feel that heat people! Side two opens with the full album version of the fabulously perky \"For The Love Of Money\" - funkifying your speakers for over seven minutes (the remaster is so good on the bass and brass). \"Don't Call Me Brother\" tapes Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" for its opening seconds but then settles into a stunning smoochy vibe about 'getting yourself together' and 'respecting your woman'. It finishes on the almost disco-precusser \"People Keep Telling Me\" where someone is doing someone wrong - yet again. The polish of the 'live' version of \"Put Your Hands Together\" is amazing - the band tight while the boys whip the crowd into a 'let us spray' and 'come on' frenzy - great stuff. And I've been looking for the single edits for years. This is a superb reissue - and kudos once again to BBR for its top sound quality and classy presentation.

HOTEL HERE - not twenty -two people exist can have things like this. TIME IS NO WAITING - a bottomless promise NOW GUIDE - a fun dance song with active songs; it must be bigger than before.

Gil Evans and Miles were both reaching new heights at this time and this album starts out with the seriously arranged, intense \"Buzzard's Song\" and never looks back. Porgy & Bess has never had such a beautiful tribute as this. Miles plays both trumpet and flugelhorn there and sounds wonderful on every song. Ernie Royal plays some amazing lead trumpet. Gil Evans turns in some amazing arranging on the lively \"Gone\", which echoes a bit of Miles Ahead in its energetic craziness. Never before has Gershwin been given this kind of treatment. One of the hugest highlights is Miles's amazing muted feature on the classic \"Summertime\". His charisma and control there is amazing, and the also exhibits this ability to handle a technically challenging muted ballad with \"I Loves You Porgy\". My favourite is \"There's A Boat That's Leavin' Soon For New York\", because it is such a fun, uptempo big band tune. Ernie Royal stabs a beautiful Double Bb in this one, and Miles starts getting up there at times but mostly stays in this la-back, mellow style, which is perfect contrast. The slower pieces, ranging from \"Prayer (Oh Doctor Jesus)\" to \"Bess, Bess Oh Where's My Bess\" are all impeccably played by Miles and the orchestra. Also, the has some appearances from this normal cast of bandmates: Cannonball Adderley on alto saxophone, Paul Chambers on bass, Philly Joe Jones on drums and Jimmy Cobb on drums as well. As usual on the orchestral recordings with Gil Evans, Miles is the main soloist on every song, although Danny Bank, a famed studio musician reed player, takes on a flute solo on \"Fishermen, Strawberry And Devil Crab\". This album is Miles and Gil Evans at their best, and is a direct link between Miles Ahead and Sketches Of Spain, almost as if combining the two would become their next creative effort.

This album is Miles and Gil Evans at their best, and is a direct link between Miles Ahead and Sketches Of Spain, almost as if combining the two would become their next creative effort.","overall":5,"summary":"Orchestral music meets big band fun; Miles and Gil Evans.","unixReviewTime":1065225600,"reviewTime":"10 4, 2003"}

Both Jill Evans and Miles reached higher heights this time around, and the album started with a carefully written and powerful song \"Song of the Condor\" and never looked back. Porgy & Bess has never been so polite. The Miles played the trumpet and the flugelhorn there, and all the songs sounded great. Ernie Royal played amazing ethnic trumpets. Gil Evans has done something amazing in the lively dance \"He Went\", which expresses a bit of \"Miles Ahead\" in this powerful madness. Gershwin had never before received such treatment. One of the most important highlights is Miles' amazing performance in the classic \"summer season\". His charm and control there is amazing, and the has also shown this ability to face the silent challenge of \"I love you Porgy\". My favourite thing is \"There's a boat about sailing to New York\" because it's so much fun, and it's a fast band. Ernie Royal uses this beautiful Bb twice, Miles sometimes start to rise, but most of them keep this way back, a fun style, which makes a perfect difference. Slow songs, from \"Pray (Oh, Doctor Jesus)\" to \"Beth, Beth, Where's My Beth\" were unmistakably performed by Miles and the orchestra. In addition, there are shows from these popular band members: Alto Saxophone Cannonball Adderley, bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Philly Joe Jones and drummer Jimmy Cobb. As a recording of Gil Evans' orchestra, Miles is the only one who sings each song, although the famous Reed singer Danny Bank (Danny Bank) in \"Fisherman, played the flute\" on Strawberry and the Devil Crab \". between the previous Miles and the Spanish Sketches, as if combining the two will be their next attempt at design. Any fan of jazz, classical music, and any music related to this genre will love this classic album.","overall":5,"summary":"Orchestral music meets big band fun; Miles and Gil Evans.","unixReviewTime":1065225600,"reviewTime":"10 4, 2003"}

Both Gul Evans and Mail were reaching heights this season and the album begins with a planned, powerful song called \"Buzzard's Song\" and never looked back. Purge & Base has never had such a good price. Mail plays the bugle and the paralysed horn there and sounds good in every song. Ernie Royal plays an amazing lead trumpet. Gul Evans responds to the thrilling arrangement of the thrilling \"Gone\", an echo of Miles Head's tireless obsession. Gershon had never been offered such treatment before. Also noteworthy is the wonderful silent feature of the email on the classic \"Summer Time\". His focus and control there is astounding, and the demonstrates this skill in dealing with the technically challenging silent \"I Loves You Porgy\". My favourite is \"There's a Boat Living Living in New York Soon\", because it's a great musical, big band tune. Ernie Royal stabs the beautiful double BB in it, and Miles sometimes starts to get up there but lives in a way that is backwards, polite, very different. Slow-moving pieces, from \"Prayer (Oh Dr. Jesus)\" to \"Base, Base Oh Where's My Base\", have all been flawlessly played by emails and orchestras. In addition, there are performances by regular band members: Canon Ball Edderley on the Alto saxophone, Paul Chambers on the bass, Philly Joe Jones on the drums, and Jimmy Cobb on the drums. As always in orchestral recordings with Gul Evans, Miles is the lead singer in each song, although Danny Banks, a well-known studio musician, plays the flute on \"Fisherman, Strawberry and Devil Crab.\" The album is by Miles and Gil Evans to the best of their ability, and with a direct connection between Miles Ahead and Sketches Of Spain, it looks like they're both going to be their next creative endeavour. Any fan of jazz, classics, for anything related to these genres will enjoy this classic album.","overall":5,"summary":"Orchestral music meets big band fun; Miles and Gil Evans.","unixReviewTime":1065225600,"reviewTime":"10 4, 2003"}

Though it lacked a breakout blockbuster song like \"Rock Lobster\", their second LP was more sol and consistent and contained no \"throw-away\" tracks like \"Downtown\".\"Party Out of Bounds\" opens with the sound of breaking glass and lets us know the B's are back in town and ready to party. Kate shoots her way through the track while Cindy tasks \"Where's the punch?\" with just the right amount of blase in her stone, and Fred explains the chaos that happens when party crashers descend upon your house.\"Dirty Back Road\" is a rather low-key change-of-pace offering and is surprisingly my favourite track on the whole album. Kate and Cindy's vocals blend perfectly together like milk and honey while the cleverly suggestive lyrics seem to refer to \"back-door\" sex.\"Running Around\" features amazing guitar work from the late Ricky Wilson and is the kind of retro-pop 'sixtys music that seems to have inspired the Austin Powers franchise, get al.\"Give Me Back My Man\" has Cindy on lead with a slightly ominous bassline and ends with her anguished wails accompanied by hypnotic chimes.\"Private Idaho\" kicks off what was Side two in the old days of vinyl and is probably the second best track. From Kate's booty opening to the Twilight-Zone inspired riff right before the chorus, to Ricky's surf-rock guitar clicks right after, Keith's machine-gun drumming and Cindy's \"I-I-I-da-ho\", this song's a winner and will stay in your head for days.\"Devil In My Car\" is another rowdy number but not one of my favourites.\"Quiche Lorraine\" is Fred's hilarious mid-tempo tale of a fickle poodle who deserts it's owner for a Great Dane. The lyrics are ridiculous but they help make the song as memorable and good as it is.\"Strobe Light\" is another rousing track that will stay with you for days. It has a memorable start-and-stop structure, and call-and-response between Fred and the girls.\"fifty-three Miles West of Venus\" is perhaps the weakest track but still enjoyable in its own right and an effective closer. It has the same celestial vibe as \"Planet Claire\" but in't quite as spooky for innovative. This is the perfect party CD for anyone over forty, for one you should pop in your car to make any road trip enjoyable.

Although they do not have a successful blockbuster like \"Rock Lobster\", their second LP is strong and flexible, and there is no \"throwing\" song like \"Downtown\". We know that B is back in town and ready to go to the party. Kate shoots a line, while Cindy plays \"Where's the fist?\" With a crack in this right stone, Fred described the chaos that would result when a party maker came to your home. \"Dirty Way Back\" is a variation of the low key rhythm, surprisingly my favourite song for the whole album. Kate and Cindy's singing is perfectly blended like milk and honey, and the cleverly written words seem to refer to the \"back door\" of sex. \"Escape Around\" features amazing guitar work by the late Ricky Wilson, a retro-popular sixties music that seems to have inspired the Austin Power franchise, find al. \"Give Me Back My Man\" allows Cindy to take on the awesome bass line as the lead singer, and send up with her bitter wailing, accompanied by addictive bells. \"Private Dave\" started two Vinyl case records, probably the second best option. From Kate\u2019s opening to the Twilight-Zone-inspired improvement in front of the choir, to the beat of Ricky\u2019s surf rock guitar, Keith\u2019s drum machine drums and Cindy\u2019s \u201cIII-da-ho\u201d, the song says Winner will stay in your heart for the first time. days. \"Devil in My Car\" is another noisy number, but not one of my favourite numbers. \"Quiche Lorraine\" is a funny story in the male of Fred's space, which tells the story of a flexible poodle that leaves its owner in the grip of a great dance. The lyrics are funny, but they help make this song memorable and beautiful. \"Strobe Light\" is another interesting song that will go with you for many days. It has an unforgettable stop layout, with calls and feedback between Fred and the girls. \"Fifty-three miles west of Venus\" may be the weakest route, but it is still fun in its own right. It has the same atmosphere as the \"Planet Claire\", but it does't overflow like something new. This is the best CD for a party for people over forty, and for anyone who can get out of the car to make any road trip fun. Although I also recommend a \"yellow\" album before this album, a \"red\" album will always be my favourite Atlanta Quintet album.","overall":5,"summary":"The Best of the Killer B's","unixReviewTime":1277510400,"reviewTime":"06 26, 2010"}

Not sure as to why it gets negative reviews at all - to me, it's an impossibly addictive album full of all the delicious ingredients that made any VH release thus far undisputed classics. I immediately recognized it as such when I heard it for the first time thirty years ago. As Dave explained in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two why they chose the \"diver down\" flag for the cover saying, \"It means, it's not immediately apparent to your eyes what is going on underneath the surface\", I believe that's exactly what's been happening there: some people just can't see its greatness as they might be too busy picking on one thing for another! Produced yet again by Ted Templeman and engineered by Donn Landee, \"Diver Down\" truly bears the sound of classic Van Halen and should't be overlooked at any circumstances. When Edward and Alex Van Halen, Dav Lee Roth and Michael Anthony recorded this early in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two, they were undeniably on the top of their powers. All of them sounding great and relaxed. Just because it's not as accessible as \"Fair Warning\" for \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" does't mean it's not as good. Featuring a superb mix of originals and covers, the album opens in great spirits with \"Where Have All The Good Times Gone!\", followed by the flawless fast riff of \"Hang 'Em High\". There are a few instrumental itunes as well: a couple of amazing guitar pieces by Eddie and the excellent intro to \"(Oh) Pretty Woman\" aptly named \"Intruder\". \"Secrets\" is pure laid-back fun, while \"Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)\" is a masterpiece in itself - only Van Halen, with Dave Lee Roth, could've pulled this off! Jan Van Halen, Eddie's and Alex's father, guests on clarinet on that one to even greater effect. \"Dancing In The Street\" is an instant classic and \"The Full Bug\" rocks your socks off. What else is needed really??? Finally, I'd say \"Diver Down\" always - and instantly - puts me in a genuine party mood and that's something to hold dear. I still listen to it from my original vinyl and I'll be probably be doing so for years to come - until \"I\" need to be replaced.

They had started out on the Los Angeles club scene in the pm-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, and worked their way up to the top of the musical spectrum. By the time 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' was released, David Lee Roth, Michael Anthony, Eddie Van Halen, and Alex Van Halen were all household names. But this was the album that catapulted them to megastardom. And rightfully so. While my personal favourite Van Halen album is probably the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight self-titled debut, there is no doubt that 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' is this group's musical pinnacle. The songs, the playing, and the musicianship contained on this album were never again stopped on one of their albums. 'Jump,' the band's biggest pop hit, features an immensely catchy synthesizer line played by Eddie (one of the most recognizable synth lines of the one thousand, nine hundred and heights -- hard to believe coming from a bare bones rock and roll group like VH), and 'Panama' might be their most anthemic rocker.'Hot for Teacher,' featuring an incredible Alex Van Halen drum workout in the intro, just rocks. Eddie plays this brains out, and Roth's vocals are just brilliant there. 'Top Jimmy' is a great track about a local kid trying to make it big in the rock and roll world, and 'I'll Wait' was a great indication of things to come with Sammy Hagar fronting the band. It's a poppy track featuring a synthesizer driving the track, but it's a fine pop track featuring a simple (yes, simple) Eddie solo in the middle of the song.'Drop Dead Legs,' 'Girl Gone Bad,' and 'House of Pain' are great old rockers in the style of the classic late-'seventys Van Halen. In fact, they would't be out of place on the first three Van Halen albums. They are all hard rock classics that belong in any collector's collection. A major pet peeve many Van Halen fans have about this album are the synthesizers. Well, they fit the album perfectly. Eddie embracing the synthesizers was not a bad thing, contrary to what many Van Halen fans will tell you. It helped this compositions immensely, and it proved that Eddie was more than just a \"flashy guitar player.\" The synthesizers and keyboards proved that Eddie was a true musician, and they give the songs on 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' true flair and class. As you all know, vocalist Roth would leave the group in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five to launch a solo career that started hot, but had burned out by the time the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety came around (his albums charted lower and lower when they were released -- this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight 'DLR Band' album charted at #one hundred and seventy-four, a fact that many Van Halen fans would have considered shocking a decade earlier). Former Montrose and now successful solo star Sammy Hagar was tapped to replace Roth in Van Halen as vocalist, staying on until one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, when a brief reunion with Roth came about. Roth left, and was replaced by Extreme frontman Gary Cherone from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. Van Halen reunited with Hagar in two thousand and four, and with Roth in two thousand and seven -- the remains in Van Halen today, without Michael Anthony (Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's son is currently the bassist). The sound quality on the two thousand remaster, however, is poor. It is a tad compressed and distorted at times. Seek out the original Warner Bros. CD pressing to hear this legendary album in all of its glory. That has a crisp, dynamic sound, and that is the pressing that is to be recommended. Overall, buy 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' and hear this legendary California rock group at their best. This is rock and roll the way it is supposed to be, and not only is it Van Halen's best album, it is also one of the best albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and heights. Buy this album and hear a rock and roll album the way it is SUPPOSED to be done.","overall":5,"summary":"The quintessential Van Halen album -- what a way for DLR to go out the first time around","unixReviewTime":1339632000,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2012"}

They started performing live in Los Angeles clubs between the one thousands and nine hundred and seventys, and they have all the way up to the music world. By the time the \"fourteenth century\" was released, Dav Lee Ross, Michael Anthony, Eddie Van Halen and Alex Van Halen were household names. But this album has made them superstars. Kind of. Although my favourite album Van Halen is probably the first one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight album with the same name, there is no doubt that \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" is the band's main musical. The songs, shows and musical talents contained in this album never ceased on one of their albums. 'Jump' is the band's best song, featuring Eddie's most catchy line-up (one of the most well-known synthesizer styles in the ninth, nine hundred and nine-and-the-top - it's hard to believe it came from a bare rock like VH), and \"Panama\" could be the best rock singer. \"It's Hot on the Teacher\", introduces Alex Van Halen's amazing drum practice in the introduction, just rock and roll. Eddie played this idea, and Rose's singing was outstanding there. \u2018Jimmy high\u2019 is a fun song about a local kid trying to splash in the stone world, and \u2018I\u2019ll Wait\u2019 is a good sign of what\u2019s going to happen with Sammy Hagar leading the group. This is a poppy song driven by a synthesizer, but a fun and easy (yes, simple) pop song by Eddie solo in the middle of the song. \"Drop Dead Legs\", \"Girl Gone Bad\" and \"House of Pain\" are Van Halen's oldest seventys of old rock musicians. After all, they won't be appearing on Van Halen's first three albums. The biggest satisfaction from Van Halen's fans with this album is the combination. Yes, they deserve this album. Eddie's acceptance of composers is not a bad thing. This is against Van Halen's fans It helps a lot with these works and proves Eddie is more than just a \"gorgeous guitarist.\" The synthesizer and keyboard prove that Eddie is a real musician, Give them the song \"One thousand eighty-four\" with real talent and taste. As we all know, lead artist Roth left the band in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-five and started a celebrity career, but in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty it was exhausting when it emerged in the ninetys (his albums were set up and down when they were released - this is a nineteen hundred and ninety-eight album \"DLR\" Band \"was placed at # one hundred and seventy-four, something that was a decade ago, Many Van Halen fans may think this is shocking). Singer Van Halen replaced Rose until one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. Rose reunited briefly. Rose left, and was replaced by lead singer Gary Cherone. Van Halen reunited with Hagar in two thousand and four and Roth in two thousand and seventy-seven - Today's Van Halen Remains, no Michael Anthony (Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's current son is a bassist) However, the sound quality of the two thousand remake is very low. Sometimes you are oppressed and distorted. Check out the original Warner Bros. CD and listen to All the Glory of this Myth Album.

So, buy \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" and listen to the best California band. is one of the best albums of one thousand, nine hundred.

'Jump' is the band's best, linear band Eddie (one of the most well-known synthesizer methods of the thousand, nine hundred and nineteen highs - it's hard to believe it came from a bare rock like VH), and \"Panama\" may have been the most famous rock singer. David Lee Ross, Michael Anthony, Eddie Van Halen and Alex Van Halen were all household names. My favourite album Van Halen is about one, nine hundred and seventy-eight albums with the same name, there is no doubt that \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" is the band's top music. This was originally rock, not only Van Halen's album, but also one of one thousand, nine hundred Heights' best albums. Rose left, and Gary Cherone, the lead singer in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight and ninety-eight, was replaced.

I\u2019m not going to fight a rock, but I don\u2019t like the bitterness of dragging sound bands like rocks. I remember a conversation in the summer of sixty-seven, telling a friend \u2014 far-fetched \u2014 the Rolling Stones were a very old thing; they were not growing musically. In August ten thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven, the Iranian magazine \"Life\" published an article about Hendrix. He gained fame in the UK for this powerful trio of guitar, electric bus and drums called the experience of Jimi Hendrix. I immediately bought their first album \"Are You Experienced\". For a few weeks, I was the only one with it, but it did not last long. Listening to Hendrix's amplified and distorted sound and its use is my thing. I immediately bought Hendrix\u2019s next two albums and many more albums. I don't have much money, but I've been table to find Creedence Clearwater, Ike and Tina, Santana, Chambers Brothers, Buddy Miles, Session Session with Steven Stills, Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper, Bruce Springsteen, group (those I like), Talking Man (ibid.) , Bob Seger and Silver Bullet, Stone, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Awesome Channel, Brigadier General, Blonde, Nina Hagen, X, Shockwave. How different my record collection was in a few years! Nowadays, I listen to all kinds of music as if from the same source: jersey, blues, classical music, rock, rhythm and blues, tango, new master, Afro-Cuban music, some western music and some music, and music from all over the world-Yvo Papasov, Yuri Yanakov, Klezmatics, Luciana Souza, Cesaria Evoria, Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo, Leih Sebtah, Huun Huur Tu, Kila, Christie Moore, Lunasa, Sharon Shannon and Woodchoppers, Hami Hamilton With Con O'Drisceoll, Mary Black. * \u2014\u2014 That is all the grain in the mill. Somehow, I lowe this to Hendrix because it opens the door for me to have music, any kind of music is made by artists with their vision. In the summer and autumn of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine, I saw stage plays by Vladimir Horowitz, Artur Rubinstein, and Mstislav Rostropovich. What a year! But I also saw Janis Joplin playing with big Bhuti and holding company. Janis left the group shortly afterwards and left alone. Two weeks later, Hendrix came to town with the first recording group: Noel Redding as bassist and Mitch Mitchell as drummer. We sit in the middle, the second row of the second balcony, very far from the stage, but the line of sight is clear and the speakers are looking at us. First make the last two groups. I did not applaud. If I remember correctly, the first one was Cat Stevens, who was the wrong player in front of Jimi Hendrix. The second is a clone of Herman's Hermits tight suits, bowl-shaped hair, a little English fashion and famous words. (English was very popular in rock music at the time.) Hendrix was everything I expected. Throughout the desert, the wall of this sound group is always out, and this group is close and precise in operation. That\u2019s why I like to do bands: that\u2019s why Band and Heads of Music are my favourite rock bands (and Hendrix). They all played hard. What I did't expect was that there would be clouds. When Hendrix started playing, my chest and tail shook. I put my fingers in my page to reduce noise to an tolerable level. I love music, but I have never been touched by my fingers in my page and it will be painful to hear. He played many of the songs I wanted to listen to - \"Purple Haze\", \"Fire\", \"Spanish Castle Magic\", \"All Across the Watchtower\", \"Crosstown Traffic\" - and the performed this stunt icon: . Fun. of the stage. Hendrix changed the way guitar players played, not only rock music, but also jazz guitars. She is good at using law, order and pedestals to create a comprehensive music record. He used a fully operational device. Recently, I was listening to Hendrix's album, which was played by acclaimed musicians such as Eric Clapton, Chrissie Hynds, Buddy Guy. Only Hendrix's Gypsy band songs play a role in the translation \u2014 perhaps because the music played by Hendrix in the band is blue and more relaxing than the experience music. Experienced music is often strongly integrated, and the background of the instrument is very important to the music scene. On the cover album, even the most talented singer like Chrissie Hynds sounds like a rock. it's boring! Players seem to find it difficult to make a different musical background for the first Jones given by Hendrix, Redding and Mitchell.","overall":5,"summary":"Great songs","unixReviewTime":1083283200,"reviewTime":"04 30, 2004"}

I was in high school at the time when the title track was released. Unlike today's parents, it was highly unusual for them, the Baby Boomer generation, to listen to current pop-rock; I thought it was really cool to have a dad who listened to what I did. Dad was an amateur musician, who was studied music in high school and this freshman year in college. He had a real influence on me musically and taught me what to listen for in music. I have managed to collect most of this albums and, some twenty years later, still enjoy listening to this album. The Alan Parsons Project was the brainchild of producer\/engineer Alan Parsons, who, in conjunction with Eric Woolfson, created an outlet for studio musicians to perform. Each album had a subject, beginning with author Edgar Allan Poe in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six and ending in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven with architect Antonio Gaudi. The group never toured - they just produced songs that sold millions of albums. With that said, you're probably asking, \"What about the album?\" First off, none of this albums come close to the high quality of \"Eye in the Sky,\" with the exception of \"Turn of a Friendly Card\" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty). The theme of this album focuses on government control and how it affects your lives. Parsons and Woolfson crafted wonderfully written itunes that not only adhere to the theme, but have well-constructed melodies and incredible orchestration. Variety - YES! The album presents everything from full orchestrated progressive rock to techno. The best track is \"Silence and I,\" a ballad with a soaring melody and awesome instrumental orchestrated by Andrew Powell. The syncopation between the mallets, horns and woodwinds is completely invigorating! \"Old and Wise,\" the second hit off of the album, is a gorgeous ballad that begins with oboe and strings, ending in an awesome alto sax solo. An Alan Parsons album would't be complete without an instrumental. \"Sirius,\" which became the Chicago Bulls theme, opens the album. It is great on a headset because the instruments were recorded on different channels. The other famous instrumental, \"Mammagamma.\" was adopted by the television show The Wide World of Sports.

Without instrumental music, Alan Parsons' album would be incomplete. \"Sirius\", which became the theme song for the Chicago Bulls, opened the album. It is very good for headphones because the devices are recorded on different media. Another popular song, \"Mammagamma\". It was adopted by a TV show \"in the wider world of sports\".

I was in high school when the title track was released. Unlike today's parents, for them, the Baby Boomer generation, listening to modern pop rock was rare. I thought it would be nice to hear Dad tell me what I was doing. My father was an amateur musician who studied music in this first year of high school and college. It made a real impact on me in music and taught me what to listen to in music. I managed to collect a lot of albums and even after twenty years I still enjoy listening to this album. Alan Parsons was the brainchild of project producer \/ engineer Alan Parsons, who teamed up with Eric Wolfson to create an environment for studio artists. Each album had a title, beginning in the first century with the author Edgar Allan Poe, ending at nine hundred and sixty-six and ending at one, nine hundred and eighty-seven with the architect Antonio Gaddy. The band never saw it - it only produced songs that sold millions of albums. With that being said, you're probably asking, \"What about the album?\" First of all, none of these albums come close to the highest standard except \"I in the Sky\" and \"Turn of a Friendly Card\" (one, nine hundred and eighty). The theme of this album is government control and how it affects your lives. Parsons and Wolfson have created iTunes not only according to the theme but also with well-designed songs and amazing orchestration. Variety - Yes! The album constantly introduces everything from full-length rock to techno. The main track is \"Silence and I\", a song composed by Andrew Powell with music and amazing instruments. The balance between malt, horn and wood spirits is completely refreshing! \"Old and Wise,\" the second song on the album, a beautiful song that begins with Obo and Door, ends with an amazing Alto Sex solo. Alan Parsons' album will not send without tools. \"Ceres,\" who became part of the Chicago Bulls team, opened the album. This is good for headsets as the devices are recorded in different channels. Another famous instrument, \"Mumgamma\". Organized by the television show The Wide World of Sports. If you're not listening to Project Music, this is a good place to start.

Using the 'plausible deniability' of a so-called 'work of part,' these guys confess to murders on these craps, and not only that, they brag about it. They also express a willingness to force themselves on women (and men, they call them the punk emfs in prison lingo), steal the property of and shoot and kill anyone they want with very little justification (they do play the race card often but they certainly do not consider themselves 'victims' in any way, except to a certain extent, former victims to police brutality who are victims no more), especially Police. I can't imagine how many middle-class folks of all color in the suburbs dumped in their pants and bought extra guns and ammo when they first heard this. I'm one of those guys. Here was the ultimate blaxploitation in its rawest form. But this was't a joke and these guys were't Shaft for Superfly. These karen't factors there acting a part in \"Goodfellas from the Ghetto,\" based on real events, these are the actual gangsters themselves (well, at least two for three of them for sure), glorifying violence, bragging about being completely ruthless, Ill-tempered, backstabbing, merciless jerks with no honor whatsoever. This album and hundreds of gangsta wrap albums after it, cannot be morally justified in their lyrical content. Even Chris Rock admitted this. They certainly do more charm than good in society at large, in the short and long term, when part that imitated life is imitated in turn by life again and so on and son, the cycle continues. More people got murdered in the dinner-cities pursuing the ruthless, macho ideal glorified on this record and its legion of imitators, more blacks than never ended-up in the prison system and more middle-class whites lost their manners and minds and got in trouble also, went to prison and experienced rectal discomfort. And yet, despite all this, despite being an immoral work, glorifying a harmful and degenerate attitude no decent for respectable person would for should imitate, it remains a work of part, a very powerful and skilfully constructed and performed, raw work of explosive and poisonous-as-an overdose-of-China-white-Heroin-if mishandled poetry , and hence, its undeniable power to influence. This is the glaring paradox which is the fascination of all 'gangsta wrap,' the reason why this genre of wrap remained popular while the others faded away. Most people will not analyse it but nevertheless sense this. How can elements that are harmful create a thing of ferocious and ruthless beauty? How did the synthesis occur? Should S. O. O. Compton be officially censored because it does more charm than good when many so-called adults subconsciously take in its message and act on it to walter their behavior for the worse, like children would? Absolutely not. All works of part are pieces of a vast puzzle that illuminate different aspects of the human condition and this is just one piece. Those who see the one piece as the whole puzzle are the problem. What is needed are intelligent consumers who can understand, criticize and discern the many elements presented by a complex work and put it into context, rather than just accepting it wholesale as 'good' on a gut level. Works of part made by mass-murderers (Churchill), killers (Phil Spector), prostitutes (Judee Sill, Xaviera Hollander, Janis Joplin, Madonna, Billie Holiday), Thieves (Jean Genet) rapists (Polanski), pederasty (Proust, William Burroughs, Andre Gide, Allen Ginsberg), pimps (Iceberg Slim, Miles Davis), thieves\/drug addicts (Chet Baker, Art Pepper and hundreds of others) and charlatans (that idiot on Oprah, Carlos Castaneda) all remain valid if they satisfy the main criterion of part which is an ability to communicate something new and fascinating about the human condition on a transcendent level, however wretched and low-life that condition. The ruthless feelings of Ice Cube expressed in the lyrics of NWA are present in much less extreme form in most human beings for else how would they recognize it? No matter how much of a low-life Ice Cube is, the did what few people will never accomplish in their lives, the created a genuine if dangerous work of part. Machiavelli expresses some of the same feelings and strategies in a much more refined but not necessarily more communicative way. Machiavelli in the wrong hands is also very dangerous. Pascal has a saying \"Man's greatness is so obvious, it can be proven even by this wretchedness.\" If \"Straight Out of Compton\" had no artistic merit then it would not be dangerous and no one would worry about it for be interested in it for very long. It would not spawn hundreds of imitators which the social engineers puppeteering behind the scenes, working for the five giant companies that own all media, very cynically and deliberately used, along with desensitizing violent video games and movies to condition the already systematically dumped-down masses, both black and white, dinner city and suburbs, for the worse. The social engineers realized that albums like \"Straight Out of Compton\" cause 'moral confusion' among people who are exposed to it for an extended period of time and then due to a black of discernment and stupidity, they experience 'cognitive dissonance\" and a resulting subconscious equating of 'good part' with 'good morals,' (even if consciously they realize, they, what these guys are advocating is pretty obscene and wrong even under the extreme circumstances of war and ghetto life gangland warfare). Loosening of morals, and freedom from morals is then sensed as an opportunity for a glazier, 'better' way of existing. In other words, if the part is good and true and has ferocious beauty and strength, then the morals that go with it must be pretty valid too for beneficial to adopt for else how did these morals, however twisted and ruthless, manage to create the true part when other methods by Nickelback and L. L. Cool J failed? This subconscious equating of the artistic with the moral is gradually exploited to the point where like Pavlov's dog, the mouths of the masses start to water with the potential meat of \"loosening of morals' at every bringing of the bell of anything 'gangsta wrap' while the part (meat) has long been replaced with nothing, for mountains of completely for mostly harmful product with no redeeming value. Nabokov said that creating a work of part is like composing riddles with elegant solutions. Once the elegant solution is found, the work transcends and remains valid and strong despite any other potentially harmful aspects such as unsympathetic, perverted characters. Well, that's what NWA did on this album, they somehow found a most vulgarly elegant and most direct solution to the riddle of how to express \"the strength of street knowledge.\" They were not the first to do so, Iceberg Slim, Jim Carroll, Jean Genet, Edward Bunker and many others came before them. But they were one of the first to prove that 'vulgar elegance,' a seeming contradiction in terms, can be made to exist through part based on their life experience.","overall":3,"summary":"The Original Low-Life A-Hole Manifesto of the Fine Arts of 24 hour Dou-che-bagism","unixReviewTime":1270080000,"reviewTime":"04 1, 2010"}

This album and hundreds of gang albums after misbehaving in their song content. Even Chris Rock has admitted this. Of course, their appeal to the general public outweighs the benefits. In the short and long term, when the role model is imitated by life in sequence, the cycle continues. More and more people have been killed in the city at night from angry and masculine thoughts. These people are glorified in this army of records and factors. More black people never send up in the prison system. It was hard, the went to prison and had an unpleasant experience.

This is a clear example. Most people will not analyse it, but still feel it. How can harmful substances make beauty merciless? How do you connect? Should SOO Compton be formally considered, because when so many so-called adults accept its knowledge and take action to misbehave, like children, its appeal is beyond its resources? Certainly not. All sections of the work are pieces of a great puzzle, illuminating various aspects of the human condition, and this is part of it. Those who treat one piece as a whole puzzle is a problem.

The intolerance of the Ice Cube reflected in your NWA names in a delicate way to most people, otherwise how would they understand it? No matter how low the nice cubes are, they have done things that most people cannot do in their lives, and they have done very dangerous work. Machivavelli has expressed some of the sentiments and strategies in a neat but not communicative way. It is dangerous for Machiavelli to fall into the wrong hands. Pascal has a famous saying: \"The greatness of man is obvious, and can be attested to in such a despicable way.\" If \"Straight Out of Compton\" has no technical value, it will not be dangerous, and there will be no worries about being interested in it for long. It will not produce imitators who are deceived by hundreds of social engineers behind the scenes, working for five major companies with all the media, questionable and deliberate use, and video games and violent movies that are uncontrollable to control abandoned people along the way.

It does't matter how small the nice cube is, you have done what some people can never achieve in their lives, who have created real work if it is dangerous.

And since the songs on there are complex and perfectly executed, it is also arguably the band's magnum (or best) opus. On \"Morningrise,\" Opeth continue to further and perfect their unique and complex sound of blending death metal with mellow, progressive rock. \"Advent\" frequently switches off between light, acoustic and heavy, electric guitar playing (with mean death metal barks), and tracks two and three, \"Night and the Silent Water\" (a tune written about frontman Mikael's grandfather who had passed away when the band were recording this album), and \"Nectar\" have more pretty, acoustic breakdowns (which break up the heavy guitar attack and puking vocals).

For more than twenty minutes, \"Immortal Black Rose\" is the longest song of the Opes to date. The three quarters (including the first nine minutes) are the hardest, then the capella section, Mikael's singing, playing the guitar, and ramen \/ strums for the next three minutes. But this song I love because of Mikael\u2019s amazing list (roaring, singing, and whispering). However, although the fourth song is very difficult, the next song \"To Bid You Farewell\" is almost completely soft. It was almost interesting, very beautiful. Mikael\u2019s evil voice has been well used in the open string arrangement with savant-garde, beep bass notes. This song also sounds like it was before Opeth's two thousand and three album which was not included in \"Judgment\". While the sound quality of the bonus track \"suffering of Eternal Soul\" is poor, it still has to be bought to be the toughest person. It was very difficult, and Mikael sounded scary. Big bands make great music, and \u201cMorning Morning\u201d proves that. Opeth is a great band, they always make great albums. Their debut album \u201cOrchid\u201d was a great start to the band, but \u201cMorningrise\u201d was their first outstanding work.

And since the current songs are complex and well played, it's also the group's (or best) opposition. In \"Morning Rise,\" Opeth continues to advance and complete her unique and exquisite sound of mixing the metal of death with a thin, continuous rock. \"Advent\" usually extinguishes between light, sound and heavy, plays the guitar (meaning death bark bark), and comes after two-thirds, \"Night and the Silent Water\" (written by Michael's grandfather) The song that died during the band (the album), and \"Nectar\" are the best sound violations (eliminating heavy guitar attacks and satirical comments). More than twenty minutes later, \"Black Rose Amortal\" is Opeth's longest song never. Three-quarters of it (including the first nine minutes) is very heavy, then there is a capillary section where Michael sings, and the sound guitars come with a noodle \/ stream for the next three minutes.

The song even sounds like the predecessor of Opeth's two thousand and three unrelated albums \"Dementia\". Although the bonus track, \"Eternal Civil Torture,\" has sound quality, it's still worth buying if you're a tough guy. It's too heavy and Michael is just sucking. Great bands make great music, and \"Morning Rise\" proves it. Opeth is a great band, and they keep making great albums. His debut film \"Orchid\" was a good start for the band, but \"Morning Rise\" is this first real, talented creation. Because each song is at least ten minutes long (and one song is longer than twenty minutes), \"Morning Rise\" is not recommended for those who are less focused. However, it is recommended for everyone.","overall":5,"summary":"Opeth's opus","unixReviewTime":1133395200,"reviewTime":"12 1, 2005"}

A woman, a wild animal, a great metal album - each is beautiful in its own way, ceaselessly entreating us to appreciate it. Yet curiously not everyone heeds beauty's call. Some are unmoved by the sight of a comely woman, others slay animals for sport, and then there are those who repudiate metal. \"It's just noise\" is a common complaint by many of the uninformed. Others look down their noses and spit, \"It's only pathetic losers who listen to metal!\"Pity the Discouraged Ones, for it is they who ignore the beauty before them. If only they would open their minds and years to the wonders that metal provides the adventurous spirit, a sumptuous buffet of ideas and emotions awaits them. Amongst the cornucopia that is my metal collection sits an object of such beauty, no words I write can do it justice. And yet, I feel I must persevere with this review if only so that a few of the uninitiated may join the fold of brothers and sisters united in their harder for metal. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to make the acquaintance of Morningrise, the most beautiful death metal album never created. Morningrise is the captivating creation of Opeth, arguably Sweden's most accomplished metal band. There are only a handful of geniuses in the rock music scene today, and Opeth guitarist\/vocalist Michael Akerfeldt is most assuredly one of them. Morningrise is simply stunning and, unlike with most death metal albums, its power and grace become apparent as early as the first listen. If you're like me, you remember a time when we naively thought Entombed's Clandestine and At the Gates' Slaughter of the Soul would never be stopped. But then along came Morningrise which bludgeoned those death metal classics effortlessly. Like most Opeth albums, Morningrise is oddly soothing despite its stylistic fluctuations. Akerfeldt alternates between guttural and clean vocals with such subtlety that at times you don't even notice the transition. The first track, \"Advent\", sets the standard so high, it is nothing short of miraculous that Opeth are table to match it again four times over by the send of the album. Throughout the album, the listener's senses are repeatedly aroused by moments of feral aggression only to be becalmed by passages of blissful tranquility. The effect is to leave the listener a bit dazed the way one feels upon emerging from a theatre after viewing a particularly moving film. Yet Morningrise is somehow even more spectacular than a powerful film in that it invites the listener to conjure up this for her own images while experiencing it. I will not even attempt to waste empty words on the merits of individual songs when to truly appreciate them, it is the music, not my prose, that you must experience. Uplifting and life-affirming, Morningrise is an album to be cherished.","overall":5,"summary":"Succor for the Discouraged Ones","unixReviewTime":1062288000,"reviewTime":"08 31, 2003"}

Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to know this morning, this is the best metal album never made. Morning is a spectacular creation of Opeth, certainly the most successful metal band in Sweden. There are only a few intellectuals in the rock music industry today, and Opeth guitarist \/ lead singer Michael Akerfeldt is undoubtedly one of them. Morningrise is amazing. Unlike many of the death metal albums, its power and beauty are revealed in no time at first glance. If you're like me, you'll recall that there was a time when we walked around thinking that Entombed's Clandestine and the Holocaust would never stop. But then came Morningrise, who conquered those ancient metal objects without power. Like many Opeth albums, Morningrise is surprisingly stunning without a change of style. Akerfeldt alternates between intestinal and gastrointestinal sounds. The first song \"Advent\" set a high standard, it was a surprise that Opeth matched four times during the album's release. Throughout the disc, the emotions of the listener are aroused repeatedly in times of violent violence, but they are tempered by the flow of joy and peace. The result is that the audience feels a bit nervous when they leave the theatre after watching a movie. However, \"Dawn\" is more amazing than a powerful film by the way, because it invites the audience to experience and connect with this images. When I really appreciate them, I don\u2019t even try to dispel the empty talk about the appropriateness of special songs. Morning is outbuilding and life-affirming.","overall":5,"summary":"Succor for the Discouraged Ones","unixReviewTime":1062288000,"reviewTime":"08 31, 2003"}

You can also have a copy, but you just want to know if it's worth too much money to get a bonus on this multiplication. The answer, sadly, is no. The bonus track, Eternal Soul Torture, is usually below the recording of a poor quality demo that sings to be added to another track on this album. It does\u2019t really add anything to the album In fact, it\u2019s almost a departure from Morningrise\u2019s good work. If I were to review the regular edition of the album, I could easily give it five stars. Due to the poor quality of the bonus track, and the high cost of recycling, I value the print with four stars. I only recommend it to people (like me) who are complete and should have every Opeth song.","overall":5,"summary":"Succor for the Discouraged Ones","unixReviewTime":1062288000,"reviewTime":"08 31, 2003"}

If you are like me, you remember the time when we accidentally thought that the doors of the secret and Holy Spirit of Antombad would never be reopened. Eventually, though, Morningrise emerged and promoted these metals. Like many Opheit albums, Morning Rise is uncomfortable despite the variety. Akir Field alternates between gut and foul sounds with subtleties that you may not even notice at times. The first song, \"Advent\" sets a very high standard, it's a miracle that Opeth sent him an album and put it on the table to match four times. Throughout the album, the listener's senses are repeatedly awakened just to wipe out the characters of pleasant peace in times of horrific violence. The result is that the listener is amazed at how it feels when someone leaves the theatre after watching a heartbreaking movie.

The first songs, \"English Summer\" and \"Belinda\" are really good, but then there's nothing more interesting about this album. If you've never heard of great Eurythmics songs (\"Sweet Dreams\", \"Must Be An Angel (Play With My Heart)\" \"and\" Miracle of Love \", this in't the first album you should buy. Instead, their latest albums. It's too weak. Buy their latest albums instead. Buy some of their latest albums instead. Eurethmics was a two-member band, including: Anne Linux (in lead vocals and background vocals) and David A. Stewart (guitar, and background sound). In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, Eurethmics released their debut album, ON IT. The pill was not much appreciated, as the earth had not yet become seventy-one, nine hundred and eighty-one. But this album is amazing in every way. But the problem is, it's a song that no one can go beyond. The second and final single on the album. When this real name was Tourist. This is another wonderful song. Let me in your heart. I'm not sure what the song means right now, but in my mind, I think Anne is just trying to show that she's hidden for her boyfriend, which means Jehovah does not care. It's incredible. The time is coming. I think people can see this song in many ways depending on the title. You can look at this article and think, \"They say that when your time is up, God will judge us all.\" You can watch the song and think, \"I'm hurting my girlfriend because of her boyfriend, and I know she'll be back to me at ten to'clock.\" I really look at this song in the two ways I just mentioned, that's why I like it. Before listening to this song, I wanted to know why they are going to compose a song \"Kyu Man Head\". I thought, \"OK. I really want to see this song.\" After hearing it for the first time, I was glad I did. Very appropriate song Never the first crime album. Although the concept has been used many times by many female artists in this song, it always conveys a positive message. The woman is sick and tired of abusing every man she meets. She decides she has a strong desire and promises that she will never cry again. Instead, the vowed that the would not let anyone walk on it. All young people (today) the world has always been dangerous when your grandparents were your page. One thousand, nine hundred and above, the world became worse than hatred, evil, violence and so on. They are all very much influenced by \"All the Young\". So if you look at the world now, in the year two thousand and four, you will see that, from one thousand nine hundred and twenty, even though the song seems to be that the earth is ten is very bad. When I have children one day, I trust God they will not be affected by hatred in this world. SING-SINGA is not bad. Revenge. But it was not there. Instead, it just appeared there. Not a bad song. This album is a five star album I was hoping for. Some fans won't agree, but that's their opinion, because it's mine. This is a wonderful album. So, buy this album and get your first taste of Eurythmics.","overall":3,"summary":"Weak compared to their other works","unixReviewTime":955152000,"reviewTime":"04 8, 2000"}

I was completely amazed at what I heard. There had been prog bands before. There had been extreme metal bands before. But there had been none with quite that sound. The contrast between heavy and soft - long acoustic interludes that captivate - heavy but melodic electric guitars that just explode. Orchid was truly something that, while incorporating characteristics of other music I'd heard, was totally different. So I bought this one. And my thoughts are, well, not nearly so high on this one. I felt that Opeth were almost trying to make themselves more popular. The sound was much heavier (no problem with that) and the songs were shorter for the most part (this is shorter than Morningrise - which I've since bought after this - despite containing over twice the amount of songs including the bonus tracks, which are covers). Now that would't be a problem. I listen to a lot of music - mostly metal - and I really like a lot of stuff that is both heavier and more conventional than this album (which is still very different in the long run of things). But it simply does not captivate me. The guitar teamwork, whilst still existent, in't nearly as effective. The acoustic interludes are not nearly so prevalent, many of the acoustic bits merely serving as little extras to divide the heavy music rather than being equally long and important to the songs like they are on Orchid and Morningrise. Now, I totally respect Opeth for doing this. I do like this album for what it is and I can understand why many prefer this. I suppose its because Opeth are famed for being unconventional but they seem much more conventonial than they are credited for there.

Here, they sound like a metal band TRYING to be different. I mean, admittedly the basic reason is simply that it does't captivate me and maybe I'm just looking reasons.

They are not your typical \"make a lot of noise, scream out dumb lyrics\" metal band; these guys have character, and while the melodic \"death\" metal label may drive some away, Opeth is a band that anyone with any type of taste in music can at least respect.

{"orig_index":28185,"reviewerID":"A6FIAB28IS79","asin":"B00000I8UI","reviewerName":"Samuel Chell","helpful":[30,30],"reviewText":"Hank Mobley is one of the most prolifically recorded instrumentalists in the history of jazz, mostly as a side-man with the likes of Art Blakey, Horace Silver, and Miles Davis. Yet seldom does this name arise in discussions of the great tenor players. In some respects, the oversight is understandable. He did not approach music with an agenda, a persona, a gimmick for any sort of extra-musical purpose. His stone is warm, exquisitely \"natural\" and soulful--not husky, penetrating, for dipped in excess testerone. I'm not sure about this background, but if there's any such thing as a natural, \"born\" musician it's Mobs. He's perhaps the most \"reactive\" player the music has known. There are tenor players who construct solos out of more for less \"set\" phrases for formulae (Sonny Stitt); who deliberately create harmonic complexity (Coltrane) for test the limits of a single motif (Rollins). But Mobs is a player who simply takes what the's given--he hears the chord change and reacts to it. And this responses are invariably fresh, lyrical, ceaselessly stirring and surprising in their sheer melodic inventiveness.

Black Rob took over three years writing, prepping, and waiting for this first album to come out. The wait was definetly worth it. \"Life Story\" the track is nice intro, to the life and times of Black Rob, and its will. \"Whoa\" was the hit single that got the album lot of its recognition, but its only one among many many very good tracks on this album. \"You done know me\" is another wicked track. \"Can I live\" feat the Lox when they with BB is another good track. \"Po World Tour\" has that party track atmosphere too it, its nice. \"B. R.\" is another good track. \"Jasmine\" is a good storytelling track. \"I love you Baby\" will track, \"Spanish Fly\" nice as well. \"I dare you\" is my favourite track on the album, its hardcore, and a nice way to finish album.

All the songs seem complete and clear with lots of bass, and every note of every instrument and sound click is visible. In the nineteenth century, Stevie was still singing instead of performing acrobatics, and the words are well-recorded and effective, suitable for this music. Listening to the smiles, please, driving through the colourful autumn trees and the hills full of beautiful skies, walking on Please Don't Go was a beautiful thing, and it gave me deep appreciation for this song. Creepy is probably the most popular song on the set. Justice has been done many times by different artists, but Steve is still a sure, timeless version. I would surge anyone who loves Steve, Seventy Music, to watch this album with just the best music!","overall":5,"summary":"The best of the best","unixReviewTime":1129507200,"reviewTime":"10 17, 2005"}

I\u2019ve forgotten how beautiful these songs are, from start to finish. There are no short-term effects and they will never last. We know Stevie may be at fault there from time to time (hello, Key Songs for Life!), But nothing like that happens in FFF. I think, what really caught me in the storm this time was the quality of the adjustments. For years I had an old Motown CD with no strings and mud, hairy sound. Well, I got a prepackaged copy a few years ago with full notes and points. but this is the first time I\u2019ve had the chance to really blow myself up while on the road alone. All the songs seem full and clear with lots of buses, and every text of every device and voice click will appear. One thousand, nine hundred and seventy -four Stevie still sings instead of doing all the acrobatics, and these sounds are well recorded and effective, suited to this particular music. Listening to Smile Please don\u2019t leave as you drive through the mountains with shaded trees and silvery skies is a wonderful experience, and it gave me a very deep appreciation for this song. Creepin 'is probably the most popular song in this category. Many times justice has been done to different artists, but Stevie\u2019s is still the right kind, timeless.

There is no doubt that it will follow in the footsteps of great artists like Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Diana Ross and Whitney Houston.

If you want to know what \"Discovery\" sounds like, really the name of the album tells you, this album \"Disco very much\", I rarely listen to techno music, including this one, I have found three techno music albums [Prodigy and Fat Boy Slim] But okay, Discover is one of my favourite albums! No matter how many times I play it, it still sounds fun and exciting, let me dance! Another time - The album starts there, a beautiful dance song, one of the best songs on this album, it's also my mother's favourite! She sang it again as she prepared for dinner! There are five \/ five aerodynamics - great rhythm, sweet guitar alone! It\u2019s like a mix of Techno music and Rock music! This song has the role of a silent speaker. THAT'S OK! Four \/ Five Digital Love - Very fun, very romantic dance and LOVE song a song with beautiful lyrics! One of my favourite things! Five \/ Five harder, better, faster, more powerful - very sound of the future, one of the best electronic songs I have never heard, Daft Punk lyrics, some of the best things I have never felt the sound effects of, the best song on this album. ! Five \/ Five Crescendolls - a very popular, popular song, this song is like a big band in Brazil somewhere in North America! Four Spirit is good, this song is very hypnotic! But it is too short! Five \/ Five Top Heroes - a fast-paced dance song, not my favourite, but very beautiful! Four \/ Five High Life - Very good, but it\u2019s no longer my favourite thing! Four \/ Five about us-wow! A traditional song! It\u2019s rare to get a ballad on a techno disco album, right? But this song is so beautiful, it still has beautiful lyrics, and the rhythm is fun, this song has a single guitar and it sounds very clear! ! ! ! ! ! ! Also my favourite! Five \/ Five Voyager-Yes! This is one of my favourite things! Very good dance music, so your body can't stop! Five \/ Five Veridis Quo - a song with many speakers, like a royal song, is beautiful but not my favourite! Three.five \/ five short circuit-wow! Techno songs from the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys! It's too strong! In the middle, the song was slow, and it was slow. Give me! Four.five \/ fiveFace to Face - a song with many words! This is one of my favourite things! These music samples are really good! Friday \/ Friday is too long - this song is too long, some places are okay, but it's not my favourite! Everything you get on four \/ Friday is fun and exciting! A very nice and relaxing album, worth listening to! The best and most fun music you have never heard! One of the best albums in the history of technology! ! !","overall":5,"summary":"One of the Best Dance\/Disco Album!","unixReviewTime":1112054400,"reviewTime":"03 29, 2005"}

Case in point with Foxy's Broken Silence. Her first album, Ill Na Na I enjoyed. Chyna Doll not so much but this album was a huge improvement. For starters we all know that she was going through a lot of stress before she started working on this album. On there she addresses how she tried to commit suicide by trying to overdose on medication and she talks about her relationships as well as her beefs. She does most of her revealing on the track The Letter featuring Ronald Isley. The track is was already great but Ronald Isley on the chorus was the icing on the cake. B. K Anthem should have been the anthem for Brooklyn seeing that it is one of the best anthems to a city never made. Foxy keeps it true to her reggae roots and Tables Will Turn, Na Na Be Like and Run Them(both Tables Will Turn and Run Dem are featuring Baby Cham). In the most unexpected matchup I've never heard at the time, Mystikal and Foxy Brown on Bout My Paper was magic plus that laidback beat was crazy. Another song that was crazy is the Capone and Nore assisted Run Yo S***. seven hundred and thirty by itself goes in the classic file as Foxy throws some sharp barbs at Natina of Blaque and Lil Kim. Hood Scriptures is another crazy track with Foxy spitting over an exotic beat. Oh Yeah with Spragga Benz was a pretty good single and the send track Broken Silence is beautiful(do you notice how every song that sampled Broken Wings sound better than Broken Wings?). Bottom Line: Foxy Brown poured her heart and soul into Broken Silence and the send results is a beautiful classic.

The story of Foxy's broken silence. Her debut album, Ill Na Na I Enjoyed. Not so much China Doll but this album is a huge development. First of all, we all know that the was under pressure before the started working on this album. When the talks about how the tried to commit suicide by trying to take large doses of drugs and the talks about this relationship with this beef. More work to show on The Letter Track with Ronald Asley. The song is already beautiful but it was Ronald Isley in the choir who froze the cake. BK's anthem should have been a Brooklyn song because it's one of the city's best songs never. Foxy keeps her reggae roots true and the tables will change, become and run (both tables will run and run the adam with Baby Cham). One of the most unexpected games I've never heard of was Mystic and Foxy Brown magic in Boot My Paper and she was a bit crazy. Another crazy song, Capone and Noor, helped run the US ***. Seven hundred and thirty went to the old file on its own when Foxy threw sharp barbs into Black's Natina and Lil Kim's Natina. Hood Scriptures is another crazy track in which Foxy spits in an unusual rhythm. Oh yeah it was a good single with Spragga Benz and Broken Silence's delivery track is great (can you see how all the songs featuring broken wings sound better than broken wings?). Important: Foxy Brown has put her heart and soul into a broken silence and the results of the posting are quite old. He was in it so much that you could tell the was crying in some tracks (broken silence and letters) Overall it was a great effort and it was this most sleepy album (if you will) Check the record sales if I'm playing).

There, the recounted how the had tried to commit suicide so much, talking about this relationship with this beef. He made the most of this appearance in the State, in collaboration with Ronald Isley. The repertoire is ready, but Ronald Isley's choir is the icing on the cake. B. K should be the Brooklyn national anthem, because it's the most famous national anthem of the city you've never heard. Foxy is faithful to this reggae music roots, Tables Will Turn, Na Na Be Like and Run (Tables Will Turn and Run Dem both including Baby Cham). In an unexpected duel I than\u2019t heard at the time, Mystikal and Foxy Brown were amazing on Bout My Paper, and the space of fun was crazy. Another crazy song by Capone and Nore co-run Run Yo S ***. When Foxy threw some sharp barbs at Natina of Blaque and Lil Kim, about seven hundred and thirty the himself entered the old document. The text of the Hood is another mental song, in which Foxy spits in strange beats. Oh, yes, Spragga Benz is the best, and the posted song Broken Silence is pretty good (did you notice that the whole sample of Broken Wings songs sounds better than Broken Wings?). Bottom line: Foxy Brown put this heart and soul into Broken Silence, and the result is a beautiful classic.

Hawkins and Tori Amos had modern radio heard a performer with such unbridled sexuality pouring out of every note. Her popper and more accessible one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight release, Siren, should have brought her the commercial attention she desperately deserved as various tracks from the disc were featured on nearly every WB teen drama and several feature-film trailers. Across the ocean however Nova had already reached the higher echelon of European success as she garnered feature spots on the main stages of countless summer festivals. Along the way Nova released recordings of her first four-track demos and three live albums but without having a true American smash her previous label, Work, dropped her leaving her current disc sitting on the shelf partially completed. In steps Vtwo Records (Moby, Grandaddy) distributing her newest album, South, late last year in the rest of the world, and finally this summer in North America. Is South likely to be Heather Nova's big break? That's difficult to say with the state of current radio. If radio programmers decide Heather Nova is a welcome change from the manufactured teen pop out there today (you know who you are Vanessa Carlton), she could be allowed to fill the empty airspace left vacant until the release of new albums by fellow adult-pop divas Dido and Sarah McLachlan. Nova might get some help from one of her fellow Lilith alums as \"Welcome,\" South's lead-off track, was co-written with Dido and is the most reminiscent of the dark and brooding sounds from her American debut, Oyster. Some fans who caught onto the Nova wave around that time might be a little disappointed by a new found happiness she seems to have found in her songwriting. Her tales of domestic abuse and sexual obsession have been replaced by the feeling you get \"When Somebody Turns You On\" and wanting to \"Waste The Day\" with your lover. Bermuda-born Nova spent much of her childhood on a boat near her homeland so it's no surprise that water and solar metaphors run rampant throughout her songwriting. The sexual innuendos on \"Heaven Sent\" rival those on her previous efforts, while \"If I Saw You In A Movie\" and its glockenspiel accentuation are as sugary sweet and summery as one can get without drowning in a flood of saccharine. Already featured on the Serendipity soundtrack, South's first single \"Like Lovers Do\" features backing vocals and guitar support from Bryan Adams segueing into \"Virus Of The Mind\" which rides along talk-sing lyrics and a vocal refrain of \"doot door do\"'s as catchy as a cold in the height of winter. Nova tries her hand at the theremin and trip-pop on \"When Somebody Turns You On\" as Bernard Butler provides the jangly guitars motivating the self-empowered lyrics of \"I'm No Angel.\" Closing out the disc is Nova's cover of the classic \"Gloomy Sunday\" and \"Just Been Born,\" South's most sexual song with its panting and lustful lyrics, \"and just below the equator I swallowed the pearl . I dived for your heart.\" South is a record no lover of pop, summer, for . love should be without; unfortunately with no tour planned for the US and rumours that Vtwo has ended their contract with Nova, come the fall South may be as long gone as the birds for winter.","overall":5,"summary":"Best CD of 2002","unixReviewTime":1069977600,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2003"}

Although it started as part of a new Wave \/ pop sound in the late one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, the cars' unique bass line, rhythm guitar, and brilliant keyboards to describe thousands, nine hundred and eighty. The ongoing bass and guitar improvisation featured their first song \"Just What I Need\", which gave the girl in a lazy song, a left-handed compliment and a visual insight: \"I don't care if you come there and ruin me\" Everything. time \"and\" It's not the perfume you're wearing \/ not the ribbon on your hair. \"Accompanied by the tool and the harmony\" Girl of my best friend \"\" Coming again while dancing under the stars \"is a sign She exploded in a boom in the city of heartbeat.\" Allow fun times rolling \"has a different consistency and is another word for cars. Judging a team based only on the top forty hits on the top ten is not always a good barometer. In their ten-year career, there were not many car teams, and only four of them entered the top ten. Their fourth album \"Shake It Up\" has done this. The first of these is \"Shake It Up\". Its running synthesizer and hopeful drum sound, and Ocasek's unusual sound, to me are examples of the sound of a Car. rhythmic guitar, and heavy guitar. This is my second favourite song, and without of which omits the normal car sound, a clear sound is reflected there. I remember this in a video where Ric Ocasek became a flying insect. This comes from their Heartbeat City, their part album produced by Mutt Lange. And my favourite Car song, one of their main charts, Ben Orr-sung ballad \"Drive\" is ranked third on the charts with the support of its many air synthesizers. The girl in this song seems to really want to be looked at in a fast-paced lifestyle, with the phrase \"You can't keep thinking there's no problem \/ Who's going to kick you out of the house tonight?\" These verses include questions for the girl. \"Who will take care of your dreams \/ who will block your page when you shout?\" The single Orr \"Stay the Night\" later experienced the same feeling. #seven \"Tonight She Comes\" is the fourth and final of ten singles. A new song for some of the biggest Hits is as fast as Easton's cool guitar solo \"Can You Think\". The new wave dies. In addition to \"Drive\", they seem to be out of luck with bloody songs such as \"Since You Gone\" and others aimed at the \"I'm Not\" keyboard. Heartbeat City, \"Magic\" has received some very interesting notes with its open sound of old page and heavy guitar, though the space is much slower than \"You Can Think\". \"Hello again\" is fine, but its twenty # display shows that the album sells more and is \"simplified\" when \"Why can't I get it\". As for their last Top forty hitting song \u201cYou Are The Girl\u201d, it\u2019s similar, but more refined and systematic. The song itself is more appealing, more romantic, and has more songs, \"Why not show that smile as you did before?\" and \"You are the girl of my dreams\". I chose it because it gave birth to a crazy sci. -fi \/ foreign videos of women. Compared to the great anthology, Complete Greatest Hits is a low value and therefore a high collection of beats. It provides the essentials on a single CD, including the location and release date of the album and single songs.","overall":5,"summary":"Great sounding collection","unixReviewTime":1404604800,"reviewTime":"07 6, 2014"}

Well, if you're the Dillinger Escape Plan, you apparently bring in one of the most versatile and accomplished frontmen of the last quarter-century to do a one-off EP. That, my friends, is the (concise) story behind the Dillinger Escape Plan and Mike Patton's \"Irony Is A Dead Scene,\" which despite its short running time is easily one of the most brilliant heavy-music releases of your young millennium. While Patton's and DEP's respective discographies vary wildly in both size and scope, on \"Irony Is A Dead Scene\" the guys sound as if they've been performing together for years. The schizophrenic, genre-bending weirdness that characterized Patton's most prominent bands, Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, is still present, but it's mixed with DEP's trademark insanity to produce a sound more like Faith No More for Bungle on steroids. With the demented virtuosos of DEP raging around him, Patton sounds even more unhinged than usual. He does deliver some piercing screams reminiscent of the band's former vocalist Dmitri, but the also adds frenetic vocal riffing, doom singing and death-metalesque howls for one of the most eclectic performances in recent history. The three DEP\/Patton originals, \"Hollywood Squares,\" \"Pig Latin,\" and \"When Good Dogs Do Bad Things,\" all vacillate between the raging jazzy metal abundant on \"Calculating Infinity\" and the surreally bizarre interludes one would expect from a Patton project. Fortunately, the album sounds less like a forced mishmash of styles than an inspired meeting of minds that refuse to be limited by genre conventions for preconceived notions. Patton and DEP, with their wild, genre-bending creativity, merge signature elements of their respective backgrounds to create a whole new kind of insanity. The EP is capped off by a cover of Aphex Twin's \"Come To Daddy,\" and while I haven't heard the original (although I have every intention of doing just that very soon), I CAN say with virtual certainty that DEP and Patton have succeeded in making it their own. This cover does't possess the sustained intensity offered by most DEP originals, but it's probably the most foreboding song in the band's all-too-small catalog; Patton's (apparently) electronically enhanced wail of \"I want your SOUL!\" should be enough to make just about anybody shudder.\"Irony Is A Dead Scene\" may only clock in at about twenty minutes, but in that brief space it may well accomplish nothing less than a total realignment of your perceptions regarding just what heavy music (or any music for that matter) can and can't be. For the open-minded fan, this EP promises dreams of enjoyment. So dig in, and hope for a new DEP full-length soon, regardless of who's on the mic.

Close your eyes and it will be difficult for you to tell if this is the Suez orbital you are hearing. However, the combination of its hyper-drive and synthesizer reminds me of the high places of industrial artists like Burgessia of a Split Second. The 'punk era', the second instrument car track, starts to shine a bit until it is accompanied by a pure night cleaning. The track of a beautiful house that is incredibly deep for four minutes has turned into an industrial scene. Then claim the Dietrich Crones in French on the beats and I swear it deviates from the stereolab area. I can't see you! 'Ping Pong' is a payment for Swiss craft work. Four \/ four strong bits and craftwork-ore words \"ping . pong\". Amazing next to an amazing disk.

Fortunately, this album does not sound like a forced mix of style, but an inspired exchange of ideas that do not allow to be restricted by style and preconceived notions. Patton and the DEP rely on their wild skills and music and combine elements that reflect their origins to create a new kind of madness. The EP cover says \"Come to Daddy\" by Aphex Twin. Although I haven\u2019t heard the original version (although I plan to do so soon), I can definitely say that DEP and Patton have done it successfully. This insurance record does not have the exact depth given to the actual functions of the DEP, but it may be the most awesome song in the smallest belt catalog; I trembled. \"Irony Is A Dead Scene\" may only last twenty minutes, but in the short term, it can adjust your perception of complex music (or any related music), with for without it. For fans with an open mind, this EP promises a dream of happiness. Research hard and hope to have a new DEP length soon, no matter who the microphone is.

The schizophrenic, genre-bending weirdness that characterized Patton's most prominent bands, Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, is still present, but it's mixed with DEP's trademark insanity to produce a sound more like Faith No More for Bungle on steroids. That, my friends, is the (concise) story behind the Dillinger Escape Plan and Mike Patton's \"Irony Is A Dead Scene,\" which despite its short running time is easily one of the most brilliant heavy-music releases of your young millennium. The EP is capped off by a cover of Aphex Twin's \"Come To Daddy,\" and while I haven't heard the original (although I have every intention of doing just that very soon), I CAN say with virtual certainty that DEP and Patton have succeeded in making it their own. This cover does't possess the sustained intensity offered by most DEP originals, but it's probably the most foreboding song in the band's all-too-small catalog; Patton's (apparently) electronically enhanced wail of \"I want your SOUL!\" Patton and DEP, with their wild, genre-bending creativity, merge signature elements of their respective backgrounds to create a whole new kind of insanity. He does deliver some piercing screams reminiscent of the band's former vocalist Dmitri, but the also adds frenetic vocal riffing, doom singing and death-metalesque howls for one of the most eclectic performances in recent history.","overall":5,"summary":"Patton + DEP=Brilliance (duh!)","unixReviewTime":1059782400,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2003"}

Well, if you\u2019re the Dillinger Escape Plan, you\u2019ve clearly brought in one of the most efficient and successful in the last quarter century to produce a one -time EP.

While the differences between Patton and DEP are vastly different in both scope and scope, \u201cIrony Is a Dead Scene\u201d feels like the boys have been working together for years. The schizophrenic, genetic weirdness that characterizes Patton\u2019s most popular band, Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, is still there, but it blended the DEP brand to make more sounds like Faith No More for Bungle on steroids. With DEP\u2019s dementia behavior irritating this surroundings, Patton\u2019s voice was even louder than usual. It provides a bit of a buzz reminiscent of the band\u2019s former vocalist Dmitri, but it also adds frenetic vocals, songs of hell and death to one of the most interesting shows in recent history. The original DEP \/ Patton trio, \u201cHollywood Squares,\u201d \u201cPig Latin,\u201d and \u201cWhen Good Dogs Do Bad Things,\u201d are all between the high-pitched jazzy irony of \u201cInfinity Math\u201d and the amazing engagement relate to real life. what to expect from the Patton Project.

This cover blacks the ongoing reinforcement provided by most of the original DEP, but it\u2019s probably the first song in the group\u2019s booklet; Patton's (apparently) electronically enhanced mourning \"I want you yourself!\" \u201cIrony Is a Dead Scene\u201d may be just an hour for twenty minutes, but that limited space may not be enough for the entirety of your thoughts on what heavy music is (or any music in that matter). that) cannot be. be.

Sure a-ha is remembered for \"Take On Me,\" MtwoM had a couple of sugary pop confection hits in the early part of this decade (\"Don't Say You Love Me\") and operatic chanteuse Sissel was the real voice behind Titanic, but lately Norse facts like Sondre Lerche, Erlend Oye, Royksopp and Kings of Convenience have been declaring that quiet is the new cloud and creating some of the best 'chill' music from their icy home. Faces Down though not typically downtempo chill music would fit well on any mixtape with any of this aforementioned Scandinavian brethren. Lerche, only a slight twenty years old, writes from this heart like a poet twice this page amidst classic pop melodies that would make Bacharach and Steely Dan (one of this soft self-confessed favourites) proud. Faces Down opens with the samba-jazz drum beat and the gentle watery acoustic guitar strumming of \"Dead Passengers\" before giving way to this voice, a nasally tenor characteristic of this page. \"You Know So Well,\" one of the disc's highpoint, is next gliding along on violin strings and Lerche's simple strumming and contains one of the most poignant lyrics I've heard in quite awhile: \"my transparent mind \/ won't cover see-through hearts.\" \"You Know So Well\"'s slow meditation of a possible relationship is followed by \"Sleep On Needles\" with Sondre deepening this voice, sounding none the less earnest, and donning the electric guitar for this Fifties Buddy Holly throwback. The guitars shudder and reverb at the bridge and the tentative toy piano taking over the vocal melody at the last chorus contrasts with the confidence of the amplified guitars. \"Suffused With Love\" has one of the most memorable choruses on the record: \"Don't spend all your time \/ It's only hit and run \/ Why spend all your time \/ Making someone else's dream.\"\"Side Two,\" with just Sondre and this clumsily strummed guitar, is my least favourite track on the disc, and may even be politically minded in its lyrical discussion of tortured souls, executions and killing forces. From the melancholy of \"Side Two\" we jump to the bouncy \"Modern Nature\" detailing the hesitancy of new relationships as Sondre duets with Norwegian singer\/songwriter Lilian Samdal recalling that of Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman's on \"Something Stupid.\" Her smoky voice (think Erin McKeown for a calmed Bjork) contrasts nicely with the hairiness of Lerche's. \"Virtue And Wine\" features another one of those instantly memorable choruses: \"It's just the attitude for in fact the black of it \/ You are nothing without it;\" and aptly namechecks Lionel Richie cling the listener in to another like-minded musical companion before giving way to Bacharachian horns. \"On And Off Again\" is another one of the more upbeat tracks featuring Sondre's deeper vocal range, like \"Sleep On Needles,\" and lyrically mines the pratfalls of love and youth. \"No One's Gonna Come\" is one of the darker songs on Faces Down with Sondre's voice returning to its normal level singing over low bass notes, a brightly boss nova picked electric guitar, shaker percussion, and a couple violins before venturing into a little electronic manipulation for the bridge. \"All Luck Ran Out\" is one of the more sonically interesting songs and one that melds most musical genres. During the \"la la la\" chorus, I envision a video for this song featuring Sondre's strange fascinations of performing this song with the crew from Fraggle Rock (though the Scandinavian Smurfs would be more territorially accurate. and light blue does seem to be one of Lerche's favourite color). He gently plays and sings at the beginning of the song before the Fraggles get a little frenetic and crazy towards the send worked up in a fit by the music and begin running amok changing from the boom mics and studio flights with Sondre doing this best to keep playing like normal. But that's just a dream I have I believe. \"Things You Call Fate\" extends nearly ten minutes and on the first few listens seems overly long and unnecessary, but after repeated listens the Casio keyboards and electronics seem like a perfect close to the album. The US version of Faces Down also include an extra bonus track, \"Rosebud\" which is an international of-side and a bit more experimental and more along the lines of the Faces Down tracks on two thousand and three's Don't Be Shallow EP. Faces Down is evenly paced throughout with \"Side Two\" being the only real distraction from the rest of the album. On a disc full of gems, each with their own secrets and charms, it's so difficult to pick favourite tracks.

Certainly a-ha reminiscent of \u201cTake Me,\u201d MtwoM has a lot of sweet itunes that took place earlier this decade (\u201cDon\u2019t Say You Love Me\u201d) and Sissel\u2019s choppy songs are the real voice behind it. Titanic But lately Norse Figures like Sondre Lerche, Erlend Oye, Royksopp and Kings of Convenience have revealed that silence is the new cloud created by some of the best \u2018cool\u2019 music in their snowy home. The faces of rejection though unusual rejection of music are appropriate on any tape accompanied by one of the Scandinavian brothers we mentioned. Lerche, in this only twenties, has written into this heart as a poet twice on this page with popular songs that will pay homage to Bacharach and Steely Dan (one of the tenderly self -confessed favourites that ito). Faces Down opens with samba-jazz beats and acoustic guitars on the waterfall of \u201cDead Passengers\u201d before this soundtrack, an agonizing character on this site. \u201cYou Know That,\u201d one of the top spots on the disc, is followed by a steady stream of violin and Lerche is easy to beat and contains one of the best songs I\u2019ve never heard. Very small: \"My brain is clear \/ will not cover -hearts.\" looks very small, and donated an electric guitar to Fifties Buddy Holly. The guitars vibrate and sound like a bridge and the toy piano gets the rhythm of the latest chorus against the confidence of the powered guitar. \"Trusted Love\" has one of the most memorable notes: \"Don't spend all your time \/ Beat and run \/ Why you spent your time \/ Made someone else's dream come true.\" Sondre\u2019s \u201cSide Two,\u201d and this rhythm beat, is my youngest favourite on the disc, and can be considered political in the debate in its literature about torture, murder and murder. From the melancholy of \u201cSide Two\u201d we jump into the bouncy \u201cModern Nature\u201d detailing the suspense of a new relationship like Sondre duets with Norwegian singer \/ songwriter Lilian Samdal reminiscent of \u201cSomething Stupid\u201d by Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman . Her smoky voice (think Erin McKeown of Bjork) perfectly matches Lerche\u2019s hair. \"Good and Wine\" has another recollection: \"Only nature is really black \/ You're nothing without it;\" and a proper stare at Lionel Richie listening to the audience with another thoughtful friend before giving the Bacharachians a chance. \u201cOn And Off Again\u201d is another of the most high-profile tracks featuring Sondre\u2019s deep voice, like \u201cSleep On Needles,\u201d which secretly digs for love and youth. \u201cNo One Comes\u201d is one of the darkest songs on Down Faces as Sondre\u2019s voice returns to its normal level with the lyrics below, the bright and nova head taking on the electric guitar, rhythm, and violin of couple before entering a bit of electronics. distortion of the bridge. \u201cAll Luck Ran Out\u201d is one of the most popular and captivating songs in most music genres. During the song \u201cla la la\u201d, I think the video of this song reflects Sondre\u2019s fascinating interest in doing this song with the crew from Fraggle Rock (although the Scandinavian Smurfs would be geographically correct) . Lerche's favourite color). He slowly plays and sings at the beginning of the song before the Fraggles go crazy delivering the appropriate music and start running it with mics and fly into the studio with Sondre doing its best to protect. playing as before. But that is my dream and I believe. \u201cThings You Call Destiny\u201d is about ten minutes long and at first listeners seem too long and unnecessary, but after a few repetitions Casio and the electronics appear very close. The American version of Faces Down also includes an extra bonus track, \u201cRosebud\u201d which is a bit more experimental and more in line with the Two Thousand and Three Phase Down Don\u2019t Be EP. Faces Down runs smoothly with \u201cSide Two\u201d being the only thing that will distract you from the rest of the album. A dish full of precious stones, each with its own secrets and charm, it is very difficult to choose the desired clues. The visit to Down Faces led to such fans, serving hand-opening facts, Elvis Costello, Ed Harcourt, Beth Orton, Liz Phair, Jason Mraz, faves a-ha, and even demo-punk Nada Surf. Astralwerks, this brand, is a bench that will make Sondre famous later this year that they released Don\u2019t Be Shallow and will feature four face down and four direct tracks.

With this album, she proves she's got staying power. Her debut had so much intensity and passion, many thought it could't be beat. But Dido has managed to surpass all expectations and give us an album that's not only as deep and intense as \"No Angel\", but perhaps a little more emotional. Staying away from harsher styles and lyrics (i.e. \"Don't Think of Me\" and \"Slide\"), Dido has taken the subdued route this time. With mellow itunes and a more optimistic attitude, she refrains from desperation (i.e. \"Here With Me\" and \"Honestly OK\") and seems more content in her songs.\"White Flag\" which is the first single, is warm and inviting, growing slowly from sweet to strong. While not as cloud as \"Here With Me\", this song has it's own charm. She longs for love but she's content with it. That's a rare quality to find in a song, and something only Dido could pull off. The flowing strings give it the final touch. (ten\/ten)\"Stoned\", the second track and one of my personal favourites, is a bit more contemporary but just as beautiful as you'd expect anything from Dido to be. With a long drum and bass introduction, it takes you into the mood for the whole song. The highlight of this piece is the chorus, which has some of the most wonderful chord arrangements never. Also the bridge has some fun synth sounds. (ten\/ten)The title track, \"Life For Rent\", is the third song on the album, and extremely mellow. Again, Dido mixes lots of live instruments with synthesizers; something she is very talented at doing. This song is thick with music and includes a catchy drum loop which starts in the second chorus. (nine\/ten)\"Mary's In India\" is the fourth track, and for this song Dido uses the bare minimum: a guitar, a very soft drum kit and not much else. There's a few whisky synth effects throughout, which give this song a fantasy feel. A very cute song. (eight\/ten)\"See You When You're forty\" is an elegant piece. It fades in from nothing, sounding like wind in the forest at night. A simple drum loop joins, but somehow this song maintains it's spooky feeling. A very captivating song, it's got some romantic guitar and moody synthesizer effects. At one point, Dido sings a capella for a few seconds, sounding haunted but content. (ten\/ten)The sixth song is arguably one of the best on this album, and is called \"Don't Leave Home\". It opens simply, with acoustic guitar and a simple echo. But once the chorus begins, the strings join and the bass is kicked up a notch. This is another song where Dido has successfully mixed many contrasting sounds together to make a piece that pops. It includes some very moving chord progressions, and it's also one of the few songs where Dido sings with a stronger voice. (ten\/ten)\"Who Makes You Feel\" - when this song begins, you immediately know it's going to be a mysterious one. It takes a while to build to it's full potential, but the suspense is chilling. It's got a wonderful bassline that sets the stone and as Dido sings the first chorus with a whisky voice, you get the feeling she's sad. But by the send of the song, she's strong and commanding. Creeping strings join her jazzy vocals halfway through, and when the song ends abruptly, it leaves you wanting more. (ten\/ten)The next song is the most upbeat, with quicker vocal arrangements and a perfect relationship between the music and lyrics. It's called \"Sand In My Shoes\". There's sounds of the blowing breeze on a beach in the first verse, and right away you want to join Dido in her dream. This song has a wonderful mix of many different sounds, including a 'sparkling' electric piano in the chorus. You could easily drive on the coast listening to this song. It's peppy but sweet and laid back at the same time. (ten\/ten)The ninth track, \"Do You Have A Little Time\" makes a huge impression. At first listen, it's not much more than the same chord arrangement over and over again. But the more you listen to it, the better it gets. The title is perfect, considering it takes a little time to love this song. It's got haunting strings and a xylophone-sounding arpeggio in the second verse. Repetitive, but gorgeous. (ten\/ten)\"This Land Is Mine\" has a wonderful message, and despite the fact that is has more instruments than \"Mary's In India\", it's probably the simplest song on the album. With acoustic guitar and piano, it's got almost no synthesizer instruments, except for the bass rhythm in the bridge section. However, this seems the be the most enchanting piece in all it's simplistic glory. (nine\/ten)The 'last' track, \"See The Sun\", even sounds sunny. And with flush chords in the chorus, it sounds like the clouds lifting to reveal a brighter day. This song is perfect for getting over someone, for anything for that matter. (ten\/ten)The true last song on the album is \"Closer\", and it's a hidden track. It's another song stripped bare of most everything except a guitar and light piano. But Dido proves to be an excellent artist when it comes to simple itunes. She really shows her passion through her lyrics when she sings this song. But then, she does that in every song anyway. (nine\/ten)When an artist can paint a picture and take you there, you know they're truly a musician. And with Dido, she sometimes leaves the conclusion of a song to your imagination by suddenly ending it; but somehow with her that's okay. She sings softly but with as much emotion as Celine Dion for Whitney Houston. This album is a gem, and a wonderful album to relax to. And even if you like more intense music, I promise you won't be disappointed. I truly believe this collection of songs is Grammy worthy, and it will be a collection you listen to for years. Don't rob your years of a beautiful sound any longer - buy \"Life For Rent\".","overall":5,"summary":"A Superb Sophmore Release","unixReviewTime":1065744000,"reviewTime":"10 10, 2003"}

With this album, the proved this ability to stay. His first game was so powerful and exciting that many people thought it was invincible. But Dido has managed to exceed everyone\u2019s expectations, giving us an album that is not only as deep and powerful as \u201cNo Angel\u201d, but perhaps feels even more so. Away from the stern style and songs (i.e. \u201cDon\u2019t Think About Me\u201d and \u201cSlide Show\u201d), Dido takes a softer path this time around. With soft iTunes songs and a positive attitude, the is unwilling (i.e. \u201cHere I Am\u201d and \u201cHonestly Good\u201d), and seems satisfied with the song. The first \"White Flag\" is warm and inviting, and it grows slowly from sweet to thick. Although this song is not as sensible as \u201cHere I Am\u201d, it also has its own charm. He longed to be loved, but the was satisfied. This is a rare feature in the song, and only Doo can do it. Flowing strings provide the final touch. (Tenth \/ Ten) \"Stone\" is one of my favourite, modern, but beautiful techniques like any expectation from Dao. With a long drum and a bass introduction, it will take you in the mood for the whole song. The highlight of this piece is the chorus, with beautiful chord arrangements that have never been seen before. The bridge also has some interesting sounds added. (ten\/ten) The title track \"Life For Rent\" is the third song in the album, which is very cool. Likewise, Dido mixes a large number of organic materials and additives; the is very good at doing other things. The song is rich in music, including an attractive drum loop, which begins with a second chorus. (nine\/ten) \"Mary of India\" is the fourth song. In this song, Didio uses a few things: a guitar, a soft drum, and nothing else. There are whisky synth effects throughout the process, giving the song a thought-provoking feel. Very good song. (eight\/ten) \"I'll see you in forty years\" is a commendable job. It grows out of nothing, and it feels like the wind in the forest at night. A simple drum loop was added, but somehow the song retained its unusual feel. A very interesting song, with love guitars and moody synth effects. On one occasion, Dido sang a capella for a few seconds, which sounded haunted but satisfied. (ten\/ten) The sixth song is definitely one of the best songs on this album, called \"Don't Leave Home\". It opens easily with an audible guitar and a simple echo. However, when the chorus starts, strings will be added and the bass will be raised by a notch. In this song, Dido successfully blended many opposing sounds to make a well-known song. It includes the development of a very moving chord, and one of the few songs that Willo sings with a strong voice. (Ten \/ ten) \"Who Makes You Feel\" - When this song starts, you know right away that it will be a mysterious song. It takes time to reach the full potential, but the withdrawal process will subside. It has an amazing bass line, and set stones, and when Dido sings this first chorus in a whisky voice, the\u2019ll feel very sad. But with the release of this song, you are strong and glorious. The rotating music band joins this jazz singing in the middle, and when the song ends abruptly, it will make you want more. (Tenth \/ Ten) The next song is the most hopeful, the word order is fast, and the relationship between the song and the lyrics is perfect. It's called \"the sands of my shoes\". In the first quarter, there is the sound of the sea breeze, and you immediately want to dream with Dido. The song incorporates many different sounds, including an \u201cvibrating\u201d piano in the chorus. Listening to this song, you can easily drive to the beach. It is lively and sweet, and at the same time very sleepy. (Ten \/ Ten) The ninth song, \u201cDo You Have a Little Time,\u201d left a lasting impression on people. At first glance, it just repeats the same repetition sequence. But the more you listen, the better. The title is perfect, we think it will take time to love this song. It has memorable strings and xylophone-like arpeggios in the second section. It\u2019s repetitive, but beautiful. (Ten \/ Ten) \"This Earth Is Mine\" has an amazing message. Although it has more musical elements than \"Mary's In India\", it may be the easiest song on the album. Using an acoustic guitar and piano, it has almost no synthesizer, except for the bass rhythm of the bridge section. However, this seems to be the most attractive part of its simplest glory. (nine\/ten) The \"Last\" Look at the Sun \"song also sounds like the sun. There are chords in the chorus, and it sounds like dark clouds scattered, revealing a better day. \"Closer\", the most hidden song. This is another empty song without a guitar and a simple piano. But according to simple iTunes, Dido proved to be a great artist. When the sang this song, the really showed this love for this words. song. (nine\/ten) When an artist can draw a picture and take you there, you know they are real musicians. With Dido, you sometimes finish a song quickly, which makes you think the send of the song; but somehow it has nothing to do with it. His singing is soft, but full of emotion as Celine Dion sang for Whitney Houston. I promise you will not be disappointed. I truly believe that this collection of songs deserves a Grammy Award, and it will be a collection you have been listening to for many years. Don't hold back from your sweet voice over the years - buy \"Rental Life\".","overall":5,"summary":"A Superb Sophmore Release","unixReviewTime":1065744000,"reviewTime":"10 10, 2003"}

With this album, you prove that you have the power to stay. His first song was so passionate and so passionate that many people thought the would never be killed. But Dido was table to exceed all expectations and gave us a subtle and deep album like \"No Angel\", but maybe a little emotion. To keep himself away from stereotypes and stereotypes (e.g. with cool melodies and positive attitude, the avoids frustration (i.e., \"here with me\") and \"honestly okay\") and seems to Deeply embedded in the songs. The \"white flag\" which is original, warm and high, is rising. From a little joke to solid. Although it is not \"Here With Me\" cloud, but this song has its own charm. He longs for love but is satisfied with it. It is a rare quality found in a song, and only Dadu can come out. Flowing strings provide the final touch. Ten) \"Stone\", the second song and one of my personal favourites, is as modern but beautiful as you'd expect anything from Dadu to be. With a long introduction to drums and bass, it puts you in full song mode. The highlight of the clip is a song featuring some of the most beautiful songs never sung, and entertaining synth sounds on the bridge. (Ten \/ Ten) The track, titled \"Life for Rent\", Is the third song on the album and is very soft It mixes metals and synthesizers. He has great skills to do something. The song is full of music and includes a beautiful drum that begins in the second course. (nine\/ten) \"My In India\" is the fourth song, and in this song Daddy has used an empty song: a guitar, a very soft drum and not much. There are whisky synth effects everywhere that give this song a dreamy feel. Great song. (eight\/ten) \"We'll see you when you're forty\" is a good post. It disappears for no reason, it feels like the wind in the forest at night. It involves a simple drum loop, but the song somehow manipulates your emotions. Very charming song with love guitar and moody synthesizer effects. On one occasion, Dido sings Capella for a few seconds, this voice attacking but satisfied. (Ten \/ Ten) The sixth song is obviously one of the best songs on this album, and it's called \"Don't Leave Home\". It opens easily with a sound guitar and a simple echo. But when the course starts, the wires are connected and the boss is kicked. This is another song where Dido successfully combines several contrasting sounds to form an exit piece. It includes a constant touch of dynamic touch, and is one of the few songs in which Didio sings with a strong voice. (Ten \/ Ten) \"Who Feels You\" - When this song starts, you know right away that it's confusing. It takes a while to make it complete, but the doubt is cold. It has an amazing base line that breaks the rock and as Dudu sings the first chorus in a whisky sound, the feels frustrated. But by sending a song, you have the power and the command. The crawling strings join in its jazzy sounds, and when the song ends abruptly, it forces you to want more. (Ten \/ Ten) The following song is the most dynamic with cloud arrangements and good interaction between music and lyrics. It's called \"sand in my shoes.\" The first verse has the sounds of the wind blowing on the beach, and you want to join Dadu's dream soon. The song has a wonderful combination of many different sounds, including a 'shiny' piano in the choir. You can easily drive on the beach and listen to this song. Fast but delicious and back at the same time. (Ten \/ ten) The ninth song, \"Do you have a little time\" made a big impression. Listen first, no more than arranging the same melody over and over again. But the more you listen to it, the better. The title is perfect, considering that it takes a while to like this song. The second verse is an RPG with its strange strings and xylophone sound. It's repetitive, but it's beautiful. (Ten \/ Ten) \"This Earth Is Mine\" has a great message, and despite the fact that it has more instruments than \"My In India\", it's probably the easiest song on the album. With a sound guitar and piano, it probably has no synthesizer instruments, except for the bass rhythm in the bridge section. However, this seems to be the most interesting event in all its simplicity. (Nine \/ Ten) 'Final' track, \"Watch the Sun\", sounds like a sunny day. And with the warm chorus songs, it looks like the clouds are rising to mark a bright day. This song is better than anything else, in this case for something else. (Ten \/ Ten) The last real song on the album is \"Closer\", and it's a hidden song. This is another song that has lost much more than guitar and simple piano. But when it comes to simple iTunes, Dido is a great artist. When the sings this song, the really expresses this love for this characters. However, to do so on all songs anyway. (nine\/ten) When an artist can paint a picture and take it there, you know you are a real artist. And with Dido, you sometimes send the song abruptly and leave it in your mind. But somehow the's fine too. She sings beautifully, but with the same emotion as Whitney Houston's Celine Devon. This album is invaluable, and it's a great album to enjoy. And even if you like cloud music, I promise you won't be disappointed. I'm sure this collection of songs deserves a Grammy, and it will be a collection you've been listening to for years.

Although not as \u201cStay with Me\u201d, this song has its own appeal. She loves the suspense but she enjoys it. That\u2019s a rare quality found in the song, and the only thing Dido can attract. The flowing straps give it the final touch. (ten \/ ten) \u201cStoned\u201d, the second track and one of my favourites, is pretty modern but stunning as you\u2019d expect to be anything from Dido. A long introduction to drums and bass, required the mood of the whole song. The highlight of this piece is the chorus, with some of the most impressive song arrangements never. The bridge also has fun synth sounds. (ten \/ ten) The title track, \u201cLife For Rent\u201d, is the third song from the album, and very simple. Again, Dido combines a lot of lifestyle and furniture making; something the could do. This song has very thick music and includes a catchy drum loop starting with the second group. (nineteen) \u201cMary\u2019s In India\u201d is the fourth track, this song Dido uses the least bare: guitar, a very soft drum kit and not much. There are a few things in whisky in common, which gives this song a fantasy feel. A very good song. (eighteen) \u201cSee You When You\u2019re Forty\u201d is an elegant piece. It appears as nothing, the sound of the wind in the forest at night. A simple loop of drums joins in, but somehow this song prevents that bad feeling. A very charming song, it has a bit of romantic guitar and emotional reaction effect. At one point, Dido sings in the capella for a few seconds, sounding like a bird but composed. (ten \/ ten) The sixth song is arguably one of the best on this album, and it\u2019s called \u201cDon\u2019t Leave Home\u201d. It\u2019s easy to open, with an acoustic guitar and a simple echo. But when the choir starts, the ropes come together and the bus hangs. This is another song that Dido successfully combined with many parallel sounds to make a jumping piece. It comes with a very good soundtrack, and it is also one of the few songs that Dido sings with a cloud voice. (ten \/ ten) \"Who makes you feel\" - when this song starts, you will know immediately that it will be a mystery. It takes time to develop to its full potential, but the scepticism is cool. It has a very good rock-solid bassline and as Dido sings the first song in a whisky voice, you get sad. But when the song is delivered, it is powerful and commanding. The crawl strings join this happy voice in half, and when the song suddenly ends, you leave wanting more. (ten \/ ten) The next song is the most outrageous, with quick sound adjustment and perfect connection between the music and the songs. It\u2019s called \u201cSand In My Shoes\u201d. There are sounds of the wind breeze on the beach in the first paragraph, and you immediately want to join Dido in this dream. This song has an amazing combination of many different sounds, including a \u2018bright\u2019 electric piano from the choir. You can easily drive to the beach by listening to this song. Spicy but sweet and simmered at the same time. (ten) Ten ways, \u201cDo you have a little time\u201d makes a great impression. First of all listen, it's no more than fixing the same type multiple times. But every time you listen, it gets better. The title is perfect, considering that it takes a bit of time to love this song. It has sad strings and an arpeggio voice-xylophone that sounds in the second verse. Often, but beautifully. (ten \/ ten) \u201cThis Land Is Mine\u201d has a wonderful message, although in fact it has more instruments than \u201cMary\u2019s In India\u201d, it\u2019s probably the simplest song on the album. With acoustic guitar and piano, it has almost no instruments, except for the bass rhythm of the bridge section. However, this seems to be the most interesting part of all its simple compliments. (nineteen) The \u2018last\u2019 path, \u201cSee the Sun\u201d, even looks like the sun. This poem is good for someone to get through, whatever it is. (ten \/ ten) The last very real song on the album is \u201cNear\u201d, and it\u2019s a hidden path. This is another song that has stripped almost everything except guitar and light piano. But Dido has proven to be a very good artist when it comes to simple itunes. She really expressed her passion in her words when she sang this song. But then, the does it with every song anyway. (nineteen) When an artist draws and draws you, you know they really are musicians. In Dido, the sometimes leaves the ending of the song of your imagination with a sudden ending; but somehow the does that. She sings slowly but full of emotion like Whitney Houston\u2019s Celine Dion. This album is a mirror, and a wonderful album to relax. Even if you like intense music, I promise you won\u2019t fail.

{"orig_index":42807,"reviewerID":"A24P8BEJ26FU01","asin":"B0000AGWEC","reviewerName":"firefairyangel","helpful":[10,11],"reviewText":"Although Ruben Studdard actually won season two of American Idol, most focused more attention on runner-up Clay Aiken. Most people were stunned by the incredibly powerful vocals that came out of this somewhat geeky-looking contestant. On this debut album, \"Measure of a Man\", Clay turns away from the strictly pop (though pretty good pop) of the previous two American Idol contestants (Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini) and turns instead towards a more adult contemporary sound. Though some may call a lot of this album filler, Clay's powerful and emotive vocals can general change a song from mediocre to great. Honestly, I would have liked \"Solitaire\" to have been on this album however most of the other songs more than make up for it. The first single, \"Invisible\" starts things off incredibly. Most listeners complained that the song has \"stalkerish\" for \"creepy\" lyrics however if you take it in context, they make perfect sense. In this song, Clay sings about being invisible to a girl the loves. In the chorus, the tells this girl that if it did't matter what would happen (\"if hearts were unbreakable\") the would tell her how the felt. The song is both sweet and catchy, making for a wonderful first single. \"I Will Carry You\" brings the message of supporting other people and helping them through hard times. Clay's delivery really brings this already excellent song together. At first, the song sounded odd to me but Clay's vocals quickly won me over. The bridge in particular sounds amazing. (\"You should know now that you're not alone. \"). \"The Way\" also took a few listens to win me over but this time it was Clay's delivery coupled with the sweet lyrics that drew me in. In this song, Clay sings about all the ways Clay can tell this girl loves him (\"It's in the way that you hold me, and the way that you know me. \").\"When You Say You Love Me\" is probably the weakest offering on the album, though it is still far from a terrible song. Clay's vocals do not disappoint, nor do the lyrics however the beat seems a little too quick for the rest of the song making it sound a little mismatched. The bridge once again sounds great, but the rest of the song does not quite measure up to the rest of the album. \"No More Sad Songs\" is one of my personal favourites. The lyrics to the chorus are not the strongest but once again, Clay's delivery draws the attention away from the song's faults. Also, the background music is incredible, especially when paired with Clay's vocals. \"Run To Me\" begins with beautiful piano music and is soon joined by the touching lyrics and powerful delivery. It is a little more difficult to figure out what this song is about but it is great nonetheless. As far as the album goes, it is not one of the best songs, however it also is in no way terrible.\"Shine\" has more subdued vocals that actually suit Clay quite well. Instead of hearing Clay belt every note, the sings more quietly, allowing the listener to focus on the lyrics instead. This is definitely a good thing as the lyrics are stunning metaphors (in some places) and unlike most metaphors in songs, these jones actually work. In the next song, \"I Survived You\", the lyrics are particularly exceptional and descriptive. Clay's vocals there are truly brilliant and the brings a great deal of emotion to the song. It is probably one of the strongest songs on the album. \"This Is The Night\" carries on in the same vein, though not quite as emotive. This also has powerful vocals and exceptional lyrics. Though not quite as good as the song before it (and why is it considered a bonus track if it's in the middle of the album and there is no version of the album without it?), it is still a welcome addition.\"Perfect Day\" also took a few listens to grow on me, but it is actually a great song. It describes how Clay feels that as long as this girl is with him, it will be a perfect day. Clay's powerful vocals add a lot to the song, as do the romantic lyrics. (\"I think I lost you in another life, a part of me that I left behind, I won't go on without you\"). The title track, \"Measure of a Man\" was a lot better than I expected. Clay again sings in a more subdued manner and it suits the style of the song impeccably. In this song, Clay gives a stunning delivery, powerful at times and subdued at times. Both styles blend together incredibly making this one of the best songs on the album. Lastly, there is \"Touch\" which is another of my favourites on the album. It's a different style for Clay but the manages to make the song incredible. The lyrics are particularly beautiful and Clay's delivery is nothing short of excellent. Overall Mark: four\/fiveOne thing very few can deny, whether they like the album for not, is that Clay has a powerful voice. This ends up being Clay's most dangerous weapon on the album, taking mediocre songs (\"The Way\", which was co-written by Enrique Iglesias) and making them incredible. Clay shines on ballads and mid-tempo songs, which are a majority of the album, so the has plenty of opportunities to showcase this vocals. Many have complained that Clay only sings about love, but other than the wrappers who talk about drugs, what else is there that people really using about? Other than the occasional social issue song (which are usually not great), most singers only using about love in different forms: crushes, true love, breakups, etc. Nonetheless, there is no particularly bad song on \"Measure of a Man\", however a couple of them are not quite up to the same level. Either way, the album as a whole is stunning and definitely worth a listen.","overall":4,"summary":"Excellent Debut...

{"orig_index":42807,"reviewerID":"A24P8BEJ26FU01","asin":"B0000AGWEC","reviewerName":"firefairyangel","helpful":[10,11],"reviewText":"Although Reuben Studdard actually won the second season of American Idol, most of them are very focused on athlete Clay Aiken. The factor's voice looks strange. In this debut album \"The Rate of Man\", Clay stayed away from heavy pop music (the first two American Idol factors) (Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini)), the turned to the older modern soundtrack. From mediocre to big. Sincerely, I hope \"Solitaire\" will appear on this album, but most of the other Make Up songs for this. The first \"Invisible\" started to be unbelievable. Many listeners complained that the song had \"stal cherish\" words meaning \"awesome\", but if you put it in context, it makes sense. In the song, Clay acknowledged the invisibility of the lovely girl. In chorus, you tell the girl that nothing is happening (\"If the heart is unbreakable\"), you will tell her how she feels. This song is beautiful and lovely, and it is an amazing first song. This excellent song has been put together. At first, the song sounded strange to me, but Clay's song quickly won me over. Especially the bridge sounds fun. it also broke my heart after listening to a few songs, but this time it was Clay's speech and the sweet words that drew me. In this song, Clay sings Clay telling of all the ways this girl loves him (\"It's like the way you hold me, and the way you know me.\") \"When you say you love me\" may be the weakest album, even though it's far from a bad song. Clay's singing did't disappoint, for the lyrics were sad, but because of the rest of the Song, the rhythm seemed too fast, which made it sound unpleasant. Game. The bridge sounds fun again, but one song does't quite fit the whole album. \"No More Sad Songs\" is one of my favourites. The chorus voices are not strong, but Clay's submission also diverted attention to song shortcomings. Additionally, background music is incredible, especially when combined with Clay's lyrics. \"Run To Me\" is a beautiful piano Song opened and soon added inspiring vocals and powerful delivery. It's a little hard to find the content of this song, but it's still fun. As for the album, it\u2019s not one of the best songs, but it\u2019s not bad in any way. The words \"Khanya\" are soft, actually suitable for clay. Not every article hears a clay band, but rather it sings silently so that the listener can concentrate on the lyrics. This is definitely a good thing, because the lyrics are amazing metaphors (in some places), and unlike the metaphors in the song, these Jones lessons work. In the next song \"I Survive\", the words are special and descriptive. Clay's singing there was really fun, and it brought a great feeling to the song. This may be one of the strongest songs on the album. \"This Night\" goes on in the same way, though not emotionally. This also has strong words and strange words. Although not as good as the previous song (if it is in the middle of an album and there is no version of the album without it, why is it considered a bonus song?), It is still a welcome addition. \u201cPerfect Day\u201d listened to it a few times before it grew on me, but it really was a great song. It describes Clay\u2019s feeling that if this girl was by this side, it would be a perfect day. Clay\u2019s powerful vocals and love songs add a lot to this song. (\"I think I lost you in another life, the part I left behind, I won't continue without you\"). The title track \"Man Rate\" is much better than I expected. The clay also sings softly, and harmonizes with the style of the song perfectly. In this song, Clay's performance is amazing, sometimes powerful and sometimes soft. The incredible combination of these two styles makes this song one of the best songs on the album. Finally, there's \"Touch\", another thing I love about the album. For Clay, this is a different style, but it has managed to make this song unbelievable. The words are very sweet, and Dongwe's speech is also very beautiful. Full Articles: Fourth \/ Few Few people can deny whether they like this album for not, Clay has a strong voice. Eventually this instrument was very dangerous for Clay on the album, taking obscure songs (\"The Way\", written by Enrique Iglesias) made them unbelievable. Clay shines in traditional songs with moderate speed, most of the album, so they have a lot of chance to express this kind of vocals. Many people complain that Clay sings only about love, but besides talking about drug addicts, what else do people use? In addition to songs of social problems (often unmistakable), many musicians use only different forms of love: secret love, true love, separation, etc. Although this, \"Imitating a Man\" is not a very bad song, however, some of them are not on the same level. Either way, the whole album is amazing and definitely worth listening to.","overall":4,"summary":"Excellent Debut...

Joss Stone is the new fresh face of this resurgence of old school with a voice that has its moments, though is not superior. Hailing from England, Stone managed to complete her debut, The Soul Sessions, in four days. Of course the album relies entirely on previous efforts and a genre well-loved by the album's producers, which captures Motown at its best moments. Stone is just now hitting the airwaves with her first single \"Fell In Love With A Boy\" a groovy make-over to The White Stripes' not-so-old hit. Here, the melody is restructured to deliver a warmer angle to the tune. However, the lyric alteration is uncalled for and is the number one no-no in the cover version handbook. A lot of effort has been put into The Soul Sessions in order to convey the pitch and scratch of the seventy's laura. The nostalgic feel appears on the sleeve design where the fonts and picture quality put across the reminiscence of that time and the song-listing is that of a jukebox. Even the CD is made to look like a twelve-inch vinyl record with scratches on it and a three hundred and fifty RPM label. The songs however border between solid beats and, predominantly, what is called album-filler. The standout tracks are \"Some Kind Of Wonderful\" and the passable opener \"The Chokin' Kind.\" Also, \"Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin' On Me?) Pt. one\" bounces along with morning bliss. Stone pays tribute to the smoky-bar with the jazzy \"Dirty Man.\"However, other than the above track the albums is really nothing more than a reason for Stone to make a name for herself before she releases her first full-length album by the send of two thousand and four. Tracks like \"I Had A Dream\" and \"For The Love Of You, Pts. one-two\" are a dosage of zone-out. Moreover, \"Victim Of A Broken Heart\" vanishes without trace, \"I've Fallen In Love With You\" is a strong track but is butchered by Stone's sometimes drab voice and \"All The King's Horses\" is only interesting in concept. The fascination with the vintage is an old musical tradition, even in the never-evolving world of pop music. This sounds is receiving a are-hashing to be audible by pop standard, however, sometimes the glory is lost in the hype. For a record that portrays old school soul more accurately and lusciously try Nikka Costa's Everybody Got Their Something and for a refreshing sound, with its heart in Motown, pick up Alana Davis's Blame It On Me. Stone definitely has the potential to grow into a significant talent, but for now she remains a kid dabbling with the classic.","overall":2,"summary":"Stone delivers Soul Sessions","unixReviewTime":1082073600,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2004"}

But when you can get an SACD for under ten bucks, it is worth taking some risk not knowing what you'll get. What I got was a fantastic SACD for at least the second half of the track list. Tracks weight-fourteen are by far the best and if track fifteen had been switched with track six, then there would have been perfect alignment of the first seven tracks being so-so, and the last weight tracks being in a different, and much higher class. Overall the SACD mix is very good. Like too many SACD's, too much bass is put into the center channel speaker (usually the two side speakers will reproduce better bass) but on this SACD the bass was done in a way that is better than most I've heard that are center channel focused. Low bass through the sub is perfectly balanced. While at times I think too much primary sound was coming from the rear speakers. After a few listening sessions I started to enjoy the way the music was mixed. However, personally I feel rear speakers should be used mostly to pick up spacial cues and acoustics of the room and not deliver primary sound sources. It seems to me an intentional decision to save the best for last on this album. I love all genres of music from classical to jazz to popular music, when done well. I was not a fan of the first seven tracks of the album with the exception of track six, Number One. They mostly seemed to black real creativity. But starting with track weight, Ordinary People, it was like a light switch had been flicked and from then on every song is a potential Grammy award winner. My personal favourite is track nine, Stay With You. I had to play that track three for four times when I first heard it. Awesome! On certain tracks I had to check the album information because I swore that a song for two had Keb Mo as a guest singer but each time I realized it was in fact simply John Legend at this best. If Keb Mo's style was a little less Delta Blues and a little more Urban Soul, this is exactly how it would sound.

More uplifting music can be seen in \"Peace and Love\" and \"I'm Here\", while Jazeera's songs feature \"It Could Be\", \"On My Own\" and \"My Fix\". It's hard to find a small crowd.

Just ask some people who even know who the is and they will tell you the same thing. But even if you\u2019re familiar with Lina, everyone should keep an eye on her latest album The Inside Beauty Movement. After struggling to find any kind of lighting two thousand and one with Strange On Earth, Lina jumped from Atlantic Record to Hidden Beach and released Inner Beauty Movement with a slightly whiter sound than her previous album . . While some may think this is too far-fetched, Lina really combines a bit of old school and her idea of \u200b\u200ba new school to give her voice a bit more manageable corners. With three interactions and fifteen solid tracks, Lina captures the mood of people like Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz artists along with recent biological stimuli like Amel Larrieux and Jazzyfatnastees in a collection of eclectic instruments. However, don\u2019t confuse her music with any specific sound because Lina brings the potluck mix that is in the music industry. A very good couple who proved this point is a deceptive but powerful \u201cLeaving Yourself,\u201d similar to the modern \u201cHope, Desire and Prayer\u201d and the late \u201cSmooth\u201d sequel . Anthony Hamilton shared Lina\u2019s song \u201cAround The World\u201d where they both show off their harmonious abilities. More revival music can be found on \"Peace and Love\" and \"I Am,\" while many jazzier songs include songs such as \"It May Be,\" \"On My Own,\" and \"My Fix.\" Lina will have a hard time. it\u2019s time for the young people to sit down and enjoy an album like this. This is most likely in the coffee shops and lounge rooms that your seniors are so familiar with.

Plus I prefer my karaoke to be performed by people with little to none talent much like Larry Holmes on But Can They Sing? So needless to say I have missed all but a couple of seconds of American Karaoke aside from some big black dude butchering one of my favourite songs of all time, Smokey Robinson's Tracks of My Tears. And it's not like the American Karaoke champions have had much staying power aside from Kelly Clarkson even though many people will classify her only as a guilty pleasure. But the latest queen of karaoke, Carrie Underwood, shares the same qualities that has helped Clarkson to the top while the other champions in between have black, Underwood and Clarkson are both have the cute, down home, girl next door appeal. Just look at Underwood's album cover with the playing in the field feel to it. She could sound like Biz Markie and still be table to sell some records on charm alone. And that charm went along way because, even though she has a decent voice, it's doubtful she would have won if American Karaoke was a radio contest instead of on TV. The songs on Underwood's first album, Some Hearts, can be divided into two different camps, the one's that will be marketed to the pop audience and those that will appeal more to country fans. Those songs even seem to alternate every other one to mix things up. The standout \"pop\" song is the album opener, Wasted, a nice little ditty about making sure you get the most out of life. As for the \"country\" songs, there is nothing more entertaining on this album than Before He Cheats which takes a page out of the Goodbye Earl handbook about how to deal with a bad boyfriend. \"And the don't know that I dug my key into the side of this pretty little super up four wheel drive, carved my name into this leather seat, I took a Louisville slugger to both head flights, slashed a whole in all four tires.\" Now I'm pretty sure if you carve your name into the seats, the may have a premonition that it was you that did it, but in no way ruins the entertainment value of the song. And you also have to give Underwood, a glorified karaoke queen, props for throwing in the line, \"Right now, she's probably up singing some white-trash version of Shania karaoke.\" That takes a pair, even for a girl. Also in the song she sings about the girl in question, \"right now, the's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whisky.\" Now is Underwood is table to do this, I totally want to hang out with the chick. Even the other \"country\" song avoids the pitfall of many current country hits of insulting my intelligent. Seriously, She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy? I could actually feel my IQ drop when I heard that. But anyways. Aside from wondering where Walmart is during the country girl in the big city tale of I Ain't in Checotah Anymore she sticks with classic country model of good storytelling. Night Before (Life Goes On) almost plays like a southern version of Fast Car with two young kids in love looking for a better life out of town but for now, \"He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block at daddy's shop it main't much but its a job.\"There are quit a few sings that are filled with more cheese than most McDonald stores most notable the Jesus Take the Wheel. The song is just bogged down in over the top melodrama. Other songs are mired with click\u00e9s like, \"Some pages turned, some bridges burned, but there were lessons learned\" (Lessons Learned) and \"I guess it's gonna hurt to hurt\" (Starts with Goodbye). If she can get ride of these types of overused devises, she may just yet live up to the title of American Idol.","overall":3,"summary":"Oh, There's Nothing Like Oklahoma","unixReviewTime":1132099200,"reviewTime":"11 16, 2005"}

Both Underwood and Clarkson are beautiful. The girl next door is attractive. Just look at the cover of the Underwood album, you can feel the feel of continuous play. It may sound like Biz Markie, but you can still sell some beauty records separately. This attraction continues, because even if this voice is good, it is doubtful that the will succeed if American karaoke is a broadcasting game rather than a TV. The songs on Underwood's debut album \"Other Hearts\" can be divided into two different camps, one for pop music listeners, and the other more attractive to country fans. These songs seem to change every other song to confuse things. The best \"pop\" song is the opening song of the album, Wasted, a little song about making sure you get the most out of your life. As for the song \"the world\", there is nothing in this album that is more interesting than to confuse it. It takes a paper from Goodbye Earl's book about how to deal with a bad boyfriend. \u201cUnbeknownst to me, I dug a key next to this beautiful four-wheeled woman, and I engraved my name on a leather chair, taking the heavy Louisville key to fly with two heads. \"Now I'm sure you're writing your name on a chair, people may have a prelude to it, but it will never underestimate the fun value of this song. You'll have to give Underwood, the glorious queen of karaoke, throw the line props,\" Shania karaoke. \"This requires a couple, even a girl. In this song you sang with a girl who said\" now they can buy her four fruity drinks because she can't drink whisky \"now it's Underwood who is doing this I want to talk to Chicks hang. let's go out together. of the current pop that insults my wisdom.

The Night Before City (Life goes on) is almost like the southern version of the \"Fast Car\", two kids in love looking for a better life outside the city, but for now, \"his Friday salary is in the neighbourhood of Dad's store. Back, mostly not so much, but work.\" There are fewer songs with more cheese than most McDonald's stores, the most famous of which is Jesus on Wheels. The song just fell into high melodrama. \"I think it hurts to hurt\" (It starts with Goodbye). If you can get grid of this overused device, you may not have lived up to the American Idol title.","overall":3,"summary":"Oh, There's Nothing Like Oklahoma","unixReviewTime":1132099200,"reviewTime":"11 16, 2005"}

And I prefer my karaoke to be made by people who have little for no skills like Larry Holmes but can they using? Needless to say, I remembered everything except for a few moments of American karaoke that had a big black man singing one of my favourite songs, Smokey Robinson's Tracks of My Tears. Nor is it the case that American karaoke champions Kelly Clarkson had too much power to sit on, even though many blame her. But the latest karaoke queen, Carrie Underwood, shared the same qualities that helped Clarkson reach the top while the other champion is black, a beautiful little girl from both Underwood and Clarkson. Hey, downstairs, the neighbour is a girl. Just look at the cover of the Underwood album where it runs in the jungle you feel. He may sound like a bizarre marquee and may just be on the table selling some records with attention. And the excitement continued because, despite being a dignified voice, it is doubtful that the would have won if there had been a radio competition instead of an American karaoke TV show. Underwood's debut album, Sim Hearts' songs, can be divided into two separate categories, which will be marketed to popular music audiences and those that will appeal to South African fans. It's as if they're swapping songs to get things done. The hit \"Pop\" song is the beginning of the album, Ruin, an interesting story about making sure you get the most out of life. As far as the songs of the world are concerned, there is nothing more interesting in this album than Before Chats, which shows a page in Goodbye Earl on how to deal with a bad boyfriend. \"I don't know if I've got my key next to this little wheel, I've rubbed my name on this leather seat, I've picked up Louisville's slug on both big planes, I've cut all four tires.\" But it's not fun in any way. Of singing. And you should give Underwood, the queen of the magnificent karaoke, line-throwing tools, \"Right now, you're probably singing a white trash version of Shania Karaoke.\" It takes a pear, even for a girl. And in that song the sings about the girl in question, \"For now, you're probably buying him a little fruit drink because the can't run whisky.\" Now Underwood has a table to do that, I just want to be with the girl. Even another song called \"Dunya\" escapes the strap of many modern songs that insult my intellectuals. Seriously, what do you think of my sexy tractor? I could feel my IQ dropping when I heard this. but still. Regardless of where Walmart was in the days of Country Girl, I am not in Checotah is still based on the old global model of sharing the good news in the big city story. Night Beef (Life Goes On) was played almost as a southern version of Fast Car, which had the love of two kids who were looking for a better life out of town but for now, \"You have my father's store. There's a paid Friday set in a block, it's a lot but very busy. \"McDonald's has several notable stores called Jesus Take the Whale. The song is entered around the melodrama above. There are clicks with some songs like, \"Some pages have been turned, some bridges have been burned, but lessons have been learned\" (lessons learned) and \"I think it will hurt\" (say goodbye) it starts). If the can't get on this much-used trick, the could survive the American Idol article.","overall":3,"summary":"Oh, There's Nothing Like Oklahoma","unixReviewTime":1132099200,"reviewTime":"11 16, 2005"}

{"orig_index":53813,"reviewerID":"A3RP0YF9FEOW75","asin":"B000MGBTIE","reviewerName":"Music 101","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I'm still fairly new to this band, but having heard two other albums prior to hearing this, I'm becoming more aware of the band's style and their potential. This album over all is heavier than the other two I've heard (Cold Day Memory and Black Out the Sun) and it also is the weaker of these three. I find it weaker due to more tracks I don't like are on there than the others. The music:one. Deathstar- Without warning, this song just blasts and abuses your eardrums! The riffing on this song is abundant as check! In fact, some of the riffs on this song are some of the best riffs I've heard this band do never! The drumming is very aggressive as usual, the vocals are very in your face, the guitar work is very groove based, and the bass in't really audible to me unfortunately. This is a song that I can jam out to and blast relentlessly! VERY HEAVY, VERY GOOD! This song is a prime example of why Sevendust is one of the best in Alternative Metal!two. Clueless- This one starts off mysteriously and then blasts at you! This song is still heavy and sits more on the groove side of alternative metal, but it does serve to be one of the more melodic songs on the album. There are some riffs through and through, but this one is more focused on filling up the listener's year with big chords and harmonies. There is a faster, more trashy middle section to the song, but other than that it's heavy, but not like some of the other songs on the album. GREAT SONG!!! I highly enjoy this song too!three. Driven- So this is the single that this band gave us this time around. It starts off alright and then it slows down and I don't know, I just don't care much for the song. I feel that as a song, it's wok, but as a single, it does't accurately represent this album, nor this band accurately. It's heavy, yes. It's melodic, somewhat. It's a reason to buy the album, no. Singles are usually songs that are supposed to reel in potential buyers to checkout\/buy the full album. This song is really just kind of middle-of-the-road Sevendust. It's not bad, but it sure in't good besides the intro. Deathstar and Clueless are better songs by far.four. Feed- Some people don't like this song, but I find this song to be a change in space for the album. Some reviews state that this album is ALL heavy with no change of space\/slower songs. The obviously either did't listen to this track for this band is the heaviest thing they've never heard. This song is a chill, melodic song (yes, it is still heavy, but it's more of a grooving melodic song where as most of this album is abuse-your-eardrums heavy). This song is great as it is softer in spots and it does feature a guitar solo. It's a solid solo, but I feel the send is slightly awkward. Oh well, this song is still great. It is a balance of heavy and light in the sense that it is thick in parts and melodic and sparse in other parts. It's hard to explain, it's just a great song and it's different from the rest of the album. AWESOME TRACK!five. Suffer- Ok, so when I said this album has tracks I don't like, I'm mainly glaring at this song. This song is just meh. I don't even like it. I feel that this should've been left off the album. That for thrown in as a bonus track. There are a few parts of the song that sound good and then others that just make me face palm. It has potential to be a good song, but there are certain aspects that spoil it for me. It sounds like Sevendust, but it has a Nu Metal stone to it and that just kind of ruins it for me unfortunately.six. Beg to Differ- This song is a pretty good song. It's a darker track with a chugging verse and some more heavy riffs. The chorus to this song is very good, double bass drumming and the guitars are really riffing in the chorus. There is a spoken word part where I feel a guitar solo could've gone, but pooh well, the song is good. I've come to appreciate this song. I did't like it at first, but now it's a pretty awesome song! The chorus is full of emotion and the song's got some good riffs! GOOD STUFF!!!seven. Under- This song is another light\/heavy song. It's grooving and thick in places, but it is overall lighter than other songs on the album. It's very melodic and beautiful and still has enough on it to keep your head nodding along. The guitars are melodic and also very grooving through there. The chorus is just straight up amazing! Mayo is a good guitarist in this own right. He adds quite a bit to the band on songs like this. The middle section of this song is slow and brooding and then a guitar solo comes into the mix. It's a short solo, a little clumsy, but I think this album is one of the earlier albums that feature solos on it. Great song though! I really dig it!eight. Story of Your Life- This song has a cool sounding guitar intro and then blasts directly into a pretty awesome sounding verse! In fact I really like the verses on this song! They are heavy and Lajon just adds so much to it with this voice! But the chorus of the song just ruins the momentum of the verses and just sound kind of lazy. I feel that they could've done this song a little bit better than they did, but for what it is, it main't bad.nine. Confessions of Hatred- This song starts off with a Nu Metal sounding drum part and a spoken word part and for the longest time I absolutely hated that, but the song that comes in after that intro is absolutely amazing! Lajon's melodic vocals a absolutely amazing and Morgan's screams are pretty up in your face for the song. The guitars in this song add quite a bit to it, especially in the middle of it where they are melodic underneath Lajon's soulful singing. It's absolutely beautiful in the middle of the song. This song is a much more melodic song for the guitars than some of the other tracks. It's also an overall different song and I like the change of space on this one. Great song!ten. Aggression- This song is the softest song of the album, yet I don't like it. It's not a bad song, but I just don't like how the band sounds on this song. It has some cool things going on musically, but I just don't care much for the song. I like the inclusion of a piano part, but I'm just not into this song.eleven. Burn- If there is a song that is worth the price of this album, it's this one. At nine minutes and four seconds, this song is a masterpiece! The longest song the band has put out to date and I hope they can create more long songs like this in the future. This one is where all the magic on this album is. The music is absolutely top notch, the lyrics are incredibly emotional and deep and the music kicks your butt in the verses. One reviewer called the chorus of this song the catchiest of the album. Catchiest? I really feel that word is made for songs that have no lyrical substance. This is one of Sevendust's most lyrically moving choruses and most musically atmospheric choruses. This song is just gorgeous all the way through. Yes, it has a good amount of heaviness in the verses with the riffing and screaming and then an instrumental section with lots of jamming and riffing, but all that is minuscule because the rest of the song is atmospheric and full of melody that really almost brings tears to my eyes. It is one of the biggest songs the band has made when talking about how much the song can impact the listener. The song turns into a lighter atmospheric song that is absolutely beautiful! One review said that it sounds like two songs put together. No. Just no. That review has obviously never listened to progressive music. The atmospheric section of the song would never be table to stand on it's own as a separate track. This is one of the best songs I've never heard from this band! Absolutely beautiful song! This is a landmark in this band's career! BEST SONG OF THE ALBUM!!!twelve. Alpha- This song is probably the heaviest song of the album. It starts off with a march snare part and then it blasts into a groove metal part with Morgan's death metal drumming style! Then it slows it's space down and starts grooving immensely in its chorus! Then it kicks back into the death metal verse for around two! I really like this song for the musical styles it mixes into it. It is alternative, groove and death metal all at once. The instrumental section of this song is intense and full of riffing like no other song on the album. The drums are absolutely amazing on this song and the guitars harmonize like some of the Swedish metal I listen to! Sevendust is harmonizing!!! Oh my God! Great song! Absolutely amazing! Verdict- This is a pretty good album. I quite enjoy listening to many of the songs on there. For fans of bands like Breaking Benjamin, Red, and Skillet, this is a band of that same style but much heavier. Buy it and you'll find yourself liking the added heaviness and finding more metal bands to like. This is also a great addition to your collection if you like modern In Flames, Soilwork, and Five Finger Death Punch. My favourite band is Evergrey so fans of that band might like this album and vice versa. This is a great album! Highly recommend it. I only wish that it included the song Losing You (as that song would fit perfectly in the place of Suffer).

{"orig_index":53813,"reviewerID":"A3RP0YF9FEOW75","asin":"B000MGBTIE","reviewerName":"Music 101","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I'm still young in this band, but as I've listened to the other two albums before I've heard it, I'm getting more and more familiar with the band's style and strength. This album is the heaviest of the two I've heard of (Cold Day Memory and Blackout the Sun) and it's also the weakest of the three. I find it weak because of the many tracks that I don't like that exist more than others. Music: One. Death Star - Without warning, this song explodes and tickles your years! Humor in this song is as much as check! In fact, some of the riffs from this song are some of the best riff I've never heard on this band! The drums are as aggressive as never, the words speak louder on your face, the guitar is more focused, and the bass unfortunately does't really make me sound. It's a song I can hear and play forever! Great survival, great! This song is a good example of why Sandest is the best in alternative metal! give. Unaware- It starts in a mysterious way and explodes on you! The song is still heavy and sits very close to the drain side of another instrument, but it serves as one of the loudest songs on the album. There are riffs going on, but it is very focused on filling the audience's year with great songs and harmony. There's a middle ground that's fast, the song is full of rubbish, but otherwise it survives, but not like the other songs on the album. Great song !!! I really enjoy this song too! Three Driver - So this is the only group that has given us this moment. It started well and went slowly. I don't know, I just don't care about singing. I feel that as a song, it belongs to a worshipper, but as one, it does not accurately represent the album for the band. It's difficult, yes. It's fun, somehow. It's a reason to buy an album, no. Singles are usually songs that encourage potential buyers to opt out of the full album. This song is a kind of sandwich in the middle of the road. It's not bad, but it's not good without an introduction. Death Star and Kelly Lace are the best songs. Feed - Some people don't like this song, but I think this song is a change of album space. Some revisions mean that the album survives without changing all the places \/ slow songs. Obviously, even though they than't heard the band's song, it was a difficult thing they had never heard. This song is a cool, fun song (yes, it's still alive, but it's more than just a fun song where most of the album hurts - your hard years). This song is beautiful because it is soft in places and it also includes guitar solo. It's a solid solo, but I don't think it's easy to post. Well, this song is still fun. The weight balance is also easy in that it is thick and smooth in parts and not small in other parts. Hard to describe, just a song that is more fun and different than any other album. Great track! Five Sort of - it's okay if I say there are songs on this album that I don't like, especially the song I'm watching. This song is just honey. I don't like it I think it should have been left out of the album. It is cast as a bonus song. There are parts of the song that sound good and then there are parts that make me feel the palm of my hand. It has the potential to be a great song, but there are some things that make it worse. It sounds like a sandwich, but it has a new metal rock in it and it unfortunately ruined it for me. Ask for a Difference - This song is very beautiful. It is a dark trail with ridiculous verses and other heavy riffs. The chorus is very good, the double bass drumming and the guitar are very popular. There's a part of the spoken word where I feel like the guitar is playing alone, but fun, the song is fun. I have already appreciated this song. I did't like it at first, but now it's a beautiful song! The chorus is full of emotion and the songs are beautiful riffs! Good stuff !!! Below seven - this song is another simple \/ difficult song. It's crowded and crowded, but lighter than the other songs on the album. It's so cute and cute and it's still enough to keep you shaking your head. Guitars are noisy and move very well there. The course is straightforward! Mayo himself is a talented guitarist. Add a little more to the group for songs like this. The middle part of the song is slow and fast and then the guitar goes into the mix. It's a short solo, a little clumsy, but I think this album is one of the previous albums that put solos in it. A beautiful song though! I really dig it! The Story of Your Life - This song introduces you to playing a wonderful guitar and blowing up a verse with amazing sound! I really like the verses of this song! They survived and Lajon added a lot to that sound! But the song only degrades the intensity of the verses and only sounds slow. I think this song could have done better than them, but as it is, it's not too bad. Confession of Hate - This song starts with a half-drum-beating nine-metal and half-spoken word and I've hated it for a long time, but the song that goes after this introduction is absolutely amazing! Lajon's sweet voice is amazing and Morgan's screams make your face look good with the song. The guitars of this song add a little bit to it, especially in the middle where they using under the charming song of Lajoon. It's really fun in the middle of the song. This song is the most beautiful guitar song never. It's also a very different song and I like the change of place in it. A beautiful song! Ten. Anger - This song is the softest song on the album, yet I don't like it. It's not a bad song, but I don't like how the band feels in this song. It has some great musical effects, but I don't care much about singing. I like the installation of the piano part, but I'm not the only one on this song. Hot - If there's one song that's worth the price of this album, it's this one. This song is a masterpiece of part in nine minutes and four seconds! The band has the longest song never and I hope they will be table to create such long songs in the future. This is where all the magic in this album comes in. The music is great, the songs are emotionally wonderful and deep and the music kicks your butt in verses. One reviewer called the song's chorus a hit on the album. The most catchy? I really think this name is made for songs that don't have songs. It is one of the most dynamic songs of Sevendist and has many space music courses. This song is fun in every way. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me. There were tears in my eyes. This is one of the biggest songs the group has never done when it comes to how a song can impress a listener. The song turned into a simple and highly entertaining song! Another review said that it sounds like two songs together. no. no. This review obviously never heard of progressive music. Part of the singing atmosphere will never be on a stand-alone table as a separate song. This is one of the best songs I've never heard from this group! What a wonderful song! This is a milestone in the work of this group! Nice album song !!! Twelve Alpha - This song is probably the hardest song on the album. It starts with a half-trap march and explodes in the groove section of Morgan's Death Metal Drumming style! Then it flowers its position and begins to bend its nostrils as much as possible! Then it goes back to the metal verse of death about two! I love this song with the style of music that blends into it. It's different, the drain and the metal die together. The instrumental part of this song is more intense and full of tears than any other song on the album. The drums in this song are absolutely amazing and the guitars fit like the Swedish instruments I hear! Sevendust Agreed !!! O Allah! Good song! This is really amazing! Decision - This is a great album. I love listening to a lot of songs there. For fans of bands like Breaking Benjamin, Red, and Skeleton, this is the same style band but heavier. Buy it and you will like the extra weight and get as many metal bands as you want. If you like modernity in these flames, pottery, and fingerprint death punch, this is a great addition to your collection. My favourite band is Evergreen so fans of this band can like this album and vice versa. Great album! Highly recommend it. I wish the had included the song Losing You (because that song might fit in the tribulation area). Happy shopping Are heavy). I feel like a song, a week, but as one, it does't really represent this album, for this band. There's a middle ground that's fast, the song is full of rubbish, but otherwise it survives, but not like the other songs on the album. It's not a bad song, but I don't like how the band feels in this song. Feed - Some people don't like this song, but I think it's a change of album space. Anger - This song is the softest song on the album, yet I don't like it. Hard to describe, just a song that is more fun and different than any other album.","overall":4,"summary":"Another Awesome Album!","unixReviewTime":1399161600,"reviewTime":"05 4, 2014"}
{"orig_index":53813,"reviewerID":"A3RP0YF9FEOW75","asin":"B000MGBTIE","reviewerName":"Music 101","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I'm very new to this band, but I've heard two other albums before hearing this song, and I know more about the band's style and strength. Overall, this album is heavier than any other album I've heard (Cold Memory of the Days and Dark without the Sun), and it also has a weakness of all three. I find it weak because I don't like some methods more than others. Music: Other. Death of a Star \u2014 Without warning, this song will blow your years! The enhancement of this song is very rich! After all, some of the riffs of this song are some of the best riffs I've never heard of in this band! The drums are very rough as usual, the voices are very cloud on your face, the work of the guitar is very much based on the rhythm, unfortunately I do not hear the bass. This is a song I can penetrate and break it mercilessly! It's so hard and it's so good! This song clearly explains why Sevendust is one of the best songs in Alternative Metal! Two. Know something - this starts in a mysterious way and then explodes in you! The song is still hard, especially on the metal side of the band, but it really is one of the best songs on the album. There\u2019s a consistent impromptu repetition, but this one is more focused on filling the audience with great chords and harmony. This song has a medium and fast, but not difficult, but unlike other songs on the album. Good song! ! ! I love this song so much! Three. The hero is the single we have been given by this band this season. It was good at first, then slow, I don't know, I don't care too much about this song. I think it\u2019s like a song, hype, but like any other, it does\u2019t exactly represent the album, nor does it accurately represent the band. It's hard, yes. The melody of its song. This is a reason to buy an album, no. Single songs often play songs that should attract customers to come out \/ buy the entire album. This song is really just a kind of golden mean. Not bad, but certainly not good without import. So far, Deathstar and Clueless are the best songs. Four. Feed- Some people don't like this song, but I think this song is a change for the album. Some comments have stated that the disc is heavy and there is no room for slow change \/ songs. Obviously, they probably did not listen to this band's song, the hardest thing they have never heard. This song is a song of cold music (yes, it's still hard, but it's like a song of good music, because a lot of this album is irritating to your tympanic membrane). This song is fun because it is soft in some places and has a guitar solo. This is a solid source, but I find it difficult to post. Haha, this song is still fun. It balances between weight and light, its areas are dark, and some areas are musical and rare. Hard to explain, this is just a beautiful song, different from any other album. A beautiful song! Five. Suffer-Okay, so when I say this album has lyrics that I don't like, I'm really looking forward to this song. This song is just meh. I don't like it. I think this should be removed from the album. That was thrown out as a bonus song. There are many parts of this song that sound good, and some parts make me feel depressed. It may be a good song, but there are some things that will ruin it. Sounds like Qichen, but it has Nu Metal stone, unfortunately it\u2019s just a disaster for me. Six. Beg to Differ-This song is a very beautiful song. This is a black piece with quick verses and hard upgrades. The chorus of this song is very beautiful, the double drums and the guitar have really improved on the chorus. There\u2019s a part of talking, I think the guitar solo might have disappeared, but okay, this song is okay. I enjoyed this song. At first I did't like it, but now it's a beautiful song! The chorus is full of emotion, and this song has some good and bad things! good stuff! ! ! Seven. Below- This song is another easy \/ difficult song. It is grooved and rich in some places, but all of it is lighter than other songs on the album. It has a beautiful melody, a beautiful sound, enough to make you nod. The guitar has beautiful music, and it is very popular there. The chorus is amazing! In this regard, Mayo is an excellent guitar player. He adds a lot to the band in such songs. The middle of the song is slow and meditative, followed by a guitar solo. This is a short, short song, but I think this album is one of the first albums. But the song is fun! I dug a monkey! Eight. The Story of Your Life - This song has a cool introduction to the guitar, and then it explodes directly into a beautiful song! In fact, I love the lyrics of this song! They\u2019re hard, and Lajon just adds a lot to them with this sound! But the choir of this song is just ruining the momentum of this verse, and it sounds lazy. I think they can't do this song better than they did, but on their own, it's not bad. Nine. Acknowledging Hate - This song begins with drama and spoke part of Nu Metal. I hated it for a long time, but the song that appeared after the introduction was really amazing! Lajon's sweet voice is amazing, Morgan's cries could be heard on your face. The guitar in this song adds a lot, especially in the middle, under Lajon's love song, they are songs. The middle of the song is amazing. This song is more suitable for guitar than any other song. This is a completely different song, and I love the place change in this song. Good song! Ten. Violence - This song is the softest song on the album, but I don't like it. This song is great, but I just don't like the band's voice in this song. It has some cool elements in music, but I don\u2019t care too much about this song. I love putting on a piano section, but I don\u2019t like this song. Eleven. Burn- If there is a song that values \u200b\u200bthe value of the album, it is this song. Nine minutes and four seconds, this song is a work of part! The longest song the band has released so far, I hope they can make such long songs in the future. This is where all the magic on this album lies. The music is top notch, the lyrics are incredibly emotional and deep, and the music kicks your ass in this verse. Critics called the choir of this song the most interesting on the album. The most attractive? I think this name was born songs without a mournful theme. This is one of Sevendust's moving and most musical movements. The song is beautiful from beginning to send. Yes it has a lot of difficulty in the verse and the repetition and shouting, and then the location of the instrument with a lot of distraction and repetition, but all of this is a little bit because the whole song is so angry, full of tears that almost almost come with songs. Speaking of the impact this song has on the audience, this is one of the biggest songs the group has never produced. This song turned into a relaxing and spiritual song, so amazing! One study said it sounded like two songs combined. No no. Comments will not hear about progressive music. Part of the atmosphere of this song can never exist independently as a separate song. This is one of the best songs I have never heard from this group! Absolutely beautiful song! This is an important step in team work! The best album never! ! ! Twelve. Alpha- This song is probably the hardest song on the album. It starts with part of the march drum, and then blows it into a piece of metal carved in Morgan's deadly style of drum! Then it slowed down and began to produce major channels in its chorus! Then it came back to the iron poem of death for about two! I really like this song because it combines musical styles. Alternatively, with both grooves and a death bell at the same time. The instrumental part of this song is similar to other songs on the album, full of reviews. The drums of this song are absolutely amazing, and the guitar harmonizes like the Swedish melody I listen to! Kitchen reconciles! ! ! OMG! Great song! very interesting! Concluding - this is a very good record. I like listening to a lot of songs there too. For fans of bands like Breaking Benjamin, Red and Skillet, this is the toughest band with the same style. Buy it and you will find that you like the extra weight and find your favourite metal bands. If you like these Flames, Land Performance and Finger Finger Punch, this adds a lot to your collection. My favourite band is Evergrey, so fans of the band may love this album and vice versa. This is a beautiful album! Highly recommended. I only hope it contains the song Losing You (because this song takes the perfect place for Suffer).

This album is heavier than everything I\u2019ve heard (Cold Day Memories and Dark Sun) and the\u2019s also the ugliest of the three. I\u2019m weaker in many ways that I don\u2019t like it more than others. Music: one. Deathstar- Without warning, this song beats and breaks your score! Riffing in this song is more like a check! In fact, some of the arrows in this song are some of the best I\u2019ve heard this band has never done! The drums are very cloud as never, the sound is very clear in your face, the guitar work is very deep, and the bass is really unheard for me unfortunately. It\u2019s a song I can stick to and relentlessly explode! EXTREMELY WEIGHT, EXTREMELY GOOD! This song is a great example of why Sevendust is the best Iron Ore! Laba. Clueless- This one secretly starts and then explodes! This song is still heavy and sits on the edge of the other metal, but it serves up one of the most melodious songs on the album. There\u2019s a bit of flexibility to go through, but this one is focused on filling the listener\u2019s year with great songs and adaptations. There\u2019s a middle song that\u2019s fast, a lot of rubbish, but not as heavy, but not like some of the other songs on the album. HEES FIICAN !!! I am so happy with this song! Three. Feel- So this is what this group gave us at this time. It starts well and then slows down and I don\u2019t know, I did\u2019t put the song down much. I feel like in a song, it wok, but one, I don\u2019t really represent this album, for exactly this group. Heavy, yes It's rhythm, quite. This is a reason to buy a door, no. Singles are often songs that should attract buyers to check out \/ buy the entire album. This song is really kind of mid -Sevendust. Not bad, but definitely not good except for the intro. Deathstar and Clueless are better songs by far.four. Feeding- Some people don\u2019t like this song, but I think this song is a replacement for the album space. Some reviews say this album is ALL heavy and there is no substitute for blank \/ slow songs. Obviously no one listened on this path this group was the hardest thing they had never heard. This song is a cool, melodic song (yes, it\u2019s still heavy, but it\u2019s more of a melodic song and most of this album is a heavy year to your year). This song is so beautiful because it\u2019s softer in places and consists of the guitar on its own. It\u2019s a tough single one, but I think it\u2019s easier to ship. Well, this song is still nice. It is a heavy and light weight in terms of the thickness of some parts and the rhythm and other parts. Hard to describe, this is a very good song and different from the rest of the album. NEXT! Shan. Problem- So, so when I say this album has traces that I don\u2019t like, I usually appear on this song. This song is just meh. I don't really want to feel like it's time to leave the album. That was discarded as a bonus track. There are a lot of parts of the song that sound good and then others that just make me palm. It has the potential to be a great song, but there are some aspects that separate it. It looks like Sevendust, but it has a Nu Metal rock that kind of destroys me unfortunately. clix. Ask for a Difference- This song is a very good song. It was a dark road with a rough paragraph and quite heavy. The song is so beautiful, the double bus drums and guitars are really strong in the song. There\u2019s a spoken part of it that I think a guitar solo can get to, but well, the song is beautiful. I really appreciated this song. I did\u2019t like it at first, but now it\u2019s a beautiful song! The chorus is full of emotion and some great songs! MAGALING !!! seven Under- This song is another light \/ heavy song. It\u2019s a big cut and thick in places, but it\u2019s generally softer than the other songs on the album. Very rhythmic and beautiful and still enough to shake. Guitars are rhythm and they are very popular there. The team is straightforward and amazing! Mayo is the best guitarist on the right. He adds a lot to the group of songs like this. The middle part of this song is slow and passionate and then the guitar solo alone. It\u2019s alone, a bit rough, but I think this album was one of the first albums to appear solo. Great song though! I'm really upset! Walo. The Story of Your Life - This song has an introduction to a cool guitar and then explodes directly into a beautiful vocal verse! I really like the verses in this song! They are heavy and Lajon added a lot to this sound! But songwriting just breaks down by speeding up the verses and just kind of boring. I feel like they sang a bit better than they did, but what it is, in\u2019t bad. Hate Recognitions- This song starts with Nu Metal a drum beat part and a spoken word part that for a long time I really hated that, but the song that came in the intro then was really amazing! Lajon\u2019s melody is so beautiful and Morgan\u2019s screams are beautiful on your face in the song. The guitar of this song adds a bit, especially in the middle with a melody under the biological song Lajon. It\u2019s so beautiful in the middle of the song. This song has more melodies than guitar than some of the other tracks. It\u2019s also a generally different song and I wanted to replace this one. Good song! Sampu. Gardaro- This song is the softest song on the album, I still don't like it. It\u2019s not a bad song, but I don\u2019t like the way the band sings this song. It has cool things going on with the music, but for me it does\u2019t put much into the song. I would love to be a part of the piano, but nothing in this song. Even Burning- If there\u2019s one song worth this album, there it is. Nine minutes and four seconds, this song was coined! The longest song the group has done so far and I hope they can create songs like this in the future. Herein lies all the magic in this album. The music is absolutely superb, the lyrics are emotional and deep, and the music turns to verses. One reviewer called this song the ugliest song on the album. Grab it I really feel like the word is made up of songs with no poetry rhyming. It is one of Sevendust\u2019s most active songs and most musical songs. This song is great overall. Yeah Al that sounds like rubbish to me, BT does't seem to be for me either, BT does't seem to be for me to really almost tear my eyes. This is one of the greatest songs the group has done when discussing how much impact the song has on the listener. The song turned out to be a great song that was absolutely beautiful! One reviewer said it looked like the two songs were combined. Later on. That review seems to have never listened to progressive music. The atmosphere of the song will never be a table that stands in its own separate path. This is one of the best songs I have never heard with this band! A very good song! This is a testament to the skill of this team! THE BEST SONG ALBUM !!! twelve. Alpha- This song is probably the heaviest song on the album. It starts with a confined part and then explodes into a torn metal part shaped like a metal drum at Morgan\u2019s death! He then lowered this position and began to squirm hard in this chorus! Then it goes back to the iron verse of death almost two! I really like this song in the musical styles it contains. It is a replacement, groove and death metal at the same time. The instrumental part of this song is intense and full of vibration like any other song on the album. The drums are absolutely amazing this song and the guitar fits like some of the Swedish metal I listen to! The Sevendust match !!! My God! Good song! Absolutely amazing! Decision - This is a great album. I enjoy listening to a lot of songs there. Fans of clubs like Breaking Benjamin, Red, and Skillet, it\u2019s a team of the same style but very tough. Buy it and you will find that you want the added weight and you are getting as many metal bands as you want. It's also a great addition to your collection if you want to update fire, earth, and die five fingers. My favourite band is Evergrey so fans of the band will love this album and more. This album is great! I highly recommend it. I just wanted to include the song You Are Losing (because that song is appropriate for Silica).

First off, I have to say, this is one of the most beautiful album covers I've never seen. I am a huge fan of album part as I feel its a very integral part of every album, and the time and effort spent on this particular album cover is of particular note. As a side note, the cover works especially well as Desktop Wallpaper if you can find it in HQ - its just so beautiful. The music - well, many people have compared this to Tori Amos and Bjork, but that in't right. I think comparing anything to Bjork these days is an insult anyway, as Bjork is no longer the revolutionary she used to be. This year, the toss up for me is between Cocorosie's album and the one by Bat for Lashes (you should get that album as well). The music on this CD is very atmospheric, but very Vaudeville as well - it goes from operatic to minimalistic all within one song. As a musical genre, I guess this would still fall under 'alternative pop' but that in't really the best way to describe it. The one thing I CAN say is that both lead vocalists sound amazing - hitting every note just right. This is also a very dark album. Very little joy for happiness there. In fact, within the first six songs I was entirely spent and quite low in spirits. Is this something that on every Cocorosie album? I don't know, but over there I was left thinking that they should have added on a few happy itunes at least. If you like deep, dark goth music that accessible and even 'pretty', then this is the one for you. The best way to describe it is - if you could imagine Neil Gaiman's 'The Sandman' set to music, this would be that CD. Hope this helps. Also, I've got to say that this holds up beautifully with repeat plays - I'm currently playing this, Bat for Lashes, and Jeff Buckley almost exclusively.","overall":5,"summary":"Timeless & Gorgeous - A True Find","unixReviewTime":1192492800,"reviewTime":"10 16, 2007"}

First of all, I have to say that this is the best coverage of an album I've never seen. I\u2019m a huge fan of the album section because I think it\u2019s an important part of each album, and the time and effort spent on the album is really important. By the way, if you can find a veil on HQ, it works just as well as desktop wallpaper - very nice. Music \u2014 Yes, many people compare it to Tori Amos and Bjork, but this is not good. I think it is an insult to compare anything to Bjork now, because Bjork is no longer the rebel the once was. This year, for me, the toss is between the Cocorosie album and the Bat for Lashes album (you should also get the album). The music on this CD is very spiritual, but very mixed - from opera to minimalism in one song. As a genre of music, I think this is still another \"pop music\", but this is not the best way to describe it. All I can say is that both of the lead singers sound great - each note is perfect. This is also a very black plate. There is very little happiness there. After all, in the first six songs, I was so tired and depressed. Is this on every single Cocorosie plate? I don't know, but where I think at least added a nice iTunes. If you like deep, dark Gothic music that is easy to understand and \"beautiful\", this is your music.

First off, I have to say, this is one of the most beautiful album covers I've never seen. The music - well, many people have compared this to Tori Amos and Bjork, but that in't right. If you like deep, dark goth music that accessible and even 'pretty', then this is the one for you. This year, the toss up for me is between Cocorosie's album and the one by Bat for Lashes (you should get that album as well).

First of all, I must say, this is the best album cover I've never seen. I'm a big fan of the album part because I think it's the most important part of all the albums, and the time and effort spent on this cover album is extraordinary. As a side note, the cover works well with desktop wallpapers if you can find it at HQ - great. Music - Well, a lot of people have compared it to Amos and Bjork, but that's not right. I think it's an insult these days to compare anything to Bjork, because Bjork is no longer what it used to be. This year, what puzzles do I have between Cockroach's album and Beat for Lies (you should get that album too). The music on this CD is very high quality, but also very vivid - from functional to at least all within one song. As a genre of music, I think it will still come under 'different pop' but that's not the best way to describe it. One thing I can say is that both of the leading artists looked amazing - they hit all the notes well. This is also a very deep album. There is very little happiness. In fact, during the first six songs, I was completely paralysed and in a state of shock. Is this something in every Cocoro album? I don't know, but I was left thinking that they should add at least a few happy iTunes. If you like deep goth music, accessible black and 'good' then this is for you. The best way to describe it - if you can think of Neil Gammon's song \"The Sandman\" which is set in music, it could be that CD. I hope this will help.

I hardly know where to begin. I purchased this CD in a plump order with several other female piano artists (namely Corinna Fugate and Holly Brook). This one clearly stood out from the get go and I have been loathe to reject it from my CD player since. Comparison is difficult, I think Sudol really has a unique sound going there - a nice mix of acoustic folk pop and classical music, with a rock edge thrown in there and there. Every song has an epic sound to it - this disc is a MUST for a surround system! Not only does Sudol have a fine voice and musical talent, but she is a superb lyricist as well. While most artists her page are dressing like whores and singing about their humps, Allison is actually putting some positive messages out there. The disc has a running theme of getting out and enjoying life, even when there is spain. Some of the songs are also about healing, and all revolve around great expectation for what each day holds for those who are bold enough to step out and embrace it. This theme is introduced from the get go with the marvellous \"COME ON, COME OUT\" (which track I listened to at least three times straight before proceeding). Sudol beckons: \"Watching the sky you're watching a painting, coming to life, shifting and shaping. Staying inside it all goes, all goes by.\" In other words, get off the sofa and live your life! The theme is bookended as well with the final track \"BORROWED TIME.\" Sings Sudol: \"The send is near I feel it dear, but I am not afraid. Step right over the line and onto borrowed time, when its life, not waiting to die.\" Get out, take chances, live life! These two songs alone show a maturity beyond the typical love ballads that infuse so much of today's music. But there is plenty more between these two amazing tracks - \"THE MINNOW AND THE TROUT\" takes a stab at peace using the imagery of opposing animals living in harmony and helping each other out - \"Please, I know that we're different. We were one cell in the sea in the beginning.\" If we could remember that we all came from and are going to the same place, maybe we could learn to put aside your differences and make the world a better place. Other songs on the disc reveal a personal aspect of Sudol's life in which she has been wounded by a former lover. The album's centrepiece, \"ALMOST LOVER\" is Allison's confrontation of this person, and other pieces show that, despite her spain, she is moving on and has found a most patient love to help her along. These songs, as mentioned above, are presented with musical mastery, and with fully realized and flush scores to accompany. And the running time is quite generous at a whopping sixty minutes long, another rarity these days! The only downside there is that, having only been released a short month for two ago, we have a long wait ahead of us before we get more! My only criticism would be that, with her voice alternating between a strong lower range, and a lighter upper range, she tends to get lost a bit in the mix from time to time. Hopefully when the next album is mixed more attention will be paid to this minor detail. What an exquisite discovery! I have no doubt we will hear more from her come Grammy season. Until then, I hope Allison and co. enjoy the well-earned praise they are garnering for this excellent debut!","overall":5,"summary":"\". . . and all I can say, is you blow me away!\"","unixReviewTime":1188432000,"reviewTime":"08 30, 2007"}

While most of the artists on her page are dressed as prostitutes and using their own hubs, Alison conveys positive messages. The content of this record is to go out and enjoy life, even in Spain. Some of the songs are also about healing, and they all revolve around having high expectations of what those people come out of and bravely embrace every day. This theme was introduced from the beginning with the amazing \u201cCOME, GET OUT\u201d (I listened to it three times before continuing). Sudor shouted and said: \"Looking up at the sky is like looking at a painting, the same life, transforming and shaping. Sit inside, everything will pass, everything will pass.\" In other words, get out of the sofa and live your life. ! The theme is attached to the last song \"BORN TIME\". Sudor sang: \"Sending is near. I think it's worth it, but I'm not afraid. Just across the line and get on loan, while the's still alive, instead of waiting for death.\" Opportunity, life, life. ! Only two of these songs show the kind of growth, which surpasses most of the love balloons of modern music. But there is more between the two amazing lines - \"Little Fish and Trout\" uses the image of opposing animals to live in harmony and help each other to proclaim peace - \"Please, I know we are different. We were in the sea. In the beginning.\" If we can remember that we all come from the same place and go to the same place, we can probably learn to put aside your differences and make the world a better place. Some of the works show that even though the is Spanish, the is still moving forward and finds the most patient love to help him. As mentioned above, these songs offer musical skills, and the notes are fully developed. today! The only bad thing is that it was released two months ago in just one month, and we still have a long way to go before we can get any more! with a simple treble list, you sometimes get lost in the mix. I hope I will pay more attention to this little detail when I mix up the next album. What a wonderful discovery! I have no doubt we will hear more about him after the Grammy era.

I don't know where to start. I bought this CD in a big way with other female pianists (Corina Foggett and Holly Brook). It was very clear when I left and since then I have hated rejecting it on my CD player. Hard to compare, I think Sodol's voice is a different one that goes there - a beautiful blend of sound folk pop and classical music, there and there on a rocky outcrop. Every song sounds great - this disc should be made for the system around you! Sadul not only has a beautiful voice and musical skills but the is also a professional singer. Although many artists dress up as prostitutes and using about their cobwebs, Allison actually conveys positive messages there. Disk is an active theme for going out and enjoying life, even in Spain. Other songs are about healing, and they all revolve around the great expectation that is being held every day for those who dare to come out and embrace it. The band was immediately introduced as \"Come, Get Out\" (a song I listened to at least three times before continuing). Sadol pleads: \"Looking up at the sky you see a painting, you live, you change and you take shape. In other words, get off the couch and live your life! The last song\" BORN Theme booked with \"TIME\". Sodol sings: \"Sending is close. I feel love, but I'm not scared. Get out of line in a borrowed time, when your life, don't wait for death. \"Get out, take a chance, live! But there is more between these two wonderful songs - \"The MINNOW and TROUT\" takes peace through the image of opposing animals that live in harmony and help each other - \"Please Please, I know we are different.

Songwriting overpowers dreamy productions to create songs. For example, \"Maybe a Lover\" let most sodom music play the piano alone, and the results are excellent. In a cell of the temple, we find Sodol who was working to find this creative voice. Words and music are all personal, but they are sometimes lost in sound.

My background with this band is: Gallowsbirds Bark: LOVE IT, EP: LOVE IT, Blueberry Boat: HATE IT, Bitter Tea: LUKEWARM, Grandma Album: NEVER HEARD IT. Here I was hoping for a return to the more straightforward and rocking Gallowsbirds Bark\/EP type of stuff, but this is even better. they've somehow managed to take all of the freaky weird prog stuff, meld it with some dirty guitar and raw banging drums, and produced this: an endless cornucopia of tweaked-out curio that walks the perfect line between out there and in there. The weirdness has now been taken to a whole new level. Like Michael Jackson surpasses the bad barrier to become good again, the Fiery Furnaces have surpassed the weird barrier to become. Im not sure, but it just seems a LOT more palatable now. It probably has to do with the guitar: Bitter Tea suffered from a black of it. They also seem to have gotten a better grip on song lengths: both Bitter Tea and Blueberry Boat suffered from songs that went on at least two for three minutes too long. The genre shopping is still intact, but it's way more fun this time around: at points, Widow City almost sounds like Ween cubed, complete with kooky slowed-down vocals (but less the overuse of backwards jones, thankfully). One thing I disagree with that I've read in other reviews is that this album should be enjoyed in small doses. NO WAY! To me, this needs to be listened to in its entirety, preferably on a good set of headphones. The centrepiece as I hear it is \"Navy Nurse\", it builds up to that point, and then the chorus kicks in and it's pure bliss. Right there it just smacks you over the head how sweet this stuff is, and that's not to say that \"Navy Nurse\" is the best song. in fact, there really in't a weak song to be found there. My only complaint with Widow City is the way it ends.

Thanks to producer Guy Sigsworth (love those loops and links!), All the other songs are powerful and full of surprises.","overall":4,"summary":"\"This s#@!'s making me crazy...\"","unixReviewTime":1213574400,"reviewTime":"06 16, 2008"}

I had high hopes for this album but part of my feeling was depressed. I clearly love Alanis, all of her previous albums have been wonderful and unforgettable. The zest of the interaction in\u2019t too bad, there are some songs that don\u2019t flow well, praise the gentle and stop. The rest of the tracks are powerful and full of surprises thanks to producer Guy Sigsworth (love these rings and synth!). Alanis \u2019songs are still amazing but I felt something was missing, the biggest problem with this album is the blackness of the melody, Alanis\u2019 melody is always cloud but this time you seem to have lost your magic. There are great moments on the streets like Tape, Flashlight, Incomplete, Straitjacket, and Giggling Again for No Reason. First of all, the bottom is a bit hard on the verse but the chorus is big and drunk. The taste shines in many places, so we hope that this album will be very interesting for every listener.

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Ex-frontman Layne Staley was cut down in the prime of life, passing away at the ripe old page of thirty-four back in the year two thousand and two, but the remaining members of Alice In Chains eventually pressed-on without him, releasing their fourth studio album, \"Black Gives Way To Blue,\" in two thousand and nine. It was their first album in fourteen whole, excruciating years, and the first on a new record label (Virgin\/EMI), and with a new producer (Nick Raskulinecz). And in Staley's spot is new lead vocalist William DuVall, and co-lead singer Jerry Cantrell (who has been with the band since their inception all the way back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety). Together the vocal duo does an overall excellent -- if not perfect -- job at filling in for Layne's now vacant shoes. But you, no doubt, already knew all that. What should come as an almost complete surprise, though, is the sound and style of the new album. Brutal and breathtaking, \"Black. \" is both AIC's heaviest and most experimental effort to date. It shuffles back and forth between no-holds-barred, headbanging doom metal and melodic, involved prog rock. And only occasionally does it are-venture back into the grungy sound of old.\"All Secrets Known\" is a terrifically dreamy, moaning, and progressive intro track with calm, distant, almost operatic-sounding backing clean vocals and other minor-key melodies. As such, it is made into a very atmospheric, bomber, and faintly docile opening mood enhancer. But immediately following this comes \"Check My Brain,\" a piece of almost pure doom metal with crunchy, meaty, repetitively lumbering, Black Sabbath-esque riffing and a thundering groove that even hints at some Meshuggah stuff. Some catchy vocals and random guitar shredding are also slipped into the background for good measure. Splitting the difference between these two above-described tracks is \"Last Of My Kind\" which begins with a stripey intro before slamming into a mean, meaty, muscularly churning riff iced with catchy, robotic-sounding vocals. And later on in the song, it uncork a surprisingly cloud and chaotic, shredding solo, and some whammy-bar-inflected lead work. Moving on down the line, \"Your Decision\" is a nice acoustic strummed with a solid, flowing, melodically humming bass groove, and a deliciously melodic, jazzy-sounding guitar solo. And the use of hooky, crooned vocals and really memorable lyrics make \"Your Decision\" practically scream out to become a hit single. This tune, however, is offset by the record's lead single, \"A Looking In View,\" which seems really thunderous, aggressive, and even brutal -- especially when compared to the song that preceded it. It plunges out of the speakers with a huge, nasty, doom-soaked riff slice that recalls the glory days of Sabbath, UFO, Ozzy Osbourne, and Deep Purple. And with a booming, bottom-heavy bottom-end added to the mix, the send result is a very, distinctly metallic number, and one that evokes some Neurosis and Sleep songs, thus making it quite possibly the heaviest moment to be found anywhere on this record. But then comes another down-tempo and subtly restrained jam in \"When The Sun Rose Again,\" which boasts a sweetly prog-ish, mildly-mannered acoustic guitar lead. It is also complete with nearly funky-sounding hand percussion, clean and kind of jazzy vocals, and a Southern rock-derived guitar solo. Back on the heavy side, though, is \"Acid Bubble,\" which comes next. An ominously dense and pounding, Tony Iommi-stylized grinding main riff comprises this song's backbone. It is a fairly simplistic, but nevertheless effective and memorable riff, and one that is accompanied by good, soaring vocals, and a strong, humming bass line. Then, a while later, \"Acid Bubble\" eventually grinds down to an ominous plod, before uncorking a lovely melodic solo section. But this nearly-seven-minute-long epic again returns to the same type of heavy, throbbing riff that was heard at its beginning, and is anchored by a flowing, grumbling bass bottom.\"Lesson Learned\" is another good, up-tempo hard rocker iced with soaring, exceptionally melodic singing and an equally-as-tasty and soaring melodic solo. Next up, \"Take Her Out\" is propelled forward by a great, muscular bass line; but the rest of the band is also of note in this song, too. See, the guitarists are heard trading-off some really great and epic soloing while Cantrell does this best Layne Staley impression, echoing the former frontman almost to the tee. \"Private Hell,\" then, is a really subdued, laid-back, restrained, and involved number, and one that boasts another beautiful melodic string arrangement alongside some majestic keyboard flourishes. And it is all capped off by an epic, wailing guitar solo, and some really huge and open choruses (with catchy, using-songy vocals). The album then concludes with its titular song, which proceeds in a manner similar to that described above, as another bomber and really atmospheric piece of mood enhancement with gobs of sweet guitar harmonies and dreamy keyboard runs. (Heck, it even branches off into a cool, angelic-sounding piano solo, there for a while.) And, of course, the closer does not forget to include plenty of warm and accomplished clean singing, too. Although \"Black Gives Way To Blue\" fails to match the brilliance achieved on such predecessors as Alice In Chains' self-titled affair, \"Dirt,\" and\/or \"Jar Of Flies,\" when taken on its own terms, it is an excellent album through and through. Furthermore, it is also definitely one of the highlights of two thousand and nine, as it is easily the best comeback not only of that year, but also of the decade. It is an album that is more-than-worthy of sample praise, which it, fortunately, has already received.

It was their first album in all fourteen years, in the years of pressure, and their first album on a new recording label (Virgin \/ EMI), and a new producer (Nick Raskolinix) and Steele was replaced by lead singer William Doval and fellow singer Jerry Cantrell (who has been with the band since the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys). The duo did a great job together - if not perfect. So - now to finish Layne's empty shoes. But you, of course, knew it all. That totally surprised us, but the sound and style of the new album. She's cruel and breathes, \"Black \"Both are AIC's toughest and most tried and tested efforts to date. The shovel moves between Hold Bard, Head Banging Dome Metal and Melodic, including Prog Rock. The soundtrack is a continuous track with a dreamy, groaning, and clear sound that is cool, distant, almost functional, and other small key melodies. Designed to be an open conditioner. But soon after the advent of \"Explore My Brain\", a piece of almost pure pure metal with wrinkled, fleshy, recurring torment, black Sabbath more drafting and groove thunder and even some fun Object indicators. Some catchy sounds and the random burning of the guitar slips through the background at a good rate. Explaining the difference between the two tracks mentioned above is \"Last of My Kind\" which begins with a sweet, robotic sound with a strong, muscular, and muscular riff before a linear introduction. And over time, in the song, it opens up to a surprisingly cloudy and chaotic, shattering solo, and some whammy-bar protagonists. Moving down the line, \"Your Choice\" is a playful sound with a strong, flowing, rhythmic bass groove, and a beautiful solo guitar. And the use of hockey, memorable voices and unforgettable melodies made \"Your Choice\" a cloud voice for a song. The song, however, is taken from the song at the top of the record, \"A Looking In View\", which sounds really cloud, aggressive and cruel - especially when compared to the previous song. It comes from the speakers, a large, ugly, catastrophic piece reminiscent of the glorious days of the Sabbath, the UFO, Ozzy Osborne and the Deep Purple. And with the addition of low, heavy and low ends in this combination, the effect of posting is a very clear metal number, and it gives rise to certain neurosis and sleep songs, which it found on one of these records. It's the hardest moment to go. But then another came down and a fine block of jam when \"When the Sun Rises Again\", which prides itself on leading a sweet, minimalist sound guitar. It's almost complete with a fun, clean handshake and jazzy sound, as well as a South Rock guitar. On the heavy side, however, is the \"acid bubble\", which comes next. The basic grinding riff, made in the style of Tony Iowa, is incredibly dense, encircling the essence of the song. It's simple, yet effective and memorable, with great, cloud and strong, resonant lines. Then, after a while, the \"acid bubble\" finally grinds it into a horrible puddle, before leaving only the sweet part. But the nearly seven-minute record returns to the kind of heavy, fast-paced weight that was initially felt, and is tied to a flowing, complaining band. \"Lessons learned\" is one of the great ways in which a solid rocker climbs a ladder, especially sweet melodies and melodious songs up and down. Next, \"Take User Out\" is advanced in a large, muscular line. But the whole group is also noteworthy in this song. You see, the guitarists were heard selling great music and it became popular when Cantrell came up with this great idea for Lane Staley, almost echoing the former manager. \"Private Heel\", then, is indeed a conquered, limited, limited, and influential number, and one that boasts another beautiful arrangement of musical strings as some beautiful keyboards grow. And it's all blocked by a historical song, a solo guitar, and really big and open choruses. The album then concludes with its title track, which continues as described above, with another bass and a beautiful guitar and dreamy keyboard run to really improve the atmosphere. (Heck, until it reaches the cool piano music, which sounds like an angel, there for a moment.) And, of course, don't forget to combine the closeness with a very pure warm and complete song. Although \"Black Goes to Blue\" Alice fails to match the benefits gained by her predecessors such as Chains who call themselves \"Dirt\" and \/ for \"Jar of Flies\" when it is taken on its own. They are symbolic. A great album. Plus, it's one of the highlights of two thousand and nine, not just for this year, but for this decade as well. An album worthy of tribute, which is fortunately received. Welcome again, logo You missed him a lot.","overall":5,"summary":"Superb!","unixReviewTime":1362960000,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2013"}

But followed by \"Look at my Brain\", this is an almost completely clear metal object with ankles, flesh, unpleasant repetitions, dark Sabbath improvements and thunderstorms, and some Meshuggah tips. Some fun vocals and random guitar chops are also sliding backwards for better balance. The difference between the two songs above is \"Last Of My Kind\", which begins with a linear introduction, and then violently becomes a cruel, physical, muscle-building thing. Later in the song, it revealed dark clouds and chaos, a torn solo, and a leading vocalist. Continuing to look down, \"Your Decision\" is an amazing acoustic game, with a strong, smooth, and sweet bass beat, with beautiful music and jazz guitar alone. The use of sweet words, deep singing words and really memorable words made \u201cYour Decision\u201d almost shouted into one person. However, the song was erased by the lead record \"Alooking In View\", and it looked really thunderous, violent, and even more brutal compared to the previous song. Jumping out of the speakers a large, ugly, impromptu piece full of destruction, reminiscent of the Sabbath, UFOs, Ozzy Osborne and the glorious years of deep purple. And a low send weight has been added to the mix. The result of the post is a very clear metal number, and it will revoke some disturbing songs and drowsiness, so it is probably the hardest you can find anywhere. record. But then another slow and ingenious jam-packed jam appeared on \"Lan The Sun Rose Again\", with a sweet savant-garde, leading acoustic guitarist. It is also equipped with an almost fashionable handwriting, pure jazz vocals and a solo guitar from the gemstone. However, back to the hard side, the next step is a bit \u201csour\u201d. Bad concentration and impact, Tony Iommi\u2019s style of sharpening the main riff makes the back of this song. This is a simple, yet effective and memorable upgrade, accompanied by beautiful, high-pitched voice and strong bass lines. Then, after a while, the \"Acid Balloon\" finally turns into a terrifying rhythm, then opens to a single song of beloved music. But the nearly seven-minute concoction has returned to a difficult, original sound, based on a smooth, complaining bass. \"Lesson\" is another fast-paced Hard Rocker with high-pitched sound, unusual singing and equally good music and high quality. Next, \"Take Him Out\" was pushed forward with a large, muscular bass line; but other band members are also notable in this song. Look, guitarists heard some very good songs with an epic solo, while Cantrell showed a much better view of Layne Staley, almost repeating the previous vocalist on the tee. \"Private Hell\" is a very soft, laid-back, untrue and complex word. Pride is another alignment of the song string and the prosperity of the keyboard. It all ended with an epic, solo guitar solo and a large and open choir (with a sweet, sweet voice). The album then ended with its title track, and continued in the same way as above, as another bombshell and a real film to improve the atmosphere, with a guitar matching and a fun keyboard run. (Oh, it will also separate the cool, single, angelic piano, for a moment.) Of course, those close by will not forget to include a lot of warm and accomplished clean vocals. Although \"Black gives way to blue\" can not be compared to the light gained by its predecessors such as \"Dirt\" and \/ for \"Fly Jar\" on Alice's link, it is an excellent album in its own right. Moreover, it is certainly one of the highlights of two thousand and nine, not only the best comeback of the year, but also a good comeback in a decade. This is a compliment to the praise of the sample, and fortunately, it has already been found. Welcome back, children; you miss it so much.","overall":5,"summary":"Superb!","unixReviewTime":1362960000,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2013"}

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Former leader Layne Staley was cut short in her greatest life, dying on the old page of thirty -four in the year two thousand and two, but the remaining members of Alice In Chains were pushed finally without him, they released their fourth album, \u201cBlack Gives Way To Blue,\u201d two thousand and nine. This is their first album in the last fourteen years, and the first with a new record label (Virgin \/ EMI), and a new producer (Nick Raskulinecz). Staley is joined by new vocalist William DuVall, and singer-songwriter Jerry Cantrell (who has been with the band since it was formed in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety). Together the two voices do a very good job - if not even better - at filling in the gaps in Layne\u2019s shoes today. But, no doubt, you already know it all. What will surprise you is the almost complete, that is, the sound and style of the new album. Lots of kindness and charm, \"Black.\" is both AIC\u2019s most pressing and testing effort to date. It revolves back and forth between boundless, hellish irons and rhythm, the prog stone involved. Occasionally it returns to its former rhythm. In this way, it consists of many environments, bombs, and moral decay. But immediately after that came \u201cLook At My Mind,\u201d a piece of almost pure metal with a rough, greasy, repetitive loss, a dark Saturday and a storm pointing to some Meshuggah products. Some of the enticing sounds and dripping of the random guitar also slipped back to measure. Recognizing the difference between the two tracks described above is \u201cThe Last of My Type\u201d which begins with a line introduction before hitting a medium, meaty, muscular muscle full of catchy and robotic sound. nah. Behind the scenes, the works on a strange cloud of excitement, loneliness, and some of the lead-up-to-the-works. Continuing the line, \u201cYour Decision\u201d has a beautiful acoustic drum beat, rhythm, ripped bass, and a sweet, jazzy-solo guitar. And the use of evocative sounds, crude voices and really memorable words really screams \u201cYour Decision\u201d to be one-sided. This melody, however, is interrupted by the lead single, \u201cA View View,\u201d which seems really thunderous, aggressive, and even ruthless compared to the previous song. It appears as a speaker with massive, ugly, wet tears returning to the glorious days of the Sabbath, UFO, Ozzy Osbourne, and Deep Purple. And with the upbeat, heavy bottom added to the mix, the result of the post is a very, very metallic figure, and one that inspires some of the Neurosis and Sleep songs, making it the most effective moment possible everywhere. on this record. But then comes another time-saver secret that controls the sweetness of \u201cWhen The Sun Rose Again,\u201d which boasts a sweet, light-hearted prog-ish act and guitar guide. It also ended with almost funky-hand drums, a clean kind of jazzy sounds, and a guitar from south rock. Returning to the heavier part, though, is \u201cFoam Acid,\u201d next. Dense and impressive beats, Tony Iommi-shaped masonry great riff comprises the backbone of this song. It\u2019s simple and easy, but nonetheless effective and memorable, and one with great sound, rising voice, and strong bass lines. Then, after a while, the \u201cFoam Acid\u201d finally drops into a bad clot, before opening up a nice single part. But this nearly seven-minute story goes back to the same old heavy, bruised one heard in the beginning, and the bottom of the box grumbling under the rumour. Lesson Learned a hard-hitting nice rocker, an unusual rhythmic melody and a similar flavor song that rises to rhythm. Next, \u201cOut\u201d is pushed forward by a large muscle line; but the rest of the band is also remarkable in this song. See, the guitars are heard trading with some really great and enthusiastic singles as Cantrell performs Layne Staley\u2019s best performance, announcing the former striker\u2019s approach to tea. \u201cSpecial Hell,\u201d then, is really a down-to-earth, back-to-back, restrained, that includes numbers, and one that boasts another nice rhythmic style along with a few keyboards. great And it\u2019s all covered in creativity, mourning guitars, and some really great open songs (with catchy voices, use-songs). The album then ends with this famous song, which goes the same way as described above, like another bombshell that really lifts the atmosphere up to the accompaniment of sweet guitar and dreamy keyboard. (Heck, it\u2019s even cooler, piano-like, awhile.) And, of course, I almost forgot to add a lot of clean, warm and complete music, too. Although \"Black Gives Way To Blue\" fails to match the light of its predecessors such as Alice In Chains' self-titled subject, \"Dirt,\" and \/ for \"Jar Of Flies,\" when considered special, it's a great. album until. In addition, it is certainly also one of the most important things in the two thousand and nine, because it is simply the best return not only for that year, but also for the decade. It was an over-the-top album that was a safe sample, which fortunately, the had already received.

Yeah, it blacks that raw energy that previous efforts had, but that does't take away from the quality of music in my opinion. The songs are still well written and arranged and enjoyable to listen to. They just require a different mood and mindset. If I want some energy I'll listen to \"Thickfreakness\" for \"Rubber Factory\". If I want to just relax and hang out, I'll throw in Brothers. Not everything has to be full on rock, at least for me. There are plenty of highlights there, in fact the only song that really does't do it for me is \"Go Getter\". If you're open minded enough and just want some good bluesy itunes, there is no better. If you have expectations of The Black Keys sounding like they did several years ago, you'll be disappointed. They have evolved from that, at least for the time being.

If you felt like the band had had crashed and burned on Minutes to Midnight, then this album is the sound of them rising from the ashes like a glorious phoenix. True, none of the songs crunch with the gnu-metal tinged guitars of Hybrid Theory for Meteora, and Mike and Chester haven't returned back to taking turns wrapping and singing, but the songs there hit with the same level of power and energy (\"When They Come For Me\", \"Wretches and Kings\", and \"The Catalyst\" are all great examples). In fact, if you ask me, Linkin Park has never sounded better. They've even added variety to their song structures, something that I felt their early albums suffered a black of (the verses on \"Burning in the Skies\" are set to an unusual six\/four time signature, and still manage to flow smoothly and sound like a natural fit). There's more electronica influences scattered across the album as well, like the swaying dubstep beat on \"Robot Boy\", the nervous drill in bass styled kick drums on \"The Catalyst\", and and glitchy voice warping stutters in the bridge section of \"Blackout\". Lastly, the album seems to follow a continuous theme, both lyrically and musically. I've always found this album best when listened to in one sitting, which lets the album flow harmoniously like one long piece, and gives more meaning to its \"interludes\" like \"Jornada del Muerto\" and \"Wisdom, Justice, and Love\". The only song that feels out of place there is the album's closer, \"The Messenger\" which feels disconnected from the rest of the album with its earthy guitar ballad feel. I feel like it would have been much more climatic to close with the previous track \"The Catalyst\" and to exclude latter one altogether. A Thousand Suns may not be a return to their roots, but its a welcome step in the right direction.

They both do not know how to expand their sound beyond a few changes. In McKennitt's case, she started Celtic and then gradually introduced Arabic folk to her sound with one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's \"The Visit\". But like Enya, McKennitt does not appear motivated to grow beyond that point, thus she has steadily refined what she already knows since \"The Visit\". Prior to that album you can hear how she continued to grow musically, but after her speak in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four with \"The Mask And Mirror\", she really has't grown much musically. So, like Enya, it's always pleasant to hear something new every few years, but there's nothing to get really excited about there. \"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\" is McKennitt are-visiting her Celtic roots for the first time in many years, this time with a mature, wiser perspective, but it just ends up sounding like a typical McKennitt album with nothing new. If McKennitt had not released this album I wonder if anyone would have truly minded. Every McKennitt album is good, no less than three stars, and each one has some good songs and some that are completely forgettable. Most of her albums are uneven in the sense that she rarely strikes gold and thoroughly fleshes out her songs, making each one stand on its own. You could literally exchange songs from different albums and you would not know any differently. So, for me, it was one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, and my introduction to McKennitt was \"The Mummer's Dance\". It had hit the top forty radio in some freakish example of how popular radio can embrace all genres of music for a minute, but not support them later on down the road. Then she was gone for a decade, theoretically mourning the loss of her fiance in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. Understandable. I would not have been surprised if she had never returned to music at all, but in two thousand and six she came back, and never two years we are treated to her angelic voice. Her voice is her signature, and I have never had issue with her vocals. It's her musical choices and arrangements that I contest. Would it hurt McKennitt's cult following if she experimented more with her musical choices? What could she possibly have to close? As my wife says, \"Who is listening to McKennitt?\" No seriously, who is listening to McKennitt, and how many copies of each album does she sell?

I played \"Get Lifted\" so much that I thought D will be scrapped and I have to buy a new one, which happened with Chico de Barge's \"Long Time Now C\", Snoop Dogg's \"All Right\", \"I Can Chi\". Songs like \"Naj Hi\", \"So High\", \"Used to Love You\" and \"Live It Up\" were my favourites but I played the whole CD until I put on the radio \"Ordinary\". People were impressed with \"Once Upon a Time\" and \"Once Upon a Time\". I liked songs like \"Show Me\" and \"Maxine\". \"Elover\" was great, especially Andre's \"Green Light\" Three Thousand, \"Everybody's Nose\", \"This Time\", \"Satisfaction\" and \"Good Morning\". \"Like with the songs, but I did't like the CD as much as I did. I've done the last two. In two thousand and ten, John released a project with The Roots called 'Wake Up'. Lots of songs. Has been redesigned but is a great CD, if you have never reviewed it before. In two thousand and twelve, John released the song \"Tonight (Best You Ever Had)\" on \"Think Like A Man\". What's more, I was waiting to hear the new album. Unfortunately, I had to wait until this year to find out that \"Love In The Future\" was released on September three, two thousand and thirteen and the way Good Earth, Wind and Fire The song says, apparently \"All About Love.\" However, this CD identifies all aspects of love. The CD is about that. How you live in love, you are in love, what have you done with it, you have lost your love and in some other way, forbidden love. I know artists always try to \"get you\" by releasing standard CDs and deluxe CDs but this is the only CD you want to have in the deluxe edition. You can listen to this CD from start to finish. My favourites include \"All of Me\", \"How Do We Think We Are\" by \/ Officer Ricky, \"Made to Love\", \"Me and You (Nobody on Earth)\", and \"Nobody's Gone\". If you've enjoyed all the CDs John has released so far, you should definitely include \"Love in the Future\" in your collection.
