The music she chooses supports her voice appropriately, and adds to her sound. She has the ability to conjure up images with each note she sings. Like all of her previous albums, this one is again excellent. There are a many great songs on this album. \"China Roses\" has that hairy sound that Enya is well known for. She sings the backing vocal as an arpeggio of three long notes of just her voice. Over it, she sings the lyrics of the song in her crisp stone, almost like a crystal bell bringing. The Latin sounding \"Pax Deorum\" has a medieval sound to it. Again, she utilizes her voice singing in the background, to add counterpoint to the lyrics. \"Anywhere Is\" sounds like the perfect single for the album. Much more upbeat than the other songs, it has a very staccato feel making it a very energetic song. On the opposite send of the spectrum is \"Hope Has a Place\". Here her voice has a very haunting quality to it, made even more so with the morgan playing behind her. It is a very beautiful song. I'm amazed at how Enya can keep making new albums that sound similar to her previous jones, yet be totally new for the listener as well. Her voice is aging well, and she seems to improve with each passing album.

His voice is a bit old, and the seems to be improving with every album the passes. > In other words, it's \"Memory Trees\", a collection of sweet and complex songs designed to put one down and take a peaceful sleep. Now one would think that since the album title is about trees, the whole work itself would have an environmental theme to each of its songs, but it does\u2019t. Enya began this cycle when her first album \u201cThe Celts\u201d featured celtic songs and jigs, her second album \u201cWatermark\u201d had a collection of water theme songs, and her third album that \u201cShepherd Moons\u201d has songs that discuss the world beyond that. In fact, \u201cMemory of Trees\u201d does a great job of breaking down this cycle, as there are a few songs that talk about everything associated with local trees, and they all show at the door. These include \u201cMemory of the Trees\u201d, the opening track and one of this most popular songs, \u201cChina Roses\u201d, a beautiful flock making and \u201cLa Sonadora\u201d, a descriptive story about dream visions. This album could be one of Enya\u2019s few collections with three instrumental tracks, all of which are great for moving to any part of the album. I don\u2019t recommend playing at the door completely with your car, because you\u2019ll definitely fall asleep. True that\u2019s the album\u2019s biggest strength, but also the deadly weakness.

Metamorpho ;) \"Reflective and Wiser Seer\"","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"Your illustrious Seer is at the beach now. The warm sun and ocean breeze are invigorating. The white seagulls circle overhead (watch out!), and I have been busy all afternoon trying to build a summer sand castle for myself meanwhile sweating to death in this Seer's cape. They asa the fabric breathed and would be good in all temperatures. They lied. And, aside from all that, just when I get the sand castle to a stately form, some freckle-faced, red-headed bratty boy comes around and knocks it down. I threatened to report him to The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Seers, however, an nice cream cone made him go away. Dealing with Guido has made me very adept in any situation. Now if only the tides would stop being a threat. Ah well. Anyway, I am in the perfect setting to examine the rewards of \"Pet Sounds\" by the Beach Boys. Much has been written about this seminal album. And why not? It consistently ranks in the top ten pop-rock albums of all time. And rightly so if you ask me. Of course, it was't greeted enthusiastically when it came out. At least not as much as their prior hits. Brian Wilson took the hit most of all. Probably unjustly. But time has proven that it was the right move and the right time. To most, perhaps a little early and maybe they would say the wrong time. But I would have to disagree with that. Brian was ahead of everything on the scene at that time. He saw that the music was changing. Plus, artistically, you can not stay in the same place. Artistry needs real growth. Meanwhile, the other Beach Boys needed more hits- and this is why the chasm happened. But, lets get into this a little more. The Beach Boys were (and still are) the ultimate summer group. Songs about California Girls, fast cars, high school life, requited love, and teen angst, angst, angst. These songs were incredibly successful. But Brian knew that, as the got older, this audience were also doing the same thing. He wanted to try a new direction and add some sophistication. Looking back to one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six, this album is a monumental achievement- and remains so until this day. Sure, some may downplay the importance of this recording, however, that cannot eliminate the fact that it was a monumental change that influenced the musical landscape at that time forever. It is essential, and one of the very best. But, getting to the main point. Brian Wilson was moving towards greater musical composition and more adult and dinner emotions on record. This was a omega step- and quite a risk at the same time. Most of the music is flush, well thought out, and instruments used precisely to get the right nuances that bounced around in this mind. Certainly the songs are confessional, i.e; \"You Still Believe in Me\", emotional, i.e, \"That's Not Me\", \"I'm Waiting for the Day\", and quiet, heartfelt romance, i.e; \"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on my Shoulder)\". One must, of course, listen to all the colours and passages in this music. All these songs have a way of revealing certain moods that marry the music perfectly. Beautiful lilting breaks, shifting meter, an array of musical instruments heretofore never thought of in the pop-rock genre. Excellent. And songs? We are treated to different, but essential, gratuitous hits with \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"Sloop John B\". But more than this, Brian gives us two more considerable high standard gems. Yes. We get to \"God Only Knows\" which I nominate as the most beautiful song never written in the course of popular music. Grandiose, glorious- I am fairly convinced that a higher power is somehow behind this remarkable song. Sweet, yearning, beautiful beyond compare. Angelic vocals as well. If anyone doubts Brian Wilson's genius, have them look to this song. Absolutely the highest gem. Then we get to the wishful \"Caroline No\". Brian reflects upon how time can change a relationship. He looks back to a time when this love was new and exciting and wonders why she changed. \"Where is the girl I used to know\"? He hurts badly from the change and yearns for a return to a satisfying relationship, knowing full well that it has changed forever. Listen to the send. A train in the distance, approaching at a rapid space, getting louder, and then quickly passing by. A dog barks in the distance-urging its return. But it gone and then silence. What an incredible conveyance of mood this is for the ending. Superb. In a way, the outtake of \"I know There's an Answer\" entitled \"Hold On to Your Ego\" to me, conveys the frustration Brian was going through in order to have the other members of the group in compliance with this new direction. But the knows the's alone and the knows that the's \"going to close the fight\". Well, the may have lost it to them- however- the won the classic album. And we are all so much better that the did. Now, I must go and make sure that kid in't planning some new attack on my new home. I don't want to close the fight anymore than Brian does. In conclusion- a classic and a must have in any considerable music collection. Goats say \"feed me\", Seers say \"read me\". -- yours, Metamorpho","overall":5,"summary":"Wouldn't It Be Nice to Live Together, in the Kind of World Where We Belong?","unixReviewTime":1184371200,"reviewTime":"07 14, 2007"}

From this point on, we have captured the sound quality of every product, though small, works well. Productions are made mostly in-house by Mike Mosley, Studio Ton and Funk Daddy. There are stellar orbits there! \"Sideways\" featuring Cofa's B-Legit and Mac Shawn may be my favourite. The rhythm is strong and is one of my favourite B-Legit styles. \"Spittin '\" is one of my favourites. The first half of the album burned brightly with such an announcement. It almost feels like it is full of clothes, but it has a low surface area. Then there is the biggest single of the E-forty- \"Sprinkle Me\". Click on the appropriate Suga-T corresponding to Forty Water. The rhythm is strong and the words are true. Some of the highlights of the aforementioned \"Dusted'n 'Disgusted\" and the unique development \"one-Luv\". The quality of music albums in the mix is \u200b\u200bthat the album does not include them. The corresponding floor remains part of the E-four. A complete album that is always fun with another event.

This album begins with one of the most famous and memorable jazz melodies never. The song which later became Sonny's theme song, St. Thomas, which has been covered by many jazz artists such as Chuck Mangione and Mundell Lowe. The song is a brilliant composition and conversation between Sonny and drummer Max Roach. The song is begun in a latin rhythm set by Roach, in which Sonny does the melody and solos some of the most beautiful stuff my years never heard. Max Roach then takes then next solo still in the latin feel, then the sets the next groove by turning this snare on and begins to swing this solo until the whole rhythm section comes in for Sonny to express more of himself. Tommy Flanagan gets the next solo until Sonny goes back to the melody, (still swinging) for one verse, until Max sets the group back in the latin feel first demonstrated in the early minutes of the piece. This song is a classic. The only ballad there, You Don't Know What Love Is, is taken beautifully there. Strode Rode, an up-tempo piece swings heavily. The last bars of Flanagan's solo leading up to Sonny and Max's interchanging solos is haunting. Once the two do exchange solos, it is brilliant to listen to. Roach's never ending peas with Sonny's unique play of the notes make Strode Rode a very enjoyable listen. The tune with the more popular title of Mack The Knife, (usually done by singer Bobby Darin) is in a more jazz setting there. And the masterpiece ends with Sonny's extraudinary composition, Blue seven. One highlight is Doug Watkins' bass line. Other highlights include Max's numerous drum solos. This album opened the door for many young players. It also gave Sonny the recognition the needed to be one of the most influential saxophonists in jazz. This is the first period of the genius of Sonny Rollins.

Max Roach then takes the next solo in Latin, then opens the strap, sets the next lot and starts swinging the solo until the whole rhythm enters the stage so that Sony can reveal more about it. Tommy Flagan gets the next solo until Sony returns to music, (still swinging), a verse, until the first minute of the piece is heard until Max Band returns to Latin. This song is old. The only song out there, you don't know what love is, is well taken there. Stroud Road, an up-tempo instalment is very twisted. Flagn's last solo bars, Sony and Max's turn, are amazing. It's nice to hear you both take turns alone. Roach's endless thoughts on Sony's unique play-off notes make listening to Stroud Road a very interesting experience. The song, entitled Make the Knife (usually performed by singer Bobby Darren) is in an extra jazz space. And the fine part ends with Sony's unique song, Blue Seven.

There are still a lot of classics that karen't full of songs like Watts for Phone # but it's a double disc and there are a lot of classics like Ambitions by A. Radha, All About You, How Do You Want, Two America's Most Of the wanted jones, I can pause now because I can name almost all the tracks in the album. Really fix them. Then don't believe it was done in just two weeks, two weeks !! Wow, this is a skill that summarizes the real violence of Topak. There are songs with real gangsterism like working with Snoop on two most wanted people in America. But even though it's a gangsta wrap-up album, PAC added some deep and caring tracks like Life Goes On. Most of the second disc is already a bit lacking in the appearance of talented tourists, but in all this it is still a five star album. Now all your best fans have got it but if you are wondering if it is wrong, I hope you will not regret buying it.

Definitely do those. So you can\u2019t believe it was done in just two weeks, two weeks !! Wooooh, that\u2019s a profession. Taken together this usually shows that Tupac is a real thief. There are songs with real gangsterism like Snoop\u2019s collaboration of two long -awaited Americans. However, even though it was actually a gangsta recording album, Pac put on some of the deep and careful itunes like Life Goes On. Of course there is a slight downside to the incompetent guest features that usually appear on the second album but overall it is still a five-star album.

The album, despite hitting number one, produced only one song, the fourth being \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\" about how they got there. \"Captain Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy\" squandered splendour and costumes and painted a powerful portrait of the artists in their years of hunger. Overwhelming and making many songs mediocre and honest, \"Captain Fantastic\" has given Elton's fans the best of both worlds. The simple storytelling of Elton's work has been likened to the growing confence in him and the writing of Bernie's songs. Although there has never been an interesting song on this album, it is easy to become an unchanged work of this famous era. It even became the first album to make history, with charts stopping the charts. It's also very emotional in Elton's albums. The title track emphasizes a humble beginning, and the well-planned \"curtain \/ we all love\" setup is well done. The late producer Gus Dudgeon has made the album brilliant rather than blunt - the may be one of the most eye-catching participants in Elton's career. (He died in two thousand and two.) It was just a song in Elton's farewell style that became popular, a love song lost without remorse \"Someone saved my life tonight\", when Long John Baldry and Bernie spoke to Elton. Coming out of a marriage that will see him send this music career. A powerful ballad and a great entry into the story of \"Captain Fantastic\". Since the album is a fantasy album, it is best heard as an episode. Angry \"Food Ticket\" is a sweet rock song, as well as \"Bitter Fingers\". But this is the way in which all the pieces are equal which shows the glory of this album. Even if two of the three bonus tracks are number one hits, it's actually a distraction there. Even the liner notes acknowledge this point, stating that Elton and Bernie were genuinely trying to be faithful to the form, and that they had no problem recording the singles indirectly. Anyway, how many albums can have some nice bonus items like the cover of Elton's old concert \"Philadelphia Freedom\" \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" even if you look at it, not the bonus track off, \"Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboys \"is a classic, a moment that puts all teams at the forefront when they were more commercially successful. After the note: I received this album as a gift on my fifteenth birthday, and I met Elton John in Philadelphia in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. When I told him how I got the album (and the poster), the Jokers said, \"It makes me feel old.\" The poster - which Burney also signed - is framed and is shifting to a valuable space on my office wall.","overall":5,"summary":"Elton John's Autobiography On Disc","unixReviewTime":1201046400,"reviewTime":"01 23, 2008"}

Listen to \"Art for Arts Sec\" and you'll hear the beautiful line that separates pop and rock into thousands, nine hundred and seventy. As the stench continued, they left the line, but for a moment, Pooh came very close. \"Donna\" is probably the weakest song in the collection, and it set me up when I first heard it. I think one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, the year of the album \"Ten CC\" from which this song came, there are still some songs that seem strange. This is followed by the song \"Rubber Bullets\" which is a protest song, as well as \"The Dan and I\" by \"Ten CC\". The last of these is in my opinion the top three, but it is the longest. \"Sheet Music\" has proved \"Wall Street Shuffle\" and \"Sly Lo\". Both songs are very fast and have a strong rhythm, but the smell has not come to their line yet. \"Original Soundtrack\" presents \"Life Monster\" and \"I'm Not in Love\". The second one is really good. A song about the denial of love when the artist is clearly deep in love. This song is probably the most memorable of all the songs, and it has often been played on old rock stations. \"How Dear You\" is my favourite album, and it includes \"Art for Arts Sec\" and \"I'm Mandy, Fly Me\". If you like songs in this collection then this album is worth buying. I can guess five stars. The smell has changed a lot from this place. The songs \"People in Love\" and \"For You and Me\" are beautiful songs that take advantage of the stench that has been stinking for the last five years. Played in \"Miami Voice\". I believe that the video of this song was also the first use of morphing in the music video. An interesting song, you can hear the stinking sound. I believe this song was also the last hit song of any member of stench.tencc which was amazingly created through pop \/ rock set. Sometimes a very small pop, but for a while their pop had a strict limit. As soon as the disco page started, their charter role ended, and was replaced by New View. But for a while it was beautiful music. I hope you find what I found in this ordinary rock.","overall":5,"summary":"Rocking Pop","unixReviewTime":1035158400,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2002"}

West, Bruce and Laing did't exactly come up flame in the send. This was about the best of their three efforts (they had a second studio and a very questionable live album to give before they called it a day) in terms of packaging, anyway. And it in't all just a around of supergroup posturing, whatever you think of that intriguing but suggestive cover portrait. \"Turn Me Over\" is actually very effective blues---Corky Laing surprises with a strong lead vocal; Bruce blows out practically the least obstreperous harmonica work of this life; and Laing and West work the crumbling rhythm with surprising aplomb and weight. (If you want to call it \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\" riding \"Southbound Train,\" that would't necessarily be inaccurate.) \"Shake Ma Thing (Ballin' Jack)\" rocks authoritatively enough for a number that's pretty much nothing much more than an exercise in crunch in search of a jaw-dropping riff. But the title track kicks the whole thing off with a ferocious swagger; it's as pure West as you get outside the original Mountain context and this closing soloing is a delight. So is this lullaby-like acoustic exercise, \"While You Sleep,\" oddly affecting even if the threesome sounds like they're half making fun of themselves for doing it. On the other hand, Bruce can't resist indulging this prog pretensions---\"Out In The Fields\" might have worked with a little less mellotron and about half the overdubbed choral voices; \"Theme For an Imaginary Western II\" it in't. And \"Love Is Worth The Blues\"---a rather flame rewriting in metal of the Rolling Stones' \"Play With Fire\" (which they'd play with this arrangement on their live album!)---is a textbook exercise in what was wrong with the original plod style of what became heavy metal, even if they try bringing it up midway with a rocking bridge and a soaring moment for two during West's solo. The real problem, of course, is that this lineup---the scattered moments of excellence aside---is something of a mismatch. Bruce sounds a little too constricted trying to make cream (or should that be Cream?) out of hard clay soil; West and Laing are playing over their heads trying to live up to their bandmate's reputation. On the few moments when they equal it, they show there may have been something substantial there. They were far more effective when the game was kept a little simpler---which they seemed to understand well enough to give Mountain another shot two years later. Unfortunately, that one misfired, too. Maybe the real problem was how they got there in the first place. There was a bit of a bidding war for them once the word got out that they were banding together, and a few too many high expectations (as in, multi-million-unit movement right out of the proverbial chute) on a band that really needed to find its own way first and in measurement, wielded the wrong impact on their work. (Blind Faith experienced a similar problem while managing to deliver a slightly stronger album.) And it's a shame, because on paper West, Bruce & Laing looked like a winner. It would have been nice to see what could have happened without the big chase and the overblown expectations.","overall":3,"summary":"Why Should'ya?","unixReviewTime":968198400,"reviewTime":"09 6, 2000"}

In any case, this is the best of their three attempts (they have a second studio and a live album with a lot of problems before it ends) in terms of packaging. This is not the action of a large group, no matter what you think of this funny but suggestive picture. \"Turn Me Into This\" Really well a very blues-Corky Laing terrifying with a strong singer leading the way; Bruce almost played this very harmonica in the garden of this life; Laing and West I played holding a surprisingly difficult rhythm with the noise. (If you want to call it \"Rollin 'and Tumblin\" ride the \"Southern Train\", that's not true.) \"Shake Ma Thing (Ballin' Jack)\" is enough for an insignificant number. But the title song started everything with a bitter swagger. When you leave the beautiful scenery of the mountains, like the pure west, this kind of send alone is fun. The same goes for this acoustic function like the lullaby \"When You Sleep\". Bruce, on the other hand, can't resist this savant-garde stance- \"Out In the Fields\" can use a small Mellotron and a half-chorus voice called \"The Theme of Imaginary Western II\" does not exist.

David Gilmour's self-titled effort was recorded during down time in Pink Floyd's history. At the same time David Gilmour was making this self-titled solo album, bass player\/singer Roger Waters created demos for The Wall and The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking (which would be this second solo album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four) whilst drummer Nick Mason was producing artists as diverse as jazz musician Michael Mantler, punk rockers The Damned and part rocker Steve Hillage. Lastly keyboard player\/songwriter Rick Wright was making a solo album of this own Wet Dream. David Gilmour's album was recorded in late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven\/early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight at Superbear Studios in France with David producing and handling all of the guitars, vocals and keyboards. Also joining him were sex-Roxy Music and eventual Foreigner bassist Rick Wills and Quiver\/Sutherland Brothers drummer Willie Wilson, whom both had played with David in the power trio Bullet in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven. All of the tracks were written for co-written by Gilmour himself (except as noted). This album kicks off with the great instrumental \"Mihalis\" which is a great guitar workout for David. The next song is \"There's No Way Out Of Here\" (written by Unicorn member Ken Baker) and is a laid back classic delivered with the minimum of fuss and overdubbing; Gilmour's voice rarely rising above a breath. This track was originally recorded by the band Unicorn as \"No Way Out of Here\" and this song was the single off the album doing well on rock radio in the US in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. In fact, this was the song that sent me looking for the album in March of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight on cassette (I have on CD now). Next is \"Cry From the Street\" (co-written by Gilmour and Eric Stuart) is a great rocking number with some great playing. \"So Far Away\" is a nice ballad which has David singing calmly throughout and one of this best guitar solos (the harmony parts at the send of the solo remind one of Queen). Mick Weaver plays some piano on this track. The rocker \"Short and Sweet\" kicks off the album's second half and was co-written by David with fellow Harvest labelmate Roy Harper and is a great song. \"Raise My Rent\" follows and was the second instrumental on the album with more fretwork from Gilmour on the Fender Strat and the riff was inadvertently resurrected in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four on Pink Floyd's The Division Bell on \"What Do You Want From Me\". The bluesy \"No Way\" follows and has a great Gilmour vocal and superb lap steel guitar work. The instrumental \"It's Deafinitely\" follows and has superb guitar work from Gilmour. The album closes with the atmospheric \"I Can't Breathe Anymore\" which sounds like it could have appeared on a Floyd album and rocks out to a collage of Stratocasters and lap steel guitars. David Gilmour's self-titled effort was a modest success as it peaked at #twenty-nine there in the US and went Gold and has held up well over the years. David Gilmour's self-titled solo debut was finally are-released on September twelve, two thousand and six on Columbia Records with digitally remastered sound thanks to longtime Pink Floyd mastering engineer (since one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine's The Wall) Doug Sax plus fully restored artwork.

There must have been a huge pressure on Michael Jackson. He wrote nine of eleven songs on the album. Even though Bad was't as successful as Thriller it still cd pretty good around the globe, Bad sold three hundred and fifty.zero copies in five days during its first week of release in Britain and it stayed thirty-eight weeks in the US top five. Then the went on a world-wide tour to promote the album even further. Wanna Be Startin' Something opened Thriller with an edgy track and so does the title track Bad. It was definitely a strong musically start. It had a catchy chorus \/Because I'm bad, I'm Bad come on\/You know I'm Bad, I'm Bad, You Know It\/You know I'm Know come on, You know\/And The world Has To Answer Right Now\/Just To Tell You Once Again\/Who's Bad\/. I'll admit it might not be the most touching lyrics never, but it's funny and catchy. It reached no. one in America and no. three in the UK. The second track on the album The Way You Make Me Feel is probably the most cheerful song on the entire album. It's one of my favourite Michael Jackson songs never. His voice against this multi-tracked background makes the whole tune perfect. The third single off the album. It reached no. one in the US and once again no. three in UK. Man In The Mirror is my favourite track on the album. The song has been described as more for less a gospel song mixed with pop. I remember seeing this performance of this song a couple of years back. Honestly it's one of the best performance I have never seen in my life. The message in the song is simple; If you want to change the world you should start with yourself and if you are not happy with yourself there's a good chance you might not be happy with anyone else. Surprisingly it only reached no. twenty-one in the UK, but it did landed as no. one in the US. Smooth Criminal is another highlight. Like Michael Jackson's Heartbreak Hotel there is also soundeffects in this track. The song would later appear in this movie Moonwalker. Leave Me Alone was only to be found at the cd version of the album. Its players of vocals give the song a perfect sound. The song carries a very personal message from the singer and it's to be taken literally. The song is a plea for privacy. It reached no. two in the UK though it was not a single in the US. Dirty Diana is the rock song on the album. The song deals with a similar subject as Billie Jean. A woman is willing to sleep her way to get what she wants whatever that might be. It was released as the fifth single off the album. It reached once again no. one in the US and no. four in the UK. There is a perfectly good reason why this album does't get five stars. There is some good material on the album though songs like Just Good Friends, Speed Demon and I Just Can't Stop Loving You are in my opinion just average songs. You would think a duet between Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder would be spectacular well it in't. Speed Demon sounds too mechanical and I Just Can't Stop Loving You is a boring love song. I would recommend anyone to buy the bad. There are some of Michael Jackson's best songs on it.

One of those life-changing records that the first time you hear it (and I mean REALLY hear it-- it took me over ten years to really hear it), you stop what you're doing, no matter what, and you just listen. And somehow, when its done, you start it over again and it feels like everything's changed. Buckley, who died at a young page after recording only one studio album (this one), has left a legacy with us. Showing signs of this pedigree in downtown New York, this music has that sort of unnamed quality you can't quite pin down. Simple folk songs for delicate blues somehow become quite a bit more. It could be Buckley's voice, a high tenor that feels a bit like a non-tempered instrument, is certainly evocative and filled with emotion. It could be the subtlety of the arrangements. It could be something else entirely. The point is, its there, and the music really is transcendent. To single out any particular track is a bit unfair, its pretty much all unbelievably good, from blues-based rock (\"Mojo Pin\", \"Eternal Life\") to ballads (\"Hallelujah\", \"Lilac Wine\", \"Corpus Christi Carol\") and some material that just defies even such broad categories (\"Last Goodbye\", \"So Real\"). But really, star to finish, a superb record. The Legacy Edition has been newly remastered, admittedly probably somewhat unnecessary given that the album is only a decade for so old, but nonetheless the sound is crisp and clean. The bonus disc includes a dozen for so tracks, of-ses, alternate versions, and so on. The material in't quite as essential as the album, but it's all lawfully good, and certainly several of the tracks are as strong as the material on \"Grace\" (\"Forget Her\", \"Mama, You Been on My Mind\"). The set also contains a DVD with a \"Making of Grace\" documentary filmed in the 'ninetys and updated for this set that is quite an interesting watch and runs about thirty minutes long. Buckley's band in particular is a treat to hear interviewed. The disc is also augmented by the videos for the album's singles. Finally, the liner notes contain commentary about all the bonus tracks by producer Steve Berkowitz and Mary Guibert (Jeff Buckley's mother) and a brief essay on \"A Decade of Grace\" by Bill Flanagan. All of this comes wrapped in a giant digipack and a plastic slipcase. All in all, it looks quite nice (and it matches \"Live at Sin-E\" well too-- now if only \"My Sweetheart the Drunk\" would get this treatment!). All in all, this is one great value, and a nice way at looking at the legacy of what really is one of the best albums of its decade.

Initially one thousand nine hundred and seventy. Was released, because it was Sttooge's third attempt. I mean, it looks like if you lived in the city you were given a copy. Outstanding photo punk, Detroit style. Who does't have a copy? You should have one. Before you start playing, check if you can control your volume. Even if you think your volume is normal, you may face hell because this CD is mixed That is why the cloud is probably above all faith The previous reviewer seems to have backed down - it has one, ninety-six remixes of \"Raw Power\", while the \"Millennium\" version seems to be the first mix. Combined by Dav Bowie and Aggie Pop, the first of nine thousand and ninety-three, \"Raw Power\" has been the subject of much controversy over the years, with many fans feeling that Bowie was sucking \"blood and courage\" from the album. Are Aggie was reluctant to are-mix the album-she acknowledged the flawed nature of the original mix, but as stated in the liner notes of this thousand, ninety-seventh edition, \"she never wanted *** for it. However, someone at Sony \/ Columbia decided that the album would be reunited without Iggy - so, wishing to join, Iggy released the album at one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six and mixing engineers Danny Kader and Bruce. Reunited Dickinson, the main producer of this edition, is new. This version of the mixed version has escalated the controversy. Aggie found everything there \"red\" and took a bit, which led to a disappointing level of distortion and even low volume. In fact, you can write a complete article comparing the differences between the two versions. On the one hand, fans of any of the major stages already had a copy of the original \"Raw Power\" somehow, but still, I think they should have replaced the original with all the original mix and the new mix instead of actually changing it. Should have been put in a CD. As far as the \"Raw Power\" album itself is concerned, it's not hard to see why it gets its popularity - these things especially affect hard rock with the Aggie Pop remix. If you're mid-venty Big fans of things like Aerosmith and you haven't heard of this album, so you're wasting a great time. Was, and my brother Ron Ashton was still on the board but was taking on guitar activities with new member James Williamson. Yes, \"Raw Power\" is actually a dangerous hard rock. Williamson wrote all the tracks in \"Raw Power\" with Aggie, and although William was a more successful guitarist than Sun Ashton, this guitar-driven career still That's a good thing. Common tracks include a hard charge, \"Your beautiful face goes to hell,\" meaning \"Hard to beat,\" and \"Penetration.\" With crying, it's another gem. Although Iggy's \"I Need Someone\" was a 'forced' song, don't be fooled by it - it's a great track that can meet the \"need of the child\" by completely kicking it. Hyperactive, hand clap strong \"shake appeal\" is also a fun load. Current versions of \"Your Beautiful Face Goes To Hell\" and \"Entry\" take away the sound of a stupid stereo drum, which is an acceptable change. On the other hand, the original \"Jamie Danger\" is actually a different sound that is heard there and it is a popular version. Even in the original \"search and destruction\" there is a lot of metal in the place of unclean cutting. Songwriting in \"Raw Power\" slows down from time to time. And the title track completes it - it's like loose writing \"Your beautiful face is going to hell\" as if they need another track to complete the album. As the previous reviewer wisely said, any serious fan of \"Raw Power\" would like both models - it's interesting to see how different they are, and each has its own appeal. However, if you're just used to the original mix, you really close if you don't watch this mixed version. Also, this version has extensive, highly informative notes from Iggy which is a great bonus.","overall":5,"summary":"Iggy & The Stooges - 'Raw Power' (Sony)","unixReviewTime":1132617600,"reviewTime":"11 22, 2005"}

His HIStory album had experienced enormous success in Europe, yet America cd not embrace the album as warmly as Europe had. Jackson's popularity in Europe was cemented as the first single Blood On The Dancefloor reached no. one on the English single chart, while the album enjoyed success in both England and the rest of Europe. Blood On The Dancefloor is mainly to be regarded as an EP for a remix album, consisting of five ordinary songs and weight remixes. The title track and the first single Blood On The Dancefloor is a funky up-tempo song with a fusion of keyboard and teasing synthesizers. Despite being released as the opening single, the song was hardly among Jackson's finest material. In fact, Blood On The Dancefloor even sounded dated in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven and it has certainly not aged very well. I always found that the song bore a resemblance to the Dangerous album in terms of sound. Perhaps the material on the Blood on the Dancefloor album was written for that particular album for during the same time period. However, the gruelling theme continues as the song Morphine reveals a character completely obsessed with the drug. The soft and hunting verses are a contrast to the sturdier choruses, yet surprisingly it works quite well. Superfly Sister is Michael Jackson's attempt to simulate Prince; however the repetitive, dull baseline is an unwelcome addition. Similar to the lead single, Superfly Sister suffers from the syndrome of dated-ness. Ghosts and Is It Scary are enjoyable songs; however they are not among Jackson's greatest works. Notably, Is It Scary is a lovely track especially due to the shift between the soft verses and the tougher choruses. I considered it the best song among the five ordinary songs on the album. The remaining weight songs\/remixes are a Tour De Force of dance remixes. Generally, I do not like remixes, however the remix of two Bad, Scream-Louder and HIStory are not half-bad. Yet the remixes of the remaining songs leave a lot to be desired. Blood On The Dancefloor is primarily an indulgence for hardcore Michael Jackson fans. The few ordinary songs are pleasant, however they are not on par with Michael Jackson's back-catalogue. If you like remixes in generally, I am positive the remixes on the album would surely appeal to you. If you have recently discovered Michael Jackson's music, I would advise you to purchase Number Ones for The Essential Michael Jackson in order to fully grasp the back-catalogue of Jackson.

Blood on Dancefloor is basically conserved as the EP of the mixed album, consisting of five classic songs and a hard mix. The title track and the original Blood on Dancefloor is a fast-paced style that combines keyboard and comic synthesizer. Although released as the original, this song is not one of Jackson's best. In fact, \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" sounds like a thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven years old, and certainly not very old. I always find this song like a dangerous album in terms of sound. Maybe the bloody stuff on the Dancefloor album was written for a certain album at the same time. However, as the song Morphine reveals a character completely addicted to drugs, the theme of difficulty continues. The soft and hunting verse is different from the solid chorus, but unfortunately it works well. Sister Superfly is Michael Jackson's attempt to impersonate the Prince; however, a recurring foundation, and loneliness are an unacceptable addition.

Jackson\u2019s popularity tightened in Europe for the first time when Blood On Dance reached no. one of the most destructive charts in the UK, while the album enjoyed success in both England and the rest of Europe. Blood Floor Dance is often referred to as the Remix EP album, which consists of five standard songs and a mix of weights.

Superfly Sister is Michael Jackson\u2019s attempt to remain a Prince; however, over and over again, the lazy foundation is an undesirable addition. Like the alone leader, the Superfly Sister suffers from historical relationships. Spirit and fearlessness are songs to enjoy; however they are not included in Jackson\u2019s major works. Notably, Ma Fear is a popular path especially the transition between soft verses and hard songs. I found this to be the best of the five standard songs on the album.

Like its predecessor, was produced by Bill Szymczyk and has the same band lineup as the previous album. The opening title track, which was a #one hit for the band, is a rock song with a funk\/soul feel which was described as disco-like but it's not a disco number and featured a dynamic vocal from Don Henley whom sang normal in the first two verses and at the send goes into Barry Gibb mode with the falsetto at the send of the track. Next is bass player Randy Meisner's \"Too Many Hands\", written by himself along with guitarist Don Felder (a bit of an odd couple, but it's a superb pm-tempo rocker with killer guitar solos from Felder and guitarist\/keyboardist Glenn Frey). The countryish \"Hollywood Waltz\", which was the only song written by Frey, Henley and guitarist Bernie Leadon and was, bless them, a real waltz. Don's vocal was great and has more superb falsetto work from Henley at the send of the track and the song was the first Eagles track to have a synthesizer. The first half ends with Bernie's first of two contributions, the wild but stately seven-minute instrumental \"Journey Of The Sorcerer\" which was a superb piece of music. The second half of the album starts with the second single \"Lyin' Eyes\", which was one of Glenn's best songs and one of few six minute tracks to top the charts and is a great country-rocker. Next was \"Take It To The Limit\", a grand and melodious stop-and-go ballad, sung by Meisner whom gave this best vocal performance on this track. The album's hardest rock song \"Visions\" had guitarist Felder's sole lead vocal which was co-written with Henley. Next, was \"After the Thrill is Gone\" which was sung by Frey and Henley and was a superb ballad about breaking up. The album closes with Leadon's second of two contributions, the ballad \"I Wish You Peace\", which ironically was this last song with the band as the would leave in late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five. This album was the band's first #one album there in the States. I first got this classic on cassette when I was nine and have the remastered CD and this remastered CD buries the original album!

The album tracks are great for those on their own, which is also the case at the California Hotel.

Following the success of Sign O'The Times, Prince has risen to prominence. Regardless of human and \/ for spiritual reasons, Prince kept the Black Album forever and instead produced Lovesexy, adding only \"When Two Are R In Love\" from Black Album to this part work. Clearly, Prince's best album is Purple Rain. That given. But in my opinion, Lovesexy is the second best album, beating Sign O'The Times with a dirty mind with one hair. Lovesexy has never been the busiest album, as Prince put everything on this album just to see what could be done. Beautiful voice features, impressive guitar enhancements, stylish bus lines, amazing drum Sheila E., and places with strong and strong horns \u2014 all of which go back and forth among nine different songs. However, these songs go from one song to the next without stitching and perfectly. I hope that in time, critics will return to this album, because history so far has given Lovesexy axis!

Often a great artist for band does't get recognized until they release their breakthrough album. For Pink Floyd it was, \"Dark Se Of the Moon\". For Prince It Was, \"Dirty Mind\". Madonna predefined what a pop artist could do during the eighty's and well into the ninety's. Would Mariah Carey for Brittany Spears have never become popular without her influence. Most likely not. This is also back in a time where MTV videos actually had substance and value to them. \"Like A Prayer\", \"Express Yourself,\" and \"Oh Father\", all predefined the fact that video making could be an true part-form if done correctly. Of Course, now that so-called artists like fifty cent, Good Charlotte and Mariah Carey have taken over, video making has gone to the dogs. The album opens with the pop classic, \"Like A Prayer\". It sounds like a typical love song but I think its actually a metaphor for speaking to God and finding spiritual peace; something that Madonna has been trying to do all her life. The video to this song was very controversial with Madonna making out with a black Christ figure, singing in a field of burning crosses, and displaying images of stigmata. The video was revolutionary and she (or nobody else for that matter) never made anything quite like it again. \"Express Yourself\", is another unforgettable video in which the world is divided into classes and nobody is allowed to across over them. \"Love Song\", is a duet with Prince and, \"Till Death Do Us Part\", is the happiest break-up song never. Things change completely with haunting and heartbreaking number, \"Promise To Try\", which is about a single mother who must take care of her only child. Things get happier with the hit single, \"Cherish\", and the almost Disney like song, \"Dear Jessie\", but things then get extremely dark with the ballad, \"Oh Father\". Possibly the darkest pop song never recorded, it tells the tale of a young girl who closes her mother and must deal with her abusive father. The Black and White video that accompany it is also very dark with its use of dark lighting and surreal effects. Things get bright again with the song, \"Keep It Together\", which is about sticking with your family and friends no matter what happens. The second to last song is another haunting ballad. A Spanish like song, \"Spanish Eyes\", is about the singer closing her lover to a war and not being table to deal with it. The last song is just Madonna having fun and pulling a joke on the listener. As you can see, Madonna touches on almost every pop culture subject. While fifty Cent and Good Charlotte are singing about sex and butter nonsense, Madonna is singing about stuff that really matters.

Normally, big band artists will not be noticed until they release albums. In Pink Floyd, \"the dark use of the moon.\" To the prince, it is \"an evil heart\". Madonna predicted what pop artists could do in the eightys and ninetys. Without her influence, would Mariah Carey be popular because of Brittany Pierce? Probably not. This goes back to a time when MTV videos have great content and value in them. \u201cLike Prayer\u201d, \u201cReveal Yourself\u201d and \u201cOh Father\u201d all point to the fact that if done right, video production can be a real part of this form. Certainly, since Fifty Cents, Good Charlotte and Mariah Carey and other so-called artists have taken over, video production has become a dog. The album opened with the famous song \"Like A Prayer\". It sounds like a normal love song, but I think it's really a metaphor for talking to God and having spiritual peace; something Madonna has been working hard to do for the rest of her life. The video of the song caused a great deal of controversy, with Madonna using the image of a black Christ to approach, singing on a burning across, and depicting a stigmata. This video has a change, and she (or anyone else) has never done anything like this again. \"Show Yourself\" is another memorable video in which the world is divided into levels and no one can across it. \"Love song\" by duet with the prince, \"Until death do us part\", is the happiest song of separation. Things have completely changed the unforgettable painful picture, the \u201ccommitment effort\u201d, which is about a single mother who has to take care of her only child. The song \"Cerish\" and a almost Disney-like song \"Dear Jessie\" made things even more fun, but with the traditional song \"Oh Dad\", things got a lot darker. Probably the darkest song never recorded, telling the story of a little girl shutting down her mother and having to deal with her abusive father. The black and white video that goes with it is very dark because it uses dark light and surreal effects. The song \"Keep It Together\" makes things fun again. No matter what happens, you need to stay with your family and friends. The previous song is another memorable ballad. A Spanish song called \"The Eye of Spain\" tells us about a singer who turns this girlfriend instead of solving it. The last song was that Madonna could be happy and make a joke to the audience. As you can see, Madonna covers almost all well-known cultural themes. While Fifty Cents and Charlotte using ridiculous things about sex and butter, Madonna sings the most important thing.

The truth is the album does't need any of these things as it is already perfect and can't be improved on, in fact the original release still sounds perfect. \"Angel Dust\" the second album to feature Mike Patton on lead vocals would go on to influence bands ranging from The Dillinger Escape Plan to The Scissor Sisters and plenty more in between. At the time of its release \"Angel Dust\" confused just about everybody including long-time Faith No More fans to the music press and their rather shocked record label who were expecting \"The Real Thing\" part two and another hit along the lines of \"Epic\" instead gone was the funk metal to be replaced by a much more aggressive sound and add to that the fact that Mike Patton had also dropped the whole nasal voice singing sound that the had used for \"The Real Thing\" to differentiate between Faith No More and this other band Mr Bungle. Probably the biggest influence was that it was the first album that Mike Patton would have a big input on; as most of \"The Real Thing\" was written before the replaced Chuck Mosley as lead singer. The album was worlds apart from the previous work of Faith No More and would incorporate death Metal in the form of \"Jizzlobber\" with its haunting synth outdo and \"Malpractice\". There's the brilliant synth bass work on \"Kindergarten\". The rather suggestive lyrics of \"Be Aggressive\" with its cheerleader sounding chorus, \"Smaller and Smaller\" would feature what's now a trademark Patton shriek before breaking down in the middle into some sort of tribal synth war dance, it's just one of the many turns the album takes. There's the oriental sounding \"A Small victory\" which along with earlier single \"Midlife Crisis\" is about as commercial as \"Angel Dust\" would get. Opener \"Land Of Sunshine\" with its bass heavy sound is a great opener to the album and could only be followed by the madness that is \"Caffeine\" which features a Patton scream fest towards the send of the song. It's fitting that the album should finish on a cover of John Barry's \"Midnight Cowboy\" as you listen to it you can imagine the credits from the warped mind of Mike Patton rolling. Of course reissues of the album would include the cover version of \"Easy\" by the Commordes, while it's a good cover it does feel out of place on the album.

The album did't match the success of \"The Real Thing\" in the U.

Grunge was at its speak popularity and alternative rock was thriving. It was an exciting time for music, and in hindsight, it's certainly understandable how fortyoz to Freedom went under most people's radar. This was, after all, a ska\/reggae\/punk-rock\/rap album full of several cover songs and a fair amount of raunchy material, so the fact that it did not receive any radio\/mainstream attention is not all that surprising. In essence, this is a party album, an album that celebrates sex, drugs, reggae and punk-rock in a uniquely So-Cal\/white-trash sort of way. And I say white-trash affectionately, as it's hard (for me anyway) not to relate to lead singer Bradley Nowell's soulful and amusing tales of cheating girlfriends, shady friends, hard-partying nights, and the associated dance with drugs and alcohol that goes along with that lifestyle. But this album is also about love. That's the predominate vibe there (besides partying): love. This theme comes not only from Bradley's fun-loving and warm persona, but from the music itself, which is equally sunny and frivolous in nature. This can largely be attributed to the reggae inflections that dominate the album, conjuring up images of warm, sun-drenched So-Cal beaches, surf, and babes. But while this album certainly has a fun, laid-back vibe, the gritty and raunchy subject matter of the songs makes this record far from poppy. As mentioned before, there's a lot more going on there than danceable, rock-infused reggae, its reggae driven by the infectious grooves of ship-hop and spiked with a healthy dose of punk-rock. It's hard not to move your ass to this music, either via shaking it to the beat, for thrashing it to the rock. It's a fun album, and it's a raunchy\/playful album too, never taking itself too seriously. Much of the album has a tossed together feel to it, and some of the songs sound like they were cut in one take in a brief moment of drunken-fueled spontaneity. But that's the beauty of this album. It's not particularly well crafted, it's not epic in stone for material, but it's catchy as hell, it rocks, it chills, it flows, and it's completely unashamed to revel in its own So-Cal\/fratboy-esque vibe for the sole sake of having a good time and enjoying life. Even some of the weaker tracks that may initially sound like cheap filler material have their own endearing qualities. Take \"D. J. S.\" for example, which starts out like a parody of a throw-away track from an Ice Cube album, but quickly reveals the memorable and relatable chorus of \"ain't nothing wrong, main't nothing right, but still I sit and lie awake all night\"This album reflects the sounds of good friends who have been jamming together for years, who came up on Toots & The Maytals, Bad Brains, Bob Marley, heights ship-hop, and a wide variety of other influences. You can't help but feel that \"good times\" vibe from the album. And that's certainly good enough for me. You either feel the love for you don't. You either feel the rhythm for you don't. You can either relate to the vibe for you can't. Not for the pretentious and certainly not for the up-tight, fortyoz to Freedom is a beach, yet gritty So-Cal party album with a heart and a whole lot of soul. Sublime might have cut a more well-rounded album a few years down the road, but fortyoz to Freedom captures the real, raw, edgy early essence of truly one of the best bands of the ninety, and it's my personal favourite album from the group.","overall":5,"summary":"40 Oz to Freedom","unixReviewTime":1324771200,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2011"}

But this album is also romantic. This is the main spirit there (without the party): love. This theme is not only for Bradley's interesting and warm characters, but also for the music itself, which is also sunny and carefree. This can be closely linked to the reggae songs that control the album, reminiscent of the hot, sunny Southern California California, surfing and child pornography. However, even though the album has a fun and relaxing atmosphere, the dirty and dirty song content keeps this record away from poppies. As mentioned earlier, in addition to the playful reggae, there is a lot going on. It's hard not to keep your ships to the beat, whether it's moving to the beat for knocking. This is an interesting album, but it is also a record \/ played album. Most of the content in this album has mixed emotions, and some songs seem to be automatically edited after a short period of intoxication. But this is the beauty of the plate. Its production is not very good, its equipment is not important, but it is as good as hell, it moves, it is cold, it flows, and it is not ashamed to get drunk with its So-Cal \/ fratboy spirit. have a good time and enjoy life in between. Even the weakest songs that sound like the cheapest of all genres have their own charms. Take \"DJS\" as an example. The beginning is like a discarded song game on the Cube Cube album, but it quickly reveals a memorable and appropriate song \"Nothing wrong, especially nothing wrong, but I'm sitting, flying, waking up all night\" and Maytals, Bad Brains, Bob Marley, ship-hop highs and various other influences. You can't help but feel the spirit of \"good times\" coming out of the album. This is definitely enough for me. Even if you can't feel love in you. Maybe you hear a rhythm that you don\u2019t. You can interact with the atmosphere because you can't. It's not for the faint-hearted, and it certainly in't for the faint-hearted. In a few years, Sublime could make a more comprehensive record, but fortyoz to Freedom captures the most authentic, authentic, and savant-garde of the band's best never in the ninetys. This is my favourite personal album. > To take \"DJS\" for example, the beginning is like a parody of a song left on an Ice Cube album, but it quickly reveals a memorable and appropriate chorus \"There's nothing wrong with that, most of the time. sleep through the night. \"This album features the words of good friends who have lived together for many years. charming as hell, moving, cold, flowing, and not ashamed to get drunk on its So-Cal \/ fratboy situation. good time and enjoy life in between.

Grunge was very popular and some rocks grow. It was an exciting time for music, and looking back, it is understandable how it went under the radar of the people from the one thousand, nine hundred and forty's to independence. After all, it was a Saka \/ Regi \/ Punk Rock \/ Rap album that was full of a few cover songs and lots of dirty stuff, so the fact is that it did't get the radio \/ general's attention. Surprise that. In short, this is a party album, an album that celebrates sex, drugs, reggae and punk rock in a different So-Cal \/ white-trash style. And I affectionately call it white trash, because of girlfriends, shady friends, fun nights, and drug and alcohol-related dance moves and inspiring and hilarious fairy tales to impress this lifestyle. It's hard to disagree with singer Bradley Novell (for me anyway). . But this album is also about love. This is the central atmosphere there (without parties): love. The theme comes not only from Bradley's taste and warmth, but also from the music itself, which is just as unusual in sleep and nature. This may be largely due to regression influences that control the album, including hot, sun-soaked beaches, surfs and pictures of children. But while the album is fun, the related vibe, the subtle and disturbing theme of the songs make this record far from poppy. As mentioned earlier, a lot happens when there is a drag dance, which is embedded in the rock, driven by the infectious cracks of the flagship shop and sprinkled with healthy punk rock. It's hard not to move your ass in this music, even if you throw it on a rock and shake it to the beat. This is a great album, and it's also a fun \/ playful album, don't take yourself too seriously. Too many albums have been put together, and some of the songs seem to have been automatically cut short in a short period of time. But that's the beauty of this album. They are not very well made, they are not historical in the material world, but they are beautiful, shaky, cold, flowing like hell, and they are absolutely ashamed to find their So-Cal \/ fratboy-esque vibe alone. Not because of having a good time and enjoying life. Even in the beginning, some weak tracks may sound like cheap fillers with some attractive features. Take \"D. J. S\". Making an example, which begins as a track record of closing track from the Ice Cube album, but quickly releases a memorable and repetitive song \"It's not a bad thing, it's not a good thing, but Still, I stay up all night. \" , Toots and the Metals, Bird Brains, Bob Marley, Heightship Hop, and more. You can't help but feel like \"good times\" from the album. And it really suits me. Feel the love for yourself too. Even if you feel your rhythm, you can feel it. You can associate with a web because you can't. Not for the arrogant and not strong, Freedom from the Forties is a beach, but a hundred call party album with a lot of heart and soul. Sublime may have cut a well-collected album on the road in a few years, but fortyoz to Freedom got its first real, green and vibrant basis of one of the nine best bands, and it's my favourite in the band.

It's not particularly well crafted, it's not epic in stone for material, but it's catchy as hell, it rocks, it chills, it flows, and it's completely unashamed to revel in its own So-Cal\/fratboy-esque vibe for the sole sake of having a good time and enjoying life. Sublime might have cut a more well-rounded album a few years down the road, but fortyoz to Freedom captures the real, raw, edgy early essence of truly one of the best bands of the ninety, and it's my personal favourite album from the group. And I say white-trash affectionately, as it's hard (for me anyway) not to relate to lead singer Bradley Nowell's soulful and amusing tales of cheating girlfriends, shady friends, hard-partying nights, and the associated dance with drugs and alcohol that goes along with that lifestyle. In essence, this is a party album, an album that celebrates sex, drugs, reggae and punk-rock in a uniquely So-Cal\/white-trash sort of way. This can largely be attributed to the reggae inflections that dominate the album, conjuring up images of warm, sun-drenched So-Cal beaches, surf, and babes. As mentioned before, there's a lot more going on there than danceable, rock-infused reggae, its reggae driven by the infectious grooves of ship-hop and spiked with a healthy dose of punk-rock.","overall":5,"summary":"40 Oz to Freedom","unixReviewTime":1324771200,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2011"}

This theme is not only passionate and loving people, but the music itself, which is both sunny and naughty. This is often attributed to the reggae changes that dominate the album, which combines So-Cal beach images that are hot, sunny, surf, and baby. But even though this album is really fun, the delay, the complex theme and the softness of the songs make this record poppy.

It\u2019s a fun album, and it\u2019s also a funny \/ playful album too, I never really took it personally. Most of the doors were thrown out, and some of the songs seemed to be cut once within minutes of intoxication. But that\u2019s the beauty of this album.

Following this was \"Surfacing\" which is her biggest selling album to date, going multi-platinum several times in the USA. Her career boomed in the late one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's, but no one really paid much attention to her second album that was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. That album was called \"Solace\" and was, I suppose, the calm before the storm of true artistic success. Solace is a superb album that shows not only a development in leaps and bounds from her debut, but heralds as a pointer of what was ahead in McLachlan's career. As a massive fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I was first introduced to Sarah, as I suspect many of her fans were, through hearing \"Full Of Grace\" in the Season two finale. The high emotion of that episode and Sarah's angelic voice fitted like a glove and combined to create one of the best moments of TV I've never seen in my life. I only bought Sarah's albums this year, though - Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Solace. I loved the former straight away, but it's only this past week that I have learned to love Solace. The album opens with \"Drawn To The Rhythm,\" which is a soft and meditative mid-tempo song with an atmospheric Irish quality to it. It's a cosy little ditty that fits perfectly snug around Sarah's vocals, with elements of folk thrown in. \"Into The Fire\" is completely different with an unusual electric guitar kicking things off. I was rather shocked when it first started because it was't something I expect, and unfortunately, it has dated rather badly. \"The Path Of Thorns (Terms)\" is one of the best songs on the album. At almost six minutes in length, it's a sweeping mid-tempo song with a catchy and memorable chorus. The guitars are very vivid and Sarah's voice is as always amazing. \"I Will Not Forget You\" is a definite contender for the best song on the whole album. It's more than five minutes long, and for this we can only be thankful. The chorus is amazing and very beautiful, especially the way in which Sarah's vocals rise and fall to the title of the song.\"Lost\" is another one of my favourites on the album because it has such a calming and deep quality to it. It starts off differently, however, because it seems almost acoustic. The chorus changes this especially as the dream-like, spaced-out sounds drift in after the first minute. The most beautiful part of the song comes after Sarah sings \"What is there to give for believe?\" Another brilliant song is \"Back Door Man,\" and is probably the loudest Sarah's voice gets on the whole album. Most of the time she sounds like she's just singing contentedly, but there she is really shouting and it works so well. The catchiness of the chorus will stick in your head as one of the album's best moments. \"Shelter\" is another beautiful song but is a bit short in my opinion. Sarah has such an extraordinary vocal capability that her songs should all be epic grand numbers that run for more than five minutes. This three minute number does't do it justice because as soon as it really gets going it's time to finish. The way her voice morphs into something clearer as she sings \"Oooooh. give them shelter from the coming storm\" is really beautiful.\"Black\" is the most unusual song on the album. The combination of weird instruments make this a song worthy of it's title - it really is black. It's a good song but not one of my favourites. \"Home\" is a very beautiful song where Sarah shows off her wisdom as not only an artist, but as a woman. The vocal breakout after halfway through the second minute is grand and beautiful - it's like she's singing over the top of a mountain range, very Utwo in style, although I half expect the song to break out into \"Without You\" by Nielson any minute! The way the song picks up space at the send is superb too. The album closes with \"Mercy,\" which is not one of my favourites but still is a rather good song. It's just a little bit too Hymn-like for me! OVERALL GRADE: nine\/tenIt seems that after releasing Solace, Sarah took a bit more of a commercial route. Her music definitely became more accessible, but it also become better. I loved Fumbling Towards Ecstasy because I'd never heard anything like it before, but Solace took me a little longer to appreciate. However, once you do appreciate it and take the time to listen, the result is very rewarding. I plan on buying more of Sarah's albums this Christmas, especially \"Touch,\" \"Surfacing,\" \"Mirrorball\" and \"Afterglow.\" I'd say that 'Fumbling' is the best place to start if you're looking to get into Sarah's music, and after that let nature take its course: you can't resist her. She's pure, undiluted beauty.","overall":5,"summary":"Pure Excellence From A Beautiful Creature","unixReviewTime":1102204800,"reviewTime":"12 5, 2004"}

Solace is an excellent album that not only shows this rapid growth since this debut, but also announces the future of McLachlan's career As a big fan of Buffy Vampire Slayer, I was introduced to Sarah for the first time because I suspect most of her fans heard \"Full Of Grace\" last season.

A beautiful choir will remain in your mind as one of the best moments in the album. \"Living Room\" is another fun song, but short in my opinion.

It took me a long time to appreciate it. However, when you value it accordingly and take the time to listen, the results are very helpful.

His career flourished until the send of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys, but no one paid much attention to this second album, which was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety. The album was called \"Comfort\" and I think it was peaceful before the storm of real artistic success. Solis is an excellent album that not only shows the development of disintegration and health from its inception, but also announces what is to come in McClachlan's career. As a big fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I was first introduced to Sarah, as I suspect many of her fans were listening to \"Full of Grace\" at the send of the season. The high emotion of this episode and Sarah's angelic voice fit like a glove and make it one of the best TV moments I've never seen in my life. I've only bought Sarah's albums this year, though - Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Solace. I immediately fell in love with the first one, but it was only last week that I learned to love Solis. The album begins with \"Drawn To The Rhythm\", a soft and meditative song entered on the atmosphere of Ireland's famous temple. \"Something the Fire\" is a stark contrast to a small comfy dot that fits well with Sarah's voice. When I started I was shocked because it was't what I expected, and unfortunately it turned out to be very bad. \"Path of Thorns\" is one of the best songs on the album. Tempo with about six minutes long, a middle page warm song and an attractive and memorable course. The guitars are very clear and Sarah's voice is always amazing. \"I'll Never Forget You\" is definitely a contender for the best song on the album. It's more than five minutes long, and we can only thank you for that. The chorus is wonderful and beautiful, especially the way Sarah's voice rises and comes to the title of the song. \"Lost\" on the album is one of my favourites because it has a cool and deep quality. It starts differently, though, because it sounds almost audible. The course turns this into a particularly sleepy one, with different sounds coming after the first minute. The most interesting part of this song comes after Sarah's song \"What Faith Can You Give Us?\" Another great song is \"Back Door Man\" and it is probably Sarah's loudest voice in the whole album. Most of the time you can only hear him singing satisfied, but when the shouts really cloud and it works great. The course will remain on your head as one of the best moments of the album. \"Shelter\" is another fun song but a little short in my opinion. Sarah has such unusual words that all her songs should be the best numbers that last more than five minutes. This three minute number does't do it justice because if it really goes, it's time to send it. The way her voice turns into something clear when she says \"Oooooo. Save them from the oncoming storm\" is great. \"Dark\" is a very unusual song from the album. The combination of weird instruments makes this song fit its title - it's really dark. A beautiful song but I don't like it. \"Home\" is a beautiful song in which Sarah shows her intelligence not only as an artist but also as a woman. The soundtrack after the second minute is beautiful and elegant - it's like singing on top of a mountain, in a very Uto style, though I'm looking forward to the moment of Nelson's song \"Without You\" at any moment! The way the song takes place in the post is also very good. The album ends with \"Mercy\" which is not one of my favourites but still a beautiful song. It's like praise to me! Full Grade: Nine \/ Ten It seems that after Souls was fired, Sarah took another trade route. Her music is easily accessible, but it's getting better. I loved fumbling towards Ecstasy because I had never heard of it before, but Souls took a moment to thank you. However, once you appreciate it and take the time to listen, the result is most rewarding. I plan to buy some of Sarah's albums this Christmas, especially \"Touch,\" \"Surfacing,\" \"Mirror Ball\" and \"Afterglow.\" I would say 'fumbling' is the best place to start if you want to get involved in Sarah's music, and then let nature take its course: you can't resist it. Pure, unblemished beauty.","overall":5,"summary":"Pure Excellence From A Beautiful Creature","unixReviewTime":1102204800,"reviewTime":"12 5, 2004"}

The song \"Coconut\" in't reggae--its stone predates that sound by a whole generation. It's more like the Harry Belafonte interpretation of the calypso sound. A woman puts some lime into coconut milk and ends up calling the doc in the middle of the night and gets this advice; \"put the lime on the coconut, mix them both together, put the lime in the coconut, then you feel better.\" In spirit, it's a lot like the Belafonte number \"Cordelia Brown\", who spends too much time in the sun without a that, and \"that makes your head so red.\" Red enough for her lover to marry someone else.

Is there any frustration at this stage, is it fatigue, complete lubrication, cement \/ asphalt confinement? \"Four Corner Room\" I have interpreted as an urban song, and you can feel the desire to reach some heaven on earth - the answer? But to get listeners' attention, the first track features the Latin Lauderdale California funk kit \"Cisco Kid\", which is more likely to honor an older radio \/ TV show than anything else. The authors conclude, \"The world is a ghetto.\" And George Clinton took over well in this funkdalek situation, the groups that benefited the most from the first funk \/ mid-season. They have achieved great success in all fields. One thousand nine hundred and sixty-two World is a ghetto that has created momentum for the lesser-known Deliver the Word. He and another soul came back alive after the war to the place where they were in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine. But a change has taken place. Like most types of music, a certain level of skill is certain. And that's what happened there on a large scale. As one reviewer points out, the war was a united party in which one member never ruled the light, at least not for long. It was one of the main features of the funk band during the seventies, and the band's atmosphere on this album became the source of their latest development. The voices there emphasize the music more than never, not that the instrument is still at that level. Yet people like it in every way. \"Don't Let Anyone Get You Down\" and \"Lotus Bliss\" both started the album with funky mid-tempo funky songs. The same flavor comes back later in the album with \"So\". But in the meantime, something very interesting is happening. The band takes on the \"Louie's Latin Lament\" cake according to its ability to play musical instruments in different types of music - a sophisticated ballet, Afro-Latin funk and mid-seven pop \/ rock pierced without giving the impression of being solid at the same time. There's nothing wrong with a \"heartbeat\" - it's full of bougainvillea fun in every way and lasts more than six minutes. It has always been one of my top street favourites, even though I only have one album on Vinyl. Both \"Happy Smile\" and \"In Mazatlan\" have good jazzy effects, agreeing with the combination of different metallic effects. Yes, there are hot songs. The most popular is the Latin rock classic \"Low Rider\" and the title of the song, with a clever reggae approach to dealing with racial diversity, is one of my favourites, no matter how much I've heard of it. The war on music will no longer make other such records as interesting as it did in the early eighties. He will always be one of the many band members of the real funk era. Santana and Mandrel seemed to have a strong sense of smell in their voices. It's the same, especially in shifts to other slow-moving voice numbers where the subtle changes in sound they've noticed over the rest of the decade are starting to show on their faces. Unlike many bands that would change the style of sudden cuts in music, War had a good idea to gradually change between some albums, rather than immediately getting wet with a new sound. Not only that, the kept this large audience with him. But it has made change very difficult. And there is nothing in my experience that is more frightening for any artist than the most difficult change of music to win with their audience. And is this the best creative caliper for the album that Jang was table to avoid completely?","overall":5,"summary":"WW II...","unixReviewTime":956793600,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2000"}

Sure, wrap stars probably had more disturbing lyrics, but Phair gets downright dirty with the song \"Flower.\" She sings things like \"I just want your fresh young jimmy\/jamming, slamming, ramming in me.\" To make things even creepier, she's singing this with some kid's xylophone in the background. But in-between this collection of songs about of***-and-runs and murder plots against male artists, there are also intimate quiet bluesy songs. \"Explain It To Me\" is a soft guitar song with African drums in the background, while Phair murmurs, \"Tell them to jump higher\/Tell 'em to run farther\/Make 'em measure up\/Decades longer than you.\"Nearly all the songs have a soft, but biting edge. Phair may play pianos at one time and rock at others, but she has an amazing variety of songs. On one hand, she's wants to expose male oppression, but on the other hand she demands sex from men.

However, this prevents the silent parts from being compromised. or and the frustration that made me listen to the album was to listen to \"never said\" and i think maybe something was missing before that. It is possible that this time I came to the record expecting something different, but instead of being bored, I feel like someone is tired of doing everything for everyone, and I can have a relationship. \"Gunshi\" line which summarizes the main theme \"Look monkey, do monkey, my life story\". Although the album is tragic, it shows strength and confidence behind the rocks with \"Saxon\" and \"F * and Run\". In this note I look at the idea of \u200b\u200bresponding to the gospel, which also answers how stones and men can see women in general. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused me. But in terms of bonus features, the DVD adds context to the album, which impressed the album a bit, with Bradwood (producer), Steve Albini, John Cassack and others. The best part is when different women talk about how the album changed their lives. Two of the three best bonus tracks. \"Ants in Alaska\" seems to be reaching for anything on the album, \"Say\" you've completely lost your mark, and I wish there was a change in the song \"Instrumental\" in the middle of the album. The same album may be related to Hole's \"Live through This\" because it comes out at the same time and is full of frustration, but \"Exile In Guyville\" shows a lot of things and is easy to see. Is. PJ Harvey's latest album \"Dry\" is equally beautiful and full of Spanish, but although PJ Harvey still can't believe that Liz Fair's first attempt was definitely good for him. As far as the comparison between this and \"exile on Main Street\" is concerned. Let's hope you try to get back to that level.","overall":4,"summary":"She's got no love for Guyville","unixReviewTime":1219622400,"reviewTime":"08 25, 2008"}

On the other hand, her frank discussion about sex left me feeling awkward. Please note that I said \"almost\". This is a large disc with a low key with a cool guitar rhythm in \"six'one\". The lower rock feels better than Sheryl Crow. And Phair has a great sense of humour. As far as some are concerned, well, it's a little disturbing to say. Yes, the surrounding stars may have had some disturbing lyrics, but Phair found the song \"Flower\" completely dirty. He sang words like: \"I want Jimmy \/ your little distraction, hit me.\" To make matters worse, she sang the song in the background along with children's xylophones. But in the middle of these songs about staking and the murderous plot against male artists, there are close and quiet blues songs. \"Plain It To Me\" is a soft guitar song with African drums as its origin, and Phair whispered, \"Tell them to jump high \/ tell you to run faster \/ be better \/ taller than you by ten years.\" Almost all songs have a soft but sharp tip. Phair sometimes plays the piano and sometimes rock music, but the has a lot of variety of songs. On the one hand, the wants to publicize the oppression of men, but on the other hand, the wants men to have sex.

And Phair is already humorous. In \"The Song of Divorce\", the spoke emphatically of \"Being a friend is harder than making a lover \/ you should't try to confuse the two \/ because if you do, you're not happy \/ you know. The problem is with you. \"Flower\". But it is a remarkable work to be commended at least. > \"Six One\" is a beautiful low-key disc with a cool guitar rhythm.

(***)After the decent opening \"Endtro\", the kick-off track happens to be the title track. \"Rassassination\" powers in with Stu-B-Doo's brassy horns dominating the track, and Ras spitting a fabulous opening line: \"You main't got enough calcium to have a bone to pick wit me\". He then continues, bragging with remarkable confidence (most would call it arrogance), boasting a set of witty, clever braggadocio rhymes: \"Write my rhymes in alien and battle in----s in sign language\/ Cowards make a little cheese then enlarge\/ artificially, like Pamela Anderson Lee's double D's, please\/ I'm banging from Belize to Tel Aviv on the Red Sea\/ Racin' Saddam Hussein on Kawasaki jet ski's\".\"Ghetto Fabulous\", again sporting a menacing Stu-B-Doo beat with synthesized strings, a haunting bassline and ramming percussion, is darker in stone, with Dr. Dre surprisingly taking a stab at wrapping alongside Ras about living' it up in the `ghetto'. Mack ten blends some powerful clout to the chorus, but Ras' lyrical skill again shines through: \"Want Juice like Tupac, then Obey Your Thirst clown\/ Be in the PJ's in NY, rocking DK\/ Mix EJ with OJ, OK, we say. \"L. A. in----z got crazy game\/ like John Elway got a super-bowl bring\". I>\"Htwenty Proof\" is one of the better tracks on the LP, over a raw, compressed Big Jaz beat Ras laments the black of support for underground artists. He spits some nice lines: \"I'm nice, that's probably why I don't be of--kin with Sprite\/ Cause thirst is nothing, image is everything on the mic\/ These days, these DJs get paid under the table\/ Pay the most popular producer on the most popular label\/ Pay for full page ads in the most popular magazine\/ Now you got the most popular new artist\/ Guaranteed the air we breathe is thin, better tell her\/ Then I'ma choke the bit-h out at eleven:fifty-nine, reveal the real Cinderella\/ (AAAAAAHHHHHHH!) When two hydrogen's reach my oxygen atom\/ You can't gat 'em for get at 'em\/ Anatomically designed to be solar, of--k the wrap star\/ When I die I want in---s doing drive-by's with my ashes in the carWhat is established there is that Ras is without a doubt a stunning emcee. His numerous metaphorical-contemporary culture references reminds me a lot of the style of Outsidaz' frontman Pacewon, and this inventive use of language surpasses many of this peers. He has supreme confidence, and can pull of difficult concept tracks like \"Interview with a Vampire\". Standing at six:fifty-five long, it is the sole track on \"Rassassination\" that can compete for sheer class with anything found on \"Soul On Ice\". With this track Ras craps as part of a three-way conversation with God and Satan debating the creation of the human race, the creation of the earth\/universe and various social issues. Klev's \"apocalyptic\" beat is deeply atmospheric with powerful, thick synthesizers dripping through a slow, stop-start bassline and some chilling chimes. Stunning. Unforunately, this is close to the point where \"Rassassination\" stops being a five star album. It then falls, somewhat drastically. You see, with Ras' attempts to make a bit more scilla, the's ended up by throwing in a lot of half-arsed collaborations, some HORRIBLE beats, and a whole pile of stinking jigginess. Stu-B-Doo immediately undoes all this previous good work with \"Lapdance\", featuring all of the aforementioned curses, as Ras craps sleazily about lapdancers and strip-clubs. This is an absolute STINKER - by far the worst Ras Kass song I've never heard. \"I Ain't F-kin With You\" and \"Grindin'\" (featuring DPGC member Bad Azz) are tedious, uninspired trips through Gangsta wrap territory, somewhere that a man of Ras' talent should stay the hell away from. Ras then invites speed-rap merchant Twista onto \"All Or Nothing\", a horrendously misguided track. Ras' mere style and lyrics are not suited to fast-paced beats and fast rhyme schemes; this lengthy bars are suited more to slower stuff. It's no wonder the's left completely outclassed and lounge-tied. As an overall track \"Ice Age\" is decent, but Kurupt's nonsensical braggadocio (\"Rearranged, restructured, decomposed and decomposed\/ Disassembled, dismembered, reconstructed, polished\". WTF?) and Ras Kass' horrible `playa-hater' lyrics spoil things. A bad effort from two emcee's who are always much better. \"It Is What It Is\", featuring soul crooner Jazze Phe, should't be good but actually is - with some nice lyrics and a sickly sweet beat. \"Wild Pitch\", notably featuring Xzibit, and \"Oohwee\", while sticking solely to tedious gangsta fare, has a pretty nice beat, but can't escape the fact both tracks are strictly tolerable. With \"Rassassination\" Ras Kas has pitched this tent far too broadly - the's changed what the's about as an artist in an (vein) attempt to try and capture a larger slice of the pie. It has failed - while the LP does have its moments - for the majority it falls strictly into the sad category of average. What makes its worse is that Ras Kass is truly a highly talented artist who should Not be coming out with mediocre dross like this. Hopefully, this new LP \"Goldyn Child\" can redress this.

In this way, Ross Corps opposes the creation of humanity, the creation of the universe, and various social issues as part of a three-way debate with God and Satan. Cleo's \"apocalyptic\" rhythm has a deep breath in which strong, strong synthesizers drip on a slow bass line, begin to stand up and make some cool sounds. It is amazing. Unfortunately, this is almost over when \"Resassion\" ceases to be a five star album. It falls, somehow. You see, with Ross's efforts to make it more scalable, the created a lot of arduous interactions, some horrible bits, and a lot of stinky highlights. Steve-Bee Doo quickly reverses all this good old work with \"Leap Dance\", which includes all the curses mentioned, because the ropes and strip clubs insult the dancers. It's really stinky - the worst drama as song I've never heard. \"I am not F-kin With You\" and \"Grindin\" (including DPGC member Bad Azz) is a boring, uninspiring journey through Gangsta wrap, another place where the talented man of Ras has to live in hell. Ross then invited high-profile wrapper Toista to \"All for Nutting\", a surprisingly lost track. Ross style alone and its namesake are not suitable for fast-paced and fast-paced schemes.

Kill things A bad effort from two MCs that are always the best. \"That's what it is\", with soul artist Jazefay, not beautiful but actually beautiful - with beautiful words and beautiful rhythm. \"Wild Pitch\", which is heavily owned by Xzibit, and \"Oohwee\", relying entirely on boring gangsta brands, have a great rhythm, but can't escape the fact that both tracks are bearable. With \"Resurrection,\" Ross Cass has sharply criticized the tent - Jehovah has changed what He says about the artist (rig) who is trying to get a big piece of pie.

What is certain is that Ras is undoubtedly an amazing master of festivals. Many of this paintings - modern cultural references remind me of the style of Outsidaz's great poet Pacewon. She is very confident and can pull out difficult songs like \"Vampire Interview\". At six:fifty-five, only a track in the \"Assassination\" can compete with anything in the \"Soul in the Egg\" at the highest level. In this way, Ras rolls the dice as part of a three-way conversation with God and Satan, discussing the creation of humanity, the creation of the earth \/ earth and various social issues. Klev\u2019s \u201cEnd of the World\u201d beats with a deep breath, and the powerful and heavy synthesizer starts the bass line with a quick stop and drips with some cold strings. it's amazing. Unfortunately, this is close to the point where \"Murder\" is no longer a five-star album. Then it collapsed, with a slight force. You see, as Ras tried to make more scilla, the result was an incredible half-hearted joke, a rare beat, and a lot of scent. Stu-B-Doo immediately cancelled all the outstanding work the had done on \"Lapdance\", which contained all of the above curses, because Ras made a horrible joke about dancers and strings clubs. This is definitely STINKER - the worst Ras Kass song I've never heard. \"I'm Not F-Kin with You\" and \"Grindin\" (with DPGC member Bad Azz as the protagonist) are boring and tiring journeys through the field of Gangsta wrap. Ras then invited the wrapper at a high speed to join \"All for Nothing\", a terrific track that had been lost. The clean style and vocals are not perfect for quick beats and fast-moving schemes; this string is suitable for slower things. Not surprisingly, the left wing is behind the living room. As a complete trace the \"Ice Age\" is fine, but Kurut boasts ridiculously (\"Repairing, remodelling, decay and demolition \/ demolition, disintegration, reconstruction, polish\". Spoils everything. This is what it is \", with soul singer Jazze Phe as a protagonist, it does't have to be big, but it is - it has beautiful vocals and nice sick bands.

Not surprisingly, this is almost where Rassassination stops being a five-star album. It\u2019s happening, a bit too much. You see, Ras\u2019s attempt to make a little villa, ended up throwing a lot of collaborations in half, a few ARAGSAN beats, and all stinky jigs. Stu-B-Doo immediately breaks down all the good \u201cLapdance\u201d work, featuring all the curses we mentioned above, while Ras craps jokes about knees and clubs. This is the perfect STINKER - by far the ugliest Ras Kass song I\u2019ve never heard. \u201cI\u2019m not with you F-kin\u201d and \u201cGrindin\u2019 \u201d(including a member of DPGC Bad Azz) is a tiring and unthinkable journey into the land of Gangsta, a place where one can go to hell. talented people. avoid. Ras invites Twista into the business of a quick \u201cAll for Nothing\u201d, a wrong road. Ras\u2019s style and songs are not only suitable for fast beats and fast song plans; these long bars are suitable for slow objects. Not surprisingly, the left side is completely above the room. The general path of the \u201cIce Age\u201d is clear, but Kurupt\u2019s bragging is pointless (\u201cRevised, rebuilt, broken and shattered \/ dismantled, dismantled, rebuilt, refined\u201d WTF?) And Ras Kass\u2019s \u2018playa-hating\u2019 abomination- disgusting and abusive. . Bad effort from two emcees who are always very good. \u201cIt\u2019s What It Is\u201d, as evidenced by psychologist Jazze Phe, should\u2019t be good but it really is - with nice words and sweet and sick beat. \u201cWild Pitch\u201d, which specifically features Xzibit, and \u201cOohwee\u201d, which just stays in the lazy gangsta amount, have a nice beat, but it can\u2019t escape the fact that both tracks can be hard to tolerate. With the help of Rassassination Ras Kas expanded this tent significantly - it changed what was about the part of testing (root) in an attempt to capture a large tear. It fails - while the LP has moments - it often falls hard on the sad side of the average. The bad is that Ras Kass is actually a brilliant factor who does\u2019t have to have medium sized dirt like this. Hopefully, the new LP \u201cGoldyn Child\u201d will fix this. That is if we have not.","overall":4,"summary":"strong 4\/5","unixReviewTime":1099526400,"reviewTime":"11 4, 2004"}

Benz \"CJB\"","helpful":[9,9],"reviewText":"I would've given the original remastered cd of this album four stars; this version gets five and there's why. This album featuring a revitalized Diana Ross, table assisted by the Chic Organisation (aka Nile Rodgers\/Bernard Edwards) is a seminal, hard hitting dance\/funk classic. It's a genuine crossover album drawing on tasty underground club rhetoric from the late seventy's and still managing to hit the charts right between the eyes. It has no less than three A grade singles - 'I'm coming out', 'My old piano' and the extraordinary 'Upside Down', as well as five other seller support tracks - all very listenable. This release is notable for containing the original CHIC mix of the album - submitted to Motown as the final master before the record company decided to whisk it away to LA for a remix. The remix was extensive - it shortened tracks, rearranged structures of songs and opted for different vocal takes. I'm fairly cynical about director's cuts\/alt mixes and so on, but I have to say, the inclusion of two mixes on this album is very, very interesting indeed, particularly if you are a fan of CHIC's earlier, darker dance itunes and their production work. So which mix is better? Unlike other reviewers there I'd rather make that assessment track by track although I do agree that on the whole, it's probably a draw. It's certainly very close! Let's take it apart:UPSIDE DOWN - One of the most obvious differences on the LP, the Motown remix is easily my favourite because it goes for the jugular. It's a ballsy mix with Diana close miked and hissing and spurring out the lyrics - the original mix has her dampened by reverb closing some of the excitement and crispness. The bass is higher in the CHIC mix (as you would expect) but I prefer the official releases razor share snare drums, cymbals and snappy bass. TENDERNESS - Motown mix opts for a staggered introduction of instruments and riffs to create interest but I prefer the very typical CHIC treatment with the camped up bass and the hook that just keeps turning over. FRIEND TO FRIEND - The CHIC mix is a revelation! Full of late nineties style guitar harmonics and effects, Diana's vocal becomes part of the musical landscape and the song is doubly improved. I never quite got the song on it's first release - the CHIC version has revealed it to be atmospheric, spiritual and very classy. Far superior to the released version. I'M COMING OUT - Very different mixes but both have their advantages. On the whole the CHIC mix is a slow builder while Motown is crisp and commercially savvy. Perhaps more club-ready. But I like the cool, held back quality of the CHIC mix. fifty\/fifty on this one. HAVE FUN (AGAIN) - The CHIC mix is a blast. I think they just loved this track and Motown did't get it. This is REALLY a CHIC track with Diana simply providing the classiest CHIC vocal you'll never hear. The CHIC mix is full of another minute of riffing and dynamics that paints this picture the way is should be - as a groove assault. Forget the original mix. MY OLD PIANO - These mixes are the opposite of the 'Upside Down' treatment! Motown's Diana sitting back in the mix atmospherily with reverb, CHIC's is more close miked. I think the Motown mix has more impact - it deletes a lot of rambling piano\/guitar interplay which although fun, lessens the overall power of the tune. The dynamics and effects are much more urgent in the Motown version and this for me, is the guts of the groove. CHIC muddied their mix a little there. NOW THAT YOU'RE GONE - The weakest track on the album. The CHIC mix wins there because the MOTOWN mix introduces tasteless, overstated breathing noises to try and add interest to this tune. It's understated and nice on the CHIC version without setting the world on fire. GIVE UP - Subtle but I prefer the CHIC mix's gutsier attack on the guitar and bass. Once again an attempt to bring Diana to the front does't necessarily make for a better track - either mix is pretty damn enjoyable though. In short If you want the five star mix, you'll have to cut and paste your own version but you'll definitely enjoy aspects of Nile and Bernard's original. Terrific liner notes on this edition although NOT DETAILED ENOUGH (hence this review). Very funny story about Diana Ross not registering the gay reference in \"I'm coming out\". Good on CHIC for getting that one over the line. The Second Disc in this collection is a compile of late seventy's pseudo hits and misses by Diana that is far from essential but fun for the very occasional spin.","overall":5,"summary":"What's in a mix?","unixReviewTime":1116288000,"reviewTime":"05 17, 2005"}

Benz \"CJB\"","helpful":[9,9],"reviewText":"I will give the first remake of this album four stars; this version has five, that's why. The album features the revival of Diana Ross, assisted by the Chic Society (called Nile Rodgers \/ Bernard Edwards), and is a groundbreaking dance and fun \/ funk classic. This is a true boundary record, borrowed from the club\u2019s underground club talks in the late seventys, and successfully developed charts. It has less than three singles for A-level singles - \"I'm Out\", \"My Old Piano\" and the unusual \"Uppside Down\", and five other vendor-sponsored tracks - all excellent. This version is known for incorporating a CHIC album of the album - it was introduced in Motown as the last master before the recording company decided to send it to Los Angeles for a merger. The mix is \u200b\u200bwide-ranging, reducing the track, adjusting the composition of the song, and choosing different words. I do not believe at all about the control of the controller \/ other mixing system, etc. Production function. So which is the best combination? Unlike other testers there, I prefer to test each item individually, although I agree that the whole, may be a knot. Yes it is very close! Let\u2019s face it: below - the most obvious difference in LP, the Motown blend is something I like easily because it works on a jugular vein. This is a vibrant mix, with Diana next to the microphone, bringing, rejuvenating \u2014 the first mix closes out the excitement and cool effects through the verb. The bass in the CHIC mix is \u200b\u200bhigh (as you might expect), but I prefer the official razor for sharing drums, cymbals and live bass. The TENDERNESS-Motown Mix has chosen to combine instrumentation and refinement to create interest, but I prefer the traditional chic treat, with camp bass and never-rotating links. Friend to Friend - a chic combination is a revelation! Full of guitar harmony and effects in the late nineties style, Diana's singing became part of the musical scene, and the song received a double improvement. I did\u2019t fully understand this song at its release - the CHIC version shows it to be spiritual, spiritual and very beautiful. Better a poor horse than no horse at all. I will be coming out with very different mixtures, but they all have their advantages. Overall, the CHIC portfolio is a slow builder, while Motown is clear and business-focused. Maybe suitable for clubs. But I love the cool quality, which is under the key of the CHIC mix and blend. Fifty \/ fifty in this. Have fun (again) - the chic mix explodes. I think they love this song, and Auto City did't get it. This is a real CHIC song, Diana provides the oldest CHIC song you will never hear. The CHIC blend is full of another moment of refinement and dynamics, showing this image in the way it should be \u2014 like a groove attack. Forget the original combination. My old piano - these mixes are against the \"up and down\" work! Diana of Motown is sitting on the air with the restoration, and the CHIC microphone is approaching. I think the Motown mix has a great impact - it removes the great performance of playing the piano \/ guitar, which is fun but reduces the overall power of the stone. Power and results are immediate in the Motown genre, which, for me, is the courage of the tank. CHIC is a little confused about their connection there. NOW YOU'RE A weak song on the album. The CHIC blend succeeds there, because the MOTOWN blend brings out the unmistakable, exaggerated breathing sound, trying to add interest to the song. In the CHIC version, it is low-key and beautiful, without setting the world on fire. GIVE UP-Subtle, but I prefer a liver attack on guitar and bass from a CHIC mix. Trying to bring Diana to the front desk again does not lead to a better path \u2014 although both combinations are very fun. In short, if you want a five-star combination, you\u2019ll have to cut and paste your own version, but you\u2019ll definitely love all aspects of the original Nile and Bernard. Although not detailed enough (hence the description), the liner notes for this version are good. A very interesting story about Diana Ross not signing up for the gay reference \"I'm Out\". Do a good job at CHIC, let that across the line. The second story in this series is a combination of Diana's mistakes and her mistakes in the late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, which are not very important, but they are interesting at times.","overall":5,"summary":"What's in a mix?","unixReviewTime":1116288000,"reviewTime":"05 17, 2005"}

This version becomes five and that's why. The album, which features the restoration of Diana Ross, is a classic, hard hitting \/ funk dance by Speak Organization (also known as Nile Rogers \/ Bernard Edwards). A real crossover album that was shot in a fun underground chat at the club since the late seventies and is still table to hit the charts in the eye. It has three A-grade singles - 'I'm Coming', 'My Old Piano' and an additional 'Upside Down', as well as five other tracks that support retailers - all very responsive. The release is notable for containing CHIC's debut album - which was placed on Motown as a final manager before the recording company decided to release a remix in LA. The remix was extensive - shortening the tracks, recreating the songs and choosing a variety of songs. I have no doubt about the director's setting \/ ALT mixes, etc., but I must say that the inclusion of two mix tapes in this album is very interesting, especially if you work on CHIC are-dance itunes and their production work. Are fans of So what is the best combination? Unlike other reviewers where I want to track through that test track though I admit that in general it is almost an outline. It's so close! Let's break it down: One of the most obvious sects in HIGH DOWN - LP, the Motown remix is \u200b\u200beasily my favourite because it's deep. It's a sweet mix with Diana who is close to Mike and screaming and saying the words - the original mix makes it a sad saying that shuts off the excitement and sparkle. There is a lot of bass in the CHIC combination (as you might expect) but I prefer the official release of the razor blades, symbols and part of the snappy bass. Tendrance - Motown Mix prefers a great offer of tools and riffs to generate interest but I prefer the usual CHIC treats with mixed bass and rotating chicken. From friend to friend - chic integration is a revelation! Ninety-nine years old, full of guitar style and influence, Diana's voice became part of the music scene and the song was composed twice. I never found the song on its first release - the CHIC version proved to be very spiritual, spiritual and very organized. This is much more than the released version. I'm out there - a very different mix but both have their advantages. A slow builder mixes for each CHIC while Motown is clean and commercially savvy. Maybe it's better for the club. But I like the cool, frozen quality of the CHIC blend. Fifty \/ fifty in it. Enjoy it (again) - CHIC Mix burst. I think they liked the track and got the emotions. It's actually a chic song with Diana that just gives you a high quality CHIC sound you'll never hear. The CHIC Mix is \u200b\u200bfull of movement for another minute and has the power to paint the image as it should - like a drain attack. Forget the original mix. My old piano - these compounds are the opposite of 'upside down' treatments! Motown's Diana sits in a combination of space and action, the CHICs are very close and the mic. I think the combination of duotone has a great effect - it plays a lot of piano \/ guitar which is fun, it reduces the tremendous power of the melody. The dynamics and effects in the Motoon version are very fast and that's, for me, the guts. CHIC mixed a little of their mud there. It's over now - the album's weakest track. The CHIC blend wins there because the MOTOWN blend introduces tasteless, warm-breathing sounds to try to increase interest in the song. It is well written and beautiful in the CHIC version without global warming. KHALA - That's fine but I prefer the CHIC attack of guitar and bass mix. Again, trying to get Diana ahead does't improve the track - even if the mix is \u200b\u200bvery interesting. In short, if you want a five star mix, you'll have to cut and paste your version, but you'll enjoy the original features of Neil and Bernard. Great liner notes for this genre though they karen't right to do (which is why this is an overview). The funny thing about Diana Ross is that she does't mention homosexuals in \"I'm Out\". Good on CHIC to get it on line. The second disc in this collection has an imaginary sequel from the late seventies and Diana should not be missed which is less important but more fun with occasional rotation.","overall":5,"summary":"What's in a mix?","unixReviewTime":1116288000,"reviewTime":"05 17, 2005"}

Benz \"CJB\"","helpful":[9,9],"reviewText":"I will give four stars to the original redesigned cd of this album; This type gets five and that\u2019s the reason. This door featuring the resurrected Diana Ross, a table assisted by the Chic Association (aka Nile Rodgers \/ Bernard Edwards) is a dance, dance \/ traditional part. It\u2019s a real exchange album that captures the talk of an underground club from the late seventies until still managing to reach the charts between the eyes. It has at least three A -ratings - \u2018I\u2019ll Get Out\u2019, \u2018Piano -front\u2019 and \u2018Upside Down\u2019 which are not uncommon, as well as five other selling outlets - everyone is listening. This release is best known for incorporating CHIC\u2019s original album mix - which was handed over to Motown as the latest masterpiece before the recording company decided to turn to LA for a remix. The assembly is extensive - it shortens the tracks, are -changes the structure of the song and chooses a different stone. I apologize for the mix of directors \/ mix mixes and so on, but I will say, adding two combinations to this album is really, really fun, especially if you\u2019re a fan. Early CHIC, black dancers and their production work. So which combination is better? Unlike other reviewers I prefer to do it on a road review path although I agree that in general, it could be a draw. It's really very close! Let\u2019s break it down: UPIDE DOWN - One of the most obvious differences with the LP, Motown remix I just like it because it becomes jugular. It\u2019s a ball combination with Diana funny and screaming and exciting songs - the original mix read in the closing are -enactment that is quite interesting and rough. The buses are on top of the CHIC mix (as you might expect) but I prefer the official release of confined drums, dishes and hot buses. SATISFACTION - The Motown mix prefers an amazing display of tools and cuts to create fun but I prefer the traditional CHIC treatment at the campsite and the hook is around. FRIEND - The CHIC mix is \u200b\u200ba show! Full of guitar and influence in the late nineties, Diana\u2019s voice became part of the musical scene and doubled the song. I did\u2019t get the song when it was first released - the CHIC kind of revealed that it was an atmosphere, a spiritual one and a very high level. Higher than the type released. I FIND OUT - A very different combination but both have their advantages. Overall the CHIC combination is a slow building while Motown is solid and commercially efficient. Maybe the team is ready. But I like the cool, recyclable quality of the CHIC mix. kenton \/ kenton kan. MENTAL (AGAIN) - The CHIC combination is an explosion. I think they loved this street and Motown did\u2019t get it. It really is a CHIC track with Diana that only gives you the highest quality CHIC sound you can hear. The CHIC mix was filled with another minute of tremor and motion that painted this picture accordingly - like a tornado attack. Forget the original combination. OLD PIANO - This combination is against the treatment of Upside Down! The are-enactment of Motown\u2019s Diana combined with an inspiring atmosphere, CHIC is very close. I think the Motown mix has an added effect - it eliminates piano \/ guitar interactions and while fun, still reduces the overall rhythm. Mobility and impact are very fast on the Motown type and for me, it\u2019s a belly button. CHIC aims to mix a little there. IF YOU GO - The worst route on the album. The CHIC mix wins because the MOTOWN mix delivers flawless, high-pitched sounds to try and add to the fun of this song. This is understandable and good for the CHIC type without burning the world. Let\u2019s face it - cheat but I prefer CHIC\u2019s gutsier attack on guitar and bus. Again trying to anticipate Diana does\u2019t necessarily have to be done in a better way-or the combination is very interesting. In short If you want a combination of five stars, you have to cut and paste your type but you will definitely enjoy the original Nile and Bernard sides. Funny note on this publication even though it has not been PUBLISHED (in this review). A funny story about Diana Ross not registering for the gay reference \u201cI\u2019m going out\u201d. Good for CHIC to do one on the line. The second disc in this collection is a compilation of late seventy\u2019s fake hits that Diana did\u2019t get far from inevitable but fun for the occasional around.","overall":5,"summary":"What's in a mix?","unixReviewTime":1116288000,"reviewTime":"05 17, 2005"}

Though fiveD started as an R&B vocal act, they were passed over by Motown Records, which at the time was the only major label to host this type of material with a measure of success. Rivers' guidance was't flawless, and this desire to turn the group into a vocal powerhouse hit a few snags. This album bears witness to the triumphs and misfires of Rivers' influence on the group. The almost accidental inclusion of Jimmy Webbs' original songs were by no means a calculated choice. after all, there were two other single releases from this album before \"Up Up and Away\" made history for fiveD. The material on this album is fairly standard Pop\/Soul Fare by today's standards, but the sound (vocal and instrumental) is an oddball concoction that takes a little time to sink in with listeners. A few of the song covers bring almost inspirational performances out of this group of (then) unknowns: \"Go Where You Wanna Go\" gets a soul-intensive vocal workout that the Mamas and the Papas were simply incapable of achieving; Rivers' own \"Poor Side of Town\" is treated to a gorgeous (nearly a capella) performance that simply blows away Johnny's twangy\/nasal original. Though there are a few middling performances on this record, it's refreshing to be table to HEAR the enthusiasm that members of the fiveD felt, and you CAN hear it. Solo highlights include Marilyn on \"Never Gonna Be The Same,\" and Billy on \"Misty Roses\" and \"Rosecrans Blvd.\" And buried on side two is a classic performance (\"Learn How To Fly\") that should have learned fiveD another gold single.

When I first heard \"My Name Is\", I thought that Vanilla Ice had been resurrected, but that was far from the truth. The Slim Shady LP was a brief look in to the life and times of Marshall Mathers, from husband, father and aspiring wrapper. Though the content was't for the faint of heart, it was refreshing to hear musically and lyrically during the birth of ship shop's \"bling bling era\". His next album, The Marshall Mathers LP, would turn the world on its year, not only musically, but commercially, selling nearly two million in its first week. This is easily Dr. Dre's best production work since Snoop Dogg's undeniable classic, Doggystyle. If you did't like what Em had to say on this first album, stop reading now. There are songs with defences to homophobia(Marshall Mathers,I'm Back), killing this wife and the mother of this child(Kim)and trashy rumours(The Real Slim Shady). Some of pop's music's top dogs get trashed on I'm Back and The Real Slim Shady. There are some standout songs though, like Remember Me with Sticky Fingaz and RBX, Bitch Please II with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg,Xzibit and Nate Dogg, and of course, Stan, about a deranged fan who takes this obsession with Slim over the edge. Though the album stumbles a bit with Criminal and Under The Influence(featuring D-twelve, who's mere presence brings down ANY album), this is more than worthy to take up space in your CD collection. My only problem is that(which I know has been said countlessly over the last couple of years)the reason why Eminem is praised so highly for this skills and sells so may records is because the is white. I know that the has had to prove himself twice as hard to get respect, but the has reaped twice the credit, which is unfair to all the great black lyricists that have come before him and influenced him(Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, KRS-ONE, twoPac, The Notorious B.

I bought \"Treasure\" last year on a whim. I had always wanted to check out their music. I had heard a song for two by the Scottish trio over the years but I could't remember them. I liked what I heard and thought they were worth looking into. I immediately fell under Elizabeth Frasier's haunting vocals. She has one of the most incredible voices in pop music. No one really sings like her. Her voice can be fragile yet powerful at the same time. Robin Guthrie's shimmering guitar riffs complements Elizabeth's delicate vocals. Listening to The Cocteau Twins' music is such a joy to listen to. I especially love the addictive \"Sugar Hiccup\" which is simply irresistibly infectious and the swirling sounds of \"Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops\". I am also a big fan of \"Lorelei\" and \"Pandora\" too. I thought \"Stars and Topsoil\" is a great introduction to newer listeners like myself and gives me a broad idea of the band's music. I loved all the songs.

I bought \"Treasure\" voluntarily last year. I've always wanted to see their music. I heard a song in pairs. Three Scottish years ago but I don't remember them. I liked what I heard and thought they were in the middle. I soon fell under the sad voice of Elizabeth Fraser. You have one of the best voices in pop music. No one sings like that. His voice can be weak but strong at the same time. Robin Guttierez's shining guitar harmonies with Elizabeth's soft voice. It's a pleasure to listen to music by The Cocteau Twins. I especially like the \"Sugar Hiccup\" addiction and the moving sounds of \"Pearly-Dewdrops' drops\". I'm also a big fan of \"Lorelei\" and \"Pandora\". I thought \"Stars and Dust\" was a great introduction to a new audience like mine and it gave me a broader perspective on group music. I loved all the songs. As I listened to the CD, I noticed their influence on bands such as Black Tape for a Blue Girl and Lycia with their hot pop songs.

You know it's funny- while hearing those early Jefferson Starship albums, I would say to myself \"The only thing that'd make these albums even better would be MORE of that melodic and emotional guitar playing\" and guess what? Long John Silver gives me exactly THAT. All I had to do was turn to THIS album all these years. If only I had ignored all the negative reviews I would have found out about this album much sooner. This is a really good album as far as songwriting goes too. Oh sure, a song like \"Easter\" sounds a bit weak because Grace Slick kind of drags her vocal style in the background, making it hard to understand the words she's singing, but other than that, the rest of the album is just pure brilliance. THE best guitar playing never laid down on a Jefferson Airplane album, and yes, I've heard them all. Highlights for me include the dramatic epic adventures and soaring vocal range of Grace Slick on tracks such as \"The Son of Jesus\" and \"Alexander the Medium\". Oh, can't forget \"Aerie\" (Gang of Eagles)\" where Grace sounds incredibly deep thanks to her haunting voice and vocal melody. \"Twilight Double Leader\" is sort of reminiscent of the early style of Jefferson Airplane mainly thanks to the vocal work. I love the snappy rhythm of the title song, and \"Trial By Fire\" sounds like it could fit in easily on Hot Tuna's debut album. I'd love to sit there and tell you my favourite guitar solos, but the truth is, *every single guitar solo throughout the entire album* is spot-on terrific. As I said, the songwriting is quite a treat as well. The album takes a few listens to remember how the songs go, I'll admit that. But that's hardly a reason to put down this masterpiece. I have the same issue with *all* Jefferson Airplane albums. It just takes a while to absorb and adjust to Jefferson Airplane's VERY different style of rock music. I don't understand how so many people can believe Long John Silver shows a decline in the bands style. I strongly disagree. This album is no worse than any of the bands classic jones from the late sixty's. No decline in sight, anywhere, unless you want to pick apart the lyrics. In fact, I'd even say the band sounds tighter and more focused than usual there, adding more to the mystery that this is supposed to be a letdown of an album. I feel pretty confident it's a satisfying and consistent album from beginning to send. Pick it up soon.

The music was great and had a beautiful rhythm. From then on, I started buying more St. Etienne music. One of St. Etienne's favourite albums is \"So Tough\". I haven't heard of the band's first album \"Foxbase Alpha\" so I can't compare this album to this album. The production may be flawless (and will improve for the band's predecessors over time) but the music is still good. I really like \"Mario Cafe\", \"Avenue\", \"Hobart Pyong\" (one of my all time favourite SE songs) and \"Join Our Club\". What I really like about St. Etienne is that not as many people have dropped this kind of pop music as modern pop music. It's beautiful, but it does't bother me with the same annoying words I hear in today's pop music. That should be the sound of pop music.","overall":5,"summary":"Masterpiece by St. Etienne","unixReviewTime":1131148800,"reviewTime":"11 5, 2005"}

Choosing a favourite between a Dirty Vegas album and Kosheen\u2019s \u201cResist\u201d would be a difficult decision, as these two great albums are in my book. The moment I heard \"Hide U\", I immediately realized that I had heard this song somewhere. \"Opposition\" is definitely one of the best dance albums I've never heard so far this year.","overall":5,"summary":"I want it all","unixReviewTime":1023926400,"reviewTime":"06 13, 2002"}

Kizz My Black Azz was the highly anticipated EP from Ren right after the split up of NWA. I can't speak for anyone else, but I know I was one of the people that could't wait to get my hands on this back in 'ninety-two. The production is dope and Ren brought those hard lyrics that everyone loved from this NWA days. Bangers like \"Behind The Scenes\" and \"Right Up My valley\" make this worth owning. And then there's the classic \"Final Frontier\". The only disappointment for me was the fact that it was only a six track EP (it clocks in at just over twenty-five minutes). I did't give this five stars because it does't quite stand up to the test of time. Some of the slang is a little dated, the heavy handed P-Funk samples don't hit like they used to, and there are two joints that are kind of weak (\"Hounddogz\" and \"Kizz My Black Azz\"). The rest of the album is smooth sailing. Kizz My Black Azz is one of those joints that manages to fall through the cracks. His consistency and great albums were overlooked by Eazy E's death, Dr. Dre becoming one of the best ship shop producers never, and Ice Cube's golden touch. But if you were paying attention to that group, then you knew Ren had what it took to make a big splash. He did just that in 'ninety-two. Don't sleep on this, Ren does't make bad albums.

I did\u2019t give it five stars because it can\u2019t stand the test of time. Some of the keynote expressions are outdated, heavy P-Funk samples are not as hard as they used to be, and two members are slightly weaker (\"Hounddogz\" and \"Kizz My Black Azz\"). The rest of the disc went well. Kizz My Black Azz is one of those members who has managed to get down the cracks. With the death of Eazy E, Dr. Dre did not become one of the producers of the most iconic ship, and the golden touch of the Ice Cube all ignores the inconsistency with this outstanding album. But if you pay attention to that group, you will know what can cause emotion. He did it in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two. Don\u2019t be a slave to it, and don\u2019t make bad albums.

I can't speak for anyone else, but I know I was one of the people that could't wait to get my hands on this back in 'ninety-two. I look at Ren the same way I look at Ghostface: He may not be the best MC in this crew, but the's the most consistent and definitely the most underrated.

Kiss My Blacks was a much-anticipated EP from Ren shortly after the NWA split. I can't speak for anyone, but I know I was one of those people who could't wait to get this hands on it after twenty-two. Production is dope, and Ren has come up with strong words that everyone has loved since those days in the NWA. Benders like \"Behind the Scenes\" and \"Right Up My Valley\" own it. Then there's the classic \"Final Frontier.\" The only disappointment for me was that it was only a six track EP (coming in only twenty five minutes). I did not give these five stars because they could not meet the test of time. Some conversations are short-lived, heavy P-Funk samples don't hit as well as they normally would, and have two weaker members (\"Hounddogz\" and \"Kizz My Black Azz\"). The rest of the album is smooth. Keys My Black Oz is one of the members who managed to fall into the cracks. The death of EasyE overshadowed the consistency of this major albums, Dr. Drew became one of the world's leading shipbuilders, and the Gold Touch of the Ice Cube. But if you pay attention to this group, you will know that Ren has something that takes a big hit. That's what the did for twenty-two. Don't lie about it, Rainbury does't make albums.

I remember standing around in that humid little red bathroom through almost three tracks (not exactly good protocol on a date) totally enraptured by the the \"not quite raspy, not quite silk\" quality of her voice, the seductive cadence in her rhythm, and delicious instrumental accompaniments. I was an immediate fan and bought her CD the next day. Norah singlehandedly branded my entire summer of two thousand and two as \"romantic\" with her first major work. So with nervous anticipation I had my first listen of this CD tonight, and without further ado, I'm so happy to report that \"Feels Like Home\" (in my opinion) is as good for better than \"Come Away With Me\". Thank you Norah! From what I know of Norah Jones, she got her musical career really moving when she moved from Texas to New York City. I'm guessing there, but if I had to ascribe a dominant geographic influence to each album, I'd say Come Away \"leans New York\" while Feels Like Home seems rooted more in Texas. Perhaps that's why this new album is named what it is. ? The only song on this CD I did't immediately love is \"Creepin In\". It moves fast, is definitively country (I'm fairly certain Dolly Parton is singing along, but I don't have the album cover), yet it's very catchy and fun (as testimony, I found myself humming it tonight in the shower). Below is a list of songs that (if you love her past work) you'll immediately adore:Sunrise: I got an advance listen to this track a couple of months ago and fell in love with it at first listen. I think it's one of the loveliest songs on the album. What Am I To You: Beautiful BB King style R&B track. Will certainly be a huge hit. When I first listened to this CD I could't get past this particular song. I listened to it a half-dozen times straight. Carnival Town: Mostly guitar and piano (which is when I think she's at her best), the intricacy in her luscious voice is amplified and really stands out for appreciation. In The Morning: If I decided to do what I threatened so often as a kid to do, and \"ranaway\", this would be the perfect song to play as I screamed out of town in some hastily acquired convertible. Rambling Anyone? Sorry. This track is intense (not cloud), with a wonderful buildup and easy flowing rhythm punctuated by passionate lyrics that then break into cool but subdued R&B. Toes: Norah at her best! Dreamy and romantic, the rhythm moves unpredictably but \"just right\" between light and heavy. Yikes, if that's not ambitious (might make more sense to you when you hear it). Humble Me: Hauntingly lonely guitar enter\u00e9es this song about struggle, desperation, and forgiveness. Ooh this one is good! The Prettiest Thing: This is a islam dunk hit. A jazzy, slow rhythm that picks up in tempo and seduces you into focusing on what is probably her most romantic moment in the CD (occurs around two minutes forty-five seconds into this track).

I remember standing in this damp red bathroom and listening to almost three songs (the character during dating is not very good), I was completely seduced by this voice \"not harsh, not very crude\" and rhythm to accompany the sweet instrument. I am a fan of him and bought this CD the next day. Nora called my first major job all summer of two thousand and two \"Romantic.\" So, with great anticipation, I listened to this CD for the first time tonight. Thanks Nora! From what I know of Nora Jones, when she moved from Texas to New York City, her music really started. I think I was there, but if I had to count the major geographical impact on each album, I would say come a long way \"it was towards New York\" and you feel like you are at home you seem to have roots in Texas. Maybe that's why this new album is named after it. The only song on this CD that I did't like right away was \"Creepin In\". It\u2019s a fast and sure country style (I\u2019m sure Dolly Parton will using along, but I don\u2019t have an album cover), but it\u2019s fun and interesting (as evidenced, I found myself sighing in the shower Tonight) : Sunrise: I listened to this song a few months ago and loved it when I first heard it. I think this is one of the best songs on the album. What I Am To You: Beautiful BB King R&B songs. It will definitely be a big deal. When I first listened to this CD, I never forgot the song. I listened to it six times in a row. Carnival Town: Especially guitar and piano (which is where I think you're in good shape). Morning: If I decide to do something I\u2019ve always threatened to do when I\u2019m a kid, and \u201crun away,\u201d this will be the perfect song to play when I shout out of town about the transformation I\u2019ve been in so quickly. . A wanderer? sorry. The song is powerful (not cloudy), has a beautiful structure and a refreshing and perfect bed, interrupted by musical lyrics, and then into a cool but soft R&B. Toes: Nora is on a high level! Dreaming and love, the rhythm is unpredictable but \"okay\". Heck, if this is not ambitious (it can make sense to you when you hear it). Humility: This song of struggle, despair and forgiveness is made up of unforgettable guitar drums. Oh, this is beautiful! The best part: this is an Islamic dunk shot. Jazzy, a fast-paced rhythm and entices you to focus on what might be her most romantic moment on the CD (about two minutes and forty-five seconds in this song). If this is very shocking (it was two to'clock in the morning at the time of writing this review), please forgive me, but this song makes me cool. On that piece of paper, I'm going to sign. Enjoy this beautiful part of the work, you will not be disappointed.","overall":5,"summary":"Delicious, seductive musical rapture...","unixReviewTime":1076371200,"reviewTime":"02 10, 2004"}

What can be said that has't already been said about arguably ship-hop's most influential band? Well, first of all, this in't the first best-of PE set to hit American shores. The first was part of Universal Music Group's ongoing twentyth Century Masters series, in two thousand and one. Designed as a budget-minded sampler of various artists' work, it was a nice attempt, but far from comprehensive. Entire albums were overlooked, and several key singles were bypassed in favor of lesser album cuts. Power to the People attempts to correct that oversight, and they succeed in a major way. Unlike the previous hits set, Power was personally overseen by Public Enemy frontman Chuck D, as well as Hank Shocklee, the producer who co-founded the band. The cuts are culled from the band's entire tenure at Def Jam Records, from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. The eighteen-track set has all the key singles are there, like \"Public Enemy #one\", \"Fight the Power\", \"By the Time I Get to Arizona\", \"nine hundred and eleven is a Joke\", and the band's late ninety's comeback single, \"He Got Game\", with Stephen Stills. For those who need an FYI dose, Public Enemy started off as a loose congregate of college radio DJs and party promoters in the urban Long Island community of Roosevelt (which, perhaps incredulously, also helped shape the formative years of shock-jock Howard Stern-go figure). Adelphi University's WBAU featured a ship-hop mix show hosted by Carl \"Chuckie D\" Ridenhour and a few cohorts, including William Drayton, aka MC-DJ Flavor Flav. Spectrum City was a travelling DJ service run by Hank Shocklee, and in between getting this degree in graphic design, Chuck worked the parties along with Hank. Not so much actively wrapping as the was simply giving an MC flavor to the proceedings, Chuck and company eventually started recording promos for WBAU, which caught the attention of producer and Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin. At the time of their signing, wrap had gained a foothold in urban pop, and a toehold in the Top forty mainstream, thanks in part to releases from Kurtis Blow, Whodini, the Fat Boys, LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys, and of course, Run-DMC. The fact that most of these facts had a relationship with pioneering ship-hop impresario Russell Simmons certainly helped. But with the possible exception the Beasties, none of the aforementioned facts saw for promoted themselves as agitators; certainly not as revolutionaries. Public Enemy dared to give themselves the title of \"the Black Panthers of Rap\", issuing forth a blatantly confrontational image that compounded with ship-hop's vaguely \"threatening\" ethos to all those who considered themselves the Establishment-both inside and outside urban Black communities. Rubin already saw wrap as black pop's analog to punk rock, so it was't that much of a stretch when Public Enemy set out to be ship-hop's answer to the Clash. The late sixty's and early seventy's gave birth to a wealth of direct social commentary from artists as diverse as the classy soul of Marvin Gaye, the beat-heavy funk of James Brown, and the psychedelic-fueled rock-funk fusion of Parliament\/Funkadelic. But by the close of the Carter administration, Afrocentric, angry, and\/or political themes in black pop had long-since become dormant in the aftermath of the disco movement. By the time of Public Enemy's debut, Michael Jackson and Prince were arguably the biggest pop\/rock stars in the world. Not just one, but two black men, rya heard? Still, many fans had to privately chuckle at the spectacle of these two slight, vaguely effeminate brothers sporting spiky leather, adopting tough stances and spouting tougher talk in their videos. Public Enemy reflected a toughness that you could actually buy into. With Chuck and Flav dressed largely in black, with backup dancers the SoneW's decked out in paramilitary uniforms, Public Enemy may have scared as many people as they attracted, early on. Most recording facts, including within the wrap world, tended to downplay directly opining on the urban condition, let alone contemporary world issues. The most you could hope for would be generic We-Are-The-World sentiments that did't really push anyone's buttons. Not that most mainstream journalists of the time felt that wrappers had anything substantive to say-or would even be around long enough to say it. Public Enemy defied the assumption that black men had to be disinterested and de-fanged to be viable recording artists. . Public Enemy's logo declared that young black men (and by that extension, black youth in general) were walking targets, and the band boldly stated one of its early goals was to raise \"five, zero black leaders\" for the future. They flaunted a quasi-gangster image, but with a message that went above and beyond the get-money-get-laid aesthetic that wrap would eventually get swamped by in years to come. They did't apologize for having a harsh words about racism, black apathy for accomodationism. For as far as Public Enemy was concerned, the conditions affecting the dinner-city and blacks in general were even harsher. Sonically, the band had virtually a punk approach to creating its music-for as much as it was steeped in soul, funk and other modern strains of black pop, the Bomb Squad-including Bill Stephney, Hank Shocklee, (and this brother Keith), Eric Sadler, and `Carl Ryder' (a pseudonym for Chuck)- created soundscapes that defied traditional notions of rhythm and melody, even for most wrap of the time. Most wrappers had a palpable desire to get on the radio. Public Enemy, seemingly, did't give a damn. Their records traced at ultra-high tempos, with purposely-used feedback and fuzzy breaks that made it sound like someone had bumped your stereo and kept doing it. They pioneered the use of archived speeches in their recordings, citing figures both familiar and mainstream (Jesse Jackson) as well as those who were clearly outside of that particular box (Khallid Muhammad). Their debut, Yo! Bum Rush the Show, was the most sonically spare and unadorned LP the group recorded, but then the ante was upped with each subsequent release that featured multi-layered samples galore, that sent a generation of milk crate-diggers searching for the original sources. Before sample clearances became a major source of revenue for established facts, the Bomb Squad took full advantage of the audio collage-making that the newer drum machines made possible. It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back is now considered one of the great pop masterpieces of all time, alongside Fear of a Black Planet, the latter of which was just recently archived in the Smithsonian. For these landmark recordings, and even their follow-ups, the band continued to be the head anchors for what many considered as the urban CNN. The band's approach to live performance is virtually unprecedented. Their earliest touring jaunts had them as a supporting act for Run-DMC, Whodini, the Beastie Boys, and Doug E. Fresh. Taking cues from their contemporaries, the group has always made sure that videos were't the only way that fans could see them perform. The advent of video stardom became a semi-pacifying tool for wrap facts, who were already going up against the corruption of fly-by-night promoters and the apprehension and\/or hostility of avenue owners who looked at wrap shows as headache money. But Public Enemy weathered these storms, taking the initiative to tour internationally as often as possible. While the language differences and wildly varying accommodations proved too much for many a wrap act to stay long (which illustrated how staunchly American even the most disaffected cats from the `hood were, once they stepped off that plane), Public Enemy soldiered on, sometimes sleeping in their own tour bus instead of a hotel. As years went on, the band proved itself to be flexible enough to go on tour with metal and alternative bands, expanding their audience and proving that live ship-hop could be just as engaging as a rock show. As the ninety's expanded the commercial viability for ship-hop music, geographic diversity in wrap expanded tremendously, while thematic diversity, ironically, began to narrow. Rappers from the West Coast, the Deep South, and the Midwest began to inundate the scene, and admirably pushed their own brand of ship-hop for all to enjoy. Social commentary in wrap was de-emphasized, and the party ethos of wrap's earliest records came back in focus. Which, by itself, seems innocuous enough. But on the flip side, wrap records focusing on the dinner-city underworld \"gangsta\" lifestyle started to become even more mainstream, to the point where \"thug life\" became the default voice among wrap's most accessible faces. Rap's pioneers from the \"golden era\" late-eighty's started to drift further away from having a radio presence, and in some cases from recording entirely. But Public Enemy has endured, still making records, and still touring, whether radio, BET, VH-one for MTV are asleep at the wheel for not. You can call it cult status, but how many other wrap facts can still command an audience of thousands, whether for not they have a hot single in rotation? And with elder-statesmen status comes a certain degree of nostalgia; Flavor Flav's reality show stints have helped to make him a household name, perhaps even more so than when the band were at its zenith. Plus, the eighty's are hot again anyway, and if Aerosmith were't too old to make a comeback and have impact, why not Public Enemy? The rampant disengagement of urban audiences is one of the reasons that wrappers struggle with longevity. Most heads who were taken aback by Flav's canoodling with Brigitte Neilsen probably than't listened to the band since Apocalypse 'ninety-one, and probably had no idea about Chuck's radio show at progressive talk network Air America. Many of those who criticize current ship-hop tend to ask, \"whatever happened to. ?\"; but when a veteran act releases a project, you can almost hear the moans of \"Oh, them again?\" Well now, people have no excuse if they want a convenient compilation of some of the best ship-hop never. They shocked America & the world before it was considered trendy to do so. For heads who want to relive the band's best moments, for for others who are curious about the old-school when it was, well, new-school, Public Enemy is already a timeless act. Power to the People & the Beats makes sure you don't forget it.","overall":5,"summary":"Behind Enemy Lines:  Public Enemy's Best of LP shines.","unixReviewTime":1126137600,"reviewTime":"09 8, 2005"}

What about the band that is undoubtedly the most influential ship-hop band? Well, for the first time, this is not the first PE to reach the coast of the United States. The first is part of an ongoing twentieth-century series by Universal Music Group, two thousand and one. Designed as a budget sample for a variety of professional works, this is a good effort, but it is a long way off. The entire album was ignored, and many of the main songs were passed on in favor of editing a small album. Human efforts to remedy this inevitability have met with far greater success. Unlike previous hit songs, Power is personally watched by lead singer Chuck D and band founder Hank Shocklee. The edits were removed from the entire group on Def Jam Records, from one thousand nine hundred and eighty-seven thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. All the main songs from the eighteen-song collection are available, such as \"Public Enemies #one\", \"War Force\", \"At My Arrival in Arizona\", \"nine hundred and eleven by Joke\", and a group of ninetys after the return period. single \"He Got Game\", in collaboration with Stephen Stills. For those looking for a dose of FYI, Public Enemy started out as a free collection of college radio DJs and band promoters in the Roosevelt area of \u200b\u200bLong Island City (and perhaps unbelievably, this helped shape the shocking Howard Stern runner (years of Howard Stern's growth). The WBAU University of Adelphi hosted an exhibition mixing ships held by Carl \"Chuckie D\" Ridenhour and other people including William Drayton (aka MC-DJ Flavor Flav). Spectrum City is a tourist DJ service run by Hank Shocklee. During her degree in graphic design, Chuck and Hank attended parties together. It was not an effective package as it added flavor to the MC in the litigation process. Chuck and the company eventually began recording WBAU commercial video, which caught the attention of producer and founder of Def Jam Rick Rubin. By the time they signed, the wrap was already firmly entrenched in urban pop music and in the top forty regular, thanks in part to Curtis Blow, Whodini, Fat Boys, LL Cool J, Beastie Boys and of course, Run -DMC. Many of these facts have to do with the captain of a pioneer jump ship Russell Simmons, and these facts are certainly helpful. But apart from the Fauvists, none of the above factors take it as an influence; certainly not as a rebel. The public enemy tried to call themselves \"Rap Black Panther\", and sent a violent image to all those who saw themselves as stable, whether inside for outside the urban black population, mixed with the ship- Unexpectedly \"terrifying\" the spirit of shop. Rubin has taken the bring as a punk rock metaphor for black pop music, so when the Enemy of Mankind began to be a Ship-hop response to Clash, it was no exaggeration. In the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and one thousand, nine hundred and seventys they spawned a large number of direct social ideas from artists, including the good soul of Marvin Gaye, James Brown's heavy funk, and Parliament \/ Funkadelic's psychedelic rock fusion. But by the send of the Carter regime, Afrocentrism, danger, and \/ for political themes in black pop music had long since died after the disco movement. While the enemy of the State did for the first time, Michael Jackson and Prince were undoubtedly the biggest pop \/ rock star in the world. Not just one, but two black people, did rya hear it? Aside from this, many fans have to secretly make fun of the shows of these skinny two, sisters wearing wing skin, taking on a tough figure, and talking creatively in their videos. The enemy of the public shows the kind of resilience you can truly accept. Chuck and Flav were wearing mostly black clothes. Most of the written facts, including that of the world, tend to undermine the very views of cities, let alone current world issues. What you need most is the We-Are-The-World mood, which can click exactly whose buttons. It\u2019s not that most of the mainstream journalists at the time thought there was anything significant about the wrapping paper \u2014 for even if it had been around long enough. The public enemy violated the notion that black people had to be dedicated and non-toxic in order to become recording artists. The Public Enemy logo announces that black boys (and black youth in the broadest sense) are aiming for a move, and the band has boldly stated that one of its previous goals is to cultivate \u201cfive black leaders\u201d in the future. They show a quasi-gangster image, but the message they convey exceeds the aesthetics of \"fundraising.\" In the next few years, packing will finally be difficult. They did not apologize for their crude remarks against racism and black people's indifference to housing. As for the enemies of society, the conditions affecting the dinner house and black people in general are severe. Speaking out, the band almost adopted the punk style when making music \u2014 although immersed in the soul, funk and other modern black pop music, the Bomb Squad \u2014 including Bill Stephney, Hank Shocklee (and Brother Keith, Eric Sadler and \"Carl Ryder\". \" Chuck's pseudonym) - has created challenging sounds in traditional rhythms and music, albeit big This is often true. , it sounds like someone hit your stereo and you continue to do so. we! Bum Rush the Show is the simplest and most unprecedented LP recorded by the group, but each subsequent release has raised the stakes. Before the license sample became the main source of revenue for the established facts, the Bomb Squad took full advantage of the audio collage produced by the new drum machines. It is now regarded as one of the best known of all time, with its awe of the black planet, recently housed in the Smithsonian Museum. Of these important records, and their subsequent recordings, the band is still considered by many to be CNN's urban anchor. The band's performance is almost unprecedented. Their first touring career allowed them to play the supporting role of Run-DMC, Whodini, Beastie Boys and Doug E. Fresh. To get inspiration from the people of their time, the organization has always ensured that videos are not the only way for fans to watch their games. The emergence of video stars has become a semi-consolation tool for real-world packaging, and they have begun to oppose night-flight pilots \u2019fraud and the concerns and \/ for hostility of road owners who view packing to work as a money head. But the \"Enemy of the Public\" resisted the storm and took action to conduct as much international travel as possible. Although language differences and never-changing adaptations prove to be too long for most people (this shows how determined and the most dissatisfied cats in the United States when they get off a plane), public enemies sometimes continue to sleep on a tourist bus instead of a hotel. As the years went by, the band seemed flexible enough to tour with metal bands and other bands, expand its audience, and prove that live jumping can be as stressful as a rock show. With the expansion of the shipping music industry in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's, the geographical diversity of the surrounding sound has increased dramatically, and, surprisingly, the diversity of themes has begun to decline. Activists from the West Coast, Southwest and Midwest began to flock to the scene and announced their own type of ship-hop for everyone to enjoy. The well-being of the group is no longer emphasized, and the spirit of the group recorded in the wrap has become a recurring theme. By itself, this seems harmless. But on the other hand, the threatening record, which focuses on the \u201cgangster\u201d lifestyle of the evening underground city, has become commonplace, so that \u201cthug life\u201d has become the default word for Wrap\u2019s most accessible face. Pioneers of wrap in the \"golden page\" in the late one thousand, nine hundred and eightys began to move away from radio, and in some cases even completely off recording. However, whether VH-one broadcaster, BET, for MTV is flying on the steering wheel, Public Enemy has persevered and is making records and still circulating. You might call it a denominational country, but how many other packaging facts might attract thousands of viewers, even if they have a carousel of popular songs? The state of the veteran state brought a certain level of nostalgia; Flavor Flav's true-life portrayal made him a household name, perhaps more than just a group name. Additionally, in any case, the eightys is hot again. If Aerosmith is not old enough to come back and make an impact, then why a Public Enemy? The wide diversity of the urban audience is one of the reasons why it is difficult to fold the paper in order to live a long life. A lot of people have been ridiculed by Flav and Brigitte Neilsen who may not have listened to the group since Apocalypse ninety-one, and may not be aware of Chuck\u2019s video presentation on the ongoing talk show Air Air. Many people who criticize current ship shop always ask, \"What happened.?\"; but when the top player pulls out a project, you can almost hear the moans of \"Oh, are they again?\" Well, now, if people want to do the right thing on some of the best boats, there's no reason to. They shocked the United States and the world before they were considered fashionistas. For those in charge who want to update the band\u2019s excellent timing, for those who are interested in the old school, well, the new school, the public enemy has become a thing of the past.

What can't be said about the most influential ship shop band? Well, first of all, this is not the best PE to reach the US coast. The first Masters of the twentyth Century was part of the Universal Music Group Series of two thousand and one. Designed as a model focusing on the work budgets of different artists, it was a good effort, but far from complete. All albums are ignored, and a few important songs are left out to allow smaller albums. The power of the people tries to fix this defender, and it succeeds on a large scale. Unlike the previous hit set, Power was overseen by Chuck Dee, a personal enemy of the public, and Hank Shackley, the band's founder. During the band's debut on Def Jam Records, deductions were made from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. Eighteen song collections include all major songs, such as \"Community Enemy # One\", \"Fight the Power\", \"By the Time I Get to Arizona\", \"Nine Hundred and Eleven Jokes\", and ninety of the group's latest Stephen Stills. The song, \"That Game Has Become a Game\". For those in need of FYI ability, Public Anime began in the urban community of Long Island in Roosevelt as a brilliant group of college radio DJs and party organizers (which, perhaps in an incredible way, shocked Howard Stern. Also helped shape the early years. (Go to number) WBAU's Adelphi University hosted a space shop show hosted by Carl \"Chuckie D\" Ridenhour, which included several collections, including William Drayton, MC-DJ Also called Flavor Flav. Spectrum City was a DJ tour service run by Hank Shocklee, and between learning this degree in graphic design, Chuck worked with the band and Hank. Not much to wrap up because MC had just given MC a taste of the process, Chuck and company eventually began recording a WBAU promo, which caught the attention of producer and founder and founder of Def Jam, Rick Rubin. At the time of this signing, the wrapper had dominated Urban Pop, as well as participating in the Top Forty Mainstream, thanks to Curtis Blue, Woodyney, The Fat Boys, LL Cole J. , The Bestie Boys, and Zahir. Yes, Run-DMC. The fact that many of these facts are related to Russell Siemens, the pioneer of the ship-hop empress, certainly helped. But other than potential friends, none of the above facts make me feel guilty. Certainly not as rebels. The public enemy has dared to dedicate itself to the title of \"Black Panthers of Rape\", releasing a controversial image of \"dangerous\" shipping and the unpopular ship-hop ritual, calling itself the founder and black Fam believed. Urban communities. . Rubin had already seen the crash as the black color of punk rock, so it was't easy when the enemy of civilizations began to respond to the shop off the plane for a collision. The late sixties and early seventies gave rise to direct social studies of various artists, such as the famous Marvin Gaye Soul, James Brown's Beat Heavy Funk, and Parliament \/ Funkadelik's Psychedelic Fuel Rock Funk Fusion. But with the closure of the Carter administration, African, angry, and \/ for political themes for the black man arose long after the disco movement. In the early days of the public enemy, Michael Jackson and Prince were arguably the biggest pop \/ rock stars in the world. Not just one but two black men, Rhea heard? Still, many fans laughed when they saw the two young brothers, women playing with shiny skin, taking a strong stand and talking harshly in their videos. The enemy of the community has shown the difficulty with which you can actually buy. Dressed in black, with Chuck and Flow, and SoneW's extravagant dancers in military uniforms, the enemy of the nation may have intimidated as many people as possible in the beginning. Many recorded facts, including in the world around us, often tarnish the image of the city, let alone its current world affairs. The best you can expect is a shared sense of We-Are-The-World that does't really push anyone's buttons. It's not that most ordinary journalists at the time felt that the wrappers had something meaningful - for that it was too long to say. The public enemy has challenged the notion that black men have to be indifferent and despised to become recording artists. . The public anime logo announced that black men (and by this extension, generally black youth) were at the forefront, and the band boldly stated that one of its main goals was to raise \"five black leaders.\" Who had no future. \"He shows a picture of a gangster around him, but with a message that went beyond the beauty of making money, the kept saying that the wrap will finally be completed in the years to come. He did not apologize for this harsh words about racism. , indifference to black people and love of place. As far as the public enemy is concerned, the situation affecting Dinner City and the blacks as a whole was very difficult. Unfortunately, the band probably had a punk way of making their own music - as it is deeply rooted in spirit, funk and other modern forms of black pop, bomb squad - including Bill Stephanie, Hank Shockley, (and my brother Keith)., - Eric Sadler, and \"Carl Ryder\" (Chuck's nickname) - have created voices that contradict traditional ideas of rhythm and music, even the most compelling of the time. Most writers had a clear desire to appear on the radio. The enemy of society, it seems, has not surrendered. Their records are tracked at extremely high temps. with deliberately used impress signs and incomprehensible intervals that make it feel like someone has hit your stereo and is doing it. He started using recorded impressions in this recordings, citing ordinary and ordinary personalities (Jess Jackson) and out of the box (Khalid Mohammad). Bum Rush the Show was a very special and unadorned LP for the recording team, however, it was launched with each subsequent release that had multiple players of multiple players, which made the original source Sent a generation of milk crate diggers to search for Before sample Speculation became a major source of proven facts, the Bomb Squad took full advantage of the construction of audio colleges built with new drum machines. Millions Need to Take It Back is now regarded as one of the world's leading pop part, the last of the Smithsonian archives, after the fear of the Black Planet. In this historic record, and in this follow-up, the band has continued to rise to what many consider CNN. Never seen how Team Live works. His first touring juniors got it as a collaboration with Run-DMC, Whoard, Beastie Boys, and Doug E. Fresh. By taking recommendations from people of its time, the group has been making sure that videos are not the only way viewers can see them perform. The advent of video stardom was a means of slowing down the facts, which were already rising overnight against the corruption of promoters and the fear and \/ for hostility of Avenue owners who watched wrap-up shows. But the public enemy managed to withstand the storms, and took the initiative to visit the country as often as possible. Although the linguistic diversity and habitat diversity seemed so great that the packaging process took a long time (which showed that American cats were less affected by landing), the enemy of the Civil War was advancing. , Occasionally. Sleep on your tourist bus instead of hotel. As the years went by, the band became so flexible that it got into a frenzy with other bands, expanding its audience and proving that liveship shop can be as attractive as a rock show. As the commercial performance of ship shop music increased in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys, the diversity of wrap-ups increased rapidly, while the diversity of themes, strangely, began to diminish. Rapper music artists from the West Coast, the Deep South, and the Midwest began appearing on the scene, and surprisingly, their ship shop genre continued to enjoy the most. Public comment on the wrap was emphasized, and the group's original recording was returned. Which, of course, made the video an overnight sensation. But on the other hand, the collection focused on the lifestyle of the underground city \"Gangsta\" began to roar, until \"criminal life\" became an automatic voice between the most accessible faces. Towards the send of this golden decade, \"golden page\" wrap leaders began to move toward radio presence and, in some cases, full recording. But the public enemy is patient, recording, and circulating, even if MTV radio stations, BET, VH-one are flat because they are not. You can call it stagnation, but how many other dangerous facts can command thousands of listeners, even if there is no hot song around them? And there is a certain degree of desire in the case of old men. Flavor Flow's reality show stunts helped make it popular, perhaps even more so when the band was at its best. Furthermore, it is hot again, and if Aerosmith was not old enough to come back and make an impact, why not an enemy of humanity? The growing turnout of urban audiences is one of the reasons why wrappers are struggling to live longer. Many leaders were surprised by the performances of Flaw and Bridget Nelson, who had probably not heard of the band since Apocalypse 'ninety-one, and perhaps did not know about Chuck's radio program on Air America's ongoing talk network. Most of the current ship shop critics often ask, \"What happened?\" But when the Experimental Act pulls a project, you almost \"\" Oh, they do it again? \"It's not like that anymore. People have no excuse for wanting a simple combination of some of the best ships never. They surprised the United States and the world before it was considered fashionable to do so.\" For those leaders who want to remember the band's best times, for some who want to know about the old school, where it was, well, the new school, the enemy of the community is already an eternal process.

When I thought I would close all my hopes for artists, as if no one could maintain integrity and no one could write a great album, Converge hit me in the head and listened to me. yuck) the albums are annoying, yes that's paid, but how much is too heavy, annoying and annoying too much? If only all teams were like this these days, but instead we see bands one by one running big brands, we see the underground being invaded by company interests and it shows bad. On albums like Applying for a Dark Sky and Jane Doe, if I was on Converge I would leave because it seemed impossible to be high, but I\u2019m glad I was\u2019t if there was more fire than all the previous records. The album is relentless, dark and charming, and the attacker seems to be staring at you, still confused, staring at your cd and wondering how fast it moves. Music has been in a very bad shape since the beginning of this century, bands have closed in a different sincerity, in a different way.","overall":5,"summary":"it's been a long time coming but it's coming from the heart.","unixReviewTime":1106092800,"reviewTime":"01 19, 2005"}

I'm so grateful that there are still some artistes around who don't just simply set their sights on the pop charts, radio airplay, teen magazine covers and simply take things from there. Those that do may celebrate multi-platinum sales and have mantelpiece laden with awards but to me, such performers are artistically vapid and culturally irrelevant. In ten years time, no one will remember anything they did. Thankfully, we still have some artistes with a vision, a dream of making real music, and an intention of sticking to their ideals. Despite all the obvious pressures, these men and women reject the `here today, gone tomorrow' fads of triteness, as they swim against the tide of mediocrity that passes itself off as popular music nowadays. Luckily, it is we, the discerning listeners, who get to enjoy the results. Anthony Hamilton is one such singer in my book. I'm still enthralled with this debut, \"Comin' From Where I'm From\", two years after its release. It's difficult to say whether this new work is better in any way but one thing's for sure: it's definitely not worse and it offers up the same top quality soul that I've come to expect from this singer. That can only be a good thing. His voice is as smoky and smouldering as never and the comparisons to soul heroes like Bill Withers, Al Green and Bobby Womack are no exaggeration. I remember debates I had with friends in the months following the release of \"Comin'\". My friends and I were loving this music but were wondering how much commercial success the'd have, given the type of music that people seem to be into these days.\"Oh, the's gonna have to water it down somewhat for this next release,\" someone said. Thankfully, that has't happened.\"He'll definitely have to get a couple of wrappers on this next CD. Maybe put a club banger for two in there,\" someone else said. Thankfully, despite the panic the generated in us by collaborating with Twista recently, that did't happen either. If there are any club banners on this album, I must've missed them.\"He's gonna have to change this image,\" one of us also said. \"Maybe tidy this shave up a bit, change this wardrobe, maybe even show a bit more flesh. You know, for the laydeeeeies. \" No one can be happier than I am, that none of this has happened either. Anthony Hamilton has stayed true to himself and may the be blessed for doing so. As far as the songs on the album are concerned, I love them all. The production is clean and devoid of gimmicks, giving this voice centre stage. What might be worth mentioning in the context of this review though, are the collaborations. \"Love And War\" features Macy Gray and \"Last Night\" features Sunshine Anderson & Dolo Pichino. Interestingly, although I greatly admire the talents of the first two (I've never heard of the third), neither of them are exactly current TRL darlings. All of this just goes to strengthen my belief in Anthony Hamilton's musical character. Think of all the other female vocalists the could have gone for - and who no doubt would have been happy to duet with him - but did't. Anyway, both collaborations work very well and I hope both Macy and Sunshine appear on the scene again in their own rights real soon. All in all, forget so-called \"neo soul\", (an unfortunate label if I never heard one). If you like your soul real, full-bodied and full of authentic southern flavour, this is a must for you. PS: I've only just discovered that this is not a release of new material but in fact stuff that the had done before this debut release on Arista. That explains the \"change\" of label and it also puts into question many of the statements I made above, especially about image, collaborations and so forth. Ah, well. That'll teach me to make sure I read the dinner sleeve notes on a CD next time before I go flapping my mouth. I still stand by my review though. I still think this is a great CD, worthy of the five stars I've given it. Only thing that's changed is I guess it seems we still await a \"new\" release proper from Mr Hamilton. We also wait to see if the goes on to fulfil the promise I've been crowing on about.

O. A. T. Fishschale is a perfect sequel to the stellar Pretty Toney Album as it sticks to the same formula. First of all you still have those tracks were Ghost just craps over a classic soul track without removing the original vocals (Big Girl). I don't think that there is another wrapper that can pull this off, at least not as well as the Ironman. The album also features a honest single (Back Like That) that can only be described as bubble gum wrap. He still frustrates the listener by taking a hot beat and only play a single verse over it (Barbershop). Leaving the listener hungrier than when the song began. Finally there are those skits that just leave you scratching your head be.g. Heart Street Directions. With that said this album is very different from the Pretty Toney Album in that it is a lot grittier. The beats there are less soul driven they are darker, harder beats in keeping with this drug tales. Its almost as though Ghost made a conscious effort to take it back to Supreme Clientele with the beats and even further back to Only built four Cuban Linx with the lyrics. Lyrically Ghost is so at please there, its like everything comes easy to him (especially storytelling). Ghost is as comfortable wrapping about the ladies as the is wrapping about a drug exchange for being whipped by this rooms. It is this versatility that sets him apart from the rest. The album also features a lot of Raekwon who does this best to whet everyone's appetite for the sequel to this classic. I haven't been this excited about a (non-Ghostface) Wu release in a long time. Theodore Unit is also in the house with Trife's stock continuing to rise in my book. This kid is the truth. Check out the Put It On The Line mixtape for more evidence. Beats-wise you can see the Def Jam machine at work (Just Blaze) but you also know that the man ,Ghost, must have hand picked these gems himself. I really got to appreciate this year for beats on this one. A few weeks before I heard this album Jay Dilla (R. I. P.) released Donuts which featured two beats that would eventually send up in this release. Hearing the two beats on the Jay Dilla album I was not particularly impressed. Especially with the \"One for Ghost\" which Ghost uses for \"Whip me with a strap\". But after hearing Ghost's vocals over this track I appreciated both Dilla & Ghost's Genius. Ghost makes this beat special. MF Doom is another surprise on this release as this best work off late has been when the has not been behind the boards. He definitely represents on Clipse of Doom and Underwater. Apparently Ghost even left out a few Madlib beats in order to make space for Doom's beats. That says a lot. Pete Rock's stock is also on the rise after this work on Be Easy. I like this grittier beats. In the immortal words of Phonte \"Dope Beats Dope Rhymes, what more do by'all want\"This album has got that.

First of all, you still have those lines, the Spirit is just talking nonsense about old soul songs without deleting the original words (Big Girl). I think no other package can achieve this, at least it\u2019s not as good as a triathlon. The disc also has a reliable alternative (Back to Like), which can only be specified in the chewing gum pack. He still entertained the audience with fast rhythms, and played only a poem (Barbershop) in it. It makes the listener more hungry than when the song begins. Finally, there are those sketches that make you scratch your head, as in Xinjie's direction. That said, the difference between an album and a Pretty Toney Album is that it's solid. The beds there are firmly in the budget range, dark, and very durable to match the drug story. It was almost as if Ghost was making an effort to bring it back to the Supreme Clientele with beats, and even went one step further, Build a Cuban Linx with only four words. The ghost of music is very happy there, as everything is easy for him (especially storytelling). The ghost package for the ladies is as free as the drug exchange threatened in this room. It is this flexibility that makes him unique. There are a lot of people who have music rights to the album, who are doing their best to stimulate everyone's interest in the following classical genre. I haven't been excited about the (non-Ghostface) version of Wu in a long time. The Theodore Unit is also in-house, and in my book, Treff's stock continues to rise. The child is telling the truth. See the Put it on line mixtape for more proof. Beats-wise you can see the Def Jam machine at work (Just Blaze), but you know that this person, Spirit, has to pick these gems by hand.

But after hearing the voice of the Spirit in this song, I love the ingenuity of Dilla and the Spirit. Ghost makes this beat special. MF Doom is another amazing thing like this, because the real work is done when you are not behind the board. It certainly represents the day of doom and subdivision. Apparently, the Spirit even left some Madlib beats to make Doom beats. This means a lot. Pete Rock's stock skyrocketed after Be Easy's work. I love this beat rougher.

I don't think there is any other threat that can eliminate it, at least not like Iron Man. The album also has a reliable single (Back Like Date) that can only be described as a bubble gum wrap. He still confuses the listener with a warm rhythm and a verse (barber shop) playing on it. Leaving the listener hungry before the song starts. Finally there are the skits that leave you scratching your head. The direction of the heart. Which means it's about to be the most delusional time of the year, as well. There is a small black spirit in the current heartbeat, which is a strong heartbeat according to these drug problems. It's almost as if Ghost made a concerted effort to bring it back to the top clientele in rhythm and return to the fact that only four Cuban links were created with names. Ghost is very happy with the song, as everything is easy for him (especially storytelling). Ghosts threaten women with luxury because the beating of these rooms threatens the exchange of drugs. That flexibility makes it unique. The album also includes a great raccoon that tries its best to revive everyone's desire to follow this classic. I haven't been happy with the release of Wu (which is not a ghost fee) for a long time. Theodore's unit is also in the house and the stock of trifles in my book is growing. That's right baby.

It\u2019s almost as if Ghost made a conscious effort to keep the Senior Client in defeat and even went back to building just four Cuban Linx with words. Lyrically Ghost is very pleading there, everything seems easy for him (especially the storytelling). The spirit is comfortably wrapped around the women as it is wrapped in the alternative substitutes that are battered in these rooms. It was this diversity that separated him from the rest. The album also has a lot of Raekwon doing their best to stimulate everyone\u2019s appetite for this regular series. I haven\u2019t been happy with this release (except for Ghostface) Wu in a long time. Theodore\u2019s unit is also in the house as Trife\u2019s stock continues to rise in my book. This baby is real. See Integrated Integration for additional evidence. You know you see the Def Jam machine working (Just Blaze) but you also know that the guy, the Spirit, is supposed to take the gold in this hand. I really thank this person for beating this one. A few weeks before I heard this album, Jay Dilla (R. I. P.) released Donuts which released two beats that would eventually ship this release. Heard two beats of Jay Dilla\u2019s album that I was\u2019t particularly impressed with. Especially the \u201cOne for Ghost\u201d that the Spirit uses to \u201chit me in the belt\u201d. But after hearing the voices of the Spirit along the way I was pleased with Dilla and Ghost\u2019s Genius. This spirit makes this beat special. MF Doom is another surprise about this release because the best last work it did was when it was\u2019t behind the commissions. It actually represents Clipse of Doom and Underwater. Apparently Ghost still left a lot of Madlib beats to find a place in Doom's beats. That's a lot. Pete Rock\u2019s fortunes are also rising following this Be Easy project. I love this light beat Phonte\u2019s immortal words \u201cDope Beats Dope Rhymes, what else to do\u201d got this album. There are very few artists at the table to stay on the same formula but still attract everyone\u2019s attention and the Spirit is definitely one.","overall":5,"summary":"Ghostface has done it again","unixReviewTime":1152144000,"reviewTime":"07 6, 2006"}

Joss was a credible R&B; vocalist from her first album SOUL SESSIONS (considered an EP) and she extended upon that on her exceptional MIND, BODY & SOUL, her first U. S. album to go platinum and nominated for multiple Grammys. However, according to Stone, this is her first \"true\" album in the sense of where she is musically. I understand that being a musician myself and later hating what I recorded for wrote, but in my eyes, Joss has nothing else she has to prove to me vocally. INTRODUCING turns out to be (unfortunately), a slight step back where \"songwriting\" is concerned. Where production is concerned, Raphael Saadiq works wonders making for the best produced album of her career. Unfortunately, a CD is more than just a production showcase, even if it just maybe the production that truly sells INTRODUCING. The album opens with an introduction that is entitled \"Change\". Essentially, the \"schooled\" Joss fan will see this as Joss's attempt at relaying the fact that she wanted to be different on this album. Honestly, Joss is the most soulful she's never been on INTRODUCING, but the degree may not be as different as she envisions it. \"Spoiled\" and \"Super Duper Love\" were soulful showcases from their respective albums. The true-opening track (\"Girl You Won't Believe It\"), is a hit in my mind. It did't have the same vibe as \"Right To Be Wrong\" from MIND BODY & SOUL, but I think Joss purposely intended it that way. As good as it is, you still can't help but feel there is some \"substance\" missing. Sure it is soulful, but the songwriting does't quite feel complete. This is blatantly obvious on the \"Headturner\", a good, but not great track. The production makes up for a loss in memorability, but it is unfortunate sense MIND BODY & SOUL had a number of memorable numbers. \"Tell Me 'Bout It\" raises the momentum slightly, but true Joss fans will be quick to say it in't her best single. It is good, especially with the soul background vocalists adding to the mix, but it in't nearly as memorable for as touching as the great \"Spoiled\", \"You Had Me\", \"Super Duper Love\", for etc. The Common featured \"Tell Me What We're Going To Do Now\" falls in similar circumstance with \"Tell Me 'Bout It\"; it's \"almost there\" but falls just slightly short of being SOLID, solid. Joss sounds good, even when she coverings, but \"Tell Me What We're Going to Do Now\" ends up being a bit too long, and Common is good, but the track still remains a bit unmemorable.\"Put Your Hands On Me\" is a bit manic in my eyes and fills a bit more filler than hit. Sure, it in't bad, and you appreciate Joss's assertive vocals, but it does't quite prove to have the solidity of the best of the album (\"Girl They Won't Believe It\", \"Tell Me 'Bout It\", for \"Tell Me What We're Going To Do Now\"). Sure, the production is creative, but it there too feels as if it's trying TOO hard to be soulful as opposed to being natural. I think Joss is very natural, though she does sometimes have the tendency to covering. \"Music\" proves to be much better than \"Put Your Hands On Me\", though the lifted Lauryn Hill wrap verse is a bit awkward. \"Arms of My Baby\" in't stunning, but it is good. The production once again overtakes the songwriting, but there the balance is a bit closer. The drum groove is killer on \"Arms\". \"Bad Habit\" proves to be another \"producer's track\" where the production unfortunately eclipses the songwriting itself. Sure, Joss is convincing, but neither \"Arms\" for \"Bad Habit\" come off as convincing as the very best.\"Proper Nice\" is more filler than hit (aside from great production, and soulful vocals), but \"Bruised But Not Broken\" is truly the best of the album. Here, Joss sounds exceptionally well and the songwriting, production, and vocals finally click very well. \"Baby Baby Baby\" in't too bad either, though \"What Were We Thinking\" rivals \"Bruised But Not Broken\" for the prize for best track. Had Joss just ended with \"What Were We Thinking\" as opposed to making it the penultimate number, it would've been stronger. Unfortunately, Joss chose to add the floptastic, utterly ridiculous \"Music [outro]\" which serves no purpose and detracts as opposed to strengthens the album. Unfortunately, INTRODUCING turns out to have more flaws than Joss' critically acclaimed MIND BODY & SOUL, even if the singer had hoped to have the adverse effect. Still, Joss is a much more credible singer than a number of the American contemporary R&B; singers and she chooses to using more credible numbers in the style of new-soul, which is commendable, particularly for a British singer. It does't always relate there on INTRODUCING JOSS STONE, which is unfortunate.

Joss is a loyal R&B; The singer from her debut album WORKS OF THE SOUL (taken over by the EP), has expanded on her MIND, BODY & SOUL, this is her first album to win the Platinum Award and learned numerous Grammy titles on American albums. However, according to Stone, this is this first \"real\" album about the level of music. I know I\u2019m a singer myself, and I hate what I recorded later, but in my opinion, Jos has nothing else to show me with the sound. The result of the import (unfortunately), is a small step back to \"songwriting\". In terms of production, Raphael Saadiq has created the best-produced album in this career. Unfortunately, the CD is more than just displaying a product, although it can only sell products that WE KNOW. The album begins with an introduction entitled \"Change\". Most importantly, Jos' \"educated\" fans may think that this is a fact that Jos is trying to show that the wants to be different from this album. Honestly, Joss is the most loving person the has never been to INTRODUCING, but the degree may not be as different as the thought. \"Robbery\" and \"Super Duper Love\" are love shows on their albums. The real opening song (\"Girl You Won't Believe\") is very popular in my heart. It does't have an atmosphere like \"Right to Be wrong\" about MIND BODY & SOUL, but I think Joss did it on purpose. No matter how good it is, you can\u2019t help but feel like there\u2019s something \u201cmissing\u201d. Yes it is love, but the creation of songs is not perfect. This is very clear in \"Headturner\", which is very good but not bad. The product is designed for memory loss, but unfortunately, MENTAL & SOUL has many memorable numbers. \"Tell me\" has slightly increased its power, but Joss's true fans will quickly say that it's not this single. This is great, especially for soul-backed singers joining this mix, but not to be forgotten as the biggest \u201crobbed\u201d, \u201cUbunam\u201d, \u201cSuper Duper Love\u201d, etc. The article \"Tell me what we are going to do now\" is similar to the situation \"Tell me around\"; \"it's almost there\", but it's close to being strong and solid. Joss sounds good, and when the covers up, \"Tell me what we're going to do now\" ends up being too long, Common is fine, but the trail is still a little memorable. \"Put your hands on me\" was a little manic in my eyes, with little things that could hit me. Yes, that's not right. He appreciates Jos's singing with confidence, but it does't quite prove that the has the best voice on the album (\"Girls Can't Believe\", \"Tell Me\" Cycle), like \"Tell What We're Doing Now\"). Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT saint for me either. I think Jos is natural, even though the has a tendency to hide sometimes. \u201cMusic\u201d proved to be much better than \u201cputting your hands on me\u201d, though the uplifting Lauren Hill around this poem was hard. \"My Baby Tool\" is not surprising, but it is very beautiful. The production also went beyond writing the song, but the balance is close. The drum slot is the \"instrument\" killer. \"Bad habits\" has manifested another \"song of the producer\", unfortunately, its production surpassed the creation of the song itself. Yes, Jos begs, but the \"weapons\" of \"bad habits\" are not as deceptive as the best. \"Properly priced\" is more important than the beat (except for the best production and romantic lyrics), but \"scarred but not broken\" is actually the best thing on the album. Here, Jos sounds great, and writing the song, the production and the voice are finally good. \"Baby Babe Babe\" is also a good one, though \"What We Think\" and \"You're a Tough but Unbreakable\" competes for the title of the best song. It would be powerful if Jos decided to say \u201cwhat we think\u201d instead of using it as a last number. Unfortunately, Joss chose to add \"Music [outro]\" that is weak and humorous, irrational and destructive rather than strengthening the album. Unfortunately, it turned out that SUBMISSION has more flaws than Joss's MIND BODY & SOUL, and that the artist wishes to have a negative impact. However, compared to many modern American R&Bs, Joss is a loyal musician. For the singers, the chose a more reliable figure, a kind of new, admirable soul, especially for the British singer. Unfortunately, it is not always associated with the launch of the Sweet Stone. For this, I would like to say three.","overall":4,"summary":"Not Her Strongest,  but Still Good -- 3   stars","unixReviewTime":1175212800,"reviewTime":"03 30, 2007"}

I hate being an artist myself and hating what I later recorded in writing, but in my view Jose has nothing more to show me than speaking. Introduction is just (unfortunately) a small step where \"songwriting\" is affected. Where production is affected, Raphael Sadiq does amazing work for this best-produced album.

In fact, Joss's \"school\" followers will see it as an attempt to convey to Joss the fact that they want to be different from the album. Honestly, Joss is a very encouraging spirit that has never been used, but that distance can't be what the sees. \"Spoiled\" and \"Super Duper Love\" were soul-searching on their albums. The truth-telling track (\"Girl You Can't Believe It\") is a favourite of mine. It did't have a vibe like \"Right to be wrong\" from MIND BODY & SOUL, but I think that's what Joss intended it to be. As good as it is, you can never help but feel like something is \"missing\". Of course there is a soul, but writing songs does not feel complete. This is especially evident in \"Head Turner\", a good track, but not very good. Production reduces memory, but unfortunately the concept of MIND BODY & SOUL has many memorable numbers. \"Tell me\" raises the bar a bit, but true fans of juice will be quick to tell you about one of this best moves. Okay, especially with soul-backing artists who add to the mix, but it's almost as touching as \"Spoiled\", \"You Had Me\", \"Super Duper Love\", etc. Is missed.

Of course, the production is creative, but it also seems to be more true than natural. \"Music\" proves to be much better than \"Put your hands on me\", although Lauren Hill's suggested verse is a bit vague. \"My Baby's Weapons\" in't amazing, but it's good. Goes beyond writing the song, but when the balance is a little closer. The drum beats in \"Arms\". \"Bad Practice\" proves another \"producer track\" where the product unfortunately goes beyond writing the song. Of course, Joss is convincing, but \"bad habit\" weapons don't look too good. \"Real Nice\" is more than a hit (except for the big productions, and the soulful voices), but Not Broken \"is the best of the album. Here, the juice looks great and Songwriting, production, and lyrics finally click very well. \"Baby BB BB\" in't too bad either, although \"We Thought\" rivals \"Wounded but Not Broken\" to win the Best Song award. It would have been more powerful if Joss had recently concluded that \"what do we think\" is the number one choice. Unfortunately, Joss chose to include a flopastic, \"music [outro]\" that was ridiculous, meaningless, and disturbing, as opposed to reinforcing the album. Unfortunately, there are more flaws in the introduction than Juice's MIND BODY & SOUL, although the artist hoped it would have a negative effect. However, Joss is a more loyal artist than the modern American R&B number. Artists also choose to use more reliable numbers in the style of a new spirit, which is commendable, especially for a British artist. It does't always speak there in INTRINGCING JOSS Stone, which is unfortunate.

{"orig_index":53928,"reviewerID":"A1QEWOSV05RYEO","asin":"B000MTPAGI","reviewerName":"Michael Brent Faulkner, Jr. \"Brent Faulkner\"","helpful":[1,3],"reviewText":"Why Joss Stone decided to headline this third album INTRODUCING JOSS STONE, I can no longer understand. Joss is a reliable R&B; The voter from this first album SOUL SESSIONS (considered EP) and has already added to this own MIND, JID & SOUL, this first never American album called the Grammys. However, according to Stone, this is this first album \u201cTrue\u201d in the sense of where the music is. I understand that I myself am a musician and I hate what I record, but in my eyes, Joss has nothing else to prove to me as a voice. INTRODUCTION has become (unfortunately), a small step back to where \u201csongwriting\u201d is spoken. Where production is concerned, Raphael Saadiq works to create the best album of this career. Unfortunately, a CD is more than just a production show, even if it\u2019s a production that actually sells INTRODUCTION. The door opens with an introduction titled \u201cChange\u201d. Basically, a \u201ctaught\u201d Joss fan will see it as Joss\u2019s attempt to are -convey the fact that the wants to be different on this album. Honestly, Joss is the most psychedelic never in INTRODUCTION, but the rankings may not be as different as the sees it. \u201cDestroyed\u201d and \u201cLove Duper Super\u201d are fun performances from their albums. The path to true divorce (\u201cYou Won\u2019t Believe in Women\u201d), I thought. They don\u2019t have the same existence as \u201cRight You\u2019re Wrong\u201d from MIND JODY & SOUL, but I think Joss meant that. No matter how beautiful it is, you still can\u2019t help but feel like something is missing. Sure it\u2019s the soul, but writing the song does\u2019t make it entirely sensible. This is clearly visible on Headturner, a great road, but not a highway. The production does cause memory loss, but sadly MIND BODY & SOUL has a number of memorable numbers. \u201cTell Me\u2019 Bout It \u201draises the bar a bit, but Joss\u2019s true fans will be in a hurry to tell you the\u2019s out of this way. Great, especially for original voters who add soul to the mix, but it does\u2019t seem like a memory like the big touch of \u201cDestroyed\u201d, \u201cYou Have Me\u201d, \u201cSuper Duper Love\u201d, and so on. shown in \u201cTell Me What I\u2019m Doing Now\u201d occurred under similar circumstances to \u201cTell Me Bout It\u201d; It's \"almost there\" but a bit shorter than SOLID, harder. Joss is beautiful, even with a cover, but \u201cTell Me What We\u2019ll Do Now\u201d is a bit long, and Caad is okay, but the clues are still a bit memorable. \"Raise your hands\" my eyes were a bit manic and filled with a little bruise. Sure, it\u2019s not a bad thing, and you\u2019re thankful for Joss\u2019s effective voice, but it has\u2019t really proven that the has the firm\u2019s best album (\u201cThe Girl Won\u2019t Believe It\u201d, \u201cTell Me Bout It\u201d), and \"Tell Me What I Can Do Now\"). Sure, the production is creative, but there also feels like you\u2019re trying to be more psychological than natural. I think Joss is very natural, although sometimes the has a tendency to cover up. \u201cMusic\u201d proved to be better than \u201cPut Your Hands on Me\u201d, though Lauryn Hill\u2019s rising paragraph on the recording was a bit disgusting. \u201cArms of My Baby\u201d in\u2019t surprising, but it\u2019s great. The production again surpasses the lyrics, but with a balance that is a bit closer. The drum pocket skills the \"Arms\". \u201cBad Habit\u201d proves to be another \u201ctracer-producer\u201d where the producer unfortunately obscures the writing of the song itself. Sure, Joss can be persuasive, but none of the \u201cBad Arms\u201d turned out to be the best. Broken \"is really the best on the album. Here, Joss sounds so great and the lyrics, production, and voice are finally clickable.\" Baby Baby Baby \"isn't too bad either.\" We thought \u201cBroken But Not Broken\u201d competitors for the best award never. Choose to add floptastic, completely funny \u201cmusic [outro]\u201d that does\u2019t serve any purpose and is harmful as opposed to endorsing the album. Unfortunately fortunately, the INTRODUCTION has become more flawed than Joss \u2019highly acclaimed MIND BODY & SOUL, though the factor is hoping to have a negative impact. However, Joss is a beloved singer among a number of contemporary R&B in the United States; the singers the chose use a large number of reliable new soul forms, which are commendable, especially in English songs. It is not always connected with INTRODUCTION JOSS STONE, which is unfortunate. Here I will say three.","overall":4,"summary":"Not Her Strongest,  but Still Good -- 3   stars","unixReviewTime":1175212800,"reviewTime":"03 30, 2007"}

(A certain line in \"Me and Mr. Jones\" has just been entered into my book of all time classic lines. Even though its Amy Winehouse, every time I hear it I go, \"Did she just say that???\")As for the album, as mentioned it is throwback to the sounds of 'sixtys\/'seventys AM hit radio. but its done convincingly.

Good talent has emerged, but for me we still have to run away from the music of the eighties. The period when BIG and FAT came up. Then came AMY. Of course, this album is retro. And Amy in't the first pop star to excel at making retro things (think - Fifty Two, Brand New Heavy, Brian Setzer). However, I think Amy Winehouse is the first person to have the honor of convincing this season. What Path music has a convincing \"background\" sound. Yet at the same time. Attitude is really now (!) A voice in the Winehouse that completely pops and throws back to R&B. Fifty-six divas'. But the personality is perfect for today's TV \/ tabloid generation. Besides, their songs are also charming.

Some comparisons to AC are the use of PB for all sorts of sounds and classifications, such as shooting a bowl at the beginning of \"Bros.\" The illustrations are always used in delicate and interesting ways so as not to distract the listener from the actual presentation of this work - Lennox\u2019s practical sound skills combined with this sound mixture to create a simple and beautiful reconciliation. The comparison of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys is appropriate and largely due to this ability of the song and the creator of harmony. It differs from most other artists by allowing the song to blend in with other self -praise songs. When the track is transmitted, the listener feels captured on a fascinating experimental journey similar to any live jazz for rock fixes.

I agree with people there. it's heavier and not as atmospheric as recent works. more like \"Greatest Lovesongs Vol six hundred and sixty-six\". it's not HEAVY heavy, but it has more crunch than \"Dark Light\", and the songs are as melodic and tuneful as never, with Ville Valo in fine vocal form. His lovesick poetry is as potent as never. nothing personal, but for part's sake, let's hope the never cures this broken heart. The songs are more intricate and longer, culminating with \"Sleepwalking Past Hope\" reaching the ten minute mark!!!!

As much as some people might want to live back in two thousand and two with The Illusion of Safety, I'd much rather look to the future. Thrice actually shows its unique talent and diversity in being table to create two completely different soundscapes with Fire\/Water. The classic Thrice elements are there, they have just taken them in a new direction. I can't understand people who live in the past and yearn for a rehash of the same album over and over again. Limp Bizkit anyone? In my opinion its a bands duty to evolve and get better over time, and constantly refine their sound. What if Radiohead never released OK Computer for Kid A and just released another The Bends for Pablo Honey? What if Porcupine Tree never released In Absentia? I think you get my point. On to The Alchemy Index, Vols. one-two. On the whole, an excellent excellent recording. What really impressed me when I first listened was that Thrice actually captured the essence of the Fire and Water elements on this record. Fire is harsh, brittle and incendry. Dustins voice is more raspy than I've never heard and its just feels like its going to burn into your skull. The Arsonist is an instant classic and has some of the best guitar work I've heard yet, its incredible. Choosing water to complement fire was nice because it has the complete opposite effect. Its has and almost trance like effect on you, listen to Open Water and you'll see what I mean. While Fire might burn into your skull, Water is incredibly beautiful and slow moving. Hearing how Thrice captured the elements really impressed me, I'm interested to see how Air and Earth turn out, and if this is any indication, it will be great. As far as complaints go, there are a few tracks that are not as good as others but honestly, every album has its share of ups and downs. The downs of this album are minimal at best. In conclusion, while Fire sounds great, I'd choose Water as the winner between the two. Its exceptional, even if your not a Thrice fan, there is lot to like on this album. Dustin Kensrue has one of my favourite voices and you get to hear both sides of this voice on The Alchemy Index, Vols one-two. I honestly anticipated this album so much that I was afraid it would dissapoint me, but in the send it has not. Another seller album from Thrice.","overall":5,"summary":"Whats going on here???

Three times actually showcased their unique talent and diversity, using fire \/ water to create two completely different sounds. Trice's old stuff is there, just take them to the new side. I can\u2019t understand people who live in the past and want to cover the same album over and over again. Is there anyone at Limp Bizkit? In my opinion, the band has a responsibility to emerge and get better over time, and to improve their vocals on a regular basis. What if Radiohead never released the OK Computer for Kid A but only released one The Bends for Pablo Honey? What if the porcupine tree was not released without it? I think you understand what I mean. Enter the Alchemy Index, Vol. One for two. Overall, it is a very good record. When I first heard it, the thing that really impressed me was that Thrice actually touched the context of fire and water on this record. The fire is heavy, weak and burning. Dustins' voice is sharper than I never heard it, and it sounds like it's going to burn on your scalp. The Arsonist classic instant, and some of the most effective guitars I\u2019ve never heard, are amazing. Choosing water to fill the fire is good because it has a different effect. It has an impact almost on you. Listen in the open water and you will understand what I mean. Although a fire can burn on your scalp, the water is very nice and slow. I was impressed to hear how to capture them three times. I would like to see the results of the wind and the earth. As for complaints, there are a few sub-tracks, but honestly, every album has its ups and downs. The limitations of this disc are very small. In short, even though the fire sounds good, I will choose Water as the winner between the two. Very special, even if you are not a three-time fan, this album is very popular. Dustin Kensrue has one of my favourite words, and you can hear it from both sides of the Alchemy Index, Vol. one-two.

I can't understand people who live in the past and are longing for the same album update again and again. Lame Bizkit anyone? In my opinion, it is the band's job to change and improve over time and to constantly improve their sound.

I think you understand me. Go to Alchemy Index, Walls. And two. All in all, a very good recording. What really impressed me was when I first heard that Trice played a real part in this record of fire and water things. Fire is cruel, destructive and disturbing. Dustin's voice is louder than I've never heard and it looks like it will burn in your skull. Arsenic is a fast-paced classic and has the best guitar work I've never heard, it's amazing. The choice of water to fill the fire was good because its effect is very different. Touch it and it almost affects you, listen to the open water and you will see what I mean. While fire can burn your scalp, the water is surprisingly good and slows down. Hearing how Thrace photographed the elements really impressed me, I would love to see what the air and the earth look like, and it would be great if it was a hint.

She realizes there is strength in vulnerability, and with that knowledge shares her growth as an individual as well as a musician. The pearls of wisdom beyond her years typical of Morissette abound in this new collection, but thanks in large part to producer Guy Sigsworth these songs have more edge and grit than anything she's released since the 'ninetys. These songs sway, caress, mesmerize and most definitely rock. Those seeking a return of the so-called \"angry\" Alanis from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five's \"Jagged Little Pill\" will probably never come any closer to it than this new record, but this time around she is older and wiser, and the songs are stronger for it. Morissette is table to be thoroughly autobiographical yet remain accessible. She will easily resonate there with those struggling to scope with death, whatever kind of death that may be. She has mentioned repeatedly in interviews hitting \"rock bottom\" upon demise of her engagement to factor Ryan Reynolds and how that informed \"Flavors. \" The album certainly reflects death - in this case, death of a relationship. Never hiding her bruises, she nevertheless moves forward toward the light at the send of the tunnel. Rockers like the righteous \"Citizen of the Planet\" (My frontier is on an sailplane\/My prisons: homes for rehabilitating) and \"Versions of Violence\" rub shoulders easily with sunny melodies like \"In Praise of the Vulnerable\" and melancholy ballads like \"Not As We,\" but despite the variety there are no particular standouts amid the album's slim eleven tracks, and that is a benefit there; \"Flavors. \" is thoroughly an album in the classic `seventys sense. These songs, while certainly table to stand alone, unravel in succession, letting Morissette narrate a story. Because of this, a selection like lead single \"Underneath\" with its radio-friendly production and insightful lyrics (\"Spotlight on these seeds of simpler reasons\/This score, born into form, starts in my living room\") sits comfortably aside the angry, swirling \"Straitjacket\" (\"One day I'll introduce myself and you'll see you've not met me.\")This album may have been a long time in coming, but lyrics like these from the urgent, chest-pumping \"Moratorium,\" which snap and jerk amid Sigsworth's spellbinding production, prove it was worth the wait:\"I declare a moratorium on things relationship\/I declare a respite from the toils of liaison\/I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement\/I declare a full time-out from all things commitment.\"The loss she chronicles reaches its apex on the downcast, revelatory \"Torch\" (\"I never thought I'd have to play down my torch for you\") but simmers down on \"Giggling Again For No Reason,\" where she clears her head with a spontaneous drive out of LA to breathe in the California sunset and feel the ocean against her skin. \"I can feel the bones are smiling in my body,\" she sings. \"I can see the meetings of inhibition.\" Sigsworth's sparkling production and the rapturous melody fit the song like a glove, making it an ideal summer tune. Though she's giggling again, she can't turn off the \"Tapes\" in her head that fill her with inaccurate, unfair self-appraisals (\"`I am someone easy to leave\/Even easier to forget'\/A voice, if inaccurate\") that continue to foster her insecurities. Nevertheless, on the disc's hearty conclusion, the bittersweet, rousing \"Incomplete,\" she proudly towns her flaws and the humanity they underscore with a new outlook on life:\"I have been running so sweaty my whole life urgent for a finish line\/I have been missing the rapture this whole time of being forever incomplete.\"Morissette continually proves herself to be the underappreciated poet laureate of this generation's contemporary singer\/songwriters for this generation. She has a sharp insight into the human condition that is uniquely hers. By inviting listeners along on her journey of self-discovery she helps them again insight into themselves as well, all the while entertaining. She is certainly a force to reckon with. The few extra dollars are worth investing for this deluxe edition, which comes with five leftover compositions from the album's sessions. The bitter, self-critical \"The Guy Who Leaves\" sizzles with tingly electronic beats and swirls amid Morissette's urgent vocals, while \"Orchid\" and \"Madness\" are both understated, poignant, positively beautiful ballads. Bittersweet coming-of-age tale \"Limbo No More\" has a profoundly moving orchestral arrangement, while the joyous, folksy \"On the Tequila\" is set to turn more than a few heads. It is not for black of quality but simply because they do not fit the scheme of the album that these songs are bonus cuts.

It was always going to be difficult.\" - Geoff Barrow, Pitchfork Media interview, Apr. seven, two thousand and weight. Geoff Barrow and the rest of Portishead had every reason in the world to feel this way. When Dummy debuted in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, it did't sound like anything else and was't even expected to sell fifty, zero copies. It's hard to believe in this day and page, but Dummy's dark, torch pop punctuated with ship-hop beats and swimming in a sea of bass had never before been co-opted by anyone--not even Massive Attack, who had approached trip-hop from more of a dance perspective. It blew up, sparking a trip-hop genesis in salt-rock circles looking for a viable (and similarly angst-ridden) alternative to grunge, especially in the States. Now, of course, Dummy's sound is everywhere, from the umpteen upstart trip-hop bands that subsequently appeared to spy films, cocktail parties and massage therapy commercials. So we would be forgiven for not being bowled over by Dummy today, and Portishead would be forgiven for wanting to distance themselves from it. When last we heard from Portishead, it seemed as though they were packing it in for good, leaving us with a slightly less fresh self-titled album in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven and a live recording at Manhattan's Roseland Ballroom in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight before retreating into the shadows. Always something of an enigma and quite shy of the press, it was left to us to assume that Portishead was frustrated with how their crown jewel had been assimilated and watered-down, and that they were too daunted by the challenge that Barrow mentioned above to record a third album: How do you sound like yourself and not sound like yourself? All of which makes Third--a record that was't even supposed to exist--such a cryptically dazzling triumph. Third is no Dummy: It's much bleaker, makes precious few references to pop, and attains a level of creepiness that Dummy's strangest song, \"Wandering Star,\" only suggested. Yet one listen to Third is all it takes to realize that nobody else is making music quite like this, and this is how Portishead still sound like themselves. In fact, hearing Third in two thousand and weight may clue us into what it was like to hear Dummy in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four. Counterintuitive as it may seem, the first thing to do when approaching Third is to forget about trip-hop and all the associations it carries. Barrow's drums stay far, far away from a ship-hop swagger; rather than providing a backbone, these diverse rhythms teeter on edge with the rest of the music and add another ominous player to the mix. \"Plastic\" uses camped, clipped drum rolls that send the song screeching to a halt about a dozen times, and \"We Carry On\" is driven by a scary tom-led tribal stomp (Morcheeba this in't). Barrow does't cop out by adding bass undercurrents for cheap mystery; instead, the punches up the compression and keeps the sound trebly and brittle, giving the impression that everything is flying right at you even when the songs stand still. Third may be stubbornly unsexy, but that does't mean it's not alluring. Indeed, it wields an odd magnetic power that draws the listener never further into its disorienting abyss, even when all of the elements jump bluntly out of the speakers. By the same token, Third's allure does't make it an easy listen, and it can be particularly heady when experienced in one straight pass. The sequencing feels all wrong, moving up and down and up again in the most unsettling of ways. After the distorted anti-song \"Silence\" kicks the record off, Portishead dips into the heavily narcotized haunted house of \"Hunter,\" where Beth Gibbons' vocals drift sleepily and hypnotically through the arrangement. \"We Carry On\" is followed by the ninety-second respite \"Deep Water,\" which sounds like Gibbons fronting the Ink Spots over a ukulele melody, before being gunned down by the incessant staccato rapid-firing of \"Machine Gun.\" Through it all, Gibbons sings like an innocent bystander; divorced from and frightened by the music around her, she becomes your stand-in for its unfamiliar territory. She contributes little to the record compositionally and melodically, but remove her and obliterate a sizable chunk of Third's emotional punch. The members of Portishead are noted experimentalists, but they don't just make cool sounds for fun. The backward-looped guitar on \"Nylon Smile,\" the warped ascending scales on \"Hunter,\" and the many other weird noises that crop up on Third contain an element of caution like aural barbed wire: As unpleasant as they may be, they're there to keep us from venturing somewhere truly dangerous. The creepy Portuguese television program that begins \"Silence\" seems appropriate, since listening to Third can feel as though we're tuning into a channel that we're not meant to know about for watch. I imagine that trip-hop in its nascent form--Massive Attack's Mezzanine, Tricky's Maxinquaye, and yes, Portishead's Dummy--was originally meant to invoke this sort of forbidden underworld, but that somewhere down the road the plot got lost, and its darkness and foreboding turned into something more manageable, fashionable and marketable. By rescuing trip-hop from a fate of Banana Republic soundtracks and putting their extremely personal stamp on a tired genre, Portishead have are-established themselves not simply as masters of their craft, but as reinventors of it.","overall":5,"summary":"Third","unixReviewTime":1209427200,"reviewTime":"04 29, 2008"}

Now, yes, Dummy's voice is ubiquitous, from countless leading bands that appear later in movies, cocktail meetings, and cosmetic marketing sales. So we can be forgiven for not being knocked down by Dummy today, and Portishead can also forgive us if we want to get away from it.

However, just listen for the third time and note that no one is making music like this, and this is how Portishead still sounds. In fact, listening to three thousand two thousand and the hardships can give us an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat it was like to listen to a stupid man in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four. Although it may seem contradictory, the first thing you need to do when approaching the third is to forget the jumping movement and all the communication you are carrying. Barrow's barrels are far from the swagger of boat jumping; these different rhythms do not provide background, but sway with all the music, and add another awesome player to the mix. \"Plastics\" uses vertical, cut-out rows to stop the song from bringing about twelve times, while \"We're Going On\" is driven by national anthem (Morcheeba this not) led by the dreaded Tom. Barrow will not add a lower key to get a lower key; on the contrary, it will intensify the pressure and keep the sound high and clean, giving the impression that even if the song is still there, everything flies to you. The third party may be stubborn and unattractive, but this does not mean that you are not tempted. In fact, it has incredible magnetic field, and even if all the elements are directly connected to the speaker, they will not attract the listener further into the abyss of confusion. For the same reason, the attraction of the Third does not make it easy to hear, and it can be very pleasant to again experience by passing directly. Arranging the feeling is completely wrong, moving up and down the most disturbing path. After a twisted version of \"Shut Up\" released the record, Portishead slipped into an anaesthetized haunted house in \"Hunter\", and Beth Gibbons' singing was drowsy and in line with the arrangement. \"We Carry On\" is followed by a ninety-second breath-taking \"Deep Water\", which sounds like Gibs facing Ink Spots in ukulele music then shot down by a \"Machine Gun\" and quick blasts. In all of this, the Gibeonites using as if they were innocent bystanders; separated from the surrounding music and scared, you become a place to stand in your unfamiliar place. He contributed a little to the record in composing and singing, but removed it and erased a large part of the third emotional impact. Portishead members are famous testers, but they don\u2019t just make cool sounds for fun. The guitar that pulls the loop back to the \"Nylon Smile\", the twisted scale that rises to the \"Hunter\", and many other strange noises from the third all contain a warning, like a barbed wire block: although unpleasant, they are there to prevent us from going to truly dangerous places. The horrible Portuguese television program that starts with \"Silence\" seems appropriate, because listening to the Third sounds like we're preparing for something we should't know about the Channel. a growing genre - Massive Attack's Mezzanine, Tricky's Maxinquaye, yes, Portishead's Dummy - was originally designed to resurrect this slowly forbidden land, but somewhere along the way, the plot is lost. By keeping the journey from the future of the Republican song of Banana, and putting their personal mark on the weary genre, Portis Black De is determined not only as a master of their part, but also its founder.","overall":5,"summary":"Third","unixReviewTime":1209427200,"reviewTime":"04 29, 2008"}

It will always be difficult.\" - Geoff Barrow, Pitch Fork Media Interview, April seven, two thousand and Weight. Geoff Barrow and others at Portish Head had every reason to feel this way in the world. When Dummy started singing in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine, the did't think anything else and did't expect to sell fifty copies, zero. It's hard to believe this day and this page, but the dummy black torch with which the rhythm of the ship shop and the boss was swimming in the ocean was never chosen by anyone else - not even Massive Attack, which dances. Was going on tour It exploded, especially in the states, triggering a trip shop in salt rock circles in search of an alternative to grunge (and angry). Now, of course, dummy voices are everywhere, from the never-charming trip-hop bands of spy movies, cocktail parties and massage therapy commercials. So today we can be forgiven for not dumping the dummy, and Portash Head will be forgiven for wanting to distance himself from it. The last time we heard about Portish Head, it seemed like a good protection, which left us with a young album that could be renamed One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Fifty-seven, and Manhattan's One thousand in Roseland Ballroom, and nine live recordings. Before retreating into the shadows. The most confusing and embarrassing thing in the newspapers, always, was left to us to think that Portish Head was frustrated with the way this crown jewels were mixed and watered, and that the barrow mentioned above He was deeply shocked by the challenge. Record the third album: How do you feel and do not feel like you? Everything that makes a third - a record that should't even exist - is such a glorious victory. The third is not a dummy: it's too dark, it gives some valuable references to pop, and it reaches the level of threats raised by the dummy's weird song, \"Wandering Star.\" Yet someone listens, the third is to see that no one else is making such music, and Portis Head still looks like them. In fact, listening to two thousand and one-third of the weight can lead us to what it was like to hear a dummy in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four. As it seems contradictory, the first thing you should do when approaching the Trinity is to forget the trip shop and all the parties that carry it. Barrow drums live far away, far from the arrogance of ship shop Instead of providing a backbone, these different themes thrive throughout the music scene and add another great player to the mix. \"Plastic\" uses a scanned, cut-out drum that sends the song about a pause about twelve times, and \"We Carry On\" is played by a tribal stump led by Tom (Morchiba. not me). Barrow fails to add a boss undercurrent to get a cheap mystery. Instead, it punches the compression and keeps the sound back and forth, giving the impression that everything is flying straight at you, even when there are songs left. The third may be unpleasant, but that does't mean it's not attractive. In fact, it has an amazing magnetic field that draws the audience to the abyss of disturbance, even when all the elements are out of their way. Likewise, the attraction of the Trinity does not make it easy to hear, and it can be especially important when you are familiar with a particular context. The layout all seems wrong, it goes up and down and in very unresolved ways. After breaking the record for the distorted song \"Shut Up\", Portish Head drowned in the drug-laden \"Hunter\" house, where Beth Gibbons' voices resounded through the program. \"We Carry On\" is followed by a twenty-two-second breath of \"Deep Water,\" which sounds like Gibbons watching link spots on Yukoli music, before being shot by an endless Stikato shooter \"Machine Gun\". Be killed All in all, the Gibeonites sang as if they were innocent. Isolated and frightened by the music around you, it becomes your unfamiliar place. He contributes very little to the record by composing and singing, but removes it and destroys a large part of the third emotional cartoon. The members of Portis Head are well-known testers, but they do not make cool sounds just for fun. The twisted guitar goes back to \"Nylon Smile\", the rising scales of \"Hunter\", and the many weird sounds coming from the third one contain a cautionary tale, such as the sharp bringing of an year: Although not pleasant, 'We are there' To prevent him from going to a really dangerous place. The terrifying Portuguese television series that begins with \"Peace\" seems appropriate, because listening to the Third Amendment sounds like a tunnel to an unknown channel. I think TripHop in its emerging form - Massive Attack's Mezzanine, Tricky's Maxinquaye, and yes, Portishead's Dummy - was originally supposed to claim a ban on this kind of underworld, but the plot was lost somewhere, and darkness and prophecy. Had become A solid, fashionable and marketable item. By saving trip shop from the send of banana Republic songs and putting this own stamp on the weary genre, Portishead - established himself not only as an expert in this part, but also as this inventor.","overall":5,"summary":"Third","unixReviewTime":1209427200,"reviewTime":"04 29, 2008"}

It's always hard.\" - Geoff Barrow, Pitchfork Media interview, April seven, two thousand and a half. Geoff Barrow and the rest of Portishead have every reason in the world to feel that way. When Dummy made a thousand, nine hundred and ninety -four, it looked like no one else and was not even expected to sell fifty, zero copies. It\u2019s hard to believe today and on this page, but the Dummy\u2019s dark darkness, engraved with ship -hop beats and swim bass has\u2019t worked with anyone - not even Great Violence, approaching a voyage - skip the more to look at the dance. It exploded, triggering a travel-hop of salt-rock circles looking for a viable (and equally annoying) alternative to grunge, especially in the Regions. Now, of course, Dummy\u2019s voice is everywhere, from the front-line umpteen-up lineup that eventually appeared in spy movies, cocktail parties and massage commercials. Then forgive us for not covering Dummy today, and forgive Portishead for wanting to stay away. The last time we heard it at Portishead, they seemed to be packing well, and they left us a little album titled One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Ninety-Seven Live Recordings of Manhattan\u2019s Roseland Ballroom One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Ninety Ninety- weight before returning to the shadows. It\u2019s always funny and embarrassing to the press, we\u2019re left to think that Portishead was angry about how their gold crown was melted and watered down, and they were so angry about the challenge Barrow mentioned above in recording the third album : What do you look like and don't you look like? All of this makes a third record not thought to exist - an impressive achievement. The third in\u2019t Dummy: It\u2019s very crude, it makes some expensive reference to pop, and it reaches the level of profanity just suggested by Dummy\u2019s most amazing song, \u201cStar Wandering\u201d. But a Listen Third is the only thing needed to know that no one makes music like this, and Portishead still looks like this on their own. In fact, the Third Hearing of two thousand and nine can show us how to hear the Dummy of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety -four. Avoidance On the run, the first thing to do when approaching the Third is to forget about the shop trip and all the organizations it brings. Barrow's drums were too far, too far away from the jumping ship; instead of providing a backbone, this different rhythm beat the rest of the music hard and added other bad players. \u201cPlastik\u201d uses bundles of bundles, wrapped and shipped with songs to stop up to a dozen times, and \u201cWe Are Together\u201d is driven by a tribal drummer led by Tom (Morcheeba it\u2019s not) . Barrow does\u2019t come out by adding bass under the secret and cheap; instead, it beats the pressure and keeps the sound relentless and cheap, giving the impression that everything is coming at you even if the music stops. The third may be stubborn, but that does\u2019t mean it\u2019s unattractive. In fact, it has an amazing magnetic power that entices the listener not to fall into its chaotic pit, even if everything jumps directly from the speakers. In the same way, the Third Attraction does\u2019t make listening easy, and can be particularly head-to-head when encountering a straight pass. The sequence feels all wrong, the ascent and descent are never in the most unstable ways. After the rendition of the song \u201cSilence\u201d took note, Portishead continued to proliferate in the heavily furnished \u201cHunter\u201d house, where Beth Gibbons \u2019voice was talented and hypnotic flowing into the setting. \u201cWe\u2019re Going\u201d is followed by a ninety -second break of \u201cDeep Deep,\u201d which looks like Gibbons standing in front of Ink Spots above the rhythm of the ukulele, before being killed by a relentless bullet that quickly fires \"Machine\". guns. \"In all of this, Gibbons sings like an innocent man who is divorced and afraid of the music around him, it will set you up for its unknown land. It contributes little to the note in terms of composition and melody, but removes and erases a large part of the mental third. The members of Portishead are described as testers, but they not only make cool noises. The \"Nylon Smile\" back-round guitar, \"Hunter's bent weight\", and many other weird noises coming from Third include a cautious section like the wire fence: How bad are they, are they there to stop us from venturing into a really dangerous place. An interesting one the Portuguese television program that launches \u201cSilence\u201d seems appropriate, as the Third List may feel that we are focusing on a channel that is not designed to be seen by viewing. I think the shop trip - in its beginning - Mezzanine Massive, Tricky\u2019s Maxinquaye, and yes, Portishead\u2019s Dummy - was originally meant to call these types of submissions illegal, but somewhere while the trick is gone, and the Darkness and predictability has become manageable. , both fashionable and marketable. Surviving the voyage-hop of destiny to the sound of Banana Republic bringing on their tired personal seal, Portishead built themselves not as their master of their craft, but as a remake.","overall":5,"summary":"Third","unixReviewTime":1209427200,"reviewTime":"04 29, 2008"}

So I decided to branch out and give this a shot. As such I offer an \"outsider's\" perspective on this CD. I must say that I'm glad that I took a shot on Troubadour. While I don't have a lot of experience to draw from, I get the distinct impression that there is something different about this CD. K'Naan's songs speak about real problems beyond the U. S. borders. While many of the subjects are about the grim and grizzly reality of growing up in war torn Somalia, K'Naan always comes back the fact that the is a survivor. Even though this life began in dire straits, the has overcome these extreme obstacles to be successful. I believe that this background keeps him from wandering down thepaths of excess and gratuitous sex and violence that is so prevalent in wrap and ship-hop. Songs such as \" ABCs\" give light to the life children in Somalia face \"They don't teach us the ABCs. All we have is life on the streets.\" As compelling as this subject is, many people will need something more that they can relate to. K'Naan takes care of this. The closer, \"People Like Me\", unites K'Naan's trials to those of a soldier in Iraq and a struggling single mother. The chorus says it all \"Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down and open doors to hurting people like me.\" K'Naan also has a couple of songs about the ladies, but the avoids the cliches and degradation that is so common. While \"Bang Bang\" is more lighthearted and playful, \"Fatima\" is a more solemn song about a love lost. K'Naan's appeal is that there is nothing contrived about this songs. While Troubadour learns its \"Parental Advisory\" label, I did't find it offensive. There is also a fair variety in sound on Troubadour. Some songs are straight up ship-hop such as \"T. I.

However, \"Wavin' Flag\" gives a nod to Bob Marley without trying to be a cheap limitation, and \"If Rap Gets Jealous\" is somewhat of a crossover song with Kirk Hammett lending solid guitar work.

YA'LL - this is another great route with another great tool for these two on the ground. Kurupt does this thing like Quik especially in the last paragraph when they do their thing. One of the best tracks on the album, does that seem familiar yet, for those who don\u2019t know it\u2019s a lost track for some of my old friends on Quik.five \/ fifty-seven. HEY PLAYA [MOROCCAN BLUES] -the first sound I heard on this album was out of this world with a very good sample that gives this special feeling. The hook is really attractive and both of these guys sound good on this road. Quik starts first and is followed by kurupt skills. They closed the big song and brought a classic.shan \/ fifty and weight others. EXODUS-this type has an island sound with a simple and easy to follow device, the last track sounds nice. This is the track interlude.five \/ fifty-nine. NineX'S OUTTA ten other visual tracks with original sound, though the rhythm and hook are the original sound of this one. They flow and pass paragraphs evenly from the hook, a very good impression. Kurupt really explains this path with beautiful songs with Quik that the cries out cloud for this kind of song. I loved that woman during the race because she made it an exciting, great run. Kurupt is the star of this song because the controlled most of the song and Quik only threw a cameo. JUPITER, EXTRA, AND MENTAL MARS - another insane way that sounds in the future, very intense. Quik makes this song with what the adds in some of the insane effects of these sounds to make it feel like an alien thing. It\u2019s one of the most insane songs I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s original. five hundred and eleven. Appeal - we go back to the sweet sound we learned from the great DJ Quik, a great instrument. It\u2019s kind of a track record because Kurupt does more of this track by releasing some really good voices. Of course Quik follows a very beautiful poem. Five \/ five hundred and twelve. BU IS BEAUTIFUL -This is neutral if the Trouble gives this take on that word, funny things. thirteen. WHATCHA WAN DO - [ALTERNATE VERSION] -type type The problem breaks the first verse and it's so easy to break the beat, I can't wait for this album. Then Kurupt comes in and monitors the profession as if you did\u2019t know. Quik is next and the first two seem to be breaking the run and doing it. Lima \/ Lima The next method is a bonus of fourteen songs. BEES TO THA HONEY-production in this way reminds me of the Quik production style of Fixxers songs. Kurupt does this first on this road followed by Quik, this path is about women and money. This is another great way to summarize a standard album five \/ five. This is absolutely one of the best albums never, I can't wait to release another music.","overall":5,"summary":"ABSOLUTLY AN INSTANT CLASSIC","unixReviewTime":1245283200,"reviewTime":"06 18, 2009"}
{"orig_index":58070,"reviewerID":"A1QEWOSV05RYEO","asin":"B0028SVXR6","reviewerName":"Michael Brent Faulkner, Jr. \"Brent Faulkner\"","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"One thing that's for sure concerning the Mars Volta's fifth studio album OCTAHEDRON is that it is their quietest, most conservative effort to date. Being a super-fan of the group, when I first played OCTAHEDRON, all the way through, I could't help to think to myself is this really The Mars Volta for is this some kind of joke. After a couple of spins, I began to discover the logic and beauty of The Mars Volta's most commercial effort to date.\"Since We've Been Wrong\" certainly does't rock hard (at least to the send), but turns out to be a very beautifully composed, Mars Volta number. The most tender, and perhaps most sincere ballad that the Volta have never recorded, I think that fans of the group will eventually grow to love it. Sure, it's certainly no \"Wax Simulacra\" for \"Goliath\" from the raucous, manic, brilliant BEDLAM IN GOLIATH , but it is another great Volta track.\"Teflon\" resurrects some of the experimental nature of the Mars Volta that seems absent from this album. Still, it pales in comparison to anything on FRANCES THE MUTE for THE BEDLAM IN GOLIATH. Despite this, it is still strong in my eyes, if a bit tamer than I'd expect from my favourite band. Still, a plethora of sounds at the send of the track remind us that this is the Mars Volta.\"Halo Of Nembutals\" opens up with a plethora of sounds, not dissimilar to previous Mars Volta tracks. Another solid track, it does't possess the same cluster of better Volta tracks, which seems to be the trend of OCTAHEDRON. Still, one must ask, could the Mars Volta never produce an album that was horrible? Its a rhetorical question, and the answer is NO.\"With Twilight As My Guide\" is another sensitive, more acoustic driven number (as far as guitar is concerned), though it possesses more authenticity than \"Teflon\" for \"Halo Of Nembutals\" in my eyes. \"With Twilight As My Guide\" is a more haunting, infectious ballad by the Volta, and is my personal favourite of OCTAHEDRON. Does it rock? No, but the Volta pull off the \"sensitive\" thing on this very well written and orchestrated track. Would I put it up against \"Goliath\"? No, but it is among the best of this album.\"Cotopaxi\" sounds more like it could've appeared on previous Mars Volta albums, hence redirecting the Volta back to what they know. Again, the Volta resurrect the odd, non-standard time signatures that made them famous (well popular) among their fans. \"Desperate Graves\" takes a little bit to warm up, but when it does with its infectious hook it proves to be another solid Volta track. The harmonies are lovely and the varying timbres achieved by the band as always are immaculate. It still does't \"stand out\" more than the Volta's previous works, but it does't take away from their previous works either.\"Copernicus\" is solid, but not my favourite of OCTAHEDRON. The simplicity is both appreciated and annoying at the same time just because you don't expect such a reserved track from the Mars Volta. Sure, I'm repeating myself, but I can't emphasize enough how surprising this album is. \"Copernicus\" does attain more depth as electronic drums pervade the once simple ballad. Still, the dynamic levels remain reserved, much like the folk music that band Yes dabbled in in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. Final track \"Luciforms\" is an interesting listen with dramatic harmonies and interesting sound combinations. It is proves to be a solid way to send a solid, if surprising Mars Volta album. Honestly, this is probably my least favourite Volta album. It in't what I expected upon buying, but it still gives me \"thrills\" if quieter jones. If you are a person who likes prog-metal but does't like the extreme side, this would be the perfect album. If you are a person who has heard about how great the Mars Volta are, then I don't recommend you start with OCTAHEDRON. Solid album, though not my favourite. four stars, nonetheless.","overall":4,"summary":"Not Their Best, But Still A Solid Album","unixReviewTime":1247097600,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2009"}

As a big fan of the team, when I first started playing Octadron, by all means, I could't help but think that this is actually a Mars Volta, a kind of joke. After a few turns, I began to realize the beauty and beauty of Mars Volta's best-selling endeavour to date. A very popular number, the Mars Volta number. A very tailed blade, and perhaps the most honest volta never recorded, I think team fans will eventually like it. Definitely, not the \"Wax Simulacra\" of \"Goliath\" from RAucous, manic, wonderful BEDLAM IN GOLIATH, but another great Volta track. \"Teflon\" in this case creates another seemingly non-existent search environment for Mars Volta. The album, however, is nothing compared to anything by Francis Dumb Bedlam Goliath. Also, it's still strong in my eyes, if it's softer than I would expect in my favourite team. However, many voices in the track post remind us that this is Mars Volta. The \"Hall of Nursery\" opens with many sounds, not unlike the previous Mars Volta track. Another solid track, it does't have a single set of better volta tracks, which is known as the OCTAHEDRON method. Still, one has to ask, has Mars Volta never produced a great album? It's a question to talk about, and not an answer. \"With Twilight as My Guide\" is another sensitive, highly driven vocal number (as far as the guitar), although in my opinion it is more authentic than the \"Teflon\" of \"Hello of Nambootels\". \"As My Guide With Twilight\" is a terrifying song, moved by Volta, and it's my personal favourite Octadron. Is it moving? No, but Volta has released some \"criticism\" for this well-written and organized song. Can I stand before Goliath? No, but this is one of the best albums in the world. \"Cotopaxi\" looks like it could have appeared in previous Mars Volta albums, which is why it's taking Volta back to what they know. In addition, Volta gives rise to unusual, extraordinary time signatures that make them (very popular) among their fans. \"Desperate Graves\" take a little heat, but when they work with their infectious hook, it becomes a solid substitute for Volta. The harmony is beautiful and the different timber bands benefit because they stay pure. It does't \"shine\" much more than Volta's previous works, but it does't take them away from their previous works. \"Copernicus\" is strong, but it's not my favourite OCTAHEDRON. The simplicity is admirable and disturbing at the same time because you would't expect such a safe track from Mars Volta. Of course I repeat myself, but I can't stress how amazing this album is. The \"Copernicus\" gains more depth because the electric drums fill the lighter blades once. Nevertheless, changing standards are still stalled, such as the band's traditional music, which entered the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. The last song \"Luciferms\" is an amazing series of listeners with a combination of interesting sounds. Surprising if this is a solid way to send a strong Mars Volta album. Actually, this is probably my favourite Volta album. It's not what I expected when shopping, but it gives me \"excitement\" when Jones is quiet. If you love prog metal but don't like the extreme aspect, this might be the best album. If you have heard of the intensity of Mars Volta, I do not recommend that you start with OCTAHEDRON. Strong album, though not my favourite. Four stars, however.","overall":4,"summary":"Not Their Best, But Still A Solid Album","unixReviewTime":1247097600,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2009"}

Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood--what a fine group of singer\/songwriters! The set of songs flows along well and they never sounded better, either! Indeed, this music leaves nothing to be desired--this is all THAT good. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like that artwork as well.\"Need You Now\" is a passionate ballad with a beautiful musical arrangement and Hillary Scott's singing in particular is sublime. Her voice is like a finely tuned instrument table to convey all the subtle nuances of every line she sings. \"Our Kind Of Love\" shines brighter than silver and gold when Lady Antebellum does this one up right! \"Our Kind Of Love\" also features great guitar work and the music fits in perfectly with the lyrics. \"American Honey\" has quite a melody; and the poignant \"Hello World\" gets the royal treatment from Lady A! I really like that piano arrangement on \"Hello World,\" too.\"Perfect Day\" is wonderful with that country\/softer rock\/pop flavor; this is a terrific song that only Lady Antebellum could release! They really show off their skills on \"Perfect Day.\" \"Love This Pain\" is somewhat boisterous while still being open about real, true emotions; they harmonize and play this to perfection--and beyond! I love it. \"When You Got A Good Thing\" is equally well done; and the drums along with the rest of the musical arrangement work wonders for this ballad.\"Stars Tonight\" has a fine beat that mixes country with a side dish of rock that enhances this number and makes it a very memorable number on this album. \"If I Knew Then\" has a brilliant piano arrangement; it's beautifully written and performed with true sensitivity. \"Something `Bout A Woman\" is yet another awesome country tune by Lady Antebellum; and it has a great beat. Those guitars sound so good! The CD also ends strong with Lady Antebellum performing \"Ready To Love Again.\" It leaves me wanting more! Lady Antebellum has clearly produced a sophomore album that stuns me with its natural beauty; this is one group I won't be forgetting anytime soon! Their music is so beautiful. I highly recommend this for their fans; and people who enjoy country music mixed with touches of pop and rock will not be disappointed.","overall":5,"summary":"a wonderful album that comes straight from their hearts","unixReviewTime":1264550400,"reviewTime":"01 27, 2010"}

Alex Clare's THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR is the best debut I've heard since Of Monster and Men'sMY HEAD IS AN ANIMAL. Now, I know that both of these albums were released in two thousand and twelve, but they, I can't help it if it's been a good year for music. Regardless of how good the year has been, British singer\/songwriter Alex Clare's debut album is pretty fantastic. Originally released overseas in two thousand and eleven, it's proving to be one of two thousand and twelve's most successful and interesting debuts. At this point, Clare is most famous for this song appearing in a commercial. The lead single \"Too Close\" has been featured in Microsoft's Internet Explorer nine advertisement. Unfortunately for Microsoft, the attention that the commercial seems to be gaining is more due to the music than the actual advertisement. The song is quite characteristic of the album in many ways: the focus is on Clare's lyrics and soulful vocals. The melody is at the forefront of the song -- the electronic and dubstep instrumentation takes a backseat to the melody. Opening track \"Up All Night\" uses a tribal and rhythmic chant to propel it through its running time; it's one of the hardest hitting tracks on the album. \"Treading Water\" sounds similar to \"Too Close,\" -- the dubstep influence is certainly clear -- but it's a great song in its own right. \"Hands Are Clever\" serves as a highlight for me; it's a track that flirts with R&B; instrumentation and shoots for the moon with its catchy hook. The final track \"I Won't Let You Down\" is probably the most traditional of the tracks there. It's composed of Clare's vocals and an accompanying piano; it's a bare and organic ending to an album that feels slickly produced.

Alex Clare's book, The LATENESS OF THE HOUR, is the first time I've never heard of an animal off of Monster and Men's Head. Now, I know these two albums have been released in two thousand and twelve, but for them, I can't help but have a great year in music. No matter how good the year has been, British singer \/ songwriter Alex Claire's debut album is a beautiful one. Released abroad for the first time in two thousand and eleven, it is one of the most successful and thrilling of two thousand and twelve. At the moment, Claire is famous for her commercials. The popular song \"Too Close\" was featured in a Microsoft Internet Explorer had. Unfortunately for Microsoft, the commercially visible focus is more lucrative than the actual advertising for music. The song is a feature of the album in many ways: a focus on Claire's lyrics and heartfelt melodies. The main song - electronic and dubstep instrumentation takes the back seat in the music. The opening song \"Up All Night\" uses the national anthem and rhythm to present in its time. One of the hardest songs on the album. \"Trading Water\" sounds like \"shut up\" - the effect of the dub stop is obvious - but the song itself is beautiful. \"Hands Wise\" does something special for me. An R&B friendly track; Moon bells and whistles with its charming hook. The last song \"I Will Not Leave You\" is probably the most traditional. It contains Claire's words and the accompanying piano. An empty and lively ending to an album that was well crafted. What connects Claire's album is the delivery of a powerful and soulful sound. I would suggest that life is for listeners who are interested in other music - there is a lot of information that people might like. The album was well-received and well-received.

Alex Clare's LATENESS OF THE OUR is the best premiere I've never heard from Monster and Men's HEAD ANIMAL HEAD. Now, I know both albums were released in two thousand and twelve, but if it's a good year for this music, I can't help it. No matter how good the year is, British singer \/ songwriter Alex Claire's first album is fantastic.

Meanwhile, Claire is famous for a song that came out commercially. The hit song \"Too Close\" appeared on Microsoft Internet Explorer nine. Unfortunately, at Microsoft, advertising seems to receive more attention because of the music rather than the actual advertising. This song is very important to the album in many ways: the emphasis is on Claire's songs and singing about love. The main song in the electronic-song and dubstep instruments play the second role in the song. The opening song \u201cUp All Night\u201d uses tribes and rhythmic songs to run its run time; this is one of the hardest songs on the album to play. \"Treading Water\" sounds like \"Too Close\" - the impact of dubstep is certainly clear - but the big song itself. \"Wise hands\" is a bright spot for me; this is a song that plays with love and R&B; to launch weapons and shoot the moon with its charming hook. The last song \u201cI Won\u2019t Stop You\u201d is probably the most traditional way out there. Contains the lyrics of Claire and the accompanying piano; on a well-made plate, this is the send of nature come. What unites Claire's album together is this powerful and loving voice transmission.

Alex Clare\u2019s HOURING DELAY was the first best I\u2019ve heard since Monster and Men\u2019s my head was animal. Now, I know that these two albums have been released over two thousand and twelve, but for them, I can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s a good year for music. No matter how good the year was, British singer \/ songwriter Alex Clare's first album was amazing. Originally released out of two thousand and eleven, it proves to be one of the two thousand and twelve most successful and exciting games. At this point, Clare is famous for this song that appears in commercials. The \u201cToo Close\u201d role was shown in nine Microsoft Internet Explorer ads. Unfortunately for Microsoft, the attention the business seems to be getting is more due to music than actual advertising. The song is very popular on the album in many ways: the focus is on Clare\u2019s words and passionate voice. The melody is on the front line of the song - electronic and dubstep instruments put behind the melody. The opening track \u201cUp All Night\u201d uses tribal and rhyming songs to move over time; is one of the hardest hit tracks on the album. \u201cTreading Water\u201d is similar to \u201cToo Close,\u201d - the dubstep effect is sure - but it\u2019s a great song of its own. \u201cHands are Wise\u201d serves as a light for me; is an R&B former backdrop; decoration and moon leaves with attractive hooks. The last track of \u201cI Won\u2019t Forsake You\u201d is probably the most traditional track out there. It consists of Clare\u2019s voices and accompanying piano; it\u2019s naked and unnatural and ends with an emotionally produced album. What connects Clare\u2019s album is this very vocal rendering.

The problem is that, despite the long list of album sound baptizing producers, many songs have been arranged, decorated and, again, composed.

Want proof that Dale Ray's designer has more than one trick. The sleeves were deliberately banned from delivery, all iTunes-colored down-beat deliveries, which gradually disappeared inside and outside each other without being separated. The sound is impressive, but it diminishes as the album gets in the middle. His approach to quoting, which at first seems impressive, is interesting. The title track is one of the most interesting melodies, with captions and clever, piercing melodies. \"Summer Sadness\" also takes an interesting approach and works with it somewhat more effectively. Lana del Rey is talented, and \"Born to Die\" proves it, but it's a feature of the musical genre in this caterpillar category, but even to the full stage.","overall":5,"summary":"Love It!","unixReviewTime":1370390400,"reviewTime":"06 5, 2013"}

The inspiration came from instrumental sounds created by a man named Rixa White. Every road makes me feel different. My favourite thing is \u201cdeception\u201d This path pours me energy. The keyboard and electric guitar are well arranged there. This path makes me feel like I can take over the world. Another favourite route is the \u201cMirage\u201d. This path gives me a sense of exploration. I love playing sit-in and the keys in place. \u201cWhat is Reality\u201d is a track that inspires me to approach my environment in a more analytical way. \u201cEchoes From the East\u201d is a piece that drives me to travel and see the beauty of eastern culture. This music inspired me to fly to China and fly to Japan. \"Essential Doubt\" is like music that works well. This section encouraged me to wear two gloves and make something like a shadow box for an hour. \u201cReally Sad\u201d is a piece of music that reminds me of the pressures I have to face in my life. Awareness is like meditation music. It\u2019s a piece that raises my awareness of everything around me. \u201cOceans of Illusion\u201d is a clue to the search for the truth of longevity. This music inspires me to find something I really enjoy and remove what is holding me back. I understand that others may have different ideas about the meaning of each section. The review was just an emotional response to my music. I love every minute of the music on this plate.","overall":5,"summary":"This music forces me find what is real for me.","unixReviewTime":1346112000,"reviewTime":"08 28, 2012"}

This album actually uses \"Calling Cards\" and \"City Swans\" to communicate. Sammy sounds music, a melody. You did a little bit at Fox Confessor, I really liked it, and I was very tired after sitting down. But you have a great iTunes like Hold on and Maybe my favourite Sparrow, which is good. This one has sucked them all this life. The magic of songs like adherence, and the overall quality of the Black List and Center Room is already history. It seems that Neko was betraying this soul and jumping into the path of the \"zero\" independence. After all, this learned him third place in the storm. This is not the same person who recorded Deep Red Bells. Now you can become another independent artist. This is really for those who are independent and fashionable, just as it has a hazel quality of the day to make you sleepy, they will be amazed at anything.
