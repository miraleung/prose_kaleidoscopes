Especially in electronic music, there has tended to be a preoccupation with either enormous sonic walls of sound for more minimalist, ambient sounds. Either way, the sound explorations as such tend to be somewhat like a frothy dessert stopping: it has a certain thickness and flavor but it's very easy to dig through. It is not surprising that the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea would be involved in the revival of that original concept. But Radiohead's Thom Yorke, despite a solo release already pointing this way, is another matter. In the opener \"Before Your Very Eyes\", the concept is realized fully with Flea's high toned rhythmic bass playing, similar to a guitar and the heavy percussion playing away. \"Default\" and \"Judge,Jury and Executioner\" bring the often (in the late ninety's anyway) very overused drum 'n bass sound with much more of a fluid and less stiff rhythmic patter. \"Ingenue\" blends a slower funk beat into this early eighty's style electronic \"video game\" style synthesizer pattern that strongly recalls boogie and electro funk. \"Dropped\" and \"Useless\" take the spare, ambient sound Yorke is known for and adds a mild rhythmic kick to it, just below the surface. \"Stuck Together\" and \"Reverse Running\" point back to that fully realized electronica\/funk type groove whereas the closing title track brings the quality of each track together in a full coda as it were. It's been such a long time since I've seen an album produced by an artist known for more stripped down musical productions make music that was so heavily oriented around rhythmic invention. Rather than coming from the source of one individual there,I have the feeling that this is very much the result of a creative synergy between the obviously groovecentric sound of Flea, as a funk\/rock bassist and Thom Yorke's electronic sounds-capes. The send result is not only completely built around rhythmic invention but also a strong sense of instrumental texture that is at the very score of making music percussive and funky in the most Afrocentric sense of the word. I am unsure if any of these artists are intent on expanding in this direction in the future. Even so, this would be a potent new direction in rhythmic funk to contemplate.","overall":5,"summary":"A Very Exciting Rhythic Shock To The Senses","unixReviewTime":1363046400,"reviewTime":"03 12, 2013"}

Instead of being the source of one person out there, I feel that this is mostly designed between Flea's funk \/ rock bassist and Thomas Yorke's electronic soundtrack.

Jim James and Co have always been a fascinating prospect and previous albums such as the monumental \"It still moves\" and the innovative \"Z\" saw them being described as the American equivalent to Radiohead. But whereas Thom Yorke's crew headed off into the room marked \"Experimental\" following the huge success of \"OK Computer\", alternatively MMJ decided to head somewhere nearer the mainstream which led to the spectacle of a bunch of hairy Southern rockers doing lacklustre Prince limitations (\"Highly suspicious\") and faithful live covers of \"Careless Whispers\". It was all going to send in tears and with the release of two thousand and heights generally dire \"Evil Urges\" it allowed cynics the chance to butter a cloud \"I told you so\" despite the fact that it sold rather well. Lets deal with the three aforementioned songs first. The excellent opener \"Victory Dance\" actually has echoes of some of the war themes in P J Harvey's recent \"Let England Shake\" and is a broody powerful song that starts with a military coda and is driven by a sinister bass to an explosive conclusion. It is followed by the epic title track underpinned by a fantastic Jim James vocal namely the seven minute plus \"Circuital\" which will has already brought the house down at their explosive live concerts (check out all the new songs from a live concert performed at the Louisville Palace on the \"Troubled Souls Unite\" blog). It is classic MMJ with a slightly \"Creep\" like opening vibe but which builds into a huge rocking beast and would have sat very happily on \"Z\". Finally the funky \"Holdin on to Black Metal\" starts with an exuberant chorus from the Black Metal Girls made up of female singers from their home town where at last a homage to Prince gets it right. Equally its great to see a rock band table to play live and hold their own with funky singers such as Erykah Badu. The slight problem is that nothing which follows is quite as good as the above, not that that \"Circuital\" is without its merits. For instance the concluding piano ballad \"Movin Away\" is a classy Jim James salt country heartbreaker which the has specialized in since the bands great \"At dawn\" album. \"First light\" is a nice rocker although let down by some terrible lyrics and \"You wanna freak out\" is a potential pop anthem. The self descriptive \"Slow Slow tune\" however barely gets out of the starting blocks while \"The day is coming\" becomes quite repetitive on repeated listens. Equally the sequencing of the album sometimes feels out of kilter with the lovely ballad \"Wonderful (the way I feel)\" sandwiched between two of the weakest songs on the album the previously mentioned \"Day is coming\" and rather silly sub Beach Boys of \"Outta my system\" on which the jury is still out. The good news overall is that this album is much closer to \"Z\" than its \"evil\" predecessor and on the evidence of live performances takes on an additional dimension in an already blistering concert act where My Morning Jacket find their true expression. \"Circuital\" sees this band take a step back and reassess from a rather large misstep and in broad terms it's a much happier outcome.

Jim James and Co have always been interested, and previous albums, such as the monument \"Still Moving\" and the new \"Z\", have stated that they are equal to the American version of Radiohead. However, although Thom Yorke's staff entered the room labeled \"Test\" after the great success of \"OK Computer\", MMJ decided to move closer to the most common, which led to a group of rock-bottom rock musicians who made the absence of the Prince's (\"very suspicious\") and the reliability of the \u201ctireless work\u201d live cover. All of this will make people burst into tears, and the release of the two thousand and the \u201chorrible horror\u201d in general, gives critics a chance to \u201ctell you\u201d, even though it sells well. Let's look at three of the songs mentioned earlier. The excellent opening song \"Dance of Victory\" emphasizes some of the themes of the war in the recent PJ Harvey \"Let England Move\". Followed by a songwriting song, backed by Jim James' stunning voice, which is seven minutes long with \"Circuital\", which will tear down the house down to their explosive concert (see Making a Live Concert All New Songs by Louisville Palace on \"The Troubles of Souls of Unity\" blog). The classic MMJ, the opening environment is a little \"crawling\", but it's a big snake, and will be happy to stay in the \"Z\". Finally, the fashion \u201cAdherence to the Black Iron Man\u201d began with a lively Black Girls \u2019song composed by female musicians from her hometown, and finally in honor of Prince. It is a great pleasure to see the band of the rock band play live with leading musicians such as Erykah Badu and keep their style. The small problem is that none of the following is as good as the one above, it does not mean that the \"Circuit\" has no resources. For example, the piano ballad ending \"Movin Away\" is the praises of Jim James of a salty country, focusing on the band's \"Dawn\" stadium. \"The First Light\" is a good rock singer, although some bad words are dancing, and \"You Want to Get Out\" is a potential song. However, the \"slow music\" that you described yourself did not come out in the first place, and \"this day is coming\" became a very repetitive one if you listened regularly. Similarly, an album order can sometimes feel inconsistent. out. Overall, the good news is that the album is closer to \"Z\" than never before, \"and proof of its effectiveness shows even more in the already hot concert games.

Jim James and company have good prospects, describing previous albums such as \"It's Still Running\" and \"New\" Z as the American equivalent of Radiohead. Afterwards the went to the room labeled \"experimental\", otherwise MMJ decided to go closer to normal which led to a lot of southern hairdressers becoming princes (\"very suspicious\") and \"career whispers\". Reliable Live Core. Everything is sent with tears and with the release of two thousand and its height which is often the worst \"bad advocacy\" gives critics a chance to cloud \"I tell you\" although it is good Let's first consider the three songs listed above. The great opening game \"Victory Dance\" is actually a clash of themes in PJ Harvey's recent \"Late England Shake\" and is a powerful dental song that begins with Fuji Koda. Is followed by a bad bass at the explosive send, followed by a popular musical song backed by Jim James' seven-minute voice and \"Circuit\" which has just hit this home. Will be performing in this explosive concerts (check out all the new songs from Louisville Palace \"blog. The old MMJ is a bit like opening a vibe with \"Crepe\" but a huge moving monster and can have a great time in \"Z\". It's just as good to watch a rock band table for playing and catching live. With funky artists like Erica Badoo. The simple problem is that nothing is as good as the above, not that there is nothing good in the \"circuit\". For example, in Away, which ends with the piano ballad \"Mo\", is \"Jim James\" the best of the world's salty hearts that the world has launched since this great \"Morning\" albums. \"First Light\" is a fun swing. Although it has been dropped down with some awesome melodies and a possible pop song \"You Want to Panic\". I repeat a bit. The sequence of the album sequence sometimes seems like it's not out with the beautiful song \"Perfect (How I Feel\") between the two weaker songs on the already mentioned album \"Day Coming\". Comes out of my program \"while the judge is still alive. The good news is that the album is closer to \"Z\" than never before and in live performances it takes on another element of the already disturbing concert action where My Morning Jacket finds the truth.

Equally the sequencing of the album sometimes feels out of kilter with the lovely ballad \"Wonderful (the way I feel)\" sandwiched between two of the weakest songs on the album the previously mentioned \"Day is coming\" and rather silly sub Beach Boys of \"Outta my system\" on which the jury is still out.

Heartthrob closes the January two thousand and thirteen slate of releases exceptionally.\"Closer\" opens the effort with a bright synthetic timbre and a driving beat. Tegan and Sara deliver solid, commanding vocals that are well produced. The songwriting is notable, particularly the chorus: \"It's not just all physical \/ I'm the type who won't get pooh so critical \/ so let's make things physical \/ I won't treat you like you're pooh so typical\". New wave influence continues to show on \"Goodbye Goodbye\", another crisply produced affair.

Tegan and Sara are three for three.\"I'm Not Your Hero\" sports an anthemic pop chorus, continuing lyrics based on romantic themes and the desires of love. \"Drove Me Wild\" is better, camping up the heights styling. Tegan and Sara's vocal approach is perfect, with the duo singing things staccato and in distinct fashion. Catchy and well written, \"Drove Me Wild\" is a standout cut. \"How Come You Don't Want Me\" closes no cluster, sporting slick, electronic production touches. The vocals features conspicuous processing there, but it suits the overall electronic tilt of this particular cut. The rhythmic nature of the vocals is a selling point. \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" epitomizes heights pop given an archetypical quick tempo and sound. Like its contemporaries, \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" is consistent and enjoyable. No misses for Tegan and Sara as of yet. The final three cuts don't close their 'oomph'. \"Love They Say\" may be a shade less compelling than the rest, but not by much. \"Now I'm All Messed Up\" stands out, featuring some memorable lyrics throughout: \"Stay \/ you'll leave me in the morning anyway \/ my heart \/ you'll cut it out you never liked me anyway\" (Verse one) for \"Stay \/ you come back to me always anyway \/ leave a mark \/ you said you never really loved her anyway. \" (Verse two).

When I first saw the video to Anastacia's debut single I'm Outta Love in September two thousand, I instantly began looking for flaws. I did't like her voice, the way she dressed and that darn song. yet it was kinda catchy, was't it?! Over time she grew on me and it was with the single Not That Kind that made me buy this album. Well I have to say that this is one of the most mature, catchy and accomplished debut albums I have never heard. The album went on to sell inexcess of six million copies worldwide and contains four massive worldwide hits. Not That Kind begins with the album's title track, Not That Kind (ten\/ten). This song has an amazing bassline with some brilliant girl-power lyrics and catchy, melodic beats. Anastacia's voice is so powerful, even in the verses where the song is a lot more low-lying than at the choruses. This song was the second single to be taken from Not That Kind in February two thousand and one, where it peaked at No.eleven in the UK. Track two is I'm Outta Love (ten\/ten). This is without a doubt Anastacia's most famous song to date. Her debut single, it peaked at No.six in the UK in September two thousand, stayed in the Top ten for months and was No.one all over Europe. The bassline is incredibly catchy and the lyrics are more of the same with Not That Kind; girl-power to the max! Track three is Cowboys & Kisses (nine\/ten). This was the third single to be taken from Not That Kind in May two thousand and one and peaked at a slowly No.twenty-nine in the UK. The video is not very memorable - I don't even think I can remember what happens in it! The song however is a more indie-rock song with superb guitars and various instruments. Track four is Who's Gonna Stop The Rain (nine\/ten). Like I mentioned on my review of Freak Of Nature (Anastacia's second album), every Anastacia album has the power ballad - for Not That Kind, it's Who's Gonna Stop The Rain. The beats along with the lyrics are incredibly powerful, while Anastacia's voice is on top-form again. Track five is Love Is Alive (ten\/ten). This is definitely the best song on the album. well, for me anyway. This is just such a catchy song with a superb bassline and electrifying vocals from the girl with the big voice. I just love the verses and the bridges - top class song from Anastacia! Track six is I Ask Of You (nine\/ten). This is another excellent ballad from Anastacia - one of the best on the album. That's about it! Track seven is Wishing Well (ten\/ten). A lot of people think this song is rubbish, but I love it. The song is very simple lyrics wise - they're easy to learn because they're quick and fast. Not That Kind continues with the superb Made For Lovin' You (ten\/ten). The fourth and final single to be taken from Not That Kind, this song only just peaked inside the Top thirty in the UK, which is a shame because it really is a superb pop song. The lyrics are a bit simple, yet the trademark funky bassline and Anastacia's gravely vocals make up for it. Track nine is Black Roses (ten\/ten). This is another brilliant ballad from Anastacia who sounds a lot like Tina Turner on this song. Track ten is Yo Trippin' (ten\/ten). This song has a superb blend of R'n'B and more importantly, soul! It comes as a great welcome considering most of the album is full of ballads. Track eleven is One More Chance (eight\/ten). This is yet another (zzzzzzz. ) slow smoochy ballad from Anastacia. This is basically a repeat of every other single ballad on Not That Kind. Track twelve is Same Old Story (nine\/ten). This is a great song to close this amazing album - it's different to every other song on the album. The lyrics are catchy and follow a certain pattern while, as the song ends, a gospel choir enters and warble away to their heart's content. Not the best song on the album, but a superb one to close it! OVERALL GRADE: nine\/tenFrom other customer's reviews of Not That Kind, I think I can safely say without any hesitation that this album is excellent - and that Anastacia is even more brilliant! If you've heard all the singles taken from Not That Kind (how could you not?!), then I strongly suggest to you buy it now from Amazon!","overall":5,"summary":"A World Class Debut Album","unixReviewTime":1051315200,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2003"}

In September two thousand, when I saw the first video of Anastacia single out Outta Love for the first time, I immediately began to look for flaws. I don't like her voice, her dress and this angry song. But it\u2019s kind of attractive, in\u2019t it? ! As time went on, the became more and more interested in me, and it was not the Single One who made me buy this album. Well, I have to say, this is one of the first ripe, attractive and successful albums I have never heard of. The album continues to sell more than six million copies worldwide and contains four world hits. It is not the type that starts with the title track of the album is not the type (Ten \/ ten). The song has an amazing lineup, some powerful girl songs and interesting musical songs. Anastacia's voice is powerful, in verses much lower in song than in chorus. This song is the second single by Not That Kind in February two thousand and one, which is ranked eleventh in the UK. The second track is Outta Love (ten \/ ten). Without a doubt, this is one of Anastasia's most famous songs to date. Her first single was ranked sixth in the UK in September two thousand, and she has been in the top ten for consecutive months, number one in Europe. The bass line is catchy, the songs are more similar Not that way; the power of the girl is overused! The third track is Cowboys and Kisses (nine\/ten). This is the third single to be taken from Not That Kind in May two thousand and one, and slowly reached number twenty-nine in the UK. The video is not very memorable - I don't even remember what happened inside! However, this song is an indie song with beautiful guitar and various instruments. The fourth line is Who Will Stop the Rain (nine\/ten). As I mentioned in my study Freak Of Nature (second album Anastacia), every Anastacia album has power ballads \u2014 Not that kind of, who will stop the brain. The hats that go with the lyrics are very strong, and Anastasia\u2019s voice is on the floor again. Track five is the love of life (ten \/ ten). This is definitely the best song on the album. Well, to me that's right. This song is interesting with a high bass line and a singing voice from a girl with a big voice. I just love the verses and bridges - the top songs from Anastacia! Following the sixth track please (nine\/ten). This is an excellent ballad from Anastacia - one of the best ballads on the album. That's it! Tracking seven is a desire (ten \/ ten). A lot of people think this song is a waste, but I love it. The lyrics of this song are very simple - easy to read because they are fast. Not the only one that continues to use the outstanding made for Lovin 'You (Ten \/ ten). The fourth and last single from the genre, the song has reached the top of the top thirty in the UK, which is a shame, because it is the best song never. The lyrics are simple, but the iconic funky bass and the deep singing of Anastacia do it for you. This ninth song - Black Rose (ten \/ ten). This is one of the most amazing ballad from Anastacia, which sounds very much like Tina Turner in this song. The tenth song is Yo Trippin '(ten \/ ten). This song combines R'n'B with the most important soul! Considering that much of the album's content is full of traditional songs, this is very popular. The eleventh line is another opportunity (eight \/ ten). This is another (zzzzzzzz.) Slow and gloomy ballad from Anastacia. This is basically a duplication of all other ballads in Not That Kind. Tracing twelve is the same old story (nine\/ten). This is a wonderful song to send this amazing album - unlike other songs on the album. The lyrics are lovely and follow a certain pattern, and as the song ends, the gospel choir enters and shakes their hearts. Not the best song on the album, but the fun song that ended it! Total rating: nine\/ten From some Not kind customer reviews, I think I can say without a doubt that this album is good - Anastacia is the best! If you've heard all the singles of Not That Kind (can't you listen ?!), then I suggest you buy it on Amazon now!","overall":5,"summary":"A World Class Debut Album","unixReviewTime":1051315200,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2003"}

When I first saw this video in September at Anastasia's Single IM Outlaw in two thousand, I immediately. Started searching for errors. I did't like her voice, the way she got dressed and she sang dirty. It looked good though, did't it ?! Eventually the grew up around me and there was no one who forced me to buy this album. I have to say that this is one of the most mature, solid and complete albums I've never heard. The album has sold six million copies worldwide and contains four of the world's greatest songs. Not That Kind begins with the album's title track, Not That Kind (ten \/ ten). The song has an amazing baseline with powerful girls songs and beautiful songs. Anastasia's voice is very powerful, even in verses where the singing is less than the course. The song was the second and the second to hit the Notebook on February one, when it peaked at number eleven in the UK. The second track is Outa Lo (ten \/ ten). It is arguably the most famous anastasia song to date. Her first single partner, who joined the number six in the UK in September two thousand, remained in the top ten for months and became none other in Europe. The baseline is incredibly attractive and the lyrics are almost identical. That maximizes the girl's power! The third track is Cowboys and Kisses (nine \/ ten). It was the third single to be taken from the Note two on May two and one and reached at least twenty-nine in the UK. This video is unforgettable - I don't even remember what happened to it! However, the song is an indie rock song with beautiful guitar and various instruments. Track Four Says Who Stops the Rain (Nine \/ Ten) As I mentioned in my review of Freak of Nature (Anastasia's second album), each Anastasia album has a power ballad - Not That Sugar, by Who is stopping the brain? Beats and sounds are very powerful, and the sound of anaesthesia is also high. The fifth track Love Is Alive (Ten \/ Ten) is definitely the best song on the album. Anyway, for me it's just an attractive song with a beautiful bass line and a powerful voice of a cloud girl. I just like the verses and the bridge - a high quality song of Anastasia! The sixth track says I'm asking you (nine \/ ten). It's one of Anastasia's best songs - one of the best on the album. that's it! Seven-track wishful thinking (ten \/ ten). A lot of people think this song is trash, but I like it. Singing is very simple and wise words - they are easy to learn because they are fast and fast. Not the kind of continuity that stands for Lovin 'You. From the fourth and final hit single Not Not Kind, the song has just entered the top thirty in the UK, which is a shame because it is a very good pop song. The words are a bit simple, but the sweet baseline trademark and powerful voice of Anastasia do it for themselves. The ninth track is Black Rose (ten \/ ten). This is another bright ball of Anastasia that looks a lot like Tina Turner in this song. The tenth track is Yo Trippin '(ten \/ ten). This song is a perfect combination of R'n'B and most importantly, soul! This comes as a good welcome when it is considered that most of the album is full of songs. Eleventh track is another opportunity (eight \/ ten) This is another. This is basically a repetition of all the other singles in Note The Cond. Twelve tracks is the same old story (nine \/ ten). It's a great song to close this amazing album - it's different from the other songs on this album. The lyrics are catchy and follow a special pattern, when at the send of the song, a gospel choir enters and contrasts with the contents of their hearts. Not the best song on the album, but great to close! From other Not Not Kind customer reviews, I think I can safely say without a doubt that this album is great - and that Anastacia is so smart! If you've heard all the songs from Not That Sugar (How Can You Do It?), I suggest you buy it on Amazon!","overall":5,"summary":"A World Class Debut Album","unixReviewTime":1051315200,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2003"}

The first time I watched Anastacia\u2019s first video I was Outta Love alone was in September two thousand, and I immediately started looking for flaws. I did\u2019t like her voice, the way she dressed and that song. again it's glamorous, in't it ?! After a while the grew up with me and the just was\u2019t that kind of make me buy this album. So I have to say that this is one of the most calm, catchy and complete first albums I have never heard. The album went on to sell six million copies worldwide and comprised four major hits worldwide. Other than that, it starts with the title track, Not That Type (ten \/ ten). This song has an amazing bassline with some beautiful power girl songs and enticing beats. Anastacia\u2019s voice is very strong, even though the verses of the song are lower than the songs. This song is the second song from Not That Kind in February two thousand and one, where it stopped No.eleven in the UK. The second clue is External Love (ten \/ ten). This is without a doubt Anastacia\u2019s most popular song to date. In its first place, it was the top No.six in the United Kingdom at two thousand in September, it was in the top ten for months and became None across Europe. Bassline can be very catchy and the words are identical. girl-strength to the maximum! The third search is Cowboys & Kisses (nine \/ ten). This is the third taken from Not That Kind in May at two thousand and one and the highest is No. Twenty -nine in the UK. The video is memorable - I don\u2019t think I remember what\u2019s in it! However the song is an indie-rock song with great guitar and various instruments. The fourth track is who will stop the brain (nine \/ ten). As I mentioned in my review of Freak Of Nature (Anastacia\u2019s second album), every Anastacia album has a power limit - moreover, it\u2019s One That Stops Rain. The beats and songs are very strong, while Anastacia\u2019s voice is once again in high form. The fifth clue is Living Love (ten \/ ten). This is definitely the best song on the album. well, for me it's still a charming song with great bassline and sound coming from a girl with a big voice. I just love the verses and the bridge - great Anastacia song! The sixth track is I Ask You. This is another great post from Anastacia - one of the best on the album. That's about it! Chasing seven is good - ten (ten). A lot of people think this trash is song, but I like it. The song is a very easy and clever word - it is easy to learn because it is fast and quick. Not that kind of going to a high level made for Lovin \u2019You (ten \/ ten). The fourth last pick from that genre in\u2019t, this song is only in the top thirty countries in the UK, which is a shame because it\u2019s actually a popular pop song. The words are pretty simple, but Anastacia\u2019s iconic logo and heavy sound make up. Traces of nine are Black (ten \/ ten). This is another amazing song from Anastacia that is very similar to Tina Turner in this song. Finding ten is Yo Trippin '(ten \/ ten). This song has more of an R\u2019n\u2019B mix, soul! It has a huge reception considering most albums are full of expands. The eleventh path is another opportunity (eighteen). It\u2019s still a (zzzzzzz.) Slow -moving wolf from Anastacia. Usually it is any repetition of any baldness other than that Type. The twelfth passage is the Old Story (nineteenth). This is a great song to close on this amazing album - it\u2019s different from any other song on the album. The lyrics are enticing and follow a specific style in which, when the song is over, the group of gospel singers enter and continue to pour into their hearts. It's not the best song on the album, but great close up! OVERVIEW: nine \/ ten When other clients look at something other than that, I think I can safely say without a doubt that this album is great - and Anastacia is even brighter! If you\u2019ve heard all those solos from Type A (how could you not ?!), then I force you to buy them now on Amazon!","overall":5,"summary":"A World Class Debut Album","unixReviewTime":1051315200,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2003"}

Buisman \"Martijn Buisman\"","helpful":[2,4],"reviewText":"Where Nirvana was the prologue, Weezer was the start of my interest in music. I grew up in a town called Groningen in the north of Holland. When I was fifteen I spend most of my days listening to either the local radio stations for the alternative music shows late at night. I heard the first Weezer songs there. When the magazine of the legendary Vera club put the album on the top of their charts it really started coming. I had the song on a tape and listened to it all day. Besides 'Orange' by the Blues Explosion and 'crooked brain' there is no album I have to listened to more than Weezers debut album. There is not a bad track on the album. Starting off with 'My Name Is Jonas' Banging on the drums and the powerchords, singing along with \"The Workers Are Going Home\" with the great acoustic intro and outdo.\"No One Else\" is the first nerd song, about the singer only wanting the girl for himself, afraid to close him. For someone who is fifteen the uncertainty, dreams and weird interest and social awkwardness are so well expressed in all the songs. The feeling of solitude after a break-up can be felt the best in the downbeat song 'The World has Turned and left me there', perhaps the best and most mature song on the album. That 'Weezer' maybe the teenage album of the ninety's is also thanks to track four, the now classic 'Buddy Holly'. Who does't want to be a star, a star like Buddy Holly. Besides the lyric it's also the song you can using along with the easiest. And the little nine stone break is a stroke of genius, as is the little difference in factors that follows it and leads in the send of the song. An easy picking guitar and some voices lead in 'Undone', also a great song. Teenage fun starts with 'Surfwax America', It has a thumping verse but the melody really starts in the chorus. The melody changes somewhat when the singer starts feeling the undertow and the is afraid the will never grow old. A great middle part with just voices and some keyboards repeats the never grow old part. But it ends well after all. I never liked 'Say it main't so' so I won't talk about that songThe funniest song must be 'In The Garage' the neediest song of all. Dungeon Master, Kiss etc. However, the theme of teenage awkwardness pops up again. 'In the garage, i feel safe, no one cares about my ways, in the garage where i belong no one hears me using this song''Holiday' can be a song about spring break, however it is not about a booked holiday in a hotel. To me it always meant to freedom of just going away when you felt like it. The album ends with the long and musically most interesting 'Only In Dreams', about the boy not getting the girl. Maybe now twelve, five years after it was released do I really realize how great this album still is. Weezer still make good albums but none of them has reached the overall standard of their debut which I really think it was on the best debut albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety. Their follow-up 'Pinkerton' was certainly not bad but sounded a little scrapper. Every guitar on each song might make this album seem monotone but it's how it was meant. Also the order of the song is perfect, no wonder that when they first toured Europe they played this album from track one to ten in that order. A classic, a real real classic.","overall":5,"summary":"Top 10 of the 1990s","unixReviewTime":1136073600,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2006"}

I grew up in Groningen, a small town in the north of the Netherlands. When I was fifteen, I spent many nights listening to music on local radio stations. I heard the first Weezer song there. When the popular magazine Vera Club put the album at the top of their charts, it began to appear. I put this song on tape and listened to it all day. With the exception of Blues Explosion's \"Orange\" and \"Crooked Brain\", no album deserves more attention than Weezers' debut album. There is no bad long track on the album. Starting with \"My name is Jonas\", beat drums and songs, using with \"Workers Back Home\", with the first sound of music introducing and reaching. \"No One Else\" is the nerd's first song, only for the singer who wants to be a girl who is afraid to approach him. For a fifteen-year-old child, all songs are a beautiful expression of uncertainty, dreams, strange interest and shame in society. Loneliness after divorce may sound better on the hopeless song \"The world has turned away from me\", perhaps the most beautiful and mature song on the album. 'Weezer' could be a teenage album in the ninetys and is also called the fourth song, now a classic 'Buddy Holly'. Who does\u2019t want to be a star, a star like Buddy Holly. In addition to the songs, it is also a simple song that you can use. And the Xiao Nine Break Break is a brilliant genius, with its backgrounds and minimal variations in song distribution. A simple guitar and some lyrics lead to \"Undone\", which is also a beautiful song. Teen fun begins with \"Surfwax America\", which has a beat verse, but a fun song starts with a song. When the musician began to feel the electric waves, the song changed a little, I'm afraid it won't wear out. A nice central section, only sound and other keyboards replicating a place that has never been older. But it ended well. I don't like the \"Say it does't happen\" thing, so I'm not going to talk about this song. The most interesting song should be the most desired song \"In the Garage\". Lord of the pit, may I always. However, the topic of youthful shyness resurfaced. \"In the garage, I feel safe. Nobody cares about my way. In the garage I'm in, no one can hear me using this song.\" \"Holiday\" may be a song about spring break, but it does not mention Book a hotel for the holidays. To me, it always means the freedom to leave if you like it. The album ends with \"Only Dreams\", the most interesting in music, about boys who can't find girls. Maybe after being released for twelve for five years, I\u2019ve noticed that this album is still visible. Weezer has still produced some great albums, but none of them have achieved the quality of their first album. I think this is the first great album of one, nine hundred and ninety. Their pursuit of \"Pinkerton\" is certainly good, but it sounds like nonsense. Every guitar in each song can make this album look interesting, but that\u2019s what it means. And the order of the song is perfect, it is not surprising that they played the record in the first to tenth order when they went to Europe on their first tour. Classics, classic classics.","overall":5,"summary":"Top 10 of the 1990s","unixReviewTime":1136073600,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2006"}

Starting with 'My name is Jonas' and baking in drums and strings, the sings \"The Workers Home Going\" with a great vocal and external introduction. \"No One Else\" is the first song of the idiot, about a singer who just wants this girlfriend, afraid to shut it down. Uncertainty, strange dreams and aspirations and social difficulties for a fifteen year old man are well described in all the songs. The feeling of being alone after a break may sound best in the hit song 'The World Has Turned Me Down There', perhaps the best and strongest song on the album. That 'Weisser' is probably a ninety's youth album, thanks to a four-song track, the old 'Buddy Holly'. Who does't want to be a star, a star like Buddy Holly. In addition to the song, it is also a song that you can use and simple. And the Ninth Stone Break is a masterpiece, as there is a slight difference between the things that follow in the delivery of the song. Simple Chen guitars and other melodies lead to 'Kaldam' and a beautiful song. Young people's fun begins with 'Surf Wax America', it has a charming verse but the music really starts in the music. Music changes in a certain way when the artist begins to feel the work and is afraid that it will grow old. In beautiful words only words and some keyboards repeat the part that never went bad. But it ends well. I never liked to say \"this is not to say\" basement master, kisses etc. However, the subject of unhappiness of the youth is emerging. 'In the garage, I feel safe, no one cares about my ways, no one in the garage where I live listens to me use this song. To me it always means just leave when you feel like it.

It's been twelve, five years since I was released and I can really see how big this album is. Weiss made some great albums but none of them reached the full level of this first film which I think was one thousand, nine and ninety best albums.

Come on, yeah sure these guys, what with all that fake tough-guy image, and when swearing became a serious 'prop' and nothing else, well, yeah, they suck, but I put to you just two songs, two songs, 'The One' and 'Hold On'. Okay, so they're droopy ballads, but they! 'The One' is one of the best ballad tracks I've heard since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety! It is simply fantastic. How can you say these guys suck? I put it to you, neither Korn, Rage against the machine for Linkin Park for any of their contemporaries, none of which get as bashed as much as these guys, could cut a song like that! Sure, Rage rock heaps, they are generally a better band than Limp, but they can't construct such an impressive piece of melodic pop, and the others karen't even worth talking about, in my opinion. Well, yeah, all the mean attitude and swearing and toughness grates after a while, how many times do you want to listen to someone tell you they're gonna bash you? And how true is this so-called angst anyway? I don't think Fred Durst has never been put on suicide watch. Actually, the thought of it is laughable. Fred Durst on suicide watch! Ha Ha!! He need \"braggin' 'bout my big money\" watch! But aside from all that, well, this album is kind of good. This band REALLY know how to play down a groove (yes, it had to be capitals). After the obligatory 'intro' the album begins with 'Hot Dog'. I actually like this song, that chorus CRANKS, man! Sure it needs better lyrics, but that bit about 'everybody knows this song' has a kind of eerie Middle-Eastern feeling to it, and, as I said, the chorus really pumps. It's followed by a couple of predictable heavy, tough acting songs, like 'My generation' and 'Full Nelson'. However, the second half of the album is surprisingly mellow and there are some great songs in there, actually. The aforementioned 'The One' is a poppy-ballad that ends with some cloud distortion, it kind of blends ballad, R&B;, rock, etc. and is simply a fantastic song. 'Hold on' is another excellent ballad. It features Scott Weiland on vocals, but sounds like a across between Crosby Stills and Nash with The Moody Blues, seriously! It's an excellent song. Then there's the hit, 'Take a look around', a more traditional LB song. This song is. excellent! Sure, it trips off 'Guerilla Radio' but it's still an excellent song. The lyrics this time are kind of deep, with the catch-line 'now I know why you want to hate me, because hate is all the world has even seen lately'. It's the sought of insightful lyric unique to Limp Bizkit. Then 'It'll be okay' is a very powerful break-up song, with emotive lyrics like 'If their's a better place you can take me, Better life you can give me. Whatever place I can start all over. And I would never need what you gave me.' But the song would benefit from having the 'F***ing up my whole life' part removed. Boiler is also a good song; eerie and deals with the sought of frustration Limp Bizkit usually sings about, without going over the top. Unfortunately, there is too much weak material and miss-steps to consider giving this a high-rating. However, a deeper insight reveals a band full of talent and potential that is unfortunately going down the wrong path, but with a few gems to remind us of what could have been.

Another great lyric, it sounds like Scotland, but it sounds like a across between Crosby Steels and Nash and The Moody Blues! Great song Then there's the song, 'Look Around', a traditional LB song. The song says Very good! Sure, it removes the guerrilla radio, but it's still a great song. The words are very deep at this point, with the catch line 'Now I know why you want to hate me, because the whole world has seen hatred lately'. Want a song with a different understanding from Lamp Buzzet. And then 'It's OK' is a very powerful split song, with melodies that feel like 'If it were a better place to pick me up, you could give me a better life. Anyone can start anywhere. And I will never need you to give it to me. But this song will benefit from removing the 'F *** up up my whole life' section. Boiler is also a good song. Eri also deals with the demand for frustration. Unfortunately, there are very weak structures and a black of thinking to give it a higher status. However, a deeper understanding reveals a group full of skill and energy that can unfortunately go astray, but with a few gems that remind us of what it will be like.

Come on, yes, these people, tough images of the deceiver, when the curse becomes a deep \"support\" and nothing else, yes, bad, but I give you only two songs, two songs, \"That\" and \"Endure\". Well, they throw away the ball, but they don't! 'That' is one of the best balloons I've never heard since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety! This is awesome. How can you tell if these people are breastfeeding? Let me tell you that, no matter how angry Korn for Rage is on any Lincoln Park machine of their time, none of them are as beaten as these people can using such a song! Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me. Yes, yes, after a while, all bad feelings, insults, and harshness will be gone. How often do you want to hear someone say that you are going to be beaten? In what case, how true is this so-called depression? I don't think Fred Durst was never put under arrest for suicide. After all, it's funny when you think about it. Fred Durst is contemplating suicide! Ha cha! ! Want to \u201cbrag about my big money\u201d watch! But other than that, this album is not good. This group knows how to play music (yes, it should be capitalized). After a compulsory \"introduction\", the disc begins with a \"hot dog\". I love this song, that chorus crank, man! Yes it wants better words, but the article about \"everyone knows this song\" has a very Eastern feeling, and, as I said, the choir is excited. A number of predictable and difficult music tracks have been followed, such as \"My Generation\" and \"The Complete Nelson\". However, the second half of the album is amazingly around, with some really cool songs. The aforementioned \"One\" is a poppy music song that ends in a twist. It combines traditional songs, R&B, rock, etc., and that's just fun. \"Perseverance\" is another excellent ballad. Its lead singer is Scott Weiland, but it sounds like a across between Crosby Stiles and Nash and Moody Bruce, deep! This is a beautiful song. Then there is the instrumental song \"Look Around\", which is a traditional LB song. This is the song. awesome! Yes it has been released by \"Guerilla Radio\", but it is still a great song. At this point the lyrics of the music are profound, with the motto \"Now I know why you hate me, because hate is seen all over the world lately.\" These are meaningful words that are different from Limp Bizkit. And 'The Righteous' is a very powerful song that breaks up, moving words, such as' If it is a good place to take me, the best life you can give me. I never needed what you gave me. But this song will benefit you by removing \"F *** king up my life\". Boiler is a good song; Limp Bizkit always sings, but not so much. Unfortunately, there are so many weak points and wrong steps to think about by giving high scores. However, a deeper understanding has revealed that a team full of talent and potential unfortunately has gone the wrong way, but there are other values that remind us of what is possible.

So, so they\u2019re rough expansions, but they are! \u2018The One\u2019 is one of the best songs heard since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety! Very good. How can you tell that these men suck? I put you, Korn one, Anger against the Linkin Park machine one of their teammates, and none of them fell like those guys, I can\u2019t break that song! Sure, Angry Piles, they\u2019re generally a better group than Limp, but they don\u2019t make a very impressive pop-melodic piece, the others karen\u2019t worth talking about either, I think to. So, yes, all those meaningful behavior and swearing and followers will show up over time, how many times would you like to listen to someone tell you they\u2019re going to kill you? And how true is the so -called danger still? I don\u2019t think Fred Durst came in at the time of the suicide. In fact, that idea is ridiculous. Fred Durst is watching the suicide bombing! Haa Haa !! He has to \u201cbrag\u201d about my big money \u201cwatching! But other than that, well, this album is a good type. This band really knows how to play space (yes, it has to be capitals). After the obligatory \u2018intro\u2019 the album starts with \u2018Hot Dog.\u2019 I really like this song, chorus CRANKS, man! It definitely needs better songs, but it\u2019s a bit about \u2018everyone knows this song\u2019 it says some kind of awful feeling in the Middle East, and, like I said, the chorus is really bombastic. There are some heavy and unpredictable songs, like \u2018My Generation\u2019 and \u2018Full Nelson.\u2019 However, the second half of the album is surprisingly thin and there are a lot of great songs there, really. 'a combination of ballads, R&B ;, rock a, etc. is a very good song.' Hold on 'is another great that promise. It features the sounds of Scott Wei land, but it looks like one between Crosby Stills and Nash along with The Moody Blues, really! Very good song. Then there\u2019s the hit, \u2018Look at the Show\u2019, a traditional LB song. This song is. very good! Sure, it comes out on Guerilla Radio but it\u2019s still a very good song. The words at this time were kind of deep, with a catchy line that \u2018now I know why you hate me, because hatred is all over the world even though the\u2019s only seen it lately\u2019. It's in search of Limp Bizkit's unique songs. So \u2018It will be good\u2019 is a very powerful and detached song, with emotional words like \u2018If this is a good place you can take me, You can give me a Good Life. Everywhere I started at all. And I no longer need what you gave me. But the song will benefit from deleting the \u2018F *** I\u2019ve raised my whole life\u2019 section. Warmer is also a great song; ugly and dealing with the search for depression Limp Bizkit sings like never before, without superiority. Unfortunately, there are some weak points and missing steps being considered to give it a high rating. However, a deeper understanding reveals a team full of talent and ability that is unfortunately on the wrong path, but has a few stones to remind us of what can happen.

E Jackson","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I'm honestly quite shocked and pleasantly surprised that Ruth is Stranger Than Richard contains so many good songs. First of all it should be noted that the entire album is very listenable. It's nothing like Matching Mole's first album for example where most of *those* ideas fell flat as they wandered aimlessly and accomplished nothing. No, Ruth is Stranger Than Richard is a very focused and songwriting-driven album with interesting and oddly satisfying arrangements. Let me explain what I mean by \"oddly satisfying\".\"Team Spirit\" starts off with a fairly typical Robert Wyatt vocal melody (perhaps reminiscent of this work with Soft Machine's very first album from back in the late sixty's). The saxophone work however, almost feels out of place except somehow -perhaps because of Brian Eno's involvement- they *work*. Not only are the sax solos completely enjoyable, but they're also, quite frankly, pretty darn ominous and spooky, especially during the final minute of the song when they almost seem to loop to create a melody of sorts. It's oddly pleasing according to my tastes and *definitely* has that wacky experimental Brian Eno vibe.\"Soup Song\" contains some hilarious lyrics about food-related topics. In the lyrics Robert pretends the's actually food and sings about it, all. The melody is fairly basic, but truth be told, the saxophone is fairly annoying because it's continuously obnoxious. \"Sonia\" is an AWESOME song. It has a danceable and very catchy rhythm, and magnificent trumpet and sax soloing playing over top of it. A very original idea.\"Song for Che\" would't be out of place on Roxy Music's first album, particularly near the send of the album surrounded by those experimental do wop songs. Not that this is necessarily a do wop. I honestly have no idea WHAT it is. Picture people slow dancing to a saxophone melody that's somewhat depressing and well, just plain odd.\"Solar Flares\" is a groovy-paced melodic instrumental that's almost immediately enjoyable. That is, if you can get past the weirdness factor. Either way, by the second listen you'll be loving it. The looping sax riff seriously remind me of early seventy's Traffic, and Steve Winwood would surely be impressed. The song is. hard to describe. It's based around these bizarrely beautiful piano lines while Robert Wyatt sometimes chums along to them in a mid-tempo style. Meanwhile the sax just plays the same few notes over and over giving it a hypnotic and atmospheric quality. Very unusual to say the least. The album closes with a six minute song called \"Muddy Mouse\" and it's based around a mighty fine vocal melody courtesy of Robert Wyatt and some softly performed piano lines. Actually it's more like Robert Wyatt singing, not words necessarily, but in a high-pitched range just going \"Whoa whoa whaaa whaaa\" for a couple minutes in the middle. It's not annoying for distracting however. Perhaps this is this idea of delivering a soulful vocal melody, who knows? The album does have one major weak point, and it's very very poor. It's a five-minute song that goes by the name \"five Black Notes and one White Note\". It's one unmemorable sax line repeating WAY too often, and for several minutes. Not a highlight and I don't understand its purpose. What I *do* know is that Ruth is Stranger than Richard is a very solid album, musically. Underrated too. Now. the question remains- why were all those Canterbury bands singing about a guy named Richard?

This is completely different from Mole's original album. No, Ruth is a foreigner rather than Richard is a devotional recorder who wrote a song that was wonderfully interesting and satisfying. Let me define what I mean by \u201cextraordinary satisfaction\u201d. \"Collaboration\" began with Robert Wyatt's classic music (perhaps reminiscent of this work on Soft Machine's debut album in the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's). However, the work of the saxophone almost feels awkward, except in some way \u2014 probably because of Brian Ino's involvement \u2014 they * are * working *. Saxophone solo is not fun at all, but the truth is, they are scared and shocked, especially in the last minutes of a song, they almost seem like they like to do a certain song. In my opinion, it's amazing to convince and * certainly * quirky, experimental Brian Eno vibe. \"Soup Song\" contains humorous lyrics on food-related topics. In words, Robert pretends to be real food and sings it. The song is basic, but honestly, the saxophone is annoying because it is always annoying. \"Sonia\" is a beautiful song. It has a very catchy rhythm and is very attractive, with a beautiful trumpet and a saxophone playing over it. It's a real idea. \"Song of Che\" does't seem to be missing from Roxy Music's debut album, especially when it's surrounded by experimental songs around the album's release. This will not be a mistake. Honestly, I don\u2019t know what it is. Imagine people dancing a little at a saxophone song, disturbing and strange. \"Solar flares\" is a beautiful device with a fast-paced bloom. That is, if you can overcome something unusual. Either way, you will fall in love with her for the second time. Drawing an saxophone riff reminds me of Traffic in the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, and Steve Winwood will surely be impressed. This is the song. It's hard to explain. It is based on these unusual and beautiful piano pieces, and sometimes Robert Wyatt accompanies them in a medium-style style. At the same time, the saxophone plays the same notes over and over again, providing a level of sleepiness and air permeability. Very unusual to say the least. The album ends with a six-minute song called \"Muddy Mouse\", based on Robert Wyatt's beautiful music and slow-paced piano music. After all, it's like Robert Wyatt's singing, not in words, but in the top few minutes. However, the distraction is not irritating. Maybe this is an idea to deliver the sweet sound of love, who knows? This disc is very weak, and very poor. This is a five-minute song called \"Five Black Notes and One White Note\". This is an unforgettable saxophone. It repeats many times and lasts for a few minutes. What a wonderful place, I don't understand its purpose. All I know * is that Ruth is a foreigner than Richard is a solid record, in terms of music.

Richard is a very focused and songwriting album with interesting and satisfying arrangements. Let me explain what I mean by \"amazingly satisfying\". \"Team Spirit\" begins with the usual voice of Robert Wyatt (probably reminiscent of that work with the first album of Soft Machine in the late sixties). However, the work of the sex phone feels almost out of place except in a special way - perhaps because of the involvement of Brian Enno, they * work *. Sex Solus is not only completely entertaining, but also clean, very beautiful and aggressive, especially during the last minute of the song when it seems like a variety of songs. It's incredibly fun in terms of what I like, and it's definitely the way to find the stupid Brian Inno Webb. \"Soup Song\" contains humorous words on food related topics. In the songs, Robert plays the real food and sings about it, everything. The song is basic, but truth be told, the sex phone is annoying because it's getting worse. \"Sonia\" is a wonderful song. It has a charming and charming rhythm, with an amazing bugle and sex soling playing with it. Original view \"Song for Chi\" will not be on Roxy Music's debut album, especially ahead of the release of the album, which is surrounded by in-person testing songs. It's not like it's a dope. I don't really know what it is. Imagine people dancing to the sound of saxophone music that is somewhat subdued, incomprehensible. \"Solar Flares\" is a fast-paced musical instrument that makes you happy instantly. That is, if you can go through the contradiction. Either way, you'll like it in a second. Nearby sex drafting reminds me deeply of Seventy Traffic, and Steve Onewood will definitely be impressed. The song says It's hard to explain. It is based on the amazing piano tracks that Robert Wyatt once met in the middle of the temple. At this point, Sex repeatedly plays a few similar notes to give it an addictive and environmental quality. It is not uncommon to say less. The album ends with a six-minute song called \"Midi Mouse\" and is based on Robert Wyatt's favourite vocals and some short piano lines. It's actually like Robert Wyatt's song, not the words correctly, but at a higher level just going for a few minutes between \"wow wow wow wow\". Intervening is not a problem anyway. Maybe it's the idea of introducing soul-stirring hymns, who knows? The album has a weak point, and it is rare. The five-minute song \"Five Black Notes and One White Note\".

The song is basic, but truth be told, the sex phone is annoying because it's getting worse. For example, it's not like Match Moll's first album, where most of the * ideas * wandered aimlessly and broke down due to not getting anything. The album ends with a six-minute song called \"Midi Mouse\" and is based on Robert Wyatt's favourite vocals and some short piano lines.","overall":5,"summary":"wow, this is almost as good as Rock Bottom","unixReviewTime":1308009600,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2011"}

It is not for sale, because this type of music is not as popular as it was a few years ago. It cannot be said to be bad in any case. The song that makes me happy is \"Two find you\", a beautiful love song. \"Run U\" is another popular one. \"Leave the flights on\" has a beautiful rhythm, reminiscent of Nelly Furtado. \"Haunted\" is another great song. \"Two in One\" is a great love song. This album reminds me of Sheryl Crow's second album, which contains popular music and familiar lyrics, including unique cultural references and lyrics to the song. This is still the same thing, but there is dancing. This is this best album so far. Overall, fans may be surprised, but with an open mind, people love this CD.","overall":4,"summary":"This is Jewel?","unixReviewTime":1054857600,"reviewTime":"06 6, 2003"}

I was shocked when I saw the cover of the album a few months ago. Slowly but surely, my \"intuition\" grew, a lot of fun dancing about pop culture and materialism. Now I understand from this project that Jewel wanted to add meaningful words and dance music, showing that it is possible. It is also not for sale, as the music is not as popular as it was a few years ago. Not to mention that this is bad in any way. The best track for me is \"To Find You\", a beautiful love song. \"Run to You\" is another favourite. \"Turn on the flights\" is a beautiful setting and reminds me of little blue furtado. \"Ghostbusters\" is another great track out there. \"To Be One\" is a great love song. The album reminds me of Sheryl Crow's second album, which includes pop music threads and familiar melodies, and unusual pop culture quotes and lyrics. It's still the same jewel, with only the beat of the dance. And this is this most interesting album so far.

Lords of the Underground (L. O. T. U. G., DJ Lord Jazz, Doitall, and Mr. Funkee Man) are probably one of the missed groups that came out from Newark, N. J. area. This was their debut album, \"Here Come The Lords\" that dropped back in 'ninety-three. This album was entirely produced my Marley Marl and K-Def. This album alone has some of the most excellent production I've heard from the East Coast in a minute. Most of the production is unique and garunteed to make your head bob. When I first heard \"Funky Child\", I could't stop bobbing my head to the cloud horns that K-Def and Marley Marl hooked up for this group. Other awesomely produced songs were the hit song \"Chief Rocka\" (I believe that's their well known song). \"Keep It Underground\" is also another song with great production. As for the trio themselves, they bring many lyrics to the mic on this album, and it seems like they were having a lot of fun doing it. \"Mad Skillz\" shows exactly what the group has. One humorous track would be \"Sleep For Dinner\". The song will make you laugh but at the same time they were being serious. \"Grave Digga\" and \"Psycho\" are also standouts. DJ Lord Jazz even gets some love on the song \"Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time (Make It Funky)\". As for anything bad. There in't much at all if you ask me. One thing I found a little aggravating was the fact they kept shouting out their name throughout most of the album. Other than that, this is one excellent album from the Brick City.

Some of the best production songs are the famous song \"Chief Raka\" (I'm sure it's their most popular song). \"Cape at the Underground\" is another great production song. As far as the three of them are concerned, they put a lot of words into the microphone on this album, and it looks like they are really enjoying it. \"Med Skills\" clearly shows what a team is worth. A funny track would be \"Sleep Breakfast\". The song will make you laugh but at the same time they were determined. There are also signs that \"grave will\" and \"psycho\".

In terms of these three themselves, they bring a lot of songs to the microphone of this album, and they seem interested in doing so. \u201cMad Skillz\u201d clearly shows what the team has. One way of joking is the \u201cSleeping Dinner\u201d. The song will make you laugh but at the same time they are true. \"Grave Digga\" and \"Psycho\" will also be seen. DJ Lord Jazz even gets a little love from the song \u201cLord Jazz Hit Me One Time (Make It Funky)\u201d. Like anything bad. Nothing much if you ask me. One thing I regret is the fact that they reveal their name on most of the album. Other than that, it\u2019s a great album from Brick City. This album is full of East Coast flavors with great production. Because of this, I will try to check out their second album \u201cKeepers Of The Funk\u201d. This is the one I highly recommend you listen to, because you\u2019ll love it.

One reviewer mentioned how you can barely understand who plays what in some songs (mainly \"Iscarabaid\" and \"J'Nuh\"), which is certainly true. The vocals, guitars, bass, and drums seem to fade into one beautiful instrument. Some songs such as \"five\/four\" and \"eight\" have severe changes of space in the middle of the song, yet for some reason, it feels natural. This is truly progressive and amazing music. What's even more incredible is that this album was thrown together so that the band could break up. Some songs were originally written for Diary, but for some reason were cast aside. The structures of those songs are very simallar to Diary songs. For example, \"Friday\" has the same buildup to chorus pattern that \"Seven\" had, only it lost the repetition of riffs and lyrics that made that song drag a bit. Indeed, none of the songs there are too repetitious. Every song only has the elements that would improve it, and nothing more. If you like any type of rock music, I highly recommend LPtwo. It takes a few listens to get used to, but it will quickly become one of your favourites.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Rock Album of the 90's","unixReviewTime":997056000,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2001"}

I was hooked on Jay-Z after hearing Volume one in a friend's car back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, which is actually an underrated album. I did't listen to Reasonable Doubt until two thousand, and the funny thing is, I did't realize how great it was until about a year later, after listening to it over and over. The songs are dark and deep. This is a strangely innovative album, because of the production. For example, twenty-two Two's is nothing I have never heard before, and overall the piano dominated beats are so different from what you'll usually hear on a ship-hop record. The lyrics are amazing. There are many themes that run throughout the album, including focus, determination, and justice. In my opinion, the best tracks are: one) D'evils, two) Dead Presidents, (Scary beat, and gets me hyped everytime) three) Brooklyn's Finest, (A legendary duet with Biggie) four) Can't Knock the Hustle, five) Can I Live, (the first verse is incredible) six) twenty-two Twos, (the first verse is awesome), seven) Coming of Age (the Jay\/Bleek exchange is very original and effective). The reason why D'evils is a classic is because of the message, and because of the marvellous piano loop. The message is that if you wish to be successful in any endeavour, you should be willing to do whatever it takes, including lie. A secondary theme in that song is that friends grow apart due to disparity in success. But what makes that song great is how the message is delivered - the rhymes that the chooses. If you are a music fan (not necessary a ship-hop fan, but a music fan), for a lover of language and expression, get this album, now.","overall":5,"summary":"Masterful, Powerful, and Absolutely Brilliant.

D'evils has become a classic because of the message it conveys and the amazing piano loop. The message is that if you want to succeed at anything, you have to be willing to do whatever it takes, including flying.

Robbie Robertson has provided amazing coverage for this track and other guitar. Rockin 's chair is another great addition, as the band adds a bit of charm to the song. Surprisingly, these people are Canadians, but they feel more about the Old South than the groups that live in the area. Dylan's song sounds good to me. The band plays a supporting role and is as strong as the Rolling Stones. Before the flood, when I painted my part, don\u2019t tell Henry you always hold numbers all year.

However, to say that this does not mean that it is bad is to say that it is good, but this case is even more appealing. But this should be the second best album, when the album is still a gangster. You left this gangster root behind the left death row, so there are no restrictions on the album that can touch these things. Dr. Dre left Deathrow before making the film, so no beating is so much fun. However, I want to say that the work done by the producer who made this album can be said to be equally good. My next rating. One. Introduction Nine \/ Ten is very good for the introduction. Doggfather ten \/ ten old, big song starts the album. Beating strong, Snoopy performed all the verses, and a great choir by Charlie Wilson III. Ride four Me Zero \/ eleven silly graphics, just to make the album longer. Skip Ta Boogie Ten \/ ten large choirs and beatsfive coats. Freestyle six\/ten Conversation Yeah, that's not right, Snoop is just talking all the time six. When I was third \/ tenth, I did't care about this skit, it was the only square on the album that I did't completely hate. Snoop Bounce ten \/ ten classic, good BOUNCE tonight. Gold Rush nine \/ Eleven holds the beats, but has a poem of Snoopnine. You want seven \/ ten Naaa, a stupid song with lots of cameos. (Tear Em Off) Me and My Doggz ten\/ten A solo with stroller a ** beats. Definitely one of my favourite eleven people. Ten \/ ten older Vapors, I certainly understand why this is so popular. Another hit hit with Snoop, talks about the lives of all members of Tha Dogg Poundtwelve. Groupie seven.five \/ ten Also, it's kind of filling in a bad title with too many posts. Two thousand and ten \/ eleven one time alone. This can be called Snoop Bounce II. Watch the discussion about making people slow down and completing fourteen. Six minutes Sixx ten minutes unbeaten. I have seen some people give this song a very bad review. However, for me, this is a very sweet song, and Snoop is very sleepy. (OJ) Wake up at nine: five\/ten. Yes, many cameos, but half of them are Snoopy. Snoopy worked very well on chorussixteen. Snoop's Upside Ya Head Ten \/ Ten Classic is one of the favourites of all Snoop verses and great chorusseventeen. The Blueberry weight \/ ten is fine, but where is Snoopy. If there is no Snoopy XVIII, I can't give it more than ten weights. Zero traffic \/ zero ten Another silly drawing WBALLZ, not funny at all. That WALLZ guy is stupid. Doggyland Ten \/ Ten is another great song, Snoop appears in every verse, and has a great choir. Downtown Assassin nine.five\/ten I can no longer give this nine.five\/ten I saw that there is only one Snoop verse. However, this is definitely a solid track, hitting twenty-one. Finishing five \/ ten","overall":5,"summary":"Classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","unixReviewTime":1154736000,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2006"}

However to say that does\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad, that means it\u2019s surprising but this first game is even more surprising. But it has to be this second best album to see when it\u2019s done and it\u2019s still gangsta. He left the roots of this gangster after this left -handed death so none of this limited albums can handle this product. Dr. Dre left Deathrow before it could be done so none of these amazing beats. Yet I would say the makers who made this album did a job that can be said to be that way. My Rating is Intro Nineteen years It's great to get to know each other. Doggfather Ten \/ Classic, a great way to get started at the door. The beats are tight and Snoop does all the verses and there\u2019s a great Charlie Wilsonthree song. Follow the four Me Me zero \/ ten Stupid, just there to speed up the four albums. Up Jump Tha Boogie ten \/ ten great songs with lots of beats. Free Chat Sixteen Well it's not a big deal, Snoop really talks all the time. When I was growing up I did\u2019t care about this skit, the only skit on the album that I did\u2019t really hate. Snoop Bounce Ten Classic, good for BOUNCE tonight. Gold Rush nine \/ ten Some close a bit ** beat, but it only has one Snoopnine verse. You thought seventeen Naaa, quite a silly song with congratulations. (Tear Em Off) Me and My Doggz A ten with a hard cramp ** hit. Definitely one of my favourites. Vapors Ten Classic, I\u2019m sure I can see why this one was beaten. The only one with Snoop beats is talking about the lives of all the members of Tha Dogg Poundtwelve. Groupie pit.five Again, this is a little mess with a bad theme and a lot of thirteen guests. two thousand and eleven \/ ten Another narrow. It will be called Snoop Bounce II looking at discussions about how people can get up and be fourteen. Six Minutes Ten Pretty Pretty Grateful, I found out that some people gave this song a bad rating. However for me it was a very good song and Snoop was a delayed fifteen. (OJ) Wake up at nine. Five \/ ten Hmm, looks like a lot of guests but half is Snoop and Snoop works well especially with chorussixteen. Snoop\u2019s Upside Ya Head is Ten \/ Ten Classic, another favourite of all Snoop\u2019s verses and great chorusseventeen. Blueberry \/ Ten Weight Well, but Snoop. I can\u2019t give you more than ten pounds without Snoopeighteen. Traffic Jam zero \/ ten other silly WBALLZ skits, at least funny at all. That WBALLZ guy is stupid. Ten \/ ten other great ways Doggyland, Snoop is in all the verses and there is great chorustwenty. Downtown Assassins nine \/ five \/ ten I can't give nine over five. Five \/ ten when I saw there a Snoop verse. However it was really a difficult road to beat at twenty -one. Another shan \/ ten","overall":5,"summary":"Classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","unixReviewTime":1154736000,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2006"}

All the World's A Stage was raw and gushed energy, but drew from a limited number of songs. The integrity of Exit Stage Left and A Show of Hands was diluted by overdubs and polished production jobs. But this is the real deal, with tons of intensity and dreams of great songs to perform. There are three CDs in this collection. While it is impossible for a single live release to capture the true scope of Rush's career, this package does a nice job. The first two discs (the \"main\" jones) draw heavily from the band's most recent releases: Roll the Bones, Counterparts, and Test for Echo. The stirring \"Bravado,\" the energizing and ironic \"Resist,\" and the aggressive \"Stick It Out\" are just a few examples of the newer songs given intense live treatment there. A number of the band's well-known classics are there as well. \"The Spirit of Radio,\" \"The Trees,\" \"Freewill,\" \"YYZ,\" and an incredible version of the band's best loved epic, \"two thousand, one hundred and twelve.\" Unlike the version found on All the World's a Stage, this performance keeps every section of the song intact (whereas the older one is five minutes shorter). Without a doubt, the song is a devastating feat of hard rock in the live setting. Explosive riffs and rapid-fire percussion, along with an intimate acoustic solo during part three validate the epic's standing as one of the bands best works. \"Closer to the Heart,\" the requisite concert staple is again performed there, and again it gets a fun jam tagged on at the send. Rare songs such as the emotionally charged \"Analog Kid\" and the butter masterpiece \"Natural Science\" are included. There in't much from the Signals-to-Presto era, which is especially unfortunate in Presto's case because that album has yet to be covered sufficiently on a live recording. But they, no one's never one hundred% pleased with a live album. this one does come close, though. The third disc, which is something of a bonus, was compiled from a show in London in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, during the A Farewell to Kings tour. The sound quality is as raw as it gets, which is a plus in that it means the energy is completely unadulterated. Here you can get the only live recordings of \"Cygnus X-one Book one,\" \"A Farewell to Kings,\" and \"Cinderella Man.\" The crowd's reaction to the segue between \"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" and \"Xanadu\" is one of the best moments on any live rock album. The CDs there also present an interesting contrast in the band's development over the years. Back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight the keyboards were simple, Peart's drum kit was a titanic thing, and hard rocking' riffs came hard and fast without relent. Geddy Lee's voice screamed at some high registers. Twenty years later, the band relies heavily on sequences synthesizers and backup vocals, and more melodically-savvy songs, with Lee singing at more relaxed octaves. (Compare the studio \"two thousand, one hundred and twelve\" to the live version there!)All in all, this is the best of Rush's four live albums. Hopefully the fifth will provide the Cynus X-one saga in its entirety. that'd be a dream come true. As we wait, Different Stages sports enough awesome live music to make any Rush fan happy for a long time.","overall":5,"summary":"Ne plus ultra!","unixReviewTime":1000252800,"reviewTime":"09 12, 2001"}

Of course it is, except for the real thing. All World Levels are a Start with great power, but based on a limited number of songs. The authenticity of the Left Level Exit and Hand Display was refined by a combination function and perfect production function. But this is the real deal, with a lot of difficulty and dreams of great songs that can be made. There are three CDs in this collection. While the one-time release may not capture the actual size of Rush\u2019s work, this package does a great job. The first two albums (\"best\" Jones) borrowed heavily on the latest band results: Roll Bones, Computers, and Echo Testing. This \"Bravado\" song, The Stick It Out, and the \"Stick It Out\" march are just a few examples of the new songs that have been edited there. Many well-known classical activities are also present. Incredible versions of \"Broadcast\", \"Trees\", \"Free Freedom\", \"YYZ\" and the most popular band \"two million, one thousand, one hundred and twelve\". Unlike the version in Worldwide Phase, this performance leaves all parts of the song gone (while the old section has five minutes shorter). There is no doubt that this song is a distraction from the hard rock in the living space. Improved blasting and fast play, with acoustic solo in the third instalment, confirm epic status as one of the band\u2019s outstanding functions. \"Closer to the Heart\", the theme song of the much-needed concert was performed there again, and was marked with a funny jam when posted. Included are rare songs such as the emotional \"Analog Kid\" and the \"butter of Natural Sciences\" part. There\u2019s not much in the Sign-to-Presto era, which is very painful for Presto, because the album in\u2019t quite finished yet on live records. But look, no one has never been satisfied with a one hundred% live album. However, this one is really close. The third report is an added bonus and was compiled during a farewell to the royal tour of London in one thousand and nine hundred and seventy-eight. The sound quality is the oldest, which is advantageous because it means that the energy is completely clean. Here, you can find only live recordings of \"Cygnus X-one Book one\", \"Farewell to the King\" and \"Cinderella Man\". Audience response to the debate between \"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" and \"Xanadu\" is one of the best moments on any live song album. The CD where it also makes an interesting difference with the growth of the band over the years. As early as one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, the keyboard was very simple, the Peart drum kit was a big deal, and the hard stone repairs came quickly and quickly, without stopping. Geddy Lee's voice echoed at other high places. Twenty years later, the group relied heavily on the rhythm of things and the supporting voice, and more songs, and Li sang free octaves. (Compare the recording studio \"two million, one thousand, one hundred and twelve\" with the live version there!) Overall, this is the best of Rush's four albums. I hope the fifth one will provide the Cynus X-one game completely. That will be a dream come true.

The song is a painful rock form in a lively environment, with explosive waves and rapid explosions, as well as the sound solo epic position near the third part, confirming it as one of the most effective bands. That is the basis of the much-needed concert, which is also being held there, and we also get a delicious jam at the post.

In the 'ninetys, the tradition was kept alive by Teenage Fanclub and Matthew Sweet, who married Big Star and Badfinger to 'eightys college rock - there was also Jellyfish, who acted as if the 'eightys never existed - and in the two thousands, it's been the New Pornographers, an indie-centric act who fills the Fanclub's spot, and Detroit-based singer\/songwriter Brendan Benson, who is this decade's Matthew Sweet. Not that the Sweet-Benson analogy is one hundred percent accurate. For one thing, Benson does't favor the messy guitars and confessionals that marked Sweet's 'ninetys masterworks Girlfriend, Altered Beast, and one hundred% Fun, preferring tightly constructed songs and precisely detailed arrangements that emphasize this sweet melodies. Also, where Sweet's music tied neatly into the zeitgeist of the Alternative Nation of the early 'ninetys, Benson's music is deliberately classicist and proudly out of time, belonging neither to the sounds nor the fashion of the two thousands. That is, unless the defining characteristic of this decade truly is smart, sharp revivalism, from the Strokes through LCD Soundsystem, but even if that's the case, Benson is the their to a tradition that has never had much commercial (or critical) potency since Badfinger and the Raspberries developed it in the early 'seventys - too-shy, sensitive pop tunesmith who are also skilled record-makers but whose sense of pop remains rooted in the golden era of the 'sixtys, so it chiefly appeals to other pop geeks raised on similar sensibilities. Benson, like the New Pornographers and their leader, A. C.

And make no mistake, this is close to a great power pop record, due to Benson's strong writing and impeccable sense of craft, which are the primarily appeals for power pop fanatics in the first place. Perhaps it does't have the kinetic energy for sense of adventure that mark the genre's true classics from No Dice still Girlfriend, but Alternative to Love also exists in an era that's enamoured with the past and does't take many risks, and on those terms, it's the perfect power pop album for its decade.","overall":5,"summary":"Power Pop the way its meant to be played","unixReviewTime":1119571200,"reviewTime":"06 24, 2005"}

In the ninety's, Teenage Fanclub and Matthew Sweet continued the tradition. They married Big Star and Badfinger on a college rock in the eighty's - and Jellyfish, who worked as if the never existed in the eighty's - and there were two thousand people, a new pornographer, an independent act filling the space. of the fan club, and Detroit singer \/ songwriter Brendan Benson, Matthew Sweet of the decade.

Benson, on the other hand, dislikes dirty rhythms and confessions that mark Sweet's ninety's masterpieces Girlfriend, Altered Beast and one hundred% happiness. You choose the right songs and the right arrangements to emphasize this wonderful song. In addition, Sweet music is closely related to the foreign zeitgeist in the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys, while Benson's music is deliberately made and outdated. That is, unless the descriptive brand in these decade is really smart and sharp, from Stroke to the LCD Soundsystem, but nonetheless, Benson is their tradition, developed in Badfinger and Raspberries in the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. The tuner, is also a talented record producer, but its pop music feels like it is in the golden page of the sixtys, so that attracts some popular geeks to suggest the same sensitivity. Benson and New Pornographer, like their leader AC Newman, play this small, solitary space. a combination of luck. During the production of the third different album of love, the relationship with White Stripes mastermind Jack White is deep, leading to collaboration (not yet released at the time of writing), greatly improving Benson's image before and after the release of the spring album.

It actually delivered more than the same intellect, the popular classical music on the first album. This is not something to be expected at all \u2014 electrical power makes the same album almost all the time - people like Benson who are proud of the artists continue to write until they complete the show. This is another way of love. Although nothing unexpected - the closest to today's style in the Chad Blake mix, Jon Brion's style is very much, but not as a party - it is well known for its power, even for those who are already made for those guitar lovers for the first time, they love Benson's music. Listening to another form of love for the first time is like finding old love and the new year - you feel familiar, but the details are brand new, from hooks and harmony to hidden details in the product, like unique features Use opening words. Raimon, \"spit it out.\" The place of love is not a good record, but a friendly and beautiful record, a record that is quickly loved and gets better all the time around, like all of them. There is no doubt that thanks to Benson's strong writing and an unmistakable sense of part, this is close to a great pop music record, the first of all music lovers. Perhaps it does not have the unique grace of saying \"No Dice is still a virgin\", but \"Another way of love\" is also in the busy past and meaningless past.

Much to my (pleasant) surprise the said this album and then the went on to talk about it enthusiastically. My surprise came from the fact that not many people know this album. Which is a crying shame because it deserves more attention and praise. And it's the only Jacksons concert album officially released (I'm talking about The Jacksons, not the Jackson five). It was recorded in the fall of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one on the Jacksons' Triumph Tour. It features songs from the Jacksons' Triumph and Destiny albums, and also from Michael's first solo album as an adult, Off The Wall. Plus the inevitable Jackson five Medley, for old times' sake. Michael sings lead vocals on all songs and the is in absolutely top form vocally. I especially love this performances on ballads, such as I'll Be There, Ben and She's Out of My Life. I love the band on this tour as well. Michael Jackson fans for years begged for a release of a concert CD by Michael, which was finally heard when in two thousand and twelve a live CD of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight leg of Michael's Bad World Tour was released (as a part of the Bad twenty-five boxset though - not as a CD that one can buy separately). I love that too, but this in't any worse (I'm tempted to say the band is actually better on this one).

The thing that surprised me (happily) was that I said about the album I kept talking about it with applause. I was surprised that so many people did't know this album. This is a shame to mourn, for it is deserving of your attention and praise. This is the only Jackson Jackson concert album officially released (I\u2019m talking about Jackson, not Jackson Five). It was recorded on the Jackons Triumph Tour in the fall of ten thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. It contains songs from Jackons's Triumph and Destiny's album, as well as songs from Off The Wall, Michael's debut album as an adult. It is combined with Jackson\u2019s five unavoidable, due to the past. Michael is the main character in all the songs and is high in voice. I especially like this kind of performance on traditional songs, such as I'll Be There, Ben and Exit in my life. I also love the belt for this tour. Michael Jackson's fans have been praying for Michael to release a concert CD for years, and finally release a live CD at Michael's Bad World Tour ten thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight in two thousand and twelve (e.g. purchased separately). I like it too, but it's not a bad thing (I'd like to say the band is really good). It complements the bad Tour CD well because there is a different set of songs played-focused on instruments from the Off The Wall era (including two of the mentioned Jackons albums), and a list of the worst Tour tracks is definitely focused on the Bad And the interesting album. I hope more people will find this gem. In this regard, one of my secret wishes is for someone to get a reel for a Tour concert and it can be downloaded on DVD \/ Blue-Ray!","overall":5,"summary":"Deserves more attention!","unixReviewTime":1366156800,"reviewTime":"04 17, 2013"}

The most amazing (good) thing is this album and then other people keep talking about it passionately. My surprise started with the fact that many people did not know this album. Crying is a shame because it deserves more attention and praise. And this is the only Jackson concert album that has been officially released (I'm talking about Jackson, not Jackson Five). It was written on the Jackson's Trump Tour in the fall of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. This includes Jackson's album Triumph and Destiny, as well as Michael's debut album of the wall. And the inevitable Jackson Five Medley, because of the old days. Michael sings lead songs in all the songs and is in a very cloud format. I really like playing these songs, like I'm there, Ben and you're out of my life. I also love the team on this trip. Fans of Michael Jackson have been begging for years for the release of a CD at Michael's concert, which was eventually heard on the two thousand, one hundred CDs of Michael's Bad World Tour at ninety-eight, zero, ninety-eight and eighty-eight. Twenty-five beset sets (as CDs cannot be purchased separately). I like it too, but it's not too bad (I'm tempted to say the team is better). It fits well with the Bad Tour CD, as there are a variety of songs playing - focusing on the off-the-wall era (including the album mentioned by Jackons), while the Bad Tour list on Bad and Thriller albums. Is focused. So I want as many people as possible to find this treasure.

We Hear Now was an okay track to start off the album with. World's Most Dangerous(feat Nemesis) is good. Let's Ride has Ja wrapping like Twista on the track and it want a bad album. Nigguz Theme(which borrows from NWA's Efilfourzaggin) is cool. The Suicide freestyle with Case is great because it shows what Ja is capable of. Holla Holla was a good first single and Murda four Life(feat Memphis Bleek) is a dope follow up. E-Dub And Ja(feat Erick Sermon) is dope collabo by itself. Erick Sermon and Ja did pretty good on that track. Daddy's Little Baby(feat Ron Isley) is Ja's touching tribute to this daughter and Ron Isley complimented the track well. Its Murda was a great match up which featured DMX and Jay-z(before Ja fell out with DMX). Kill Em All also features Jay-z-- the only thing the's on the hook. Only Begotten Son is Ja dripping this father a new one for not being is this life as a kid. As for flaws I cant recall any. Bottom Line: Venni Vetti Vecci is Ja's best work to date. This is not out of spite, its out of love. Ja showed this true potential more on this album then the never did on this later releases. Im not mad at him for going pop, Im mad that the abandoned this fanbase out the window just to make a quick buck and put out slope work. I could care less about him going pop. This album is reccomended to anybody who remembered him for what the was and not what the turned out to be. Standout Tracks: WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS, LET'S RIDE, NIGGUZ THEME, SUICIDE FREESTYLE, STORY TO TELL, ITS MURDA, E-DUB AND JA, DADDY'S LITTLE BABY, RACE AGAINST TIME and ONLY BEGOTTEN SON. PS: If you never like Ja, that's cool. If you liked him at one point than despised him for what the has become that's cool to but done bash him just because fifty Cent made it trendy then turn around and bash fifty Cent years later.

We heard now was the best way to start the album. The most dangerous in the world is beautiful. Let's Ride has wrapped Jaa on the track like a Toasta and wants a bad album. The Nggos theme (taken from NWA's EfWAfilzaggin) is cool. Suicide freestyle and case is good because it shows what Jay can do. Hola Hola was a good first person, and Dead Four Life (Memphis Black) is next. IE-Dub And Ja (Cart Eric Sermon) is a dope collage itself. Eric and Ja's sermon on this track was very good. Daddy Little Baby (featuring Ron Isley) pays tribute to Ja's daughter and Ron Asley praises the track. His Marda was a good game with DMX and JZ (before coming out with DMX). Killing them all consists of J-Z - which is just a hook thing. This is the only son who is raising this new father at a young page because the did not get this life. As far as mistakes are concerned, I don't remember anywhere. Below: Winnie the Pooh's best work never. It is not, although it is influenced by love. The show has seemed a bit unfocused in recent episodes, however; I'm not angry with him for going with Pop, I'm crazy that the left this fan base out of the window just to make money and a sloping job. When the left, I did't care much for him. This album is available to anyone who remembers what it was and in't. Standing Tracks: Very Dangerous Land, Rise, Engagement Theme, Suicide Source, Speech Story, Her Dead, Dubbed and J, Cady's Little Girl, Dealing with Time With Childbirth. PS: If you don't like going, fine. If you love him sometimes, instead of insulting him, which is fun now, but the did it just because fifty cents made him love him and then the hit back fifty years ago.

We now hear a great track at the beginning of the album. The World's Most Dangerous (feat Nemesis) is just right. Let's get on and let Ja go around the track like Twista, and the wants a bad album. Nigguz content (borrowed from NWA's Efilfourzaggin) is cool. The case of free suicide is good because it shows the power of J. Holla Holla is good, and Murda four Life (Memphis Bleek) is a good thing to follow. E-Dub and Ja (and Erick Sermon) are actually a kind of cohesive collaboration. Erick and Ja's sermon did a great job on this track. Daddy\u2019s Little Baby (and Ron Isley) is J\u2019s touching contribution to this girl, and Ron Isley is full of praise for this song. Its Murda is an excellent game featuring DMX and Jay-z (before Ja and DMX failed). Kill Em They all have Jay-z symptoms - the only problem that can be solved. The only-begotten Son is the one that God gave to the father a new father, because this is not the way it was when the was a boy. Disability, I can't remember. Source: Venni Vetti Vecci is Ja's most outstanding work to date. This is not out of evil, but out of love. Ja has shown more of this possibility on this album than on recent albums.

SUPERSOAKER is fun and a great way to open an album. I forgot to using ROCK CITY. I DON\u2019T HAVE TO GROW UP (always with one) but now that I\u2019m with him, GOOD WAR is a wonderful song, it opens with truth from the first to the last word, the TEMPLE is great what reminds me of the eighths, I feel happy coming. I WILL WAIT ANI will start with the big opening that you can only get from the KOL album, the FAMILY OF THE FAMILY is a rock song, the COMEBACK STORY is Brilliance in music. There are always some KOL songs that make me cry so I feel a kind of one and this is one of them. The lyrics, the interest in Calebs \u2019voice, this production, is amazing and every time I listen to it, I send up in a place where only music can take me, CAAWA is another song that penetrates the me deeply. I am so happy that they are combined with each other because when I repeat one, the other symbols come together. The words are perfect, absolutely perfect. Sometimes I think when they write songs, I have them in mind. ON CHIN closed the door tightly. It is soft, like rhythm, sweet and charming. By the way, KOL. If you\u2019re a fan like me and you know all of their music, you\u2019ve accepted all of their albums and it\u2019s different, then you\u2019ll love, you\u2019ll love this album.

He treats it like the R&B single wrapped, \u201cToss It Up\u201d and once again showed this love of California \u201cTo Live & Die in LA\u201d. Perhaps the biggest feature of the LP still is \u201cMe and My Friend\u201d, Shakur\u2019s love of guns and showing endless love for those weapons. The song inspired Jay-Z to not well cover the waterfall with Beyonce Knowles of two thousand and two. Makaveli\u2019s \u201cThe Seven Day Theory\u201d is the most fruitful Pac and perhaps the best of these works (except for \u201cMe Against The World\u201d).","overall":5,"summary":"\"7 Day Theory\" Review","unixReviewTime":1097884800,"reviewTime":"10 16, 2004"}

Makaveli's \"Seven Days\" Theory is Pac's first work and probably the best (except \"I'm Against the World\").

MASSACHUSETTS is from HORIZONTAL, originally released in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight on the Atco label. The song also appeared on GOLD, released on RSO in 'seventy-six. WORLD and WORDS are from HORIZONTAL also. DON'T FORGET TO REMEMBER is from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's CUCUMBER CASTLE(minus Robin Gibb). I'VE JUST GOTTA GET A MESSAGE TO YOU is from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight's IDEA, also appearing on GOLD. From the SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER soundtrack album, released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, are STAYIN' ALIVE,HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE and NIGHT FEVER. Also on SNF but originally from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six's CHILDREN OF THE WORLD is YOU SHOULD BE DANCING. Also from COTW is LOVE SO RIGHT. From one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five's MAIN COURSE is the disco-flavored JIVE TALKIN'. From one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine's SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN are TRAGEDY,LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT and TOO MUCH HEAVEN(the latter track was released as a single before the album). From one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven's E. S. P. is YOU WIN AGAIN. In addition to JIVE TALKIN',TRAGEDY,STAYIN' ALIVE,YOU SHOULD BE DANCING,NIGHT FEVER and LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT are ideal for discotheque play since all those songs were recorded during the disco era of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. If this album had one for two new songs on it,I'd purchase it. I won't since I already own THEIR GREATEST HITS. Some copies of this album are accompanied by a bonus DVD containing some of the Bee Gees' live performances. I dedicate this album to the memories of Maurice and the Bee Gees' father Hugh Gibb.","overall":5,"summary":"Chart-toppers!","unixReviewTime":1100044800,"reviewTime":"11 10, 2004"}

And the session, above all, captures Green's full, rich sound (dig this allusion to Diz' \"Round Midnight\" coda at the conclusion of \"Valentine\"). He certainly ensures a grooving, cooking session (though like so many Bthree players, this chords and right-hand clicks can become familiar in a hurry, making him the least interesting of the three soloists). But, surprisingly, Green's \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" is the Blue Note session I return to most frequently (out of the four in my collection). If Burrell's \"Midnight Blue\" is five stars, \"Grantstand\" is five and one\/two. Besides this one, Green's acclaimed \"Idle Moments\" is a must-have--if for the title cut alone. Harewood is an underrated, swinging drummer, supplying even more fire than Elvin does on this dates with Grant Green.","overall":5,"summary":"If Green's permitted only one five-star album, make this one 4 and 1\/2","unixReviewTime":1215907200,"reviewTime":"07 13, 2008"}

The ensuing recording sessions were rather turbulent with Nile & Bernard pushing Diana to give more vocally, and Diana storming off after reporting \"Berry (Gordy) never said I sang flat!!\". Unhappy with the final results, Diana took the mastertapes and had them remixed without Nile & Bernard's knowledge, and had her vocals are-recorded. The result? The biggest selling album of her career; double platinum (and #two on Billboard), and a million selling single. The deluxe edition of \"Diana\" includes the originally released weight tracks, as well as the unmixed Nile & Bernard versions on one disc, and extended versions of other hits, and rarities on a second disc. Packed in a rectangular digipak which opens up to reveal the full famous black and white shot of Diana in tight top and jeans, much like the original vinyl did. The album opens with the #one million selling single \"Upside down\" with THAT famous scratchy guitar riff and funky sound. The Nile\/Edward version features more subdued vocals and the guitar solo that ends the song is not as fiery as the released version's. The Nile\/Bernard version of \"Tenderness\" features a new instrumental break with some scratchy guitar and additional vocals, which stretch the song longer than the released version. I quite like this. The released version of the largely acoustic ballad \"Friend to friend\" is lighter and much nicer than the Nile\/Bernard version. The choruses on the Nile\/Bernard version of \"I'm coming out\" (her funky declaration of a \"new me\" which became a gay anthem and a #five hit) are longer, and it misses the final screamed \"I'm coming. OOOUT!!!\", sacrilege!!\"Have fun again\" is basically the same, though the Nile\/Bernard version has more drawn out (almost lazy) vocals, and a longer instrumental break. The released version of \"My old piano\" (a UK top ten) is fuller and features a nice piano\/guitar duel at the send, while the Nile\/Bernard version has a longer, almost jazzier piano\/guitar duel. The released version of \"Now that you're gone\" (the beautiful ballad of longing and loneliness) wins hands down!!! That scratchy, spare bassline, and pseudo reggae feel. The Nile\/bernard version ends abruptly, missing out the lovely piano solo at the send of the released version. Closing is \"Give up\", basically the same, but longer, with a new instrumental break. Basically, the original Nile\/Bernard version had longer instrumental breaks, a slightly jazzier\/funkier feel, and more subdued vocals. I much prefer the released version, but it's nice to have the Chic version hand in hand as an alternate. Some might prefer the Chic version, and that's the beauty of having both versions there. The remastering is superb, and the production of the album still stands up to music produced today.

Jones wrote the title track \"Come Away With Me.\" It is one of the most beautiful of melodies. \"Shoot the Moon\" with its languid guitar is a slow song of loneliness. My favourite track is J. D. Loudermilk's \"Turn Me On.\" Norah's sultry vocal entices, \"Like a flower waiting to bloom, like a lightbulb in a darkened room, I'm sitting there waiting for you to come home and turn me on.\" \"Lonestar\" is a slow country blues. \"I could almost go there just to live in a dream,\" Norah sings on the torch blues \"I've Got to See You Again.\" \"Painter's Song\" is whimsical. \"One Flight Down\" has a smoky vocal with a pretty melody. The Jones' penned \"Nightingale\" has a pretty guitar part with dreamy vocals. Jones' piano gives a sense of flight and freedom as she sings, \"You can take me away.\" \"The Long Day Is Over\" has a stately feel.

Arif Mardin did a great job at the production. The CD begins with the usual sweet music \"I don't know why\", \"You'll always be in my mind.\" The guitar in the quiet \"Seven Years\" is beautiful, and Nora sings songs like Mona Lisa. \"The smiles on her face tell a beautiful story of her own. \". Alexander's song \"Feelin 'in the Same Way\" is a lively love song full of energy. Jones wrote a song entitled \"Follow Me\". It's one of the best songs never. \"Shoot the Moon\" with a lazy guitar is a slow song on its own. My favourite song \"I Turned On\" by JD Loudermilk. Nora's wise voice was tempted: \"Like a flower waiting to bloom, like a light bulb in a dark room, sitting there waiting to go home, let me enlighten you.\" \"Lonestar\" is a slow Country blues song. \"I could almost go there just to live in a dream,\" Nora agreed singing the torch, \"Let me see you again.\" \"Artist's Song\" makes sense. The song \"I'm One-Down Down\" has a catchy scent and a beautiful song. Jones \"Nightingale\" has a beautiful part of the guitar and beautiful vocals. Jones' piano gives the feeling of flying and freedom when the sings, \"You can take me away.\" \"The send of a long day\" is dignified.

So we have the EXACT same album, track listing - but acoustic. Wow, thanks for that. Perfect for all those girls who bought the first album, you know, the jones that don't really LIKE music (not in a mad way, to buy more than one album a year for anything stupid like that). So in case the original album was a bit too edgy for you, a bit too extreme and hardcore, with a few cloud guitars and stuff - this is the one for you. The same album but with the sound of a woman who has absolutely given up on music and making something new, content to using the same songs and rest on her laurels forever. Isn't that all her fans want of her in the first place? It's a depressing album, it really is. No vision for passion for inventiveness - the hits, from the only album she's made that mattered. A pointless record from a dead in the water woman. Where would the music business be if all artists pulled this stunt? Madonna would still be Like A Virgin. Michael Jackson would still be dancing with corpses instead of sleeping with children. Prince would still be wanting to party like its one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine.

Why? Is it because this is the most important factor in the disappointment of the second year since Audioslave made Franz Ferdinand's \"Out of Expulsion\" \"You Can Be Better\"? it may not be. Instead of having a great and memorable album as the best-selling \"Hot Fuss\" of two thousand and forty-four, we made a concerted effort to try and are-create the album \"Born to Run\" by Bruce Springsteen. :: Beware of the bottle :: Look, for those who hang out with Killers and become adult fans, insisting they are \"grown up\" and \"doing other things\", just stop.

Nothing, at least the songs I've tried, have emerged as a piece of New Jersey bar band. To be influenced is one thing, to be to them is another. Brandon Flowers shuddered at the sound, like someone holding a tight rope, making a fire in the synthesizer. Dave Keuning played something interesting and hit the wall, while other band members tried to keep going. Um. Their next single \"bones\" are lovely, if not because it sounds like He wants revenge, it sounds like Interpol, it sounds like the Division of Joy by David Byrne. The whole thing is a big sandwich with fresh and old meat on it. Your stomach will hurt. \u201cWhen You Were Young\u201d was nothing special, although the songs on the album were better. \"Enterlude\" and \"exitlude\" try to combine the inevitable story wherever you go. I want to say that one of the songs that can be kept would be \"Why do I count all the time?\" The interesting thing is that they are trying to make a \"second interesting album\", even though King David Bowie advises them to do it, but the has done anything.

The reason why I'm bringing up Pac in my review for Biggie's Duets album is that there's a difference between this and Biggie's posthumous albums. That is, Tupac had a huge catalog of unreleased material left over after this passing; Biggie did't. All the songs on there are verses that we've all heard already from either Biggie's first two albums for from this guest appearances on other people's albums. Thus, this is really a remix album disguised as a regular album. Get it? And as my brother said, the most irritating thing about this album (aside from the fact that \"duet\" means two people) is how the songs are constructed around these old Biggie verses. It's hard to say what the worst songs are, but I'll have to go with \"Mi Casa\" (with R. Kelly and Charlie Wilson) and the badly produced wrap\/rock song \"Wake Up\" (featuring Korn). \"Nasty Girl\" is also pretty cheesy, and speaking of that, if Biggie was alive, I seriously doubt the'd be collaborating with Nelly, for some of these other average emcees like Boyz N Da Hood (\"Hustler's Story\") for especially Jim Jones (see \"I'm With Whateva\" -- but actually, Biggie's not even in that song, so I don't know if that really counts). Another annoying thing is the way Diddy tries to change the meanings of some of these songs. The aforementioned \"Nasty Girl\" was originally \"Nasty Boy\", and now it just seems to be a club anthem about nothing. And \"What's Beef\" has transformed into \"Beef\", with Diddy yelling at the send, \"Beef does't not happen on records. You don't KNOW what beef is!\" Apparently, HE does't know, for the forgot. While ALL the guest stars' verses don't necessarily fall short, the only really interesting parts of this whole album are the testimonies from Voletta Wallace and Biggie's kids. And I'm not really surprised by the four and five-star reviews for this album because, not to be funny, but I think that if an album came out called The Notorious B. I. G. Sings Sinatra, those people would give THAT a high rating too. Anyway, I'm a fan of Biggie too, but continually reusing this verses is not the way to preserve this legacy, so. Diddy?

The reason I mentioned Pac in my review of the album Biggie's Duets is that there is a difference between this album and Biggie's post-death album. In other words, Tupac has a huge catalog with many unpublished items left over after this period. Good luck. All the songs are verses we heard on Biggie's first two albums, because this thing came from other people's albums. So, this is a mixed album hidden like a regular album. Get it? As my brother said, the most annoying thing about this album (other than the \"duo\" which means two people) is the way this song is built around these old verses of Biggie. It's hard to say which song is the worst, but I've had to pick \"Mi Casa\" (with R. Kelly and Charlie Wilson) and the surrounding \/ hit song \"Wake Up\" (with Korn as a brand). The \"beautiful girl\" is also very difficult. Speaking of which, if Biggie is still alive, I doubt the will work with Nelly. With some common emcees, such as Boyz N Da Hood (\"Hustler's Story\") and especially Jim Jones (See \"I'm with Weeva\" - but in reality, Biggie does't even appear in the song, so I don't know if this is really important).

The girl mentioned above \"Unloved Girl\" was originally \"Nasty Boy\", but now it looks like just a club song about something. \"What Beef\" was \"Beef\", Diddy shouted when the posted: \"Meat won't appear on the record.

While not all of the guest star poems karen\u2019t enough, the most interesting part of the album is the testimony of Voletta Wallace and Biggie\u2019s children.

The reason I increased the PAC in my review of Biggie's Duets album is that there is a difference between the recently deceased Biggie album. That is, Topak had a large list of unpublished items that remained after that passage. Begi did't. All of this songs are verses we've heard on other people's albums since the guest's presence on Buggy's first two albums. So, this is a remix album that is printed like a regular album. got it? And as my brother said, the most disturbing thing about this album (apart from the fact that \"pair\" means two people) is the way the songs are arranged with these old buggy verses. Has gone It's hard to say which songs are the worst, but I have to go for \"Mi Casa\" (with R. Kelly and Charlie Wilson) and the badly wrapped \/ split song \"Wake Up\" (with Korn's feature). \u06d4 \"Nasty girl\" is also a good thing, and when I talk about it, if Begi were alive, I have no doubt that the would be working with Nelly, some of them common games like Boys and the Hood (\"Hessler's Story\")) especially Jim Jones (see \"I'm with Viva\" - but in reality, Biggie in't in the song, so I don't know if it's really important). Another annoyance is that Diddy tries to change the meaning of some of these songs. The \"pretty girl\" mentioned above was originally a \"dirty boy\", and now it just sounds like an empty club song. And \"Beef\" has changed to \"Beef,\" Diddy shouted in a post, \"Beef in't on the record. You never know what beef is!\" Obviously, the does't know, for those who have forgotten. Although all the guest star verses fail, the only really interesting parts of this album are all the evidence of Volita Wallace and Buggy's children. And I'm not really surprised by the four and five star reviews of this album because it should't be a joke, but I think if the album could come up with the name of the infamous bag Sangs Sanatra, they would also give it a high rating.

The reason I brought Pac to my review of Biggie\u2019s Duets album is there is a difference since Biggie\u2019s last albums. That is, Tupac has a massive book of undisclosed material left over from this breach; Biggie does't. In all the songs there are verses we\u2019ve all heard about one of Biggie\u2019s first two albums appearing as a guest on other people\u2019s albums. So, this is actually a remake of the album hidden in the regular album. Hel? And as my brother said, the most annoying thing on this album (other than the fact \u201cduet\u201d means two people) is how the songs are built around Biggie\u2019s previous paragraphs. It\u2019s hard to say the worst song, but I have to follow \u201cMi Casa\u201d (with R. Kelly and Charlie Wilson) and the poorly recorded rock song \u201cWake Up\u201d (with Korn). \u201cBad Girl\u201d is beautiful too, and talking about it, if Biggie lived, I really doubt they would work with Nelly, some of the other moderates like Boyz N Da Hood (\u201cHustler\u2019s Story\u201d). ) Especially Jim Jones (see \u201cI\u2019m With Whateva\u201d - but really, Biggie in\u2019t on that song, so I don\u2019t know if that really matters). Another annoying issue is how Diddy tries to change the meaning of some of these songs. The \u201cBad Girl\u201d we mentioned was originally \u201cBad Boy\u201d, and now seems like a club song that in\u2019t there. And \"What a cow\" became \"a cow\", with Diddy shouting in the post, \"A cow does't fall off the records. You never know what a cow is!\" Apparently, the did\u2019t know, because the forgot it. While ALL of the guest stars are not short, the only interesting parts of this entire album are the testimonies of Voletta Wallace and the young Biggie. I\u2019m not really surprised at four for five stars reviewing this album because it\u2019s not funny, but I think if the album called The Notorious BIG Sings Sinatra came out, and those people would give it a very good rating .

Trash features an Alice Cooper made for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, the catchy commercial songs, the ballads, songs co-written with Desmond Child, and the collaborations with Steven Tyler and Jon Bon Jovi (also Joe Perry, Richie Sambora, Kip Winger and so on) were all attempts to make Alice seem more relevant at the time. The thing is Alice should never have scared about being current for follow trends which is pretty much what the did for \"Trash\". I can disagree all I want about Trash being a solid return to form but the results are there it did fairly well on the charts and this album gave Alice one of this biggest hits with \"Poison\". I feel the opening track and lead single of the album \"Poison\" is by far the best song there although it's also the most popular. It's just a great big catchy ballad, it helped introduce Alice to a new generation and to this day it's always a live staple in concerts. \"Bed of Nails\" is in the vein of \"Poison\" in that it's a slower songs, almost a ballad that rocks a little more than Poison . A highlight of the album. \"Spark In The Dark\" is catchy and features a riff straight out of Bon Jovi, it's a darker song overall and while it's not the best song there and its subjected to criticism I quite like it. \"House of Fire\" is a bit more Alice-like and what you would expect from him but is still aimed at being a radio song as most songs from Trash are. \"It's Only My Heart Talking\" is another ballad, Steven Tyler participates on this one and this presence helps the song and for the time this was a good ballad. I feel those are the best moments there. There are some good moments on Trash but also filler for lesser material like the title track which does't cut it in my opinion for even the album closer \"I'm Your Gun\" which is too pop and does't hold up very well over time. Other songs can vary between mediocre to average. This is the deal with Trash, it's far from Alice's finest moment and it suffers from perhaps too much production and it ends up being more of a pop album. I feel like there's less Alice, it's as if the went into the studio did what the was asked to by the producer for record company. It's truly a product of its time (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine), in fact there are songs that could have been played by just about any other Glam\/Hair bands of the era (that said it could be considered a good Glam metal album but its just not really \"Alice\" which is why some fans were\/are disappointed). Alice experimented earlier in the eighty's with albums like Zipper Catches Skin, Flush The Fashion and Dada and this one almost does exactly the opposite. While those albums are usually not considered among Cooper's best they were fun experiments and unique to say the least, Trash is very calculated and goes for what's modern and popular and in't very Alice-like. The album does't have an interesting concept unlike most of Alice's albums; the only theme I can find on Trash is love because after all, most of the songs there are love\/sexual songs pure and simple. Besides I thought that Constrictor and Raise Your Fist and Yell were comeback records. Yet there are still a few great songs on Trash that makes it worth owning even though it's obviously not Alice's finest record for this best moment. Needless to say Trash is not Alice's greatest moment. There are few songs on the album that are really good but to be honest there's also filler material and this really in't one of the best Alice Cooper albums, in fact it's a little far from it. I would't say its \"Trash\" but it's not a great album either as there is a lot of filler material. This one is for completists and hardcore fans mostly; otherwise I don't think it has much appeal besides \"Poison\" to the casual listener. Please don't take it as a stab to Alice, I love the man and what the's done, I'd still say it's worth the $six.

Trash includes Alice Cooper who produced one thousand and nine and nine hundred and eighty-nine, popular commercial songs, folk songs, songs co-produced by Desmond Child, collaborations with Steven Tyler and Jon Bon Jovi (and Joe Perry, Richie Sambora), Kip Winger Etc.) Alice looks good at the moment. The problem is that Alice does not have to be afraid to follow the situation, it almost does \"garbage\". I can\u2019t disagree with all the results I want about waste on solid return to form, but the results are that it performed well on the charts, and this album introduces Alice to one of the best of \u201cPoison\u201d. I think the opening song and one title of the album \"Poison\" is the best song, even though it's also a very popular place. This great ballad was interesting, it helped introduce Alice to a new generation, and so far, she has been the lead singer of the concert. \"Nail Bed\" is similar to \"Poison\" in that it's a slower, almost rock-n-roll ball than Poison. Album highlights. \"Spark In The Dark\" is very interesting. There is a repetition not included in Bon Jovi in general. Overall, it\u2019s a dark song. While not the best song out there, it is criticized and I really like it. \"House of Fire\" is similar to Alice, and what do you expect from her, but it still aims to be a radio song as the most unwanted song. \"Only My Heart Talks\" is one of the ballet, Steven Tyler took part in this ballad, this kind of presence helps this song, it was a good ball at the time. I think it's the best moment there. There are good times in the Trash, but there are also a few things that fill things up, such as the title song. In my opinion, even the \"I'm Your Gun\" close to the album did't cut it. and it cannot be very popular. Some songs may vary from medium to medium. This is a deal with Doti, far from Alice's best time, and can be very productive, and ultimately like a well-known album. I think Alice is lost, it's like going into a recording studio and doing what a recording company producer wants. It is actually a product of the era (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine) Moreover, some songs can be played on almost any Glam \/ hair band of the time (it is said to be considered a good metal album, But it is not at all \"Alice\", which is why some fans feel \/ disappointed). Alice tried albums such as Zipper Catches Skin, Flush The Fashion and Duck in the early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, and the album was almost directly opposed. Although these albums may not be considered Cooper's best album, they are interesting experiments and, to say the least, unique, but the garbage is well thought out, suitable for modern and popular stuff, not Alice. Unlike Alice's albums, this album is thoughtlessly interesting; the only thing I can find in the trash can is love, because after all, most of the songs are clean and simple love \/ sex songs. Plus, I think Constrictor and you raised your fist and Yell are the return records. However, there are still some great songs in Doti that they should have, although it is clear that it is not Alice's record at this good time. Needless to say, garbage is not Alice\u2019s biggest moment. There are few good songs on the album, but honestly, there are also stuff to fill, this in't really Alice Cooper's best album, in fact it's a long way off. I\u2019m not going to call it \u201cjunk\u201d, but it\u2019s not a big album because it has a lot of stuff to fill. This is only designed for perfect fans and hard-working fans; otherwise I don't think it will appeal to ordinary audiences other than \"poison\". Please don't take it as an insult to Alice, I love this man and what the did, and I would still say six dollars worth it. Trash is my feeling, as you may now know more album.

In the trash Alice Cooper is one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, popular commercial songs, songs, songs written in collaboration with Desmond Child, and Steven Tyler and John Bon Jovi (and Joe Perry, Richie Sambora, Cape Winger and so on). It was all an attempt to make Alice look more appropriate then. The point is, Ellis should never be intimidated by following the best \"trash\" style. I can't agree more with what I want about trash as it is in the form of solid returns but the results are good on the charts and this album gave Alice the biggest song with \"Poison\". I think the first song and lead single from the album \"Poison\" is the most popular song though it is also the most popular. It's just a catchy song, it helped introduce Alice to a new generation and has always been a living center of concert to this day. \"Bed nails\" \"poison\" is in the vein because the songs are slower, maybe slower than poison.

I think this is the best time of the year. There are some fun moments in the trash but filling in the little things like the title track that does't bother me in my opinion, even the closest album \"I'm Your Gun\" is very popular and does't catch on well over time. went . Some songs may be moderately different. It's a deal with Doty, far from Alice's best time and suffering from a production that's probably too much and ends up being a pop album. I realize that little Alice, like the one who entered the studio, is doing exactly what the recording company's producer requested. Really a production of the time (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four), there are actually songs that could not be played by almost any other glam \/ hair band at that time (say it can be considered a good glam metal album) But this \"Alice\" is not just a reality, which is why some fans are \/ are embarrassed). Ellis has tried out albums like Zipper Catch Skin, Flash the Fashion and Dick in the early eighties and it does almost the opposite. Although the albums that were often overlooked at Cooper's Best were, to say the least, some of the most interesting and unique experiments, the trash counts a lot and goes into some modern and popular jones and not like Alice. \u06d4 Unlike most of Alice's albums, the album does't have interesting ideas.

Needless to say, trash in't Alice's big moment. There are a few songs on the album that are really good but to be honest there are a few things to fill and this is not one of Alice Cooper's albums, it's actually a long way off. I would call it \"trash\" but it's not a good album and as such there are many things to fill. This is done to eliminate fans and especially hardcore fans.

And remember how surprising it was that the idea worked? Well, for this album, Teddy tried the concept AGAIN and brought in Terrell Phillips to replace Mark Middleton. (Why Teddy thought replacing Mark was a good idea remains a mystery.) And while this album is not as long as its predecessor, it's not as good either. In fact, it's not even close. It's hard to say what's the worst song on this album, as most of them are pretty stupid, ranging from the lazy \"Girlfriend\/Boyfriend\" to \"Can You Feel Me\", which uncreatively samples Jackson five' \"Can You Feel It\" yet again. And then lyrics don't impress either. \"Think About You\" says things like \"I put on my clothes and I think about you\" and \"I fix my dinner and I think about you\". (By the way, remember the video when the bridge came on? Were those supposed to be moves?) And the chorus to \"Black & White\" goes: \"I dream in black and white\/But I make love in color.\" WTF? Even though the production and harmony get better toward the send of the album, it still can't save songs like \"In A Rush\", which sounds like it was written, well, in a rush. And the last three songs feel like they were thrown on to fill up space. Two of them are gospel songs, and the other one is the \"Take Me There\" remix from the Rugrats movie soundtrack (without the wrap, I must add). I have two things to say about that: one) if you record a song for Nickelodeon, you should't put it on your album because its theme makes it sound like it does't belong, and two) when the best song on your album is a kiddie song, there's something seriously wrong. This album was very, very disappointing. Also, Teddy Riley seems to be plagued with deep involvement with sloppy projects.

Dont Sleep(feat Lil Scrappy, Nutso and Yaki Kadafi) is cool. Take out Lil Scrappy's lukewarm verse and its a banger. The rest of this album is musical mutilation. Pac's Life feat T I and Ashanti makes me cringe still this day. Taking Pac's verses from This Life I Lead and putting them over a corny club beat. Disgusting and the remix with Snoop Dogg and Chris Starr is absolutely pointless.

Dumpin's feat of Hussein Fettle, Papuz and Carl Thomas are the best tracks there.

This album is now a piece of music. PAC's life achievement TI and Ashanti can still make me sad. Take the PAC verses from LifeIlead and place them on top of the Carney Club. Hateful and remixes featuring Snoop Dogg and Chris Star have no purpose. Things get worse when they drag the PAC to the surface of the jar with poplar cards right (male and female). The type of substance with china seeds is very weak and the man with Ludacris and Kevin Bryce will let you sleep. What's next I like the weird rhythm but the PAC verse was pressed like this when the guests (Athri and Jay Rock) were sucking it! It was good to hear the verses of the book and the billionaire youth, but it is sad to hear the rhythm given to Shamani XL. More chaos can be tragic, with Clubby International featuring Napsi Hustle (Snoop Dog Jr.) and Young Dry Truth.

Dumpin and Hussein Fatal, Papoose and Carl Thomas are some of the best options. The verses of Pac, Fatal, and Papoose fit perfectly with the rhythm of suspicion, while Carl Thomas wants the chorus not to be crude. Don't Sleep (with Lil Scrappy, Natso and Yaki Kadafi) are cool. Release Lil Scrappy's warm verse with its outgoing sound. Some albums are not finished musically. Pac's Life feat TI and Ashanti make me confused today. Take out the verses of Pac from the Life I lead and place them in the beat of an old club. The abomination and the connection with Snoop Dogg and Chris Starr is meaningless. When they used Playa Cardz Right (male and female) to drag the Pac to the Jarule poppy stage, things got even worse. The women's version of Keyshia Cole is very weak, while the men's version is Ludacris and Keon Bryce will fall asleep. I love the unusual rhythms of the following, but Pac\u2019s verses sound like crowded there, and the guests (Atree and Jay Rock) are sucking!

It seems that they have been a band in search of an identity. Starting out as a cover band, playing mainly Metallica and Megadeth songs, and even hitting on hardcore funk\/punk rock early in their career, they have evolved into an alternative radio staple. Incubus seems to have finally settled in and gotten comfortable with the alternative style. Now it's just a question of whether they can write songs to fit the genre. With two tracks from this album that have already charted quite well, it would seem that they will be just fine in the world of Alternative Rock. The lead off track \"Megalomaniac\" and the classy \"Talk Shows On Mute\" have both done well on modern rock charts. \"Megalomaniac\", sounding unlike anything the band has never done in the past, has almost a Rush-like feel to it. With singer Brandon Boyd reaching the upper octaves for the chorus portion of the track, this is really the highlight of the record. Although the band is very talented, and Boyd is quite interesting with this vocal style, the record just never seems to \"light up\" after the great lead off track. This is one of those records that is very difficult to review. The record shows evidence of a talented band that has written some pretty good stuff, and I would understand if someone thought this record was great, . but that someone just in't me. I hate to give bad reviews to good bands, and this is a pretty darn good band. I just feel that this act has so much more to offer than what they serve up there. I think they are capable of putting a whole album together, full of songs as good as \"Megalomaniac\". This record starts to take on one neutral sound, and rarely \"wakes up\" the listener. The songs start to blend and mesh, and at times can be hard to differentiate. The song can be playing, and I can be looking directly at the back cover of the CD, and I might not be table to tell you what track is playing. I never found myself referring to anything \"special\" in any of these songs. Never said, \"That's the song with the great guitar solo\" for \"This is the song with that awesome bass line, and great drum groove.\" If you go to Baskin-Robbins thirty-one Flavors, and order vanilla in a cup, you might like this record more than I do. This is pretty bland stuff. Being a very bland record, it's hard to site any references there, but I'll try to highlight some points of interest for you. Of course, as I've already mentioned, \"Megalomaniac\" is a real winner. Great hook and nice vocal track. The title track has some nice soaring vocal moments also. Another song entitled \"Sick Sad Little World\" actually sounds like a crippled attempt at a Dream Theater song. Not a bad song, but this is definitely not Dream Theater. In fact, I must apologize to Dream Theater for drawing any comparison. Another good solid track on this album is \"Pistola\". A track that starts off with a UFO landing-type effect, and progresses to a hook that follows you around for the rest of the day, this in't too bad. As for the rest of the record though, . vanilla. I look forward to hearing more from these guys in the future. I really think it's possible that they might cut a stellar album, . but this main't it.

It seems they are always in the band looking for an ID. Starting with the band, they mostly played Metallica and Megadeth songs, until they came across hardcore \/ punk rock early in their careers, and have grown to become alternative radio stations. The Incubus seems to have been completed and adapted to another style. It's just a question of whether they can write songs of this nature. The two songs on this album have made good charts, and it looks like they'll be fine in another rock country. Leading singer \"Megalomaniac\" and classic \"Talk Shows On Mute\" both performed well on modern stone charts. \"Megalomaniac\" does't sound like anything the band has never done before, it almost feels like Rush. With singer Brandon Boyd reaching the upper octave in part of the song chorus, this is the best on record. Although the band is very talented, and Boyd's style of speaking is very interesting, but after the excellent lead, this record did not look \"bright\". This is one of the most difficult records to look at. This record shows evidence of a talented team writing great things. If anyone thinks this record is good, I will understand. But that person is not me. I hate giving a bad review to a good team, this is a very good team. I just think this behavior is more than what they give there. I think they can put the whole album together, and the songs on it are just as good as \"Megalomaniac\". The record began to show a neutral sound, refusing to \"awaken\" the audience. The songs begin to blend in and blend, sometimes hard to separate. This song can be played, I can look directly at the back of the CD, without telling you which song is playing. I never found myself mentioning anything \u201cspecial\u201d in these songs. Never say, \"This song has a great guitar\", because \"This song has a big bus and big drums.\" a better record than me. These are the obvious things. As a clear record, it\u2019s hard to find any references, but I\u2019ll try to highlight some of the things you\u2019re interested in. Of course, as I said, \"pride\" is the most successful. Big hooks and beautiful vocal songs. The title track also has a good time for sound quality. Another song called \"Sick Sad Little World\" sounds like a broken attempt at the Dream Theater song. It's a beautiful song, but this is certainly not a drama. After all, I have to apologize to the Dream Theater for making a comparison. One single on this album is \"Pistola\". The trail starts with a UFO-type stop and continues to the next peg throughout the day, which is incorrect. According to the whole record, vanilla. I look forward to hearing more news from these people in the future. I think they can cut a great album. But this is not the case at all.

Looks like they were a band looking for ownership. Starting as a score group, Metallica and Megadeth sang, and they also played hardcore funk \/ punk rock early in their careers, moving to another radio station. The incubus seems to have settled down and become independent in a different way. Now the only question is whether they can write songs according to gender? With two tracks already well-planned on this album, it looks like they'll fit in with the alternative rock world. The hit song \"Megalomaniac\" and the high quality \"Talk Shows on Silence\" did well on the current rock charts. \"Megalomaniac\", which seems like the group has never done anything before, almost felt the rush. With singer Brendan Boyd reaching the top of Optio in part of the track quorum, this is a true glimpse of the record. Although the band is very talented, and the band is very interesting in this style of sound, the record does not seem to \"shine\" after leading the track. This is one of the most difficult records to review. The record shows the evidence of a talented team that wrote great things, and I can tell if anyone thinks this record is good. But that person does't love me. I hate giving bad reviews to good bands, and it's a really good band. I just feel that there is more work to be done to help you in this process than they are working there. I think they are table to put together a complete album, which is full of beautiful songs like \"Megalomaniac\". The record begins with a neutral voice, and rarely \"awakens\" the listener. The songs begin to blend in with the mesh, and can sometimes be difficult to separate. The song can play, and I can see directly on the back cover of the CD, and I can't be at the table to tell you which track is playing. I never found myself talking about any of the \"specials\" in these songs. It was never said, \"This is a big guitar song\" for \"this song has that bass line, and a big drum groove.\" If you go to Baskin-Robbins thirty-one flavors, and order vanilla in a cup, you'll love this record more than I do. That's a good thing. Being a very light record, it is difficult to trace there, but I will try to highlight some of the points that interest you. Well, as I said, \"Megalomaniac\" is a real winner. Great hook and beautiful soundtrack. The title track also has some great soundtracks. Another song called \"Sick Seed Little World\" actually sounds like a lousy attempt at a Dream Theater song. Not a bad song, but it's not a drama theatre at all. In fact, I have to apologize to Dream Theater for the comparison. Another good solid track from this album is \"Pistola\". A track that starts with the effect of a UFO descent, and then continues on the hook that follows you all day, in't too bad. For the rest of the record,. Looking forward to hearing more from these people in Vanilla in the future. I think it's possible that they cut a great album. But it is not.

Incubus seems to have finally settled in and is satisfied with the other style. Now it\u2019s just a question of whether they can write songs that fit the genre. With two tracks from this album well illustrated, it looks like they will do well in the world of Alternative Rock. The megalomaniac track and the show \u201cShow Shows On Mute\u201d have both done modern rock part. \u201cMegalomaniac\u201d, which sounds different from anything the band has done, is almost Rush-like.

I liked most of the Eurythmics products before they broke up and I was a bit confused to break down most electronics based on their sound. Annie released Reason Because, for the first time, and as much as I like it now, the video and song scene has prevented me from buying the Diva album since I feared this style would become widespread. The second and third in their own The Japanese Mirror & Little Bird are good examples of what can be achieved if Annie tries to climb. Unfortunately for this album, that\u2019s about it. Almost eighty% of this album are ballads and that is a very high percentage to make a great album in my opinion. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the sound, and the album is mostly electronic but the number of expands slows down this album. One of the saving graces is the thirteen dimensional design of Youth and Beauty because the epilogue of this album is complete with vinyl textures, it completely contradicts everything before it but it is a fitting ending. Great effects: Walking with a broken glass, Little Bird, Make Beautiful, Reason.","overall":3,"summary":"Too many ballads on solo outing by Eurythmics singer","unixReviewTime":996278400,"reviewTime":"07 28, 2001"}

I liked a lot of Eurythmics stuff before they parted ways and I was a little upset that they downloaded most of the electronics whose sound was taken from them. Why Annie first released as a single, and when I like it now, video images and songs forced me to buy Diva's album permanently because I was afraid the genre would't work. The second and third songs of Walking on Broken Glass and Little Bird are good examples of what can be achieved if Annie tries to go up. Sorry about that album, it's about it. About eighty-eight percent of this album is dance and that's a lot more than enough to make a good album in my opinion. There is nothing wrong with the sound, and most of the albums are electronic, but the number of ballads slows down the album. A saving grace is the thirty style song Cape Young and Beautiful because the episode of this album is completed with funny and nail sketches, which is completely different from everything in front of it but it is a proper ending. Remaining track: Walking with broken glass, little bird, keep it small and beautiful, why.","overall":3,"summary":"Too many ballads on solo outing by Eurythmics singer","unixReviewTime":996278400,"reviewTime":"07 28, 2001"}

Greenwood \"PorterW\"","helpful":[5,6],"reviewText":"Secret Messages sure were secret messages, because the band began closing popularity yet only made this album because a contract said so, but how can songs such as these come from JEFF's broken heart? In my opinion, only two weaker (not weak) tracks on this album and Jeff actually kind of solo's on the guitar on this album. Secret Messages (the song) deserves more credibility being an awesome pop song, with a more personal feel to Jeff. LOSER GONE WILD is definitely worth the wait for the refrain, another closer gone wild, catchy. BLUEBIRD is one of the more spirit rising tracks, that works! TAKE ME ON AND ON is a track that reminds me of nights with your girl, and you want to be with her. TIME AFTER TIME, is a little weak, but I always listen to it for some reason? Must be a good song if I keep coming back to it. FOUR LITTLE DIAMONDS is the hard rocker on the album, but has basically the same drum loops that Don't Bring Me Down has except the refrain, so it's quite familiar to it but different with some guitar clicks and more than one drum beat, good song. STRANGER is just sweet pop with a nice solo in it. DANGER AHEAD is easily everones favourite on the album, and no one can turn down the song because it's imposibble to not like it, just hear it to believe it. LETTER FROM SPAIN started weak in my opinion with the \"letter\" singing in the background which just makes me feel like smashing something, but the singing eventually makes up for it if you don't think about \"letter\" background vocals. TRAIN OF GOLD is a mediocre song, but it has a guitar solo so it'll do. ROCK'N'ROLL IS KING is the hit of the song, which reminds me of \"HOLD ON TIGHT\" but a hit none the less. The extra tracks are great, and the best is AFTER ALL, nice guitar.

Next up comes the album \"Made You Lok\" (Hello Remy), a memorable track with sick heartbeats. Then \"Last Real N **** Alive\" is a deep song in which Nass talks about the game, the loss of rivals, close friends like JZ. \"Zone Out\" feat. Track of heroes can be sent. \"Hey Nass\" feat. Kelsey and Claude Ortiz of City High find great comfort when Nass talks about an honest woman. \"I Can\" is a beautiful track with piano music in which Nass talks to young people, informing them that with hard work and patience they can become whatever they want. \"Book of Rhymes\" and \"Thugs Mansion\". Topic, follow Jay Phoenix, the first is a great free track, the second is another track song that was released on the latest Topic release, it does't work on this album. Nass followed him with a rigid banger \"mastermind\" made by an alchemist. Nass and Alicia Keys collaborated on another fun song, \"Warrior Song.\" Nass met with the QB wrapper and the lake is considered a shortcut to the \"Revolutionary War\". A picture of the late Nass's mother Anna Jones on the cover of her album and \"Dance\" is a deep gift to her and we use the pop horn Olu Dara. Chast performed the feat of \"Paradise\". Julie Blake closed the album completely. Bonus tracks are decent, although it would be nice if they were all on one disc. The song's mastermind Nass's \"Son of God\" is clear that the album the should have without a few albums to fill the album is really good.

Much can be said of this particular album. So much has been made of this albums legendary status and it being one of the \"greatest live albums of all time\" it all just can't help but diminish it's impact. Now saying this is even JAMES BROWN'S greatest live album of all time would be padding things just a tad but the fact is this is one of this most defining albums of this late fifty's\/early sixty's career. One big reason is that it represented something of a concluding chapter onto this part of this career. At this point JB's slideshows with this Famous Flames were still based around a dozen for so of this early blues and do-wop oriented singles such as \"I'll Go Crazy\",\"I Don't Mind\", the rollicking \"Think\" (one of my personal favourites) and this then new single \"Night Train\". But it's not the presentation of those songs musically that really makes this live performance what it was. For one rather than playing before an Apollo audience so excited that this performance was interrupted by screams and applause the audience sounds serve more to cheer him on from tune to tune, stopping largely during the performance due to the wordless level of respect James' presence seemed to demand. There's a medley of songs there but the whole album plays that way;James and the tight Flames flow from one horn fuelled soul workout into another with little more than a scream and\/or a horn blast to indicate passing into another song. Also elements from songs such as \"Please Please Please\" appear throughout the song and James often refers back to \"Lost Someone\" and \"I'll Go Crazy\" as phrases throughout the album-treating this single songs as parts of a unified entity as opposed to separate statement. Since albums as a studio entity were almost unknown during this time outside Ray Charles and Frank Sinatra, for someone as single based as James Brown the live show seemed the best way to express this unity in this music at the time. At the times when the audience does interact with James it's very strong and mutual and seems to happen almost as a matter of course. Because the visual element of James' dancing, the whole cape routine and sweating is missing you'll have to refer to the liner notes for photographs of the event to get something of the idea of what it looked like if you even need to. In fact for the most part the musical presentation there should do the job nicely. They say music cannot create imagery but the nature of albums such as this will make many people wonder, as it did with me as to the all around truth of that statement.","overall":4,"summary":"The One And Only Mr.Dynamite Just Starting To Do It!","unixReviewTime":1287878400,"reviewTime":"10 24, 2010"}

And singing stuff like \"Please Please Please\" appears throughout the song and James often refers to phrases throughout the album after \"Lost Someone\" and \"I'll Go Crazy\" - this one song is a joint venture.

The method was known. Sometimes the audience working with James is very strong and consistent and it seems to be the norm. Due to James's visual content, the cap and the whole sweating process are lacking. You'll need to look at the liner notes in the event photos to get an idea of what it looks like when you need it.

There was a period in the late seventy's-early eighty's where the was untouchable. He had a distinct sound, managed to get extraordinary results from otherwise ordinary artists, and took established superstars to new levels. Consider the set of albums all released within a short (three-four year) time frame: Michael Jackson's \"Off The Wall\" and \"Thriller\", George Benson's \"Give Me The Night\", this own\"The Dude\", and things like this Brothers Johnson album. You will find impeccable, tasteful production values, engineered to standards that hold up to the most revealing remastering. Layer upon player of drums with various other percussive instruments; fat luscious bass lines; orchestral segments with sweet string sections and funky horns; crisp (and more prominent than you'd recall) guitars and judicious use of the then-nascent synthesizer. Above all, there were the vocals, both upfront and back-up choruses. He made people known for their voice, like Jackson, James Ingram and Patti Austin, sound as good as they never have, and took those not necessarily known for their vocal prowess (like Benson and the Brothers) to levels they've never reached before for since. So there, on \"Light Up The Night\", we have nine sweet-sounding tracks from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, led off by the tremendous \"Stomp!\". everything a single should be. It sounds perfect on the radio, in your car for on headphones. A driving dance beat, anthemic vocals, killer horns and strings, melodies that hit you one after another with their clarity and soul. It has synth solos and bass solos (!) yet is better off with them as opposed to without them. That in and of itself is amazing. The Brothers Johnson were masterful musicians. I still have videotapes from Don Kirshner's Rock Concert where they demonstrate their chops for all to see. They were low level stars, but among the most desired session men of their time. I swear the bass playing sounds like someone trying to tame a wild animal. He does't play it as much as the unleashes it. Nothing on the album matches that initial high, but I found myself recognizing all the songs, even though I probably have not listened to this album since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. The title track is a swift poppy number with soothing background vocals. Speaking of, Michael Jackson often showed up as a background vocalist on other people's albums around that time, and there does a nice job on \"This Had To Be.\"The ballads, like \"Treasure\" and \"All About The Heaven\", all sound like the early eighty's ballads you know and love. They just happen to \"sound\" really really good. Seriously. this Quincy Jones character was taking \"sow's years\" and making \"silk purses\" as if it was as natural and easy for him as breathing. There's an instrumental (\"Smilin' on Ya\") and a near-instrumental (\"Celebrations\"), just to warn you. Overall, you will get this because:a) you love \"Stomp\". And you should.b) you have some affection for The Brothers Johnson. And you should.c) you appreciate Quincy Jones' artistry.

The fluid mix of wrap and rock is present there to full effect. `Faint' is strong and memorable. `Nobody's Listening' is a unique and fun track, using the flint as the main instrument and it works exceedingly well.

It seems a tad repetitive and lazy, like they did't give it much thought. `Figure.nine' is strong, yet reminiscent of some of their better work and so it tends to pale in comparison (if comparisons are made). `Numb' was a huge hit for them, but like `Somewhere I Belong', it seems to strike me as a lesser effort. `From the Inside' has heart and works better than `Easier to Run' in the ballad department (it does't come off as desperate). Of course, `Session' is just noise, but it's a nice upgrade from the noise they offered us on `Hybrid Theory'. it gives us perspective on who they are as a band.

{"orig_index":58210,"reviewerID":"A1EQIRL8ZVZPDN","asin":"B002C6K82K","reviewerName":"Rudolph Klapper \"klap4music\"","helpful":[6,6],"reviewText":"Over the course of a decade, Eric Johnson has lead the Fruit Bats through musical terrain both poppy and experimental, mixing Americana folk with bubbly indie, salt-country with melodic chamber-pop. With their fourth release, The Ruminant Band, Johnson & Co. continue to live up to their reputation as musical blacksmiths and the title itself. A ruminant is a mammal with four stomachs, giving it the ability to digest and are-digest food to extract the maximum amount of nutrients from a single bite, and with The Ruminant Band, the Fruit Bats have again created a record of many disparate angles, Johnson's viewpoint on the past forty years of music chewed and are-chewed into a distinctly Fruit Bats release. Johnson has always been a hard talent to pin down, but this penchant for combining many different styles into a seamless whole remains intact. It's been four years since the Fruit Bats' last, but those four years (four stomachs, anyone?), which have had Johnson become a member of the Shins and the Fruit Bats fall by the wayside, seem to have only ignited Johnson's creativity further. The Ruminant Band runs the gamut from classic rock `n roll in the Neil Young vein to light summer pop reminiscent of Elephant six groups, and while nothing there is mind-blowingly original for particularly revolutionary, it is a fresh, solid collection of intimate alternative. Opener \"Primitive Band\" stomps along a `seventys rock groove and a completely unfettered solo, while guitars bring and twang like the Allman Brothers on the titular track and the country-fried, fuzzed-out \"My Unusual Friend.\" Johnson's vocals, which call to mind a nasally mix between the Minus five's Scott McCaughey and Kevin Barnes with a more country bent, stay in a higher register for most of the time there. His rather twee, always emotive pipes make a hokey chorus like \"I'll never snow on your parade \/ I'll never bring a cloudy day\" on the excellent \"Tegucigalpa\" an earnest promise rather than a corny sentiment, and stand in perfect contrast to the rugged, full-bodied instrumentation on display throughout.

Their ability to maintain their trademark instrumental precision with extremely soulful clicks and exchanges is now well renowned. Many bands have since attempted, to carrying levels of success to approximate this approach and in the sixty's the sound served this band so well that they became the main Stax house band during that era while making remarkable singles under their own name. Of course the title track and it's shadow \"Mo Onions\" are by all accounts the strongest general itunes on this album; songs that people who may not even know the name of the band will recognize and that encompasses the very best in their precision based instrumental bluesy soul music. One thing that's important to mention is this album was recorded in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two and at that time (with the possible exception of Ray Charles) even artists such as James Brown were not so much thinking in terms of album oriented music as much utilizing the long playing medium to collect together singles into collections that sounded cohesive even if they really were't. And so as the case with this album. Considering that Stax than't been around too many years before this was released there's some similarities to an earlier Stax band known as The Mar Keys so on likeminded itunes such as \"Rinky-Dink\" which as that band had done used the idea of precision and melody together. It's a bit stiff than the usually fairly loose approach the MG's had, and I need to add there is a difference between precision and looseness. A similar situation occurs on other interpretations of songs such as \"Twist And Shout\" and \"Lonely Avenue\" although the secular gospel wail of \"I Got A Woman\" comes across a lot better as they let loose a lot more rhythmically. \"Behave Yourself\" and \"Stranger On The Shore\" do a bit better overall due to the fact they showcase a slower, more foreboding business that allows the soul of their musicianship to shine through to a greater degree. Even though this in't their first album it probably in't the place to begin appreciating the MG's music. For most other reviewers are right:the band packed it's trademark punch more on singles so a well assembled compilation such as the recentBooker T. & The MG'S :The Definitive Soul Collectionbut for those who have such a collection and want to investigate the spirit of their music in it's original context this in't a bad place to go actually.","overall":4,"summary":"The Debut Of The MG's!","unixReviewTime":1287100800,"reviewTime":"10 15, 2010"}

And \"Time\" and \"Dirty Little Secret\" are good stories. I thought this would be MONI Sarah's best album because I haven't heard of all her old things. But it's still a very good recording. Like I said before, a lot of the songs are dark on this subject, but the songs are still more charming and less painful than you say, Beck's C Change (sorry, I liked this album. Tried hard). With all the comparisons aside, Afterglow is a great album that I should have picked up soon.

However, I'm not sure why this album is called Afterglow, because most of the time, the lyrics are just black, which is evident in titles like \"Fallen\", \"World On Fire\" and \"Train Wreck\". After all, people began to think that there could be problems in her marriage to Ashwin Sudd. But this does not mean that the discs are worth a jump \u2014 in fact, they are far from perfect. The song on the album is \"Push\", which is a smooth declaration of her husband with a good background and harmony. But the \"corrupt\" nominated Grammys karen't far behind. And \u201ctime\u201d and \u201clittle dirty secret\u201d are good stories to think about. I said this might be Sarah's best album because I can't hear all of her old stuff. But this is a great recording. As I said before, most of the songs have dark themes, but these songs are still as catchy and boring as Beck's Sea Change (sorry, I tried my best to love this album).

I disagree with the allmusic review, \". that for all its sophistication, it's more about style than substance.\" There is a real sweetness in Paris Rain that is reflected both musically and lyrically. The opening track \"Ideal World\" strings beautiful sentiments over a simple melody which creates an instant classic. This is emphasized by the third track \"Catch On\" that combines a pretty melody with the lyric \"When will we catch on to the glory of love.\" When the published review I mentioned says, \"When Russell in't singing about romantic love, she's singing about universal love in such songs as 'Ideal World' and 'Catch On' which are as fuzzy-headed as they are well meaning.\" I disagree. Was John Lennon's \"Imagine\" fuzzy-headed? Russell shines with the love songs too like \"She's In Love\" with its simple guitar and vocal beginning and its samba-like rhythms. \"Walkin' In New York\" pulses to a rhythm that imitates a leisurely walk. Russell's synth guitar and keyboard move the melody of \"Expect a Miracle\" beyond atmospherics while the lyric urges, \"don't stop believing' in love.\" Sounds good to me! \"Please Felipe\" sounds like a page of diary put into a song with the great lyric line of celebration, \"Carnival becomes my heart.\" My favourite on the album is Brenda's collaboration with Carole King on \"Move the Moon.\" You can hear King's input with the pop distinctiveness from melody to chorus and the energy created. The message that independent women need love too is great! On \"Something About Your Love\" I swear I hear the lyric, \"love is like a porcupine\" which I thought was inventive, but can't find on the lyric sheet! -- Must be my years on that one! The CD concludes with the smoky bar ballad \"Baby Eyes\" with Kirk Whahm's mellow sax drenching the melody like a sweet liqueur. If I had criticisms of the CD, I might have preferred a bit more rhythmic variety and a blue umbrella instead of a red on the cover because this is more \"blue music\" to me. \"Love & Paris Rain\" with its breathy vocals and slightly disjointed melody does not work so well for me. But this album is a VERY strong offering. So when the other review says, \"She is a self-satisfied performer; you can hear her sense of her own significance in practically every note,\" understand that some are simply not read for a loving world and react with hostility. Paris Rain is a gem.","overall":4,"summary":"A Ray of Sunshine","unixReviewTime":982281600,"reviewTime":"02 16, 2001"}

I do not agree with the musical saying, \"Although difficult, style is something that is done.\" \"The Rain of Paris\" has a real flavor, which is reflected in the music and the song. The opening song \"The Right World\" made a good impression on a simple song and immediately became a classic. The third song \"Hold\" emphasizes this point, which combines beautiful music with the words \"When shall we receive the glory of love?\" As I've already said, I've noticed, \"When Russell does't using romantic love, the sings love in the universe in songs like\" Ideal World \"and\" Catch Up \". Both songs are vague and meaningless.\" I do not agree. Is John Lennon's \"thought\" obscure? Russell also shines through on love songs, such as \"In Love\", its simple guitar and opening vocals and rhythm-like rhythms. \"Walkin 'in New York\" pulsates to mimic the rhythm of a fun walk. Russell's guitar-made guitar and keyboard pass the song \"Expect a Miracle\" beyond the surrounding air, and the lyrics surge \"Don't stop believing in love.\" Sounds good! \"Help Felipe\" sounds like putting a diary sheet in a song with celebratory lyrics, \"Carnival becomes my heart\". My favourites on the album \"Move the Moon\" are Brenda and Carole King. You can hear King's contribution, from the song to the chorus and the power the made. The message that independent women also want love is great! In \"Something About Your Love\" I swear I heard the words, \"love is like a snail.\" \u2014That's my page! The CD ends with a catchy bar \"Children's Eyes\", and Kirk Whahm's soft saxophone is filled with a song like a sweet beer.

I agree with allmusic's analysis, \"In all its structure, it's more structural than material.\" In the brain of Paris there is a real dessert that is both musical and literary. The opening track of \u201cWorld Ideal\u201d combines beautiful emotions with simple itunes that create a fast space. This is highlighted in the third track \"Catch On\" which combines a beautiful melody and literature \"When will I catch the glory of love.\" When the published review I mentioned said, \u201cWhen Russell in\u2019t singing about love, the sings about international love songs like\u2018 Ideal World \u2019and\u2018 Catch On 'which is confusing if it makes sense. Well I don't agree. Is John Lennon The \"thinking\" dizziness? New York \"beats the rhythm and shows loose rhythm. Russell\u2019s synth guitar and keyboard moved the \u201cFilo Miracle\u201d rhythm out of the atmosphere where rhythm-driven, \u201cdon\u2019t stop believing\u2019 in love. \u201dIt seemed to me to be one. good! \"Please Felipe\" looks like a souvenir page with a song with a great song for the celebration, \"Carnival has become my heart.\" My favourite at the door is Brenda and Carole King\u2019s collaboration on \u201cMove the Moon.\u201d You hear King\u2019s introduction with popcorn pop sorting from song to energy and energy creation. The message that independent women need love is great! In \u201cSomething About Your Love\u201d I swear to hear the literature, \u201clove is like a boocupine\u201d which I think is a creative one, but I can\u2019t see it on the lyric sheet! - My years must have been that one! The CD ends with the smoky wings of \u201cBaby Eyes\u201d with a Kirk Whahm plate that flavors the rhythm like sweet wine. If I had a criticism of the CD, I might have preferred a little more variation and a blue umbrella than red on the cover because it\u2019s mostly \u201cblue music\u201d for me. \u201cLove & the Rain of Paris\u201d with its breathless voice and a little chopped melody would\u2019t work for me. But this album is a very strong donation. So when another reviewer says, \"She's self-satisfied; you hear her feelings about the importance of every action,\" understand that some are not easy to read in a world of love and reaction with hate. The brain in Paris is a mirror.","overall":4,"summary":"A Ray of Sunshine","unixReviewTime":982281600,"reviewTime":"02 16, 2001"}

I don't agree with all the music reviews, \"that in all this research, it's more about style than anything else.\" Paris is a real thrill in the brain that is reflected in the music and the music. The opening track \"Ideal World\" evokes sweet sentiments on simple music that makes it an instant classic. The third track, \"Catch On\", emphasizes that it combines beautiful music with the song \"When We Hold The Glory of Love Firmly.\" While the published review I mentioned says, \"When Russell does't using about romantic love, the sings about universal love in songs like 'Ideal World' and 'Catch On' which There are headlines because they have good meaning. \" I do not agree. Was John Lennon's \"Imagination\" a complicated title? Russell shines with love songs like \"He's in love\" with this simple guitar and the beginning and the rhythm of the sound. \"Walking in New York\" is a rhythm that mimics free movement. Russian synth guitars and keyboards signify \"Wait for Miracle\" music in the air, while the song emphasizes, \"Don't stop believing in love.\" I like it! \"Please Philip\" sounds like a diary page with a big line of celebration singing, \"Carnival becomes my heart.\" What I really like about this album is Brenda's collaboration with Carol King on \"Move the Moon\". You can hear King's involvement in various forms of pop, from music to chorus and created energy. The message that free women need love is great too! \"Something about your love\" I swear I heard the song, \"Love is like a torch\" which I found useful, but not found on the music sheet! - I have to be old for that! The CD ends with a smoky bell called \"Baby Eyes\" in which Kirk Wham's soft sex music is soaked like a sweet drink. If I had a CD critique, I would prefer to have more rhythm and blue umbrella than red cover because it is \"blue music\" for me. \"Love and the Paris Rain\" does't work well for me with its breathtaking sound and a bit of split music. But this album is a very powerful contribution.

There was a time when I would have agreed. Fortunately, I found a way to approach this music. I was giving this some thought this morning while listening to Coltrane's Om and ruminating on how form eventually started to reveal itself in what originally sounded like a mess. It occurred to me that the later works are very much like those puzzle pictures we used to see back in the ninety's. When you first looked, it was just a rectangle with a bunch of tiny random shapes and color. Your friend kept telling you that there was a clipper ship in that picture. You strained to see it, got frustrated, put it down, picked it up, tried it again without success. And then you found that when you stopped trying to see that clipper ship and simply relaxed a threeD hologram emerged from the backdrop and yes, there really was a clipper ship hidden in that mess. That's what listening to Coltrane's later day works are like. The emperor is in fact wearing cloths, you just haven't relaxed, put away your preconceived notions for \"looking\" allowed yourself to see them. Original Review:There is so much I want to write about Ascension that I'll probably update this review from time-to-time. First, Robert Rub III and this \"Emporer's New Clothes\" review. Robert, I know exactly where you are coming from and I've written much the same sort of review about other \"post-modern\" works. I'm afraid I can't agree in this case though, for one thing, Coltrane has an incredible pedigree of a career. The man KNEW exactly what the was doing. That pedigree legitimizes this work. I fear you have sold yourself short in this instance. You have to get beyond your comfort zone in order to discover what is happening there. Anyway, enough of that. Ascension is a wild roller-coaster ride with twists and turns and free-falls that take your breath away. And when the first forty minute ride is complete we get to say \"Let's do it again!\" and listen to the thirty-eight minute Ascension I (which was really take two in the studio). Ascension is Coltrane as Shiva (the Hindu destroyer & creator), this session is truly the continental divide of Coltrane's solo career and yeah, the destroys what the built up, but the also creates something very new, so new in fact that we have to step away from your assumptions about what music should be in order to glimpse what the has discovered. Ascension is so much like life. We are all improvisers. We go through life with your own framework (values) but whether we admit it for not, we are swinging' and making up your lives as we move along. We encounter others, it changes us. We oscillate from chaos to order then back to chaos. Ascension is very much like that oscillation from chaos to a kind of improvised order. People who call this noise are not REALLY listening to what is happening. When the horns play together, the players are communicating to one another, call and response, shouts, hollers. It's incredibly powerful stuff. Then we get the alone voice of a soloist, telling this story. Freddie Hubbard stands out in particular, what an amazing player. Is it any accident that the ended up on some of the most important \"new jazz\" works such as Out to Lunch, Ole, Point of Departure? If there is one single flaw with Ascension, it might be that Hubbard's mic is too hot and at times this playing obscures the other players (during the ensemble passages). Ascension is an awe-inspiring work. It in't easy to listen to this music. Your year has been trained to what is called \"natural cadence\", resolving the Vseven to the I chord. Coltrane, in this role as Shiva, offers no such rest for you. You have to be willing to go with him, destroy what you know and then listen. This is the key to listening to every Coltrane work from Ascension onward (like Meditations for instance). That's it, that's all I'm gonna write. Yeah, I like the pretty stuff, like Trane's earlier work, for the Miles Davis Quintets. But I can dig Ascension too! Let go and let it wash over you.","overall":5,"summary":"A Musical Tour-de-Force Thrill Ride","unixReviewTime":1208649600,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2008"}

When you first look at it, it is just a rectangle with a bunch of small shapes and color on it. Your friends keep telling you that there is a clipper in that photo. You try to look at it, feel anxious, put it down, identify it, and try again, but to no avail. Then you find out that when you stop trying to see Clipper, just relax, the threeD hologram appears in the background, yes, there is a Clipper hidden in that problem. This is how it feels to listen to Coltrane's performance later. The director wears clothes, but you are not yet comfortable. Put your \u201cseeing\u201d ideas in and let them see for themselves. Original comments: I want to write more about Ascension, and I may update this information from time to time. First, Robert Rub III and this review of the \"New Employee's Property\". Robert, I know exactly where you come from, and I wrote a review about other \"current\" jobs. In this case, I'm afraid I don't agree. On the other hand, Coltrane has a wonderful history. This person knows exactly what the is doing. Interest legalizes this activity. I'm worried you sold yourself briefly in this situation. You will need to go beyond your comfort zone to find out what is going on there. In short, it is enough. The ascent of a fast roller coaster ride, turning and turning and free fall will amaze you. When the first forty-minute journey is over, we will say \"Let's do it again!\" And you listened to Ascension for thirty-eight minutes myself (I really want two people in the studio). Ascension is Coltrane as Shiva (the destroyer and creator of Hinduism). from your thinking about what music you should have to get an idea of what you found. Climbing is as real as life. We are all developers. We live your life in your frame (values), but whether we accept it for not, we all advertise and shape your life as we move forward. Together with others we changed. We went from chaos to order, and then we went back to chaos. The Ascension increase is very similar to the shift from chaos to non-order order. The caller did not pay much attention to what was happening. When the horns are played together, the players communicate, call and respond, shout, and shout. This is a very powerful thing. Then we heard the voices of the musicians and told a story. Freddie Hubbard is exceptionally good, the's an amazing player. It finally appeared in some of the most important works of \"new jazz\", such as Out to Lunch, Ole, Point of Departure, was it by chance? If Ascension has a single defect, it is likely that Hubbard's microphone is too hot, and sometimes this type of performance will overwhelm other players (in the music sector). Ascension is an amazing job. It is not easy to listen to this music. This year the trained in the so-called \"natural rhythm\", interpreting Vseven as a chord. Coltrane plays the role of Shiva and will not provide you with this kind of relaxation. You will have to be willing to go with him, destroy what you know, and then listen. This is the key to listening to all Coltrane work that starts with Ascension (as meditation). That's it, this is what I want to write. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Trane's first works of Miles Davis Quintet. But I can dig and climb! Let him go and let him wash you.","overall":5,"summary":"A Musical Tour-de-Force Thrill Ride","unixReviewTime":1208649600,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2008"}

There was a time when I agreed. Fortunately, I found a way to get closer to this music. I was giving this idea while listening to Coltrane's Om this morning and pointing out that the farm finally started to manifest itself which at first looked like garbage. It just so happened that the latest work is very similar to the puzzle pictures we saw in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. At first glance, it was just a line with many small shapes and color. Your friend has been telling you that there is a graphic plane in this picture. He was shocked, disappointed, put it down, picked it up, and tried again without success. And then you find out that when you stopped trying to see this clipper plane, only the threeD hologram that appeared in the back was loose and yes, there was actually a clipboard hidden in this mess. That's the decent thing to do, and it should send there. In fact the emperor is dressed, you are not comfortable yet, put down your preconceived notions that you are allowed to see. Original Review: I would like to write a lot about Ascension. I will review this review from time to time. First of all, Robert Rob III with this review of \"Emporr's New Clothes\". Robert, I know exactly where you came from and I've written a similar review for other \"modern\" works. I'm afraid I can't agree with this case, but, in some cases, Coltrain has an amazing job descent. Man knows very well what Jehovah is doing. The granddaughter legitimizes the plan. I'm afraid you have shortened yourself to this. You have to go through your comfort zone to know what's going on there. Still, that's enough. Ascension Jungle is a roller coaster ride with twists and turns and free spells to clear your air. And when the first forty-minute journey ends, we get \"Let's do it again.\" And listened to the thirty-eight-minute Ascension I (which actually took two to the studio). Ascension Coltrain as Shiva (Destroyer and Creator of Hindus), this session is a real breakthrough of Coltrain's work continent and yes, it destroys what has been built, but also creates something new, so You have to give up your thoughts on what kind of music you get. Height is like life. We are all developers. We live according to your framework (values) but even if we accept it, we change and move your lives forward. We meet others, it changes us. We move from chaos to order and chaos. Rising is like the transition from chaos to advanced configuration. People who say this noise are not really listening to what is happening. When the horns sound together, the players talk to each other, call and answer, shout, shout. Things with great power. Then we get a voice of a solo singer telling a story. Freddie Hubbard stands out in particular, what an amazing player. Is it a coincidence that it became perfect for some important \"jazz\" activities like Out Out to Lunch, Ole, Point of Departure? If there is anything wrong with the Ascension, it may be that Hubbard's microphone is too hot and sometimes the play hides the other players (during the reunion). Rising is a difficult task. Listening to this music is not easy. Your year has been trained in the so-called \"natural cadence\", which is solved by Vseven in I chord. Coltrane, in the role of Shave, does not offer such comfort. You have to be prepared to go with it, to close what you know and to listen. This is the key to listening to all of Coltrane's activities since the ascension (meditation, for example). That's it, I'm just going to write. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT saint for me either. But I can dig ashes too! Stop washing it for you.","overall":5,"summary":"A Musical Tour-de-Force Thrill Ride","unixReviewTime":1208649600,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2008"}

There is a time I will allow. Fortunately, I found a way to get closer to this music. I was thinking this morning as I listened to Coltrane\u2019s Om and wondered how the style began to reveal what seemed like a mess. It turns out that the latter works are very similar to the puzzle pictures we used to see in the nineties. The first time you look at it, it\u2019s just a rectangle with lots of random shapes and color. Your friend always tells you that the picture is a cutting ship. You struggle to see, you fail, you get down, you take it, you try again without success. Then you realize that when you stop trying to see the ship in a trance and you just notice the threeD hologram coming out in the back and yes, there is actually a docking ship hidden in that mess. That\u2019s what Coltrane\u2019s later listening looks like. The king is really wrapped in cloth, you don\u2019t relax, hide your former attitude of \u201clooking\u201d allowing yourself to be seen. Original Review: I have a lot to write about Ascension that I can update from time to time. First, Robert Rub III and the \u201cNew Emporer Dress\u201d. Robert, I know exactly where you come from and I\u2019ve written many similar reviews about other \u201cmodern-day\u201d jobs. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t agree with this case, though, for one thing, Coltrane has an amazing professional genealogy. The man knew what was being done. That race became legitimate in this work. I'm afraid you could sell yourself short. You need to across your comfort zone to find out what\u2019s going on there. However, that is enough. The climb is a wild type of climb with twists and a free fall that will take your breath away. And when the first forty minutes of the ride were over we said \"Let's do it again!\" and listen to thirty -eight minutes of Ascension I (which actually took two studios). Ascension is Coltrane just like Shiva (Hindu destroyer & creator), this session is really continental splitting the single Coltrane skill and yes, it destroys the built, but it also creates something very new, so it is new departure in your the thoughts about music is supposed to see what the found. Climbing is like life. We are all reformers. We go through life with your own structure (values), but whether we recognize it for not, we will change \u201dand improve your life as we go along. We get to know others, it changes us. We rise from the mess to ask and then back to the mess. The amplification is very similar to the vibration from the disturbance in some kind of improved arrangement. People shouting this noise really don't listen to what's going on. When the horns play, the players talk, call and answer, shout, hollers. It's so cloud. Then we get the alone voice of the song, which tells this story. Freddie Hubbard is standing up, the's an amazing player. Is there anyone accident that ended with some of the most important \"new jazz\" works like Out to Lunch, Ole, Point of Departure? If there's a defect in Ascension, it could be the Hubbard micro upon is very hot and sometimes this game hides the other players (across the planes). Climbing is a daunting job. It is not easy to listen to this music. Your year is trained for the so -called \"natural cadence\", which Vseven's team solves I. Coltrane, in this role as Shiva, does not give you such a break. You have to be willing to follow him, destroy what you know and then listen. This is the key to listening to any Coltrane work from Ascension previously (as an example of Meditations). That's all, that's all I'm going to write. Yes, I like good products, like Trane\u2019s previous work, by Miles Davis Quintets. But I can also dig Ascension! Leave it and wash.","overall":5,"summary":"A Musical Tour-de-Force Thrill Ride","unixReviewTime":1208649600,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2008"}

Released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three, the Eagles second album was a risky venture---a concept album with the old West as its setting and a youthful outlaw as its protagonist. The four original members--Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner--share vocals admirably. DESPERADO has a raw, sparse feel. It's direct and uncluttered, primal in its instrumentation. And the songs are some of the groups finest. DOOLIN-DALTON sets the stage beautifully, a stunning marriage of lyric and melody. TWENTY ONE celebrates the advent of manhood with its strong bluegrass influence. That innocent joy mutates to sheer self-indulgence in OUT OF CONTROL, a raucous rocker that lives up to its title. The morning after blues is poetically addressed in TEQUILA SUNRISE, one of the two hit singles from the album. And what can one say about DESPERADO that has't been said? One of rock's most beloved ballads, the song flawlessly paints an epic code to lost hopes and dreams, its urgent plea to \"let somebody love you\" forever haunting. Next is the cynically wise CERTAIN KIND OF FOOL. A quick reprise of DOOLIN DALTON segues into the driving OUTLAW MAN, my favourite track. It epitomizes the outlaw's commitment to this chosen life and foreshadows this ultimate fate. SATURDAY NIGHT is a beautiful piece, its simplicity both touching and tragic. BITTER CREEK is a bomber prelude to the inevitable showdown. The album concludes with the DOOLIN-DALTON\/DESPERADO reprise, a remarkable reworking of the lyrics, its counter-vocals bringing a rousing finale to the story. DESPERADO is a notable album for both the Eagles and country-rock. Few albums have fused country and rock so effectively.

The first four members - Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner shared some great music. DESPERADO has an initial, rare feeling. It is straightforward, clean, and a musical instrument. The songs are the most mixed. DOOLIN-DALTON A beautiful stage, a beautiful combination of songs and melody. Twenty-one celebrated the arrival of masculinity and the powerful influence of bluegrass. In \"Out of Control\", that pure happiness becomes pure entertainment. TEQUILA SUNRISE, one of the two songs on the album, interprets the poem the morning after the blues. What can be said about DESPERADO that has not been mentioned yet? As one of the best known rock ballads and series, this song reflects the epic code of hopes and lost dreams, and encourages \"Let Someone Love You\" to last a long time. Then came some stupid idiots.

SATURDAY is a beautiful day, and its beauty is so touching and so intense. BITTER CREEK is a bomb that preceded the inevitable drum. The album ended with a mix of DOOLIN-DALTON \/ DESPERADO, with an unusual change in lyrics, and their singing undoubtedly brought an send to the story.

And the songs are some of the best bands. Dolan Dalton on a beautiful stage, a wonderful wedding of songs and music. Celebrates the arrival of masculinity with the powerful effect of the twentieth bluegrass. That innocent joy turns into complete control, an attacking rocker who lives up to this title. The morning after the blues is mentioned in a poem on TEQUILA SUNRISE, one of the two most famous artists on the album. And what can one say about the unspoken dispardo? One of Rock's most popular songs, the song undoubtedly paints an epic code for lost hopes and dreams, with an immediate appeal that \"Let Someone Love You\" is always disturbing. What is clever stupidity after that? Quick replica of Dolan Dalton's parts, Outlaw Driving, is my favourite track. It symbolizes the culprit's commitment to this chosen life and symbolizes this ultimate destiny. September is a beautiful piece, its simplicity is touching and painful. BITTER CREEK is a prelude to the inevitable game bombing. The album ends with DOOLIN-DALTON \/ DESPERADO reprise, a wonderful are-use of sounds, the opposite of which brings the story to an send.

You can find a collection of bands with many tracks, but when I bought this CD in the nineties, there was no such wide selection, so it was. This CD is full of beautiful tracks. Funk and soul are among the one thousand, nine hundred and more beautiful things. I don't know why Gap Band was't given serious respect, but their fans love them and that's the most important thing, right?
