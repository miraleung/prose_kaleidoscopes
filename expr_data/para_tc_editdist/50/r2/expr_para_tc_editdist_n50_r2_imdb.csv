This is a show of the times, but I hope that Elicot will arrest one of the victims and use torture expectations to scare us even more. Especially because of the lighting problem, I gave it four points. The torch flashed, and the local flights flashed, making it even more frightening. The light from the flashlight was awakened, suddenly renewed, and startled. I know the director wanted us to see this idea, but then the mentioned the clear connection between the Elicot spot on the power socket and the aircraft.

Oh and then you wander around on the dirty mattress and all in the bad shelter the makeup and the girls hair are perfect and don’t mess with her white shirt. Although the implementation of this event had problems with the introduction it was good and I than’t tested it many times but I felt the emotion when Dean sat down reading Elicots magazine. I just know that something very personal to the soul will attract the person who violates this for her holiness. Elicot did not appear. Perhaps it was a mistake the important thing on the site (like the Elicot office) should attract the soul when the organism touches the entrance. When they parted I wanted to shout. ‘That’s how you die! Always stay and look back! 'but they did not listen to me: to Elicot's spirit and this special ability is a marvel. This is the best time of the show but I hope the horror at Elicot flowers one of these victims and uses the prospect of torture to push us further. Especially because of the light bulbs I gave to these four. The sudden darkness that shook the light all over the place as the flashlights flashed was frightening. The incoming light illuminating the flashlight and immediately a ghost on their face was startling. I understand the directors want to see this scene but then let’s mention a clear link between Elicot handling the power outlet and upcoming flights. Let the crew respond to the reality of asylum without the ability to suddenly have one-room flights. White blue planes flying like electric wings like Elicot fingerprint power.

5300,"There are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad Valentine that I don't know where to begin. I will say this though; there is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the Valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school. You know, the jones with Batman exclaiming ""You're a super crime-fighting valentine!""Valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony, one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of Scream. The villain is omniscient and nigh-invulnerable. The heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming ""HeyIjustleftmycoatbehind!"" The score is more overbearing than Norman Bates' mother. The flimsy plot follows several childhood friends, now grown up and extremely curvaceous. Since the film gives them nothing else to do, they stand around and wait until a masked stalker skills them one by one. This stalker appears to be former nerd Jeremy Melton, who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school. With Valentine's Day approaching, the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom. Melton seems like the obvious suspect. Only problem is, as numerous characters warns, in thirteen years Melton could have changed this appearance to look buff and handsome. So (insert terrified gasp there) everyone is a suspect! Here's problem one. In order to have any sense of suspense while watching Valentine, you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming David Boreanaz. Nerds don't turn into Angel when they grown up, they turn into older, balder nerds. He's not a terrible factor, but the script, by no less than four writers, gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out. Denise Richards (the busiest actress in Hollywood never to star in Baywatch) is especially exploited; most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene. Note to self: always bring a bathing suit to a Valentine's Day party. Just because it's February does't mean you might not feel like taking a little dip. The slasher in Valentine dresses in head-to-toe black with a Cherub's mask. Here's problem number two. The filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who's whacking people in the face with hot irons. Plain and simple, it's not. Instead, it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers this entire face, including this eyes and years, can move so stealthily without bumping this shins on chairs for tables. Then again, given the things the Cupid Killer does, maybe the can teleport and this eyes are on this hands. Not only is the movie bad, it in't even sure who the killer is; the final ""twist"" is more ""Huh?"" than ""Hah!"" When you're not scratching your head you're yawning, then groaning, then searching for the nearest exit. Do not watch this movie. Even if you're alone on Valentine's Day, find something, ANYTHING, else to do. You'll be glad you did.",negative

5300,"There are so many punishments in the title of the worst Valentine's Day I don't know where to start. But I will say; there was a movie that made me crave the intricacies of Valentine's Day cards distributed in elementary school. You know, Batman's Jones shouted, ""It's Valentine's Day fight!"" Valentine's Day is a bloody bloody look without a little irony. A ruthless person knows everything and is almost unreachable. When people iran around the corner and grabbed their shoulders shouting “Hey, I just put my jacket on the back!”, The heroes easily panicked. Compared to Norman Bates' mother, the notes are more controlling. A weak plan tells a few childhood friends who are now older and more bent. Because the movie did not allow them to do anything else, they just stood there waiting for the factor to hide them. The stalker appears to be former nerd Jeremy Melton, who was often rejected by women and beaten by men in high school. As Valentine's Day approached, women began to receive bad cards, which announced their misfortune. Melton seemed like a clear defendant. The only problem is that, as many characters have warned, Melton could change this look within thirteen years to make it look more attractive and elegant. So (insert shock hit there) Everyone is suspected! This is one problem. In order to be sceptical when watching Valentine, you will have to accept the fact that a decent high school kid can be David Borrenaz. Nerds will not be angels when they grow up, they will be old, bald nerds. Not bad, but no less than four answer letters left him and the other players doing nothing but screaming and love. Dennis Richards (the most busy Hollywood actress, who never appeared in the Beach Ambulance) was particularly traumatized; the most embarrassing reason is the obvious reason for letting him wear a bathing suit in front of a suspicious main game. Tips for you: Always bring swimwear to the Valentine's Day party. Just because in February that does't mean you don't want to try it. The Valentine's Day slasher wears a black-toe black and angelic veil. This is the second question. The filmmaker clearly thinks that if someone hits someone in the face with a hot iron, it would be a disturbing image. It’s clear and simple, it’s not. On the contrary, it has made me wonder if anyone wearing a mask that covers the entire face, including this eye and page, could walk around secretly without hitting the calf on a table chair. Also, when you look at what the Cupid Killer did, you could probably be sent by phone, and this eye is in this place. This movie is not only bad, it does't even know who the killer is; last ""distraction"" more ""huh?"" There's a ""ha!"" then take a closer look at Exit. Don't watch this movie.

5556,"When Exploiters become evangelist, they still exploit in the name of poverty! My first reaction after seeing the movie is  God Bless me that I am not eating fish for any non-vegetarian products! The documentary is about Lake Victoria of Tanzania where numerous varieties of lovely fishes used to live, and one day during one thousand, nine hundred and sixty somebody came and injected the mighty fish Perch, who became the exportable commodity for Tanzania to European and Japanese markets. The consequences were severe  firstly all local small and big fish were extinct; secondly the plane that came to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial/ business/ capitalist sense, so it is filled with arms and ammunition (that is what Europe can give this world); thirdly the pilots (as all migrants and travelling population like truck drivers) has to survive their sexual needs by flourishing cheap local African prostitutes for them; fourthly the brokers, dealers, middle men in the chain (mainly Indian origin business people) get richer and Tanzania's poverty remains the same; fifth poverty drives the children to crime, drugs etc. The premise to make this documentary was excellent. But has the Director Hubert Sauper succeeded in making a good documentary? It is a big NO. I say the reasons: Like in India, it requires a higher caste Brahmin to stand up and project to the world, Indian poverty and untouchables; similarly it requires an Austrain born European documentary maker to tell the world the story of Tanzania and its crumbling and ruining economy and poverty. It is the pathetic motive of unaware breeding of that rich class (who have never seen poverty for known poor), who survives, live, learn and fame like pest changing on to projecting poverty to the world as soon as they see it. There is nothing more but despise by poor people in African and India who see such images of their. The intention and motives of the Hubert seems totally flop-sided. The images, characters, locales, interviews are too grave and murky, dark and disturbing. He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present this case. What we feel in the send is pity and sadness for Africans. We also start considering the Tanzania government and people as villainous. May be some westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms would find time to discuss and debate about the pathetic living conditions of Africans, but there would be nothing more than that. The director restrains to show himself even once on the screen  so as not to be identified among the Europeans who exploit this poor country. This Director Hubert can only survive being exploiters themselves like today's CNN and BCC media giants. Hubert did not have guts for common sense to talk to any Europeans who heat for companies who import these fish products. A totally flop-sided flimsy effort!

Mary Steenburgen played the kind of person who goes down for Christmas because her husband lost this job, they close their house, they can’t sell Christmas gifts to kids and so on. Then the was joined by Harry Dean Stanton of Gideon the Christmas angel, who in that dark and long-sleeved jacket came out as a babysitter and hung the kids all day. What better way to put Mary Steenburgen’s Christmas spirit in place instead of killing her family and then offering to take her back if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is black, this Christmas seminar is like the home of Nazi refugees to Islam. The film plays all so thick that you don’t care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the film is bitter and unbelievable. I’m sure this film wanted to be like Capra, but left the excitement and excitement about what the holiday film would look like.",negative

6756,"I rented this movie with very low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. This movie is extremely good stuff. And one would never guess it was low budget. EIGHTEEN, directed by 'Richard Bell' center around an eighteen year old named Pip, played by the superb 'Paul Anthony' who leaves this home because of the circumstances surrounding the way this older brother died. He is overcome with guilt by this event and falls into a hard life of a runaway teen on drugs and alcohol. On this eighteenth birthday, this father tracks Pip down and gives him a tape left for him by this grandfather, of which the was to listen to on this eighteenth birthday. The way the whole film is told is with two simultaneous stories unfolding at the same time. The present life of Pip and the past life of this grandfather during WWeleven of which Pip listens to on the tape. The three outstanding performances in this movie are the jones from 'Paul Anthony' as Pip and 'Brenden Fletcher' playing Jason, the young eighteen year WWeleven soldier, this grandfather. Also, the role of the WWeleven wounded medic 'Macauley' played by 'Mark Hildreth.' All putting in fine performances. A couple of concerns and scenes that did't sit too well with me. the priest, Father Chris played by 'Alan Cumming' who is gay and in broad daylight pick's up the local street hustler the whole neighbourhood knows about. And then we have the local store clerk named Jeff, a sweetheart played by the attractive 'David Beaszely' who just wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason is attracted to the very unattractive and sleaze ball street hustler, Clerk, who sleeps with just about anyone and in all likelihood is a walking toxic time bomb. On top of all that the's not a very likable person. This part just did't bring true. The parts I really like the most was the flashbacks to the War. They were so well acted and very touching. There is a scene at the send where the one soldier is dying and the other soldier, 'Jason' is there for him to comfort and show him love as the plays badly injured and dying. This is such a wonderful and touching scene it left me in tears. Beautifully acted. I highly recommend this movie.

He felt guilty, and the fell into a life of debauchery and abuse. On the eighteenth birthday, my dad found Pip and gave him a tape that this grandfather had left for him, which the wanted to listen to on this eighteenth birthday. The whole way the movie is described is that two stories at the same time happen at the same time. Pip's current life and the life of this grandfather of the past eleven years, Pip listened to the tape. The three best characters in this movie are Jones in ""Paul Anthony"" as Pip and ""Brandon Fletcher"" as Jason, an eighteen-year-old WWeleven soldier, grandfather. In addition, the role of Weleven's wounded physician ""Macauley"" is played by ""Mark Hildreth"". They all showed amazing shows. Other worries and situations that make me dissatisfied. My father Chris is played by ""Alan Cumming"", the is gay, by day, catching local street gangsters known to the whole community. Then we have a local shop assistant Jeff, a lovely factor named ""David Bitzeri"", who just wants to be liked, somehow attracted by an unattractive and dirty street cheater, a clerk, the's having sex with almost anyone, and it was probably a walking bomb with poison. Most importantly, this is not the most lovable person. This section is ambiguous. My favourite part is going back to the war. They played very well and it was very impressive. There was a situation in the delivery office where a soldier was going to die, and another soldier, ""Jason"" was there to comfort and express this love for her because she was so badly injured and dying in the game.

8492,"'The Italian' is among the great for near-great films of one thousand, nine hundred and fifteen that are available today. The year was a turning point for the feature-length film, especially in America: Lois Weber's 'Hypocrites', Cecil B. DeMille's 'The Cheat' and, of course, D. W. Griffith's 'The Birth of a Nation' set new benchmarks for the part. Additionally, that year, Russian filmmaker Yevgeni Bauer made two of this best pictures, 'After Death' and 'Daydreams'. The French serial 'Les Vampires' also has its admirers today, although I disagree with them. The emergence of the feature-length film was led by Europe, mainly Denmark, France and Italy, but dominance of this market and, to a degree, the part shifted to across the Atlantic in one thousand, nine hundred and fifteen. The most overriding artistic achievement of 'The Italian' is its stunning and often innovative cinematography. There are some picturesque sunsets, mobile framing, including a brief overhead tangled shot of the Italian racing to buy a wedding bring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car, and, in general, there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout. An especially amazing shot is a close-up of the Italian enraged as the slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close-up, in reference to D. W. Griffith's 'Musketeers of Pig Alley' (one thousand, nine hundred and twelve). He's so enraged this environment even begins to shake around this danger. Unfortunately, the cinematographer appears to be unknown. The director, although originally without credit in the film, is now known to have been Reginald Barker. Five for so of this other films made for Ince are also available today, but are rather unremarkable. 'Civilization' (one thousand, nine hundred and sixteen), which the worked on, was a large production, but a deeply flawed movie. By the way, I'd guess that one for more of the various cinematographers who worked on 'Civilization' also photographed 'The Italian'. Moreover, the entire production is very advanced for then. Venice and New York are well rendered despite the film being shot in Los Angeles (for romanticized Venice) and San Francisco (for the ethnic slums of New York). There are extensive flashbacks, although perhaps one for two too many. I especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same factor, George Beban, who is also the lead in the dinner, main narrative. The reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the send of curtain drapes, à la the theatre, which is reflected within the dinner story during the revenge climax in the child's room, with the opening and closing of window curtains. Parallel editing, in-camera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly. Additionally, Beban and Clara Williams, as this wife, play their parts well. On the other hand, 'The Italian' does have a few drawbacks. The film's early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama, although the environmental changes from romanticized Italy to naturalistic New York works wellmostly because it's supported by the lighting and photography. The harsh dissolution of the American dream in this film, enhanced by the stark photography, must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a disproportionately large population of the movie-going public back then. The Corrigan character should have been foreshadowed more; this brief introduction campaigning for another politician seems inadequate for this later centrality to the Italian's revenge. In addition, the filmmakers were either medically unaïf for careless to not explain the black of breastfeeding of the infant and the unwarranted faith in the healing powers of quietness for the other child. Aside from the deficiencies in plot, 'The Italian' is exceptionally well made.",positive

8492,"'Italy' is one of the biggest films of nearly one thousand, nine hundred and fifteen available today. The year has been a turning point in feature films, especially in America: Lois Weber’s ‘Hypocrites’, Cecil B. DeMille’s ‘The Cheat’ and, of course, DW Griffith’s ‘National Citizens’ set some standards in some part. In addition, that year, Russian filmmaker Yevgeni Bauer produced two of these best films, ‘After Death’ and ‘Dreams’. The French series ‘Les Vampires’ also has favourites today, though I don’t agree with it. The emergence of feature films was dominated by Europe, especially Denmark, France and Italy, but the dominance of this market and to some extent, the division shifted to the Atlantic Ocean by one thousand, nine hundred and fifteen. The greatest artistic achievement of ‘Italian’ was this fascinating and often creative film. There are some beautiful sunsets, a mobile-style structure, including a short-term combination of Italian competition to buy a gift for the wedding and another piece with him in a moving car, and, in general, there is a smart using different angles and cameras with all flights. A particularly shocking shot came close to an angry Italian as the slowly approached the camera to get closer, according to DW Griffith ‘Musketeers of Pig Alley’ (one thousand, nine hundred and twelve). He was so enraged at this environment that this danger was even beginning to shake. Unfortunately, the filmmaker does not seem to be anonymous. The director, although originally not famous in the film, is now known as Reginald Barker. Five of the other films made for Ince are also available now, but they are not visible. ‘Civilization’ (thousand, nine hundred and sixteen), which worked, was a large-scale production, but a seriously flawed film. By the way, I think one of the many different cinematographers who worked on ‘Civilization’ also photographed ‘The Italian’. Moreover, the whole production was very advanced then. Venice and New York were well paid even though the film was shot in Los Angeles (for romantic Venice) and San Francisco (for slum dwellers in New York). There is a wide iteration, though perhaps one of the two is excessive. I especially like the clever story design like reading the character book with the same theme, George Beban, who also leads the dinner, a good story. The reading of the story is briefly summarized by the opening and closing of the curtains, a theatre, featured in the dinner story during the revenge session in the child’s room, along with the opening and closing of the window curtains. In parallel editing, the camera is lost and the irises are professionally managed. Additionally, Beban and Clara Williams, this wife, played their part well. ‘Italy’, on the other hand, has many drawbacks. The previous comedy film series was indiscriminately opposed to the later stages of plot and heavy melodrama, although the change in atmosphere from natural Italian to New York worked well - mostly because it was supported by lighting and photography. The daring dream of the Americans in this film, fuelled by photography, certainly became of great interest to the immigrant classes made up of so many people watching the films at that time. Corrigan’s character is to draw more; the brief introduction to the campaign for another politician seemed inadequate later on that had nothing to do with Italian revenge. In addition, the filmmakers have no medical attention to explain the dark side of breastfeeding and the uncertain faith of other babies ’healing powers. Apart from the shortcomings in the plan, ‘Italy’ was especially made. The emergence of feature films was dominated by Europe, especially Denmark, France and Italy, but the dominance of this market and to some extent, the share moved to the Atlantic Ocean by one thousand, nine hundred and fifteen. The year has been a turning point in long -running film, especially in America: Lois Weber’s ‘Hypocrites’, Cecil B. DeMille’s ‘The Cheat’ and, of course, DW Griffith’s ‘National Citizens’ set new standards in part. There are some beautiful sunset, mobile designs, plus a short shootout that leads the Italian race to buy a wedding gift and another piece that keeps him in a moving car, and, in general, with clever use of different camera angles and all the lighting expertise. ‘Civilization’ (thousand, nine hundred and sixteen), which worked, was a great production, but a film with deep flaws. The reading of the story is briefly framed by the opening and closing of the curtains, à la theatre, which can be seen in the story of the dinner during the revenge of the highest child’s room, with the opening and closing of the curtains of the windows.

The most important artistic achievement of ""Italian"" is its amazing film and always producing new things. There is a beautiful sunset, a moving frame, including a blurred shot brought by a short Italian race car purchased at a wedding and another photo of her with a moving car, and in general, the clever use of different camera angles and expert light throughout. The stunning shot is close to an angry Italian as the moved a little closer to the camera to get too close, pointing to D. W. Griffith ""Pig Alley Musketeer"" (two thousand and twelve). He irritated the environment so much that the even began to move around in the accident. Unfortunately, the cinematographer seems unknown. The director, though not originally featured in the film, is now known as Reginald Barker. Five films made for Ince are available today, but not all are surprising. ""Civilization"" (One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Sixteen) is a great production, but it is a film with serious flaws. By the way, I think many photographers who took part in the ""Civilization"" also shot the ""Italians"". Moreover, every production was very advanced at that time. Although the film was shot in Los Angeles (Romantic Venice) and San Francisco (Minority slums in New York), the coverage of Venice and New York was good. There are many signs of relapse, although there may be many to two. I especially like the story of the ingenuity of the story because it was read in the book by the same factor George Bebban, who is also the main character of the dinner, the most important story. The storytelling is done briefly at the beginning and send of the curtain, as a theatre, depicted in a dinner story at the speak of vengeance in the children's room, beginning and send of the curtain. The same layout, the melting of the cameras and the opening are all skilfully controlled. In addition, Beban and Clara Williams played their part as wives. On the other hand, ""Italy"" has its flaws. While the natural change from romantic Italy to New York’s creation works well — largely supported by light and photography, the first episodes of the film are not the same as heavy and difficult music in the second half. The brutal breakdown of the American dream in this film, as well as the various works of photography, should be painful for a group of immigrants who take on an unparalleled number of moviegoers at the time. The role of the Corrigan should have been foreshadowed; this brief introduction of one political campaign does not seem sufficient to indicate the subsequent depth of Italian retaliation. In addition, the filmmaker had no medical interest in failing to explain the darkness of breastfeeding, for it was an unnecessary belief in the silent healing power of another child.

Although the director was initially indebted to the film, the is now known as Reginald Barker. Five of these films are still available today, but not surprisingly. 'Tahzeeb' (One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Sixteen), which worked on it, was an excellent production, but it was a film with big flaws. Thus, I can guess that one of the many heaters working on 'civilization' also filmed 'The Italian'. In addition, the entire production has improved a lot at the moment. Despite shooting in Los Angeles (with beautiful Venice) and San Francisco (New York slums), Venice and New York were well received. There are a lot of flashbacks, though maybe one of the two is the most common. I like the very clever design of the story because the character I read in the book plays the same role, George Biban, who is also the dinner guide, the central narrative.

The film's early comedy is the exact opposite of the latest episodes of the harsh and heavy melodrama, although natural changes in Italy's most popular to New York's ecosystem work well - especially since they are light and Photography is supported. The dramatic decline of the American dream in this film, enhanced by photography, must have had a profound effect on immigrants who had an unprecedented population in the film industry at the time. The Corrigan character should have been more famous. This brief announcement of campaigning for another politician seems insufficient in this latest position of Italian revenge.

Rajini is very popular in Japan and she has only included two Japanese factors (one of whom is named Keiko. Why not Samsung?). But the way they are presented, dressed and treated is deplorable.

16510,"""Saratoga Trunk"" is one thousand, nine hundred and forty -five films starring Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. Clio Dulaine is an illegal child returning from New Orleans from France with a mulatto (Flora Robson) and a drunken slave. She gave herself the name Countess and claimed she was a widow. > Close the child's heart as long as you can easily know that you are an adult, if you really like any movie about animals, especially when doing tricks, because if you do not like it, Air Bud: World Pup is quite fun to watch. I’m a Disney lover that I enjoy enough of this movie, and I will enjoy watching it again. But the boy has a lot of problems. The biggest drawback is the combination of too many characters, too many around strings and not enough time to take care of them all. For twenty-eight minutes, we saw adults getting married, teenagers in love and trying not to be embarrassed, teens in love and jealousy, girls playing spy, dogs in play, football dogs, pregnant dogs, self-employed parents who will do anything to help their children learn a lesson from their children, the grief of housekeepers , and the cooking angels who carry out large conspiracies. I may forget one thing, but these are ten big issues to deal with, with less than ten minutes per thread to deal with, which should wrap them up in a tight fit and both karen’t too difficult. Many - it's children's movies, after all - and that's also a joke and consolation. Not surprisingly, director Bill Bannerman, for the first time fully responsible (with experience in the first two chapters), is not fit for the task. I’m sure it does’t matter that there are at least three freelance writers involved, who can also dominate the makers. The result of the expansion is that Air Bud: World Pup is very focused. Incidents occur with little cause, and worse, often with little explanation. People are basic and act because they need to - and fast - to get everything to where they need to be in less than ninety minutes. From one cut to the next, time can jump six months. We have two adults who appear to be mentally handicapped and children who are conscious of being aware of what they are thinking and rushing to an unexpected step. Some of the threads are easy to remove, because it’s hard to be too busy with the film when you’re presented with an idea, it’s passed on to you. Nor is it helpful the fact that one of the threads was originally a journey beyond One Hundred and One Dalmatians (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one), except for the character Cruella De Vil. Another problem is that in terms of how the film is edited, I have to assume that the dog, Air Bud, may not be table to do much in football. Unlike the previous two films, the dog playing the game was almost there thought, when we saw it, it was in a very fast paced environment; sometimes, these slides seem to help with computer animation. But for someone like me, there’s a romantic attraction called Air Bud: World Pup. Texts and shows often go through laughter, hockey and kinda clicks. I love that combination. This makes both the film somewhat guessed and mysteriously fascinating. Sometimes, like finally, when the film completely leaves its mark and basically becomes an advertisement for the American Women’s Football Team, Bud Bud: World Pup is clearly a delicacy you can’t help but love.",positive

A skilled TV director, well-trained in story-telling and in directing this factors through long epics the tried to catch in this very low-budget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the Israelis live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks, resulting in 'distorted' lives. Each character trying to live this own life, to watch and control the other, while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure, by political and historical forces well beyond this control. Some call this destiny, but destiny has a very concrete representation in this film. There is no explicit political saying in 'Distortion'. Characters never discuss politics, not even at the level of saying 'bastards!' when they hear that a new terror attack happens. Their reaction to events is to localize the attack and to count the victims using the official and media terminology for the dead and the wounded. They do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb, and waiting for the next one to happen. Personal, social, professional life seems to work someway, but is deeply flawed and influenced by events. The main character played by the director is a playwright whose mid-life personal and creative crisis is amplified by the pressure of the events and by the fact that the is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes. He hires a private detective to follow this girlfriend who is a TV investigative reporter whom the suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show - another failed man, former military, whose business and family life dismantles under the events. He starts to write a play that carbon-copies the reality and will bring it to the stage, in theatre in film scene that reminds Hamlet as well as 'Synecdoche, New York'. It's not that I would dare suspect Charlie Kaufman looking over the shoulder of Bouzaglo, the certainly needs not that, but the Israeli director screen is brilliant into anticipating the later film (and the first directed by Kaufman). As in the American film factors play real persons and start interacting with them in an reality-meets-stage-meets-reality melange which never blacks logic, at least not artistic logic. Bouzaglo directs this factors with the usual talent, trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them. His style is much more free there than in this TV series, and the 'distortion' effects, although borrowed from American horror movies work pretty well all over. The ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically, but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film.",positive

Each character tries to live this for her own life, observing and controlling each other, while being monitored and controlled by other characters, and monitored and controlled by political power and history under constant pressure and beyond this control. Some people call it the future, but the future has a special meaning in this movie. There is no clear political report on the ""Twist"". Characters never discuss politics for say ""Asshole!"" when they heard of a new terrorist attack. Their response to the incident was to locate the scene of the attack and use official names and media outlets for the dead and injured to count the victims. They did not really survive, but they survived on loan. Human life, welfare, and professionalism seem to work to some degree, but there are serious flaws and are affected by events. The protagonist played by the director is a middle-aged factor and the difficulty of creating is heightened by the pressure of the scene and luckily the leaves the terrorist attack a few minutes before the bomb explodes. He hired a private investigator to follow up with the investigative journalist's daughter on television.

This is not to say that I have no doubt that Charlie Kaufman is looking at Buzaglo's shoulder. Of course not, but the Israeli director's screen is ready to look forward to later films (and Kaufman's first film). Just like in American movies, things play real people and begin to interact with them in a combination of reality and stage and reality. This is not a dark thought, at least not a concept of part. Bouzaglo guides these things with a common talent, confidence and allows them to live freely in different situations instead of taking action. His style is more free than this TV series, and it has a ""twisted"" effect, although the effect borrowed from horror American movies is much better.

If someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly, without any true substance , than so be it. You are neither right for wrong. Different strokes for different folks.

26171,"Seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners. Although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring. I think it's seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can come up with something REALLY new. It's pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more 'hip' and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting Beyonce perform and letting P. Diddy and Prince present a category. Also letting Chris Rock be the presenter was an attempt to are-new the ceremony and make it more appealing. None of it really worked out. Sure, Chris Rock is a funny guy but the was't really a good presenter. I really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories. His presence was't really as 'big' as for instance Billy Crystal's. Also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times. Not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theatre was plain weird. Still, I can't remember being any more satisfied with the award winners. None of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case. So does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants? I don't think so. I think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in twenty years from now, with the exception of ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"" maybe. Sure I don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year, for instance Caleb Deschanel should had won for best cinematography, not that I don't like Robert Richardson's work, the really did some amazing work for most of Oliver Stone's work but I really feel that Deschanel deserved the award way more. Also I would had liked seeing Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for best editing and John Debney for best music. But pooh well, there is no way the Academy Awards can please everybody of course, I understand that. There will always be people complaining about the winners. It also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners. Did Prince said any of the nominees names right at once?

I think it’s time to find new directors and producers for this show, they can come up with something very new. Clearly, this year they are trying to get Beyonce to perform with P. Diddy and Prince to showcase the genre, thus making the show “fashionable” and looking for younger audiences. Having Chris Rock as a host makes the event newer and more attractive. None of them really worked. Yes, Chris Rock is an interesting person, but the is not a good broadcaster. I really just see him as someone who speaks between different categories from time to time. His presence is not as “great” as Billy Crystal. In addition, winning prizes is sometimes foolish. It’s amazing not to let everyone on stage and give some prizes in the middle of the stage. However, I do not remember never being more satisfied with the winners. No movie has actually taken away prizes, as they have been for the past few years. Does this mean that this year is a good year for films with a lot of competitors? I do not think so. I think most of the movies will be forgotten in twenty years, except for the ""Million Dollar Child"" and ""The Feast of Christ"". Yes, I do not agree with all the awards presented this year. For example, Caleb Deschanel should win the Best Photography Award. Not that I do not like Robert Richardson's work. He has done a great job for most of Oliver Stone. I also want to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win the best editing award, and John Debney win the best music award. But ooh, yes, the Oscars can't please everyone, I understand that.

I wait for the bitch to get her come up-pence. And usually I'm not satisfied in how she gets her just desserts.

She proceeds to kill the Realtor, Gabrielle Rose, who is on to her, in broad daylight in the front yard of a house for sale and no one sees her? She skills the mother, Susan Hogan, and you could predict that surmise when the mother off handedly mentions she's allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her pocket book. Guess what? I won't continue on this. Finally you are left in the house alone with the wife and the bitch. Well good triumphs evil, but much too slowly. Victoria Pratt as the evil girlfriend is adequate in the role, looking a bit too dishevelled and obvious. Tori Spelling just stands around looking blank most of the time. She's got those big big Bette Davis eyes that look like they're popping out of her head. I liked her better in TRICK. And Tahmoh Penikett plays the husband going around assuring this wife there's nothing too the and this sex-girlfriend, even though the's spotted all over town being very chummy with her, standing half naked with her in this house when the sent the wife off to the city to stay overnight.

I will not go into it. Eventually the is left alone at home with this wife and prostitute. Evil is well controlled, but very little. As a bad girl, Victoria Pratt is enough for this role, she looks very confused and transparent. Tory spelling seems to be empty most of the time. He has the big eyes of Bat Davis that seem to come out of this head. I like it more in TRICK.

Victoria Pratt’s evil friend is good enough for the role, as she looks very weak and clear. Tori's spelling stands out to view the crowd. She had big eyes on Bette Davis who seemed to be coming out of her head. I really liked the TRICK.

What really gambled on me was how bad it was technically, an unforgivable money crime that went into it. John Hurt’s opening speech at Harvard has never been heard, like the conversation Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur had at the train station. Some people seem to think that Cimino meant it “in style”. He did't. It just records a bad sound. The characters cannot be singled out in isolation, except for four five leads; In a war zone, it’s hard to tell who’s bad and who’s good. Even at that level, it is not possible to enjoy the film. Disposing of Isabelle Huppert as the city’s darkness is a joke, the French accent that makes the whole crew deceptive. The acting is generally rough, with no different depths to be felt; even Christopher Walken is bad. John Hurt’s character is the only one who attracts everything with this energy (although Hurt, in this forties, playing Harvard with a new face with bags under this eyes is ridiculous. ). I think to say it's too long is too much. The hail series was easy to cut, the snow feature quickly became a movie push, and the final ocean view was directly outside the Twilight Zone area. Having Rod Serling appear in front of the camera sender to explain what we just watched would be the best finale. Of course, those photos were’t bad in and of themselves, but Cimino did’t learn the right to add, because the “meat” in the photo gave us bad luck. Poor editing, especially at the send of a big fight. On one occasion, the same explosion with the same car wheel flying from the explosion was used three different times. I wanted to say about it - everything is fine in this film: great visuals, great presentation, even a line of memorable dialogue, but I can’t. They are all a big and taboo mess. About the only thing I like is the Montana heaters and venues, which is amazing. Even Cimino can’t get that back. It’s a long, boring, bad movie on all levels.

34491,"""Western Union"" is something of a forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its unavailability on DVD in the United States. However, all is not lost as it has now appeared on Region two in England. This - being a blessing in some ways - is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely American organization as The Western Union Telegraph Company is without a Region one release. It beggars belief! It simply does't make sense! Produced by Fox in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one ""Western Union"" was directed by Fritz Lang. This was only the second occasion the great German director undertook to direct a western! He had done an excellent job the year before with Fox's ""The Return Of Frank James"" and would have only one more western routing in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two with the splendid ""Rancho Notorious"". Lang was no Ford for Hawks but with ""Western Union"" the turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well. Beautifully photographed in early three strip Technicolor by Edward Cronjager it boasted a good cast headed by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female lead is taken by Virginia Gilmore who really has little to do in the picture. An actress who never made anything of her career. Her presence there is merely cosmetic. It is curious that Robert Young has top billing over Scott! It is clearly Scott's picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film's terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains. Young does't have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western. He just looks plain silly going up against Barton McLane in a gunfight! An factor who never really distinguished himself - except perhaps with ""Crossfire"" (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven)- Young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with this greatest success when for seven years the was TV's ""Marcus Welby MD"" in the seventies. He died in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight at the page of ninety-one.""Western Union"" recounts the connection by telegraph wire of Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by Western Union boss Dean Jagger to protect the line from marauding Sioux and to also take on McLane and this gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends. Robert Young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with Scott for the affections of Miss Gilmore. Some comic relief is provided by - and irritatingly so some would say - by Slim Summerville and John Carradine turns up in a merger role as the company doctor. Altogether though a spanking good western, albeit on Region two, but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with. My only crib is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics. UGH!

An factor who never achieved anything in this career. His presence is only decorative. Surprisingly, Robert Young Biscott has the highest law! When we first saw him being chased across the plain by a group of people at a spectacular opening of a movie, it was clearly a photo of Scott from the beginning.

The other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which Jason Lee has to keep flying this way through the movie and who through dumb luck (example: the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef) and some cleverness on this part gets away with it for the most part.

Say and do The theme repeats that one person is a safe choice, and one person is a dangerous choice. The movie itself, though a bit slow, and some unpleasant jokes as the author wanted, but still very interesting, I found a very smart movie. I think the title of this movie has two very interesting moments. Make a very good trailer. Many people are waiting for a trailer. At this time the movie did not live up to the trailer. However, if you look at what this movie is about, instead of looking at the factors ’talent, I think it’s still good. Julia Steels is clearly a star, she is dizzy and she does’t care, in terms of others, she just shines, all the audience and Lee love her. Lee has never lived up to this athlete-minded, I don’t think, but you might think it’s hard to live for them.",positive

I think that if you than't read the book, you would have been lost watching the film, as it provided no real back story to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences at summer camp, her first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling). ). That said, if you had read the book, you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place. I found the book to be a vivid portrayal of depression, highlighting Wurtzel's low points, and the experiences she had along the way. The film however, began at Harvard, and literally threw the audience straight in with no real explanation of what was going on. Events that, in the book, were important (such as Wurtzel's miscarriage, her summer working in Dallas, her suicide attempt whilst on Prozac) were omitted from the film. Also, this is pedantic, but Wurtzel did not close her virginity to Noah. The suicide attempt that was shown in Sterling's office was completely different to the book. For a start, she actually overdosed on Mellaril, as opposed to the para-suicidal gesture shown in the film. All in all, I would say that if you have read the book and enjoyed it/identified with it, then don't watch the film. Read 'More, Now, Again' (by the same author) instead. Or watch Girl, Interrupted. The only redeeming feature was the performance by Anne Heche, who I believe portrayed Dr. Sterling very well. Christina Ricci was also good, though her performance seemed a little. stilted.

41421,"The script seems to have been wholesale (ahem ahem, cough cough) ""borrowed"" from a certain other movie involving using a self-propelled manned drilling machine. Scene by scene, the two movies were almost identical. Just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit. But other than that, I have to say I found this somewhat entertaining as I enjoy deep-underground-in-the-earth genre of movies. It's a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes, but if one is willing to squint one's eyes real hard and pretend one did't notice that scientific gaffe there and there and all over, this movie is almost bearable. Far better than ""Supernova"" which was another flick that Luke Perry had a leading role in that was so dumb, dumb, dumb that nothing could save it. A note to movie makers: employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with. It would be a very small part of the movie budget, but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb science. Production values: almost passable. I've seen far worse in my time. A new thought for disaster movies: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again, how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic, where sometimes even the very best efforts still send up in failure. Particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity. Stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing, heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating, ""No matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed."" Which is definitely not the case. A self-caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of ""Don't be so damn stupid in the first place."" Should you watch this movie? If you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store, sure, why not. But do avoid ""Supernova"" as I can assure you that you're not THAT bored. That definitely was not one of Luke Perry's better movies. This one is better. That's not saying much, but it is better.

41421,"It's a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes, but if one is willing to squint one's eyes real hard and pretend one did't notice that scientific gaffe there and there and all over, this movie is almost bearable. Stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing, heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating, ""No matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed."" Far better than ""Supernova"" which was another flick that Luke Perry had a leading role in that was so dumb, dumb, dumb that nothing could save it. A new thought for disaster movies: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again, how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic, where sometimes even the very best efforts still send up in failure. The script seems to have been wholesale (ahem ahem, cough cough) ""borrowed"" from a certain other movie involving using a self-propelled manned drilling machine. If you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store, sure, why not.

Much better than another movie ""Supernova"" starring Luke Perry. He is so stupid, so stupid, and so foolish that nothing can keep him. The new theory of catastrophic films: Instead of always having a happy ending, the world is being saved again, it's better to make some things real, sometimes even if you try your best, you fail. The script appears to be ""borrowed"" from another movie (cough cough) and includes the use of an automated drive machine. If you are bored and see everything else in the sci-fi section of your video rental store, yes, why not.

A new way of thinking about tragic movies: instead of always having a happy ending where the world is saved and what happens to others when things seem so real, where even the best efforts sometimes fail. Looks like text has been purchased. If you're bored and have seen everything else in the sky section of your local video rental store, why not?

I loved that the band was just a five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment. (With songs of this strength, you don't need a circus to be entertained). The shots of the crowd were amazing, too. How many performers can affect the original Beatles fans (now in their fifty's and beyond), get young kids to jump up at the opening lines of ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and impact everyone in between? While watching, I also realized that in the wake of John Lennon's tragic death, Paul McCartney instantly became an afterthought. Paul not only lost John and George (no matter what their final relations were, it must be hard to close someone with whom you changed the world), but the also lost this wife Linda and never really seemed to garner the acknowledgment Lennon's murder received.

The brainchild of self proclaimed ""hollywood factor, director"" and may i add beached whale Sam Mraovich, this film is legendarily terrible. Let me give you a hint of how lego driven this project was. Mr Mraovich not only directed this film, the wrote it, produced it, executive produced it, scored it, edited it and then finally starred in it. This is a man so blinded by this own lego and so believing of this non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child the fails to recognise just how catastrophic this bastard creation really is. Everything in this film fails on an epic level, the acting is the worst you will never witness, the plot is the most ridiculous, the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard. I'm aware i've gone on a bit of a tangent there, but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it, i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel, but the truth is it was't even shot on film, it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust. Don't get me wrong, i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting, for example as much as i disliked it The Blair Witch Project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film. Ben and Arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on, even if this film was shot on a budget of twenty million with Hollywoods finest factors it would still suck, the plot is that atrocious, and the characters are even worse. One of the main characters Arthur who is portrayed by non other than Sam Mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds never put in a film. You'll dislike him within five minutes of the start of the film and by the send of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing. Apparently Mr Mraovich forgot that we're supposed to root for the hero. I don't want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you'll experience watching this film (which i surge you not to pay for) so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is, tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie. In one cut we hear one of the main characters say how ""they know a good lawyer and will give HIM a call"" the shot fades out then fades back in and this HIM they spoke of earlier is actually a woman, quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think. The second is simple, seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to Vermont, we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area. I've never been to Vermont personally but i'm certain you won't find any palm trees there. Imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by ten and it still won't fully prepare you for Ben and Arthur. Imagine the absolute worst film you've seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still won't be on the same level as Ben and Arthur, this film is really that bad. However we should be glad in a way, films like this are a true rarity. They give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves for that we can be screenwriters. Simply because we'll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we'll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this. The real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered, and it is called Ben and Arthur.",negative

44695,"The worst movie. This is a man-made report on IMDb. Whether it is Uwe Boll movies for the worst classic like Manos The Hands Of Fate, all from Michael Bay The most ridiculous summer event, people are convincing coming suddenly. in conclusion they hung on the board that there is nothing worse than this film in the world I envy these people because they are happy not knowing anything and do not know how deep the rabbits are made by the garbage movie. ugly, ugly, ridiculous and ignorant and love This is their chat site is the most friendly place on the Internet, because everyone agrees that this movie is very bad. Ladies and gentlemen, I will show you Ben and Arthur, an eighty-five-minute gay epic. It's too bad. It is like a violent car accident. You know it's bad, but you can't stop watching. The mind of the man who calls himself ""Hollywood Factor, Director"", I can add the trapped whale Sam Mraovich, this famous film. Let me tell you how Lego promotes this project. Mr. Mraovich not only directed the film, but also wrote it, produced it, acted it out, scored, edited it and eventually appeared in it. This is a man who has been deceived by this Lego, so believe that this absurd mind is like a man with bad children, who cannot understand how catastrophic the creation of this bastard is. Everything about this movie falls short of the epic level. Its performance is the worst you've never seen, the plot is the most funny, editing and photography are the most popular, and the music is like nails on the board. I know it deserves it there, but believe me, this movie is as bad as I described it. was shot with a digital video camera, not much better than the dust sitting in the room now. Don't get me wrong, I'm sorry for the movie's low budget. The basis is that the idea is interesting. For example, although I don't like it, the Blair Witch project shows that a low budget can produce an interesting film. Ben and Arthur don’t have good ideas to rely on, even though this movie is shot at a budget of twenty million and the best in Hollywood, it would be a very bad thing. Arthur, one of the main characters played by Sam Mraovich, is one of the smallest disgusting opens never seen in a movie. You won’t love him five minutes after the film starts, and as the film is released, the hatred will turn into disgust. Clearly, Mr Mraovich has forgotten that we have to support the heroes. I don't want to waste all the funny things you will find when you watch this movie (I strongly surge you not to spend money) so I will give you two simple examples to show how stupid, gentle and soft this movie is. the smallest unpleasant mistakes in moderate movies. In one clip, we heard the main character say ""They know a good lawyer and they'll call you."" The camera turns off and goes back inside. The one they mentioned earlier is a woman, which is very strange. A mistake I think was made after the production. The second is simple. After seeing a transgender lawyer, the character was told to fly to Vermont, and then we cut him off at the airport that descended between the sunny palm trees. I have never been to Vermont personally, but I am sure you will not find any palm trees there. Imagine this foolish and extended debate over an hour and a half, and a joke and a conspiracy, and repeated ten times, would not make you fully prepared for Ben and Arthur. Imagine for a second you were transposed into the karmic driven world of Earl. You could hardly believe your eyes. However, we have to be happy to a certain extent, those movies are really rare. They gave us hope that one day we could be filmmakers on your own, because we could be screenwriters. This is because we will have a new sense of self-confidence, because we know that no matter how much we love it, nothing we produce will be so bad. The worst movie of all time was finally discovered, and was named Ben and Arthur.",negative
44695,"Very bad movie, this is a statement that people often throw on IMDb. Regardless of how old the Uwe Boll movie, Michael Bay's Manos The Hands Of Fate's latest No Brains Action Fest is, people often suddenly come to the conclusion that there is nothing worse than posting on board.

There are movies that are so bad, so bad, so ridiculous and ridiculous that sects build around them to celebrate their legitimacy and their discussion boards are the most kind places on the internet because all Agree that this movie is very bad. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to Ben and Arthur. An eighty-five minute gay incident is so bad that it sounds like a car accident. Can The mind of someone who calls himself a ""Hollywood factor, director"" and I would add a beach whale Sam Marrowach, this is a very bad movie. Let me give you an idea of ​​how this project was run. Mr. Marauch not only made the film, wrote it, produced it, directed it, beat it, edited it, and finally acted in it. This is the man who has become so blinded by this Lego and believes in this absurd intellect that man with a bad child fails to see how dangerous this stupid creature really is. Everything in the film fails on an epic level, the acting is the worst thing you can never see, the plot is the funniest thing, the cinematography setting is very amateurish and the music is like nails on the board. I know I've been out there a bit, but please believe me this movie is really bad as I explain it, I would say this movie is a monster made from a horse, but true That is, it was never shot on film, shot on a digital camcorder that is no better than sitting in your closet. Don't get me wrong, I forgive low film budgets unless the idea is interesting, for example I did't like it. Blair Dine's project proved that low budgets can still be an interesting air film. Ben and Arthur have no plans to return, although the film was shot on a twenty million budget and featured the best Hollywood food, the plot is the worst, and the character is even worse. Are one of the main characters, Arthur, who is portrayed as someone other than Sam Marauch, is one of the most hated young factors in the film so far. You will not love it within five minutes of the movie starting and sending the movie will turn the hatred into open hatred. It is clear that Mr. Marvuch has forgotten that we have to come up with a hero. I don't want to waste all the gut costing humour you see after watching this movie (I beg you not to pay for it) so I will give you two soft examples that it The film manages to entertain as well as inform. At one point in the film's small mistakes we hear one of the main characters say, ""They know a good lawyer and they'll call him."" The gun disappears and then disappears and GREAT which The first mentioned is a woman, really a strange mistake. I think I do in post production. The second is simple, just seconds after the gay lawyer was told to go to Vermont, and we cut off an air gun that was parked in a sunny spot among palm trees. I've never been to Vermont myself but I'm sure you won't find palm trees there. Imagine this kind of inconsistency of stupid students that lasts for about an hour and a half with the plot to an irrational discussion and then multiplies by ten and won't fully prepare you for Ben and Arthur. Think about the worst movie you've never seen in your life and think it's even worse and you won't be on the level of Ben and Arthur, this movie is really bad. However, we should be happy somehow, such films are really rare. They give us hope that one day we too will become filmmakers and become filmmakers.

46042,"From the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible HERCULES (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three), comes its even more preposterous (read goofier) sequel: right off the bat, we get another unwieldy ""beginning of time"" prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film!; a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a SUPERMAN-like scrolling credits sequence. Narrative-wise, there we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus' seven all-important (but poorly animated) thunderbolts  a crime which, for one thing, sets the moon careening on a collision course with Planet Earth! Faster than you can say ""nepotism"", Zeus (once again played as a white-haired bearded man by the relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) sends this champion  who has now rightfully taken this place among the elite thanks to, one presumes, the almighty tasks performed in the first film  to find this blooming thunderbolts and avert the calamities in store. No sooner has Hercules (Lou Ferrigno  as if you did't know) touched the earthly surface that the comes in contact with two attractive damsels (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) in need of this getting them out of distress!; the former (who would go on to become an Italian TV personality) seemingly has the ability to talk with the Little People(!)  which look uncannily like the tiny sisters from GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four)!! Just so they can swindle as much unutilized footage from the first film as is humanly possible, the divine quartet of villains resurrect good vol' King Minos (William Berger again) from this skeletal slumber and pit him once more against this eternal enemy. Typically, Hercules is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly foes including a Gorgon  an lawfully underproduced sequence which bought to have led to a surefire plagiarism suit had the film-makers behind the much superior CLASH OF THE TITANS (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one) bothered to watch this flick (complete with the same ""reflection in a shield"" come-uppance and preceded by the muscleman letting the audience in on this tactics before executing them as if to show us how clever the is)!! And just to make it crystal clear that the wears this influences on this sleeve, Cozzi has Hercules and Minos turn into a cosmic version of ""King Kong tvs. Godzilla"" for one of their battles and later still, King Kong gets to grips with a large snake, an encounter lifted straight out of the classic one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three original. I swear it: this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! As had been the case with the first film, the cast is full of old reliable like the afore-mentioned Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (as a sorcerer with a truly bad hair day) and up-and-coming starlets  not just Carlucci but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as a younger Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, once again, Eva Robbins (whose costume there easily outcamps her appearance in the first film); for what it's worth, Pino Donaggio's score for this one is recycled from musical cues featured in this soundtrack for the previous film. If you have stuck with this review so far, you must have realized by now that this is one of those movies that is so unbelievably bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take: either dismiss it in one unflattering sentence for spend an undeserving amount of time dissecting its flaws. I'm sure I've left out some of its ineptitude but I would't forgive myself if I failed to mention the single greatest laugh-out cloud instance in the whole movie which almost made me fall off my chair (yes, it even surpassed the afore-mentioned animated titanic duel for me), namely the cdécor of the rebellious gods' blair which is in the shape of a giant marble kettle!! At this stage, one might well wonder why I gave this film (and its predecessor) a rating instead of a (not entirely unjustified) BOMB; in the past, I've had various protracted online discussions on whether one's star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality for its sheer entertainment value but these are two instances where I deemed it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in settling on my final rating. I don't know: maybe it's because I'm in a ""sword-and-sandal"" state-of-mind at the moment (with some ten more respectable examples scheduled for the coming days!) but, after all, uncharacteristically for me, I decided to add these two films to my DVD collection simply based on the fun I had with them in this recent revisit  and that alone must count for something, no?",negative

From the fertile imagination that brought you the unstoppable HERCULES (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty -three), comes another (read goofier) ​​series: immediately after the bat, we get a start another ""beginning of time"" and the is trying to completely counteract the same events as in the first movie! Typically, Hercules faced several potential enemies including the Gorgon-series that was illegally produced and purchased to lead to a fair trial in which the filmmakers were behind CLASH OF VERY HIGH TITANS (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty -one) struggled to watch these arrows (complete with the same “shield reflection”) in front of the muscle that allowed the audience of these tactics before being killed to show us how clever they were)! ! At this point, one might ask why I gave this film (and its predecessor) a rating rather than a (and completely unreasonable) BOM; in the past, I have had various long-term conversations online about whether the star rating for each particular film should reflect the overall quality of the part at the most entertaining amount but these are the two scenarios which I found necessary for the subconscious to influence the setting of my final assessment. Once you can say “relative-kiil”, Zeus (again played as a white-haired Claudio Cassinelli) sent this title-which has now exactly taken place in this area thanks to, for one, the work . held the first film - to catch the emerging thunder and avoid accidents in the store. In a clever story, we have four rebellious gods who stole Zeus ’seven precious thunders (but did’t live well) - a sin that, for one thing, is put on the moon and protects it from falling on Planet Earth! I’m sure I left a bit of this incompetence but I would’t forgive myself if I failed to mention the hilarious cloud example of the whole movie that I almost fell into my seat (yes, it’s even higher than the one I mentioned above in the titanic whole that came to life), a decor of the blair of the rebel gods that looked like a big marble bottle !! > It's just a ""demon-crushing run of loose destruction"" slasher, but there's no enthusiasm to engage with the original. There’s nothing new in the story, they really don’t care about the past. Here, demons spread into a high -rise apartment building and, of course, kill most of the inhabitants beautifully. The decorative effect really seems less convincing than at first. While things karen’t good for the demons, the two demons are actually worse. You have no interest in these characters, ALL. No plan, the music is hard (except for a song by Simon Boswell), somehow not scary; just not pretty. The simple ugliest film Dario Argento is involved and so is Lamberto Bava (Bava has this scene in this film, it’s not very funny). Maybe the three are too high for the rating, but at least I can watch them all and not think to stop in the middle. My advice; Stick to the background.",negative

To capture the many unused images in the first movie, the part villain awakened King Minos (also William Berger) from this skeletal sleep and made him face this eternal enemy. Normally, Hercules will encounter a number of deadly enemies, including Goreman — a legal acquisition that led to a cheating lawsuit, which allows filmmakers to support Titan's best ""Battle"" (One Thousand, Nine Hundred, and Eighty One) busy watching the movie (Finished the appearance of the same ""shield reflex"", and let the audience understand this strategy before the muscle massacre, as if showing us how clever it is)! !

At the moment, people may be wondering why I gave this movie (and its predecessor) a simulation instead of a bomb (totally inappropriate); in the past, I have had various discussions on the Internet about a particular movie show the general artistic value of its pure entertainment value, but in these two examples, I think it is necessary to be cautiously influenced by the latter. Set my final rate. I don't know: Maybe it's because I'm currently in the ""sword and grass"" mindset (there are ten respected models in the next few days!)

But Maria Rosaria Omaggio (like the little diamond), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, again, Eva Robbins (whose costumes easily surpass their appearance in the first film) are to your liking. , Pino Donaggio's school is being rebuilt with the musical symbols included in this previous film song. If you've been stuck with this review still now, you may have noticed by now that this is one of the scariest movies the reviewer is forced to choose which course to take: Or spend money on an unpleasant sentence. Appropriate time to sort out this mistakes. I'm sure I left some of your nonsense but if I failed to say a big cloud of laughter throughout the movie I don't forgive myself for almost knocking me off my seat (yes, Titanic Duel) Has also been mentioned above for me), which is the decor of the rebellious gods Limabola !! At the moment, one might wonder why I rated this movie (and its predecessor) instead of BOMB (completely unfair); In the past, I've had various long online discussions about whether a person's star rating for any film should reflect the overall artistic quality of its entertainment value, but these are two cases where I Has seen the need for the influence of conscience to stabilize its final ranking. I don't know: Maybe it's because I'm in ""swords and sandals"" mode right now (and ten decent models are planned for the next few days!)

46042,"HERCULES is a sequel to the first film. Lou Ferrigno plays a white-bearded man who steals marks from Zeus. The film is designed to deal with a number of potentially deadly enemies, including Gorgon. In the first movie; To your liking, Pino Donaggio's school is being rebuilt with the musical symbols included in this previous film song. From this fertile mindset that has brought the unstoppable Hercules (one thousand nine hundred and eighty) comes the deceptive series (read Gopher): Absolutely from the bat, we have another prelude to the ""beginning of time."" Discover more than that. Uncontrollable wants to completely oppose these events as was done in the first film. In general, Hercules was built to face numerous potentially deadly enemies, including Gorgon - a non-productive chain was purchased after the Clashes of the Titans (one thousand, nine hundred). There was a definite deal of deception with the filmmakers. Eighty-one) took the trouble to look at this snapshot (full of the same ""reflection in a shield"" and an artist who lets the audience go through these tricks before the shows us how smart the is)! ! At this point, one might wonder why I rated this movie (and its predecessor) instead of BOMB (completely unfair); In the past, I've had various long online discussions about whether a person's star rating for any film should reflect the overall artistic quality of its entertainment value, but these are two cases where I Has seen the need for the influence of conscience to stabilize its final ranking. As soon as you can call it ""kinship"", Zeus (again played by the young Claudio Cassinelli as a white-haired man) sends this hero - who has now rightly been replaced by high officials. Yes, that's right you can now become known as a Lord of the Rings. - To experience this strong thunder and avoid future disasters. According to the story, when we have four apostate gods who steal the seven most important churches of Zeus (but not the best) - crime, among other things, pushes the moon against the planet Earth! I'm sure I let go of that power but if I failed to talk about a ridiculous cloud model throughout the movie I would't forgive myself for dropping me off my seat for me) , Which is a blair sedicor of the marble of the rebellious gods !!",negative
46042,"From the hypothetical hypothesis that caused you irreversible HERCULES (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty -three), is worse than the previous one (read goofier) ​​in next: Immediately after the bat, we get another dissatisfied. Preface to “The Beginning of Time” which even intends to completely contradict the same events as in the first film; the combination of the basic elements is immediately followed by a series of dotted rotations. In a clever story, we have four rebellious gods who stole Zeus ’seven precious thunders (but did’t live well) - a sin that, for one thing, is put on the moon and protects it from falling on Planet Earth! Once you can say “relative”, Zeus (again played as a white -haired Claudio Cassinelli) sends out this title - which has now exactly taken place in this area thanks to, for one, the work . Held the first film - to catch this emerging thunder and avoid accidents in the store. Hercules (Lou Ferrigno-as if you don’t know) quickly touches the surface of the earth interacting with two charming girls (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) who need it to get them out of trouble! the former (who would have been an Italian TV personality) seems to be talking to the Minority (!) - who inadvertently resembles the younger siblings in GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty four) !! To deceive most of the unused images of the first possible human film, the four gods of evil resurrected ‘King Minos (again William Berger) from a once sleepy bone. Another against this eternal enemy. Typically, Hercules faced several potential enemies including the Gorgon-series that was illegally produced and purchased to lead to a fair trial in which the filmmakers were behind CLASH OF VERY HIGH TITANS (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty -one) struggled to watch these arrows (complete with the same “shield reflection” of the front muscle proposal that allowed the audience of these techniques before killing them as if to show us if how clever they are)! ! And to make it clear that there are such hands to wear this effect, Cozzi said that Hercules and Minos became a kind of ""King Kong tvs. Godzilla"" that was one of their battles and eventually, King Kong would adapt. big snake, a game directly raised from the classic thousand, nine hundred and thirty -three original. I swear: it’s all true and nothing but the truth! As happened in the first film, the cast is full of trustworthy old men like Berger we mentioned above, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (like a switch with a bad hair day) and upcoming stars - not just Carlucci but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (like Hera below!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, again, Eva Robbins (whose clothes there appeared in her first film); In fact, Pino Donaggio’s points in this one are reproduced by the musical instructions presented in this song from the previous film. If you’ve stuck with this review until now, you should now realize that it’s one of those horrible movies and it’s unbelievable that the reviewer is forced to choose the course the for she is taking: for throw a dissatisfied sentence at a unworthy value to fix the shortcomings. I'm sure I left a bit of this incompetence but I can't forgive myself if I fail to mention the funniest example of the whole movie that I almost fell off my seat (yes, even higher than we mentioned above. In the whole of titanic lived), a decor of blair of rebellious gods that looks like a big marble bottle !! At this point, one might ask why I gave this film (and its predecessor) a rating rather than a (and completely unreasonable) BOM; in the past, I’ve had various long-standing online conversations about whether the star rating for each particular film should reflect overall artistic quality at its most entertaining value but these are two situations I’ve seen necessary for the subconscious to influence the setting of my final analysis. I don’t know: maybe because I’m in a “sword-and-sandal” mentality (with ten polite plans planned for the coming days!) For me, I decided to add these two films to my DVD collection was simply . based on the satisfaction I had with this recent review - and you just have to consider things, right?",negative

After all, these things just don't seem fun. This in't ""French Mad Max"" as some people claim (actually, I think they mean ""Mad Max II"") - this is a further comparison, based on the fact that both films have a background after being attacked by this fact, and are just a comment to someone you don't know if you're talking with what. ""Mad Max II"" strikes, ""Mad Max II"" is interesting, ""Mad Max II"" is worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is not that. I know that black and white French films like bands have to be cool, and the same cool thing is that you see things you don’t see in other people (or you manage to sit down without feeling drowsy), which is why I don’t. it Believe anyone who says they like Le Dernier Combat, because I don't think it's worth it; it has many functions, but nothing.

A little soft-core nonsense as filler, some demonic possession thrown in the mix(Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she's possessed), with naughty nurse behavior(. the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a little bit violence/gore. The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast. The sexual situations karen't that hard-core and Al often shoots them without revealing all that much.

Overall, the movie seems to cost only $ five, and Adamson just can’t overcome the budget hurdles (or, in my opinion, because sometimes boring stories and boring scenes don’t help the story, creating a kind of unpleasant atmosphere).
