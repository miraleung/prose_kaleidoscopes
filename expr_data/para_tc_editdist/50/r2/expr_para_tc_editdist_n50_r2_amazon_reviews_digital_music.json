The result is a bleak testament to melancholy and alienation that has a haunting and pristine beauty. There are only eleven songs, most of which are under three minutes in length, which is why the album is not even a half-hour long, but there is a sense in which anything longer would be too much to bear. \"Pink Moon,\" by itself, justifies Drake's status as a cult figure among those who love folk-rock. Ironically, you have probably hear Nick Drake's music before, because the title track was used for a Volkswaggen commercial, just another example of how music is perverted to commercial interests (what else is new?). I have been spending the cold winter putting together mixes of folk music (in the broadest sense) and making a concerted effort to get beyond Bob Dylan and the Byrds to explore the likes of Sandy Denny and the Beau Brummels. Checking out Sandy Denny led me to Fairport Convention and Richard Thompson, and eventually to Ralph McTell and Nick Drake. Now I can only wonder what rock I have been living under that I have never come across these artists before. The title track is a beautiful folk ballad, performed with just Drake's superb acoustic guitar playing and haunting vocal. Throughout the album you notice the depth of this lyrics and this guitar playing. The latter might have been lost in an album with orchestration, but there you have the opportunity to listen to the openings of \"Radio\" and \"Parasite\" unadorned. For the former a choice example would be the opening of what is probably the best song on the album (it is hard to choose), \"Which Will,\" which begins: \"Which will you go for\/Which will you love\/Which will you choose from\/From the stars above?\" There is a simple elegance to the lyrics, captured by the vocals, and complimented by the more complex guitar playing. Nick Drake only produced three albums, so there is no reason not to have all of them in your music library. These works represent the very best of the British folk-rock scene and Drake is a first rate singer-songwriter whose songs of failed romance, mortality, and depression are quite affective.

There are so many good songs on this album - they fit together to form a cohesive whole while at the same time each stands on its own individually. I don't think there is one song on this album that I don't really like except perhaps (and maybe ironically), the title track. Standouts range from the beautiful, longing and urgent \"Boys of Summer\", to the pretty \"Not Enough Love In the World\" and \"Land Of The Living\", to the songs that rock out \"All She Wants To Do Is Dance\" (complete with sarcastic, cynical political overtones) and \"Drivin' With Your Eyes Closed\". But to me, the highlight of the album are the two songs which segue into each other on what used to be side two of the album - these are \"A Month Of Sundays\" which is a heartfelt and heart-tugging glimpse at the struggles of farmers hit during the glut of farm foreclosures which were taking place in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and heights. This beautiful, sad song relaxes into the cool, jazzy \"Sunset Grill\", which for some reason evokes Los Angeles to my mind. At any rate, to sum up - this album brings out a wide range of emotions through really well played, well conceived songs. There are pretty songs and songs that rock on this album.

My baby is my favourite song on this album. Overall, this is a good record, and people need to explain it. Get this CD. When Streisand Superman was released on June fourteen, one hundred, and nine hundred and seventy-seven, Streisand was the most powerful woman in the show business. Six months ago, the released A Star Is Born, this most successful film in the box office to date. The sound that accompanies music is No. one for six consecutive weeks (the longest record in this career), including a work the wrote \"Evergreen\", which allowed him to win an Oscar three weeks after winning. it was on a bulletin board. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, Streisand was still releasing one album a year, but the fact that the released Superman just six months after \"A Star Is Born\" is very unusual, especially since the soundtrack is still on the chart. He is ranked among the best. Success has already begun, and Superman's songs continue to prove that Barbra, a singer who cd not make a chart of independent songs ten years ago, is now entering a new category, and has been welcomed by radio. The media referred to the six-month release of \"Born Star\" and \"Superman\" as \"one Streisand Punch and two Punch!\" There karen\u2019t many teenage musicians (if any) who can release a album titled \u201cSuperman\u201d - -But it seems worthwhile. Streisand is known for this bravery, wearing white pants and a white shirt with a Superman logo on this seemingly appropriate album. The title and photo show that the entertainment queen has a ball. Although the had a successful career before seventy-seven years, it seems the has reached a high level. This is very appealing to this fans, and very annoying to this critics. Now that I\u2019ve used Streisand\u2019s official packaging and a lot of inside photos of Steve Shapiro, let\u2019s start listening to music. Streisand has finally released a full-length pop album, this album is in perfect harmony and right for him. These songs include popular songs, such as the song \"My Heart Is Mine\", ranked fourth on the Billboard Top one hundred Singles Board, and fun sonatas, including \"Love comes from the most unexpected place\", made of Prolific Gold Carnes, Rock and Back. From the opening title song, Streisand's song rises above the clouds, so that when the sings the words \"I'm Superman\" with a strong belief, you believe you're Superman! The whole album is very interesting; it\u2019s like cotton candy in summer games. The only thing that says \"Can't believe what you're reading\". Although the song was composed by Streisand, the lyrics are also great, and the details of this life are explained in the tabloid, but the guitar instruments are not crooked when repeating popular rhythms. On the other hand, another song written by Songbird is a beautiful ballad \"Answer Me\", which was written for A Star Is Born. Although it did not complete the film with sound, fortunately it finally appeared on this album. Top hits such as \"I've Found Love\" and \"Cabin Fever\" capture Streisand's play, and because of this outstanding success in the genre \"A Star Is Born\" (although many critics say so), so the continues to show. its versatility as a top musician and can capture almost all musical styles. Speaking of which, the even covered Roger Miller's little country song \"Baby Me Baby\". Two of the highlights are the last two albums of the album, the brilliant Billy Joel of \"New York State of Mind\" and Rupert Holmes' independent holy code \"My Own Lullaby\". Billy Joel's performance on Streisand's brilliant speech \"New York State of Mind\" was \"delighted\", and the latter remarked: \"My mother now knows I have succeeded because Barbra Streisand has recorded one of my songs.\" Barbra Streisand has done a very good job. He conquered almost all entertainment entertainment. It was a matter of time before the took control of the world of pop music. If there's one word to describe Superman Streisand, it's \"confidence.\" This is one of the best albums in Streisand Records.","overall":5,"summary":"One of her best!","unixReviewTime":1248048000,"reviewTime":"07 20, 2009"}

The song 'ninety-nine' I have never truly embraced, only because I think it just goes on and on! In bands I really like, I try and find something good in every track they do, because face it, there's good in everything. 'ninety-nine' I liked when I first heard it, but after repeated listening, its a song I skip. Thats a rarity. Especially on the first four TOTO albums for me. And another thing. When never a over compilation is released of TOTO, it seems they are missing videos I remember seeing a LONG time ago, even before I became better acquainted with them in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. I remember, for a FACT, seeing in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine, a video for 'All Us Boys'. Like any other late seventy's performance \/ video clip, but I remember seeing it and what it looked like. Along with the 'ninety-nine' video, but 'All Us Boys' I know for sure was also a video release. Gripe over. It all opens up very moody. Honestly, I love the first two songs on this album more than many other TOTO songs. Both sound right together, one of the best track sequences I can think of. Hydra into St. George and the Dragon thematically and musically segue so well together, I can't hear these songs never separate again. After 'ninety-nine', is another favourite track of mine, 'Lorraine'. I just love this song. And when I heard this album for the first time, I did't know you could actually be a fantastic musician, but write great songs as well. I did't honestly know how it was done, for how to get there. Thanks TOTO. Some of these songs are very basic to play, they are easy chord sequences and arrangements, but its the way they are played that standout so much. They make four\/four time sound incredibly interesting, and if you're a musician, I really surge you to pick up at least one of the first four TOTO albums, they will honestly teach you a lot about arrangement and group interaction. The rhythm section is just so 'together', every other instrument can just play off of it, for with it. (Jeff) Porcaro and David Hungate were players that listened to eachother, knew how to play and how not to. I really can't say anything that comes close to how much can be learned from musicians this good. The main songwriter again is David Paich, and it indicates that the probably had lot of this material available to him for TOTO in this session years.

They had a sound that made the atmosphere around it so thick you could cut it with a knife. Richard Butler's voice sounded like a snarling David Bowie. When you hear Duncan Kilburn's generous saxophone use, you wonder why more bands don't employ this instrument more. And they translated wonderfully live. While bigger fame with \"Pretty in Pink\" was to come later, this album just blew me away when I first got it. There might have been debut albums just as good, but I can't think of any that were better. All of the songs of the original are on this \"re-issued with extra stuff\" version. But the songs are not in the original order, and there are some extras. Of the extras, you can throw out \"Mack the Knife\". I love other versions of the song, and of course, love the band, but I find the marriage of the two totally unlistenable.

This one is interesting because it begins with a milder version of the bass\/drum assault of \"India\" with guitar and saxophone thrown in.

He was't trying to be a star for a big named wrapper, just a freestyle legend. And let me tell you, the can spit some shhhh off the top of this dome (if you get a chance look for an album called \"Harlem's Greatest: A Freestyle History\"). I first heard of this guy on the Music Choice Channel when the song \"All Luv\" by D. I. T. C. was being played one night. He cd't have the best verse in the song (outshinned by Lord Finesse) but the grabbed my attention. Listening to this album, I understood where Big L's style came from and how the elevated it. \"Put It On\" was a dope single and a way to start off the album. My favourite song on the entire album would have to be \"No Endz, No Skinz\", a song about women out for a mans money. A lot of these songs through out the album the would talk about murder (\"All Black\") and living the dinner city life (\"Danger Zone\"). Lyrically the was good to the point where you would hit the rewind button a few times (\"I would't give a chick ten cents to put cheese on a whopper\"). But at the same time the kinda overdid it to have people like \"what the hell?\" (\"If I catch AIDS, I'ma start raping of*****s\"). Guest appearances came in packs in two songs \"eight Iz Enough\" (I forgot what television show that came from) and \"Da Graveyard\". In many songs there are a lot of no names at the time, with the exception of Lord Finesse on the latter song. But today you can find Killa Cam (Cam'ron) in the song \"eight Iz Enough\" and a younger Jay-Z in the song \"Da Graveyard\". Production wise is cool. I know Diamond D and Showbiz did a few tracks on there. So you have that D. I. T. C flavor throughout this album. Flaws are not that many. Some people might can't take the intensity of Big L's lyrics. But they that was this style of wrapping. And maybe \"I Don't Understand It\" and \"Fed Up With The BS\" might fall under skip material. Other than that this is one album that is a perfect album to your collection (and at the price listed, you CANNOT beat it!). It's sad the was taken away from us and ship shop due to an act of violence (the day after Valentines Day, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). There was reports that the was going to sign under Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella records before the was killed. I keep saying I'm going to buy \"The Big Picture\" but haven't gotten around to it.

Kelly Cam (Cameron) on the songs \"Eight Coffee\" and \"The Cemetery\". Instead, this is the man who is talking about these real-life tables in Ghetto Lifestyle. And I understand the ghetto lifestyle. It's a real crowded road. The first song was Keep It Up and along with a good drain drain was the following MVP song. The next song starts spitting on people who hate you and don't understand why it does't go with *** wood. \"Eight buzz is enough\" Pose's style is one thousand nine hundred and ninety and this audience finds it very cruel. The song is all next black which I think is probably my favourite on this album. It talks about a brutal murder and this crazy sex with women. Danger zone is just a danger zone. The next track is another classic cut called Street Strike and teammates can talk about jobs other than crack sailing. Graves is another emerging song in which a crowd of traumatized people tell stories. JZ was before Descent Debut this year and is as hungry as Kila Kam, as remember Charlotte's Lifestyle of the Rich and Fame in the Weight Buzz song, and listening to the lifestyle is very different from Dapur and Dangerous. He proves that the ghetto is alive. I understand that personal disappearance is in all the bad feelings and there is always something wonderful in it abroad. Then with the next song the said that if the policeman shot me the would be compensated and if I shot him I would never see a plane on the road. This song is called Fed up with the Bullsh **. The next and last track is Let mem have it L. which does where it's all about the lyrics. He was one of the top MSs in the top form on this CD. This album is literally behind the great Illmatic. My second album is probably my favourite third album. \"It's not black, Harlem.

Five bodies, friend Don.\" It happened in your area and I was armed with nothing but wrap jazz. I sell corn on the cob. How do I bother to meet, I like to using another song \"Poor\" Your poems are not up to standard, you are a superstar \"and not even a gold nugget on the phone\" \"Even if Grandma breaks it has to go \"Everyone should be like Mike but wants to be like Mike L.\" When you buy this man there will be some dope lines, I'll hit another one instead.","overall":4,"summary":"Amazing Flow...Amazing Lyrics (Rating: 9 out of 10- -4.5 stars)","unixReviewTime":1165276800,"reviewTime":"12 5, 2006"}

In fact, whereas the brilliant Disintegration is mostly on an even keel in terms of its slow, dark sound, Wish offers more variety. It starts with the powerful rocker \"Open\" (which sports excellent lyrics about being trapped in a world of excessive social drinking and drugs) then moves to the happy sound of \"High\" (\"when I see you kitten as a cat\"), and then presents one of the most beautiful, slow songs I've never heard \"Apart.\" The album continues this variety with another rocker \"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea,\" the quirky \"Wendy Time,\" and, later, another beautiful slow song \"Trust.\" \"Cut\" is another powerful track. \"End\" is another one of my favourites with addictive guitar riffs. The only track I do not care for is the single \"Friday I'm in Love\" which I find a bit too cutesy. \"Doing the Unstuck\" starts out in the same vein with the \"let's get happy\" lines but then launches into some awesome guitar riffs. If it were not for the opening, it would be one of my favourite tracks off Wish. \"A Letter to Elise\" was another single off Wish which I like better than \"Friday.\" If you like the singles, I highly recommend checking out this album as there are much better tracks on it and it offers a whole range of emotions.","overall":5,"summary":"\"turn everything red and the beat is complete\"","unixReviewTime":1100736000,"reviewTime":"11 18, 2004"}

The door was made by legendary R&B; made by Arif Marden. Peter P. Gabriel loved this whole single album, but just explained that --- the producer was Robert Fripp, King Crimson\u2019s electric guitarist, who loved to record fast. He convinced Gabriel to record \u201cPGtwo\u201d for six weeks, a very long time for Gabriel, who, as every fan knows, loves to spend this precious and precious time on recordings. studio. As a result, Gabriel felt that this atwood door had never been as beautiful as the wanted it to be. Although I fully respect Peter\u2019s opinion, I must admit that I disagree with him. Really strong! \u201cPGtwo\u201d is an amazing album, and my favourite Mr. Gabriel. And now that the door has been updated (along with Peter\u2019s remaining booklet on \u201cUS\u201d!), It\u2019s made even better * quality * sound quality than never before. Throw in a piece of poetry complete with all the songs in the CD booklet, as well as some beautiful photos taken from Peter in the thousand, nine hundred and seventy -eight, and you\u2019ve seen the most and most Satisfied customers in this review! Gabriel may not have been happy with the quick recording of \u201cPGtwo,\u201d but commercially, I think, producer Fripp (who also contributes high-end guitar parts) has succeeded in getting Gabriel. raw for the first time in Gabriel\u2019s recording career (although I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m knocking on other doors alone --- love \u2018em all!). There\u2019s a bit of a twist to the material there and there, but overall, it\u2019s a complete in-studio, recording-and-all sound recording that feels like it\u2019s being recorded directly on tape. Gabriel\u2019s voice on the whole is energy, gut, tough & tough. Of course, the guy * always * is awesome to using, but \u201cPGtwo,\u201d you hear it so you don\u2019t hear it from other recordings, and you probably won\u2019t hear it again. He was a raw Gabriel. What else is the \u201cPGtwo\u201d album of my favourite Gabriel? Peter's writings. These are irreplaceable songs, every single one of them. Peter has been a bit dark on \"PGthree\" and \"Security,\" but \"PGtwo,\" the songs are dramatically elevated (\"DIY,\" \"Good Day in One Way\"), trembling (\"On the Air,\" White Shade, \"\" Exposure \"), her heart (\" Mother of Violence, \"\" Indigo, \"\" Flotsam And Jetsam, \"\" Home Sweet Home \"), jazzy (\" Animal Magic, \"\" Theory \"), beautiful and fun (all of the Above.) Gabriel only collaborates with the best singers possible, and \u201cPGtwo\u201d is no exception, with guitarist Fripp, bassist Tony Levin, synthesizer wiz Larry Fast, and drummer Jerry Marotta. And Gabriel himself in't low on keys, either! I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am that Peter Gabriel's booklet has finally been redesigned (as we patiently wait for the new album ), and I really plan to get it all in. You too.

Namely, a generic circa-one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven\/ninety-style Atlantic CD with red lettering on the CD spine and a regular silver disc with a red band around the router edge of the CD.","overall":5,"summary":"This is NOT a remastered version.","unixReviewTime":1219363200,"reviewTime":"08 22, 2008"}

Phil made Hello, I Must Be Going! during a busy one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two which saw him play on sex-Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant's first solo album Pictures at Eleven, tour with Genesis that summer, produce an album for sex-ABBA singer Fra and drum at the very first Prince's Trust Concert for Jethro Tull, Pete Townshend, Kate Bush and Robert Plant that busy year. Like this previous solo album, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one's Face Value, Phil plays drums and percussion, does all vocals and keyboards (save \"You Can't Hurry Love\" where Peter Robinson plays them) and is joined by co-producer\/engineer Hugh Padgham, Genesis touring guitarist Daryl Stuermer, bass player John Giblin (and Mo Foster on tracks six and seven) and the Earth Wind and Fire horn section a\/k\/a The Phoenix Horns for another superb solo album. We start with the great rocker about the disgust and apathy of being ridiculed and having one's name dragged in the dirt called \"I Don't Care Anymore\" which was a huge rock radio hit and still gets airplay on classic rock stations aside \"In the Air Tonight\". Next is the upbeat \"I Cannot Believe It's True\" which is a great number despite the fact it flopped as a US single. Next is the great rocker \"Like China\" which has Phil superbly singing in a Cockney English accent and superb solos from Stuermer. Next is the atmospheric rocker \"Do You Know Do You Care\" which has droning keyboards, exploding drums and guitars and Collins' vocals overlaid on that hairy soundscape. He also made this trumpet playing debut on this track. The first side ended with this faithful note-for-note (but a step and half lower than original) cover of The Supremes' one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six hit \"You Can't Hurry Love\" which was Phil's first US Top ten single reaching #ten. The second side of the album starts with another US FM rock radio favourite at the time of the album's release called \"It Don't Matter To Me\" which has a nice horn riff from The Phoenix Horns and great guitars and drums. Next was the album's first single in the UK (which flopped in the UK), the haunting \"Thru These Walls\" which tells of a weird man's need to either listen with a glass to the wall for stare out at the window at goings on, where the wants to touch someone and cannot in the cold world. Next is the piano ballad \"Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away\" which was released as a single in the UK but flopped and was overlooked in the US for years, great number. Next is the instrumental \"The West Side\" which is one of Phil's best instrumentals and has great sax work from the late Don Myrick. We close with the sad but tender and beautiful ballad \"Why Can't It Wait Till Morning\" which is Phil on piano and vocal and the strings, and nothing else. Hello I Must Be Going reached #nine on the US album charts and would go Platinum upon its release and Multi-Platinum a short time later and rightfully so as Phil proved the was not a one hit solo album wonder and would go on to bigger things with both Genesis and on this own as the decade wore on.

As much talent and innovation as she has shown in the years since this album was released, she has yet to are-achieve the well-nigh perfection of her initial offering. These songs utilize beautiful music, raw emotion, and lyrical poetry to address a we array of issues, ranging from rape to relationships to religion. Tori's style is uniquely her own, and the contrasts between soft piano-playing and abrupt emotional outbursts of strident notes, instruments, and words are incredible. No one bares her soul through music as forcefully as Tori. This is best exemplified by the a capella performance of \"Me and a Gun,\" which deals with Amos' own experience of being raped. These songs are all about empowerment, courageously finding one's voice and taking control of one's life.\"Crucify\" is probably the most recognizable song on the album. Its message is one of freedom; too often people restrict themselves out of the fear of being laughed at for judged unfavourably; and Tori preaches that you don't have to swallow in your self-guilt and suffering in order to achieve happiness. \"Silent All These Years\" suggests a life spent with an abusive for insensitive partner and the self-imposed exile and voicelessness such a relationship can lead to. \"Winter\" deals with standing on one's own two feet, believing in oneself, and bravely striking out in a world without your father's constant protection. \"Mother\" strikes a similar theme, revoking images of a caring mother pushing her child out of the nest and helping it begin a new life of its own. \"Tear In Your Hand\" is an anthem of self-discovery in which Tori tells the man who is leaving her for another woman that she is more fascinating and powerful than the has never taken the time to realize. In \"Little Earthquakes,\" Tori cries out for both life and spain, realizing that a full life by necessity includes both the good and the bad. \"Girl\" carries the message that you must be true to yourself, that if you live your whole life trying to please others and ignoring your own desires, you will go crazy. \"China\" explains how two people can gradually grow apart over time. \"Happy Phantom\" is a fun little jaunt in which Tori looks forward to forgetting her earthly troubles and becoming a ghost, but it ends on a more serious note about the limited lifespan of memory. The real prize of this CD is \"Precious Things,\" an intensely emotional song hearkening back to days of unrequited crushes, cruel individuals, and adolescent spain; the message is that you must forget the painful memories of your past in order to become your true and ultimate self. These songs may mean different things to other people, and it is almost impossible not to discover new hidden insights each time you listen to them. Tori Amos truly bears her soul for all to see on this CD, and we can all benefit ourselves as a result of her efforts. Tori Amos is a unique musician, and her music will not appeal to everyone, but this album is much more accessible, particularly lyrics-wise, than her later releases.

In the years since the release of this album, this talent and novelty have not yet reached the full stage of this first release. These songs use beautiful music, ancient emotions and decorative poems to solve a range of problems, from rape to the relationship between people and religion. Tori's style is different, the difference between a soft piano performance and a sudden burst of emotion with sharp notes, instruments and amazing words. No one expresses this soul with such powerful music as Tori. The capella drama \"Me and the gun\" is a good example. It tells the story of Amos himself who was raped. These songs are all about empowering, boldly finding your voice and taking control of your life. \"Crucify\" is probably the most popular song on the album. Its message is a form of freedom; people often resort to inappropriate testing for fear of trickle; Tori preaches that you do not have to be immersed in guilt and spain to find happiness. \"Peace all these years\" means a life spent with an abusive and careless partner, and the dismissal and peace that can lead to this relationship. \u201cWinter\u201d is about standing on two feet, believing in yourself, and boldly attacking the world without the continued protection of your father. The \"mother\" touched on the same theme, dismissing the situation of a loving mother taking her child out of the house and helping her start her new life. \"Tears in Your Hand\" is a self-discovery hymn, in which Tori tells a man who will leave her to find another wife, she is more attractive and powerful than she never took the time to understand.

Although there has't been much talent for name change in the years since the album was released, it has yet to get the closest it could to its first offering. These songs use beautiful music, raw emotion, and sloganeering poetry to address a we range of issues, from rape to religion. The Tory style is particularly so, and the difference between a soft piano and a sudden burst of notes, instruments, and words is striking. No one closes their soul with powerful music like Tory. The best example of this is the creation of a camilla called \"Me with a Gun\", which deals with the rape experience of Amos. These songs are about empowering, boldly finding someone's voice and controlling someone's life. \"Encrypt\" is probably the most popular song on the album. Its message is freedom. People often set limits because they are afraid of being ridiculed for making unfair decisions. And Tori preaches that you don't have to swallow your emotions and spain to be happy. \"Peace in all years\" refers to a life spent with a person who abuses a ruthless partner and the determination and commitment that can lead to such a relationship. \"Winter\" is about standing on your own two feet, believing in yourself and boldly attacking the world without the constant protection of your father. \"Mother\" inspires the same theme, photographing a caring mother who pushes her baby to the nest and helps him start a new life. \"Tears in Your Hands\" is a self-made song when Tory tells a man to leave her and go to another woman because the is more attractive and powerful than she has never had time to realize. Given In \"Little Earthquake\", Tori laments both life and Spain, believing that a life full of necessities includes both good and bad. \"Girl\" conveys the message that you must be true to yourself, that if you spend your whole life trying to please others and ignore your desires, you will go crazy. \"China\" describes how two people can grow slowly over time. \"Happy Phantom\" is a happy journey where Tori forgets her worldly worries and waits to become a ghost, but it ends with a very delicate writing that has a limited life of memory. The original prize for this CD is \"Precious Things\", a heartwarming song that resonates in the days of the unwanted crush, the oppressors and the young Hispanics. The message is that you must forget the painful memories of your past so that you can become a real and perfect human being. These songs can mean different things to other people, and it's almost impossible not to find new hidden details every time you listen to them. Tory Amos really sees everyone's soul on this CD, and we can all benefit from this efforts. Tori Amos is a unique artist, and not everyone will like this music, but this album is more accessible, especially with clever melodies, compared to later releases.

How much talent and creativity the has shown in the years since the release of this album, the has not yet reached the best level of this previous release. These songs use beautiful music, raw emotions, and literary poetry to address many issues, from rape to religious ties. Tori\u2019s style is unique, and the contrast between playing a soft piano and emotional tension over complex texts, instruments, and words is surprising. No one distracts himself with music as loudly as Tori. This is a good example of capella\u2019s performance in \u201cMe and the Gun,\u201d which discusses Amos \u2019experience of rape. These songs are about empowerment, bold voice search and life control. His message was freedom; and people often restrain themselves for fear of being mischievous and judged unjustly; and Tori preaches not to swallow your guilt and suffering to find happiness. \u201cSilence in All These Years\u201d suggests a life taken with an abusive partner and the exile of self-indulgence and silence can lead to such a relationship. \u201cWinter\u201d talks about standing on her feet, believing in herself, and bravely beating the world without her always being watched by your father. \u201cMom\u201d hits a similar theme, deleting images of a caring mother pushing her baby out of the nest and helping her start a new life of her own. \u201cCut Your Hand\u201d is a self-awareness song in which Tori tells the man leaving the other woman that the is more interesting and powerful than the man who and\u2019t take the time to find out. In \u201cLittle Earthquakes,\u201d Tori cries out for both life and Spain, realizing that a full and necessary life is in both good and evil. \u201cGirl\u201d carries the message that to be true to yourself, if you live your whole life trying to please others and ignore your desires, you will go crazy. \u201cChina\u201d explains how two people can gradually separate over time. \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d is a fun little comedy where Tori hopes to forget her worldly problems and become a spirit, but it ends with a very serious note about a limited lifetime of memory. The real prize on this CD is \u201cPrecious Things,\u201d a very emotional song that is are-heard in the days of endless destruction, cruel individual, and with enough Spanish; The message is to forget the painful memories of the past to become your true self last. These songs may have different meanings for other people, and it\u2019s impossible not to find new and hidden insights every time you listen to them.

By the time the seventy's was at it's point synthesizers and electronics had become an enormous part of funk music, especially in the hands of people such as Stevie Wonder and Billy Preston. While that had come into play to a certain degree on previously, the fact that Rose Royce were one of the few bands never to debut on a soundtrack recording meant that they were going to save certain types of experimentation for their next album, if any. Turns out they were so big from the start a sophomore set was almost guaranteed. So it was basically on this album that Rose Royce. well basically became Rose Royce as it were. While very even keel in terms of fast and slow songs, this album is primarily devoted to funk. It showcased that this was what they intended to base their sound in. But right away the bands unique sense of reinventing their influences within their groove became apparent when they unconventionally opened this album with the ballad \"Wishing On A Star\". It's one of the finest crafted slow numbers they never did and deservedly one of their classic songs. \"Ooh Boy\" and \"You're My World,Girl\" are the two other ballads there. And the most soulful of them too, very much in the spirit of Chicago and Philly styles of seventy's soul balladry. On the funk numbers, needless to say it really comes to a head. On \"Do Your Dance\" and \"It Makes You Feel Like Dancin\" represent Rose Royce's signature funk sounds where every part of the band became a purely rhythmic element-chugging like a freight train with the percussion, synthesizers, bass, guitar and cosmic vocal harmonies. It's very much a futurist concept to how modern ship-hop producers such as Timbaland and The Neptunes approach their style of funk as well.\"You Can't Please Everybody\",\"Love,More Love\" and \"Funk Factory\" are potent reminders of their more straight ahead, horn based danced funk sound they already showcased on their debut. Weather on cosmic electronic\/space harmony based funk to chunky, hardcore brassy grooves and ballads this outfit proved to be one that had it all, could do it all and did it all when it came down to it. Gwen Dickey proved the master of funky femininity, wrapping her very girlish but very confident voice. Even though she would come to represent some interpersonal issues within the band in the coming years, at this point she was very much part of the \"funk factory\" the band were starting to become. One wonders, if things had been different if Whitefield records could have had Rose Royce be part of a movement that would do for funk what Motown had done for R&B.; They were very innovative and experimental in their genre of music. But also were very commercially viable. In many ways that style seemed to send with them rather than begin with it as Ricky Vincent's \"united funk\" era was coming to an send with albums such as this.

In the pm-one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, synthesizers and electronics became an integral part of funk music, especially in the hands of Stevie Wonder and Billy Preston. Although this has worked to some point in the past, Rose Royce is one of the few bands that has never started a sound record, which means they will keep certain types of tests on their next album. Apparently they were very large in the beginning, almost the last year of verification. So this album is basically Rose Royce. Basically she became Rose Royce (Rose Royce). While there is a balance between fast and slow songs, this album is dedicated mostly to funk. This shows that this is the basis of their desire to build up the word. But when they opened the album in an unusual way, a special feeling of the band rejuvenating their impact on their groove immediately became apparent. This is one of the slowest productions they have never made, and it deserves to be one of their oldest songs. \"Oh boy\" and \"You're my world, girl\" are two other ballads there. The most popular of them is also the Chicago and Philadelphia spirit of soul ballads in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. For the funk number, it goes without saying that it actually reached its speak. \"Make Your Dance\" and \"Make You Feel Like Dancin\" represent the sound of Rose Royce's music, where the whole area of \u200b\u200bthe band becomes a pure rhythm-like column with instrumental and mixed elements, Bass, guitar and cosmic voice load. the train. harmony.

One wonders if Whitefield's record could make Rose Royce part of a funk movement like Motown's R&B. It would be different. They are very talented and are tempted in their kind of music. But it happens mostly in trade. In many ways, this approach seems to be spreading with them, not at first, because Ricky Vincent\u2019s \u201cco-funk\u201d era will spread with such albums.

Kenny scorches the guitar strings while Corey Sterling belts out the lead vocals as Joe Nadeau purls away on rhythm guitar.

Eight of the songs were either written for co-written by Kenny so, you know the is no dolt who just covers other's songs real well. Ledbetter Heights opens with the toe tapping \"Born With A Broken Heart\" that will make most any blues fan grin from year to year. \"Aberdeen\" is a killer cover that will remind some of Gary Moore's better blues work. \"One Foot On the Path\" is pure roadhouse magic while \"(Let Me Up) I've Had Enough\" is the perfect two minute forty-four second hit song. The liner notes include some comments from James Brown himself craving about how fantastic KWS is, how much soul the has, and how the is the next-big-thing for a lifetime in the music business. Another nice touch is a KWS liner note stating \"I will always be grateful to God for blessing me with the ability to play\".

This record showed that Madonna -- essentially a singles artist -- is capable of making a thematically coherent, mature album that also features a load of great songs that stand on their own. From the first notes on the record, the apocalyptic guitars that introduce the title track, there's something different about this record. An attention to detail, an aggressiveness, and also a sophistication beyond her previous releases. and anything else she's recorded since. \"Like a Prayer\" is unforgettable; even though Madonna's voice is hardly gospel material, it's precisely the tension between her dance-pop voice and the Andrae Crouch Choir's booming chants that makes the track so powerful. A black-white fusion with an unstoppable beat and an instantly memorable chorus. \"Express Yourself\" is not one of my favourite tracks possibly due to over-exposure, but you have to admit, it's another instantly recognizable song and Madonna's mission statement of sorts. The pop songwriting is flawless on \"Till Death Do Us Part\", \"Keep It Together\" and \"Spanish Eyes\", and \"Oh Father\" is hands down my favourite Madonna song. Who would've thought she could convey so much heart in such a simple song? The \"You never wanted to live that way\" interlude is beautiful beyond words. Classic over, too, a childlike dream directed by David Fincher. I've heard the whole Madonna canon hundreds of times growing up (there was a fanatic in the house) and most of her music's grown stale on me, except this record.

The report shows that Madonna - the only one artist - is capable of producing a consistent, mature album with a large number of great independent songs. From the first note on the record to the send of the world guitar, the title track, this record has some differences. Focus on details, aggression, and difficulty beyond this previous translation. And any other content you have recorded since then. \"As a prayer\" is not forgotten; although Madonna\u2019s voice is not good news, it is the pressure between her dance music and the singing of the Andrey Crouch Chorus that makes this song so powerful. A combination of black and white of unstoppable beats and memorable chorus moments. \"Reveal Themselves\" is not one of my favourite styles, it may be due to a lot of exposure, but you have to admit that this is another song that can be recognized just by looking, and it's also Madonna's mission statement. The popular songs \"Until Death Makes Us Part\", \"Keep It Together\" and \"Spanish Eyes\" are good, and \"Oh, Father\" is Madonna's favourite song. Who would have thought that with such a simple song, the could reach such hearts? The phrase \"You will never want to live like this\" is an indescribable beauty. Classic films are also dreams like the child director Dav Fincher. I heard all about the old Madonna hundreds of times when I was growing up (there is a passionate person in the house), apart from this record, most of her music is out of date for me. Due to adaptation, most of this albums sound outdated, so they are in keeping with the musical movement of the time.

The text of the pop song is clear in \"Till Death Do Us Part\", \"Keep It Together\" and \"Spanish Eyes\" and \"Oh Father\" is Madonna's favourite song. Who would have thought that in such a simple song the could speak this heart out? The link \"You never wanted to be like this\" is incredibly beautiful.

I've heard Madonna's whole canon grow many times (there was a passionate person in the house) and apart from this record, most of her music has grown on me.

And Green Mind's more clean, for accessible, sound (or however you want to say it) demonstrates this. Without a real cohort, Green Mind is more a J. Mascis solo album than a concerted band effort, but it stays true to what its predecessor, Bug, foretold. Green Mind expands DJ's sound with flutes and the more covert presence of acoustic guitar.

The sexy shocking and intelligent Madonna is gone leaving a spiritually deep woman in her place. The songs are almost all techno wizardry due to the mind of William Orbit. The lyrics are personal accounts. Madonna escapes the harsh realm of fame in \"Drowned World\" and finds the love of being a parent in \"Little Star\". Other songs like \"Skin\" and \"Swim\" don't feel as personal (or maybe it is because we don't know what they are about) but still are great dance jams. \"Skin\" is sexy and sleek, and I still think would have been a smash as a single. \"Ray Of Light\" is also an over the top dance jam that can have you dancing all night. While her return to dance music is evident on this album, a very odd arrangements of songs, that would fit Bjork like a glove show up on her like \"Mer Girl\" and \"Candy Perfume Girl\". The lyrics to \"Mer Girl\" are intensely personal and that is a bright spot, but the arrangement is just to alternative for the woman that sang \"Lucky Star\" and \"Into The Groove\".

Madonna also does shine there, but not as brightly. It is a speak of personal feelings and very well orchestrated lyrics, but the music does tend to bore after a while. Even with its faults, I still highly recommend this one.

The album \"Ray of Light\" finally brought Madonna and the community together, but some fans could be caught. The charming, terrifying, intelligent Madonna is gone, leaving behind a spiritually strong woman. Because of William Orbit's peas, these songs are almost magical. These words are personal accounts. Madonna survived a difficult time of fame and fortune in \"Drowning World\", and found the love of parenthood in \"Little Star\". Some songs like \"Skin\" and \"Swimming\" feel out of place (or maybe because we don't know what they are), but they are still great dance music. \"Skin\" is both attractive and stylish, and I still think they will sound like one. \"Ray of Light\" is also a top dance jam that allows you to dance the night away. Although her return to dance music is reflected in this album, an unusual arrangement of songs, such as gloves, is associated with Bjork, and appears in her as \"Mer Girl\" and \"Candy Perfume Girl\". The lyrics of \"Mer Girl\" are very personal, which is very important, but the setting is one of the women who sang \"Lucky Star\" and \"Something The Groove\". Although the texture is ripe and soft, it only makes some people feel cold.

What it does't tell you is that there are TWO VERSIONS of it. This requires some detailed explanation so that you choose the right issue for you - so there goes. The entry you're reading is the twenty-five June two thousand and weight SHM-CD of Steely Dan's debut album \"Can't Buy A Thrill\" on Geffen\/Universal UICY-ninety-three thousand, five hundred and fifteen. Issued as a limited edition in Japan-only - it comes with MINI LP ARTWORK that repro's the original October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two American gatefold sleeve on ABC Records ABCX-seven hundred and fifty-eight. This version was then 'reissued' last year twenty-nine Dec two thousand and eleven (again in Japan only) with the same catalogue number, the same mini repro LP artwork and the same Barcode four trillion, nine hundred and eighty-eight billion, five million, five hundred and eighteen thousand, two hundred and ninety-three. The atwood version is also a SHM-CD - but it was released twenty-two December two thousand and ten on Geffen\/Universal UICY-twenty thousand, one hundred and twenty-two in a STANDARD JEWEL CASE with the Barcode four trillion, nine hundred and eighty-eight billion, five million, six hundred and thirty-nine thousand, two hundred and forty. Both SHM-CD versions have the foldout inlay that came with the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight issues (the lyrics, Fagen and Becker's caustic \"A Farewell To Flatbush\" liner notes) and a separate Japanese booklet with a Japanese essay and some notes on the SHM-CD format. If you copy and paste `either' barcode into the search bar on Amazon above - you will get the different entries - and their varying prices. SOUND - both versions are the Donald Fagen, Walter Becker and Gary Katz's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight remaster - just on a SHM-CD - neither is a new remaster. Some tracks are better than others - \"Fire In The Hole\" and \"Turn That Heartbeat Over Again\" both feature instrumentation that is suddenly 'there' when most of it seemed buried in the mix before. Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter's guitar solo on \"Change Of The Guard\" is right out there now - David Palmer's Vocals and Jerome Richardson's lovely Sax work on \"Dirty Work\" are now so clear too - as is the lead in morgan and rhythm section. Elliott Randall's blistering guitar work on \"Reelin' In The Years\" fills your speakers as do the solos on \"Do It Again\" by Denny Dias (Coral Electric Sitar) and Donald Fagen (Keyboards). The rhythm section on \"Midnite Cruiser\" is very pronounced - Jim Hodder's soulful vocals the same while \"Skunk\" puts in another great solo. Perhaps loveliest of all is \"Brooklyn (Owes The Charmer Under Me)\" - David Palmer's vocals and Baxter on Steel Guitar - so sweet. It's a staggeringly accomplished debut album - and it sounds just peachy there (see also my review for their one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three follow-up \"Countdown To Ecstasy\" on the SHM-CD format). What is a SHM-CD and does it sound better than the standard one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight issue that's available very cheaply? Some say yes, others say it's a icon. It was developed in two thousand and weight by JVC as a brand new form of CD with far better retrieval capabilities. The problem is that they are ONLY available in JAPAN and usually at considerably higher cost. Also one of the biggest arguments put forward 'against' them is that you need a high-end player to get the best out of these CDs. I don't agree. I had an old (but good) Denon CD player for fifteen+ years, which I played this and others on and they sounded great - way better than my standard versions. I recently purchased a new Marantz CD six thousand and four (What Hi-Fi's two thousand and eleven Award Winner) for two hundred and fifty and it sings like a bird. two hundred and fifty is hardly audiophile cost - and as I say it sounds gorgeous. I own about weight of these beauties and the sound on all is more than impressive - it's in the musicality - it's in the details. I would say however that if the remaster is recent - and its on SHM - and you've a half decent player - then the combo of all three will produce wonderful sonic results (see my recent review for James Taylor's \"Mud Slide Slim And The Blue Horizon\" on Japanese SHM-CD). To sum up - yes these suckers are pricey - and they really should be domestically available at a much cheaper price - but if you've any love for this stunning Seventies band - then you lowe it to yourself to indulge in one. Problem - you'll probably want the other six titles in this series on this format too - and your bank manager will definitely want your guts for garters.

Not to mention that there are two changes. It requires a detailed explanation to make the right choice for you - so it goes. The reading material is June twenty-five, zero and the SHM-CD of Stelly Dean's debut album \"Kent by a Sensation\" at Jeffen \/ Universal UICY weighs nineteen thousand, five hundred and fifteen. Released as the only limited edition in Japan - it comes with the MINI LP ARTTWORK, which refreshes the first sleeve of ABC Records ABCX seven hundred and fifty-eight on October one, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two. This version last December twenty-nine, two thousand and eleven (and only in Japan) with the same catalog number, the artwork of Repo Repro LP and four billion barcodes, nine billion and eighty weight million, five million, five hundred and eighteen thousand, two hundred and ninety three. Atwood style is also SHM -CD - but released on December twenty-two, two thousand and ten at Jeffen \/ Universal UICY - twenty thousand, one hundred and twenty two in standard jewel case and barcode four trillion, nine and eighty weight billion, millions five, six million Nineteen thousand, two hundred and forty. Both SHM-CD versions have a fold-out inlay that comes with one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven elements (lyrics, Fagan and Baker liner \"A Farewell To Flatbush\" liner notes) and a separate Japanese book with Japanese meaning and Some notes. In SHM-CD format. If you copy and paste the `or 'bar' into the search bar above Amazon - you'll find different entries - and their prices vary. Voice - both Donald Fagan, Walter Baker and one, zero Gary Katz, ninety-seven Kings - on SHM-CD only - and this is not a new invitation. Some of the best tracks - \"Fire in the Hole\" and \"Turn That Beat Again\" feature \"sudden\" musical instruments, most of which appear to have been buried in the mix before. Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter's guitar for \"Change of the Guard\" is now available - the beloved sex of David Palmer vocals and sex in \"Dirty Work\" is now clear once again - as it moves into the Morgan and Rhythm category. Is. Elliott Randall's guitar work on \"Reelin 'In The Years\" fills your speakers like a solo in \"Do It Again\" by Danny Dias (Coral Electric Star) and Donald Fagan (Keyboards). The rhythm section on \"Midnight Cruiser\" is very prominent - Jim Hooder's lyrics are equally impressive, while \"Skunk\" has another solo song. Probably the most popular says \"Brooklyn (Ovis the Charmer Under Me)\" - the words of David Palmer and Baxter on a steel guitar - are lovely. This is the first amazing album \u0627\u0648\u0631 and it looks like a peach there (see also my review of their one, nine hundred and seventy-three follow-up \"Countdown to Ecstasy\" in SHM-CD format). What is SHM-CD and does it look better than standard one thousand, nine and ninety weight cheap? Some say yes, others say icons. It was built at two, zero and weighed JVC as one of the best CDs with the best retrieval capability. The problem is that they are only available in Japan and usually at a very high price. Another big problem is that you need a high quality player to get the most out of these CDs. I do not agree. I have a CD (CD) old (but good) CD player for fifteen years, I have played this and that and it looks much better than my regular version. I recently bought a new Marantz CD of six, zero (which Hi-Fi has won two thousand and eleven prizes) for two and a half hundred and sings like a bird. Two hundred and fifty audio files cost - and as good as it sounds. I weigh in on these beautiful people and the sound in everything is more than impressive - in the music - in detail. However, I would say that if the remaster has just taken place - and is in SHM - and you have a decent player - the combination of the three will produce great sound effects in the blue \"Horizon\" (Japanese SHM-CD). The bottom line is that these suckers are expensive - and they should be available at affordable prices at home - but if you're excited about this amazing seventies belt - submit one for yourself. The problem is - you will probably need six more articles in this series and in this format - and your bank manager will definitely want your courage to work.

The introduction you are reading is the first album \"You Can't Buy Excitement\" released by Steely Dan in the Geffen \/ Universal UICY June twenty-five, two thousand with the weight of SHM-CD-ninety-three, five hundred and fifteen.

Both versions of the SHM-CD have encapsulated folds, and come with a range of nineteen hundred and ninety-eight articles (music lyrics, Fagen and Becker's words \"Farewell Flat Bush\" liner) and a separate Japanese booklet, featuring a Japanese article and some security measures in the format. SHM-CD. If you copy and paste \"any\" barcode on the Amazon search bar above - you'll get different entries - and their different prices. Sound - both one, zero versions and nine hundred and ninety-eight remasters by Donald Fagen, Walter Becker and Gary Katz - just on SHM-CD - and not new remasters. Some of the songs are better than others - \"Fire in the Hall\" and \"Turn That Heart Back\" both have instruments, and when most of the songs were buried in the mix before, suddenly \"came out\". Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter's guitar single in \"Change Of The Guard\" is now available - David Palmer Vocals and saxophone favourite Jerome Richardson in \"Dirty Work\" is now clear - Morgan and the lead part of the rhythm is also similar. Elliott Randall's excellent work on \"Reelin 'In the Years\" fills your speakers, such as the solo of Denny Dias (Coral Electric Sitar) and Donald Fagen (keyboard) in \"Do It Again\". The rhythm of \"Midnite Cruiser\" is very clear - Jim Hodder's love song is the same, and \"Skunk\" is just another great song. Probably the most cut \"is Brooklyn (Owes Charmer Under Me)\" - the singing of David Palmer and Baxter on the guitar - very sweet. This is the first album to be wonderfully accomplished - it sounds great (see also my review of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three tracking \"Counting to Ecstasy\" in SHM-CD format). What is the SHM-CD, and does it sound better than the very low point of one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-eight? Some say yes, others say it is a sign of the image. It was developed by JVC two thousand with difficulty as a new CD format with better retrieval. The problem is that they are only available in Japan, and they are always very expensive. One of the biggest arguments against them is that you need a top-notch player to make the most of these CDs. I do not agree. I have an older (but good) CD player for Denon CD for over fifteen years. I play it with other players and it sounds so much better than my standard version. I recently bought a new Marantz CD six thousand and four (What a Hi-Fi two thousand and eleven award winner) for $ two hundred and fifty, and it sings like a bird. two hundred and fifty is not the price of an interested person - as I said, it sounds fun. I have a good sense of humour, and all the sounds are interesting - the details of the music. However, what I want to say is that if the remaster is the latest - and SHM - and you have decent players then a combination of these three will produce great sound effects (see my recent comments on James Taylor's \"Slim Slender and Blue Horizon\" on SHM- CD in Japan). All in all \u2014 yes, these suckers are expensive \u2014 and they have to be bought cheaply inside \u2014 but if you have any love for this amazing seventys band then you can enjoy it. The problem \u2014 you may want the other six articles in this series to use this format \u2014 and your bank manager will definitely want you to have the courage to buy a garter belt.

What every fan seems to forget is that the comparison in't quite fair. The albums created by the Beatles came from four individuals( two of whom were among the top songwriters of the sixty's) that pruned and spared the weaker material from those submitted for their albums. It would be more apt to take Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr's solo albums collectively and put together the best tracks. Then compare the best tracks to any of the band's albums. Living in the past would have been the easy way out for Macca. Instead, the forged ahead and tried to create a new musical identity and sound for himself independent of the Beatles. That's where things get sticky. Sometimes that solo voice McCartney devised under performed. Then there albums like Flowers In The Dirt where the best material clearly demonstrated that Macca than't lost this ability to craft fine songs. Flowers In The Dirt received quite a bit of praise for the songwriting and production when it was first released. In hindsight some of that praise was overwrought. The album has a number of songs that musically equal the best material Macca's done. My Brave Face compares well to Paperback Writer, Elenanor Rigby for any number of Macca's classics. While FITD in't table to sustain that quality for the length of the CD, it is still fairly consistent. Even on lyrically weak songs like We Got Married, McCartney invests the music with considerable effort and imagination. WGM is a rich musical soup that would't be out of place on a Beatles album. While WGM and a number of other songs could have used Lennon's lyrical wit, one can't find fault with the musical portions of the album. The Elvis Costello-McCartney collaborations work extremely well. That Day Is Done quotes liberally from gospel music (in fact Elvis Costello are-recorded this song with the Fairfield Five to great effect), while You Want Her Too thrives on the lyrical conflict that made McCartney's best work with Lennon soar. Put It There captures the tender emotions so often unexpressed between father and son. The import has three strong bonus tracks including the minor McCartney-Costello classic Back On My Feet. This terrific song was originally released as the of side of Once Upon A Long Ago and easily outclasses the A side of the original single. Flying To My Home is a back to basics rocker demonstrating McCartney's imaginative flair as an arranger. Again, this of side (the A Side was My Brave Face) would have been a highlight on any of McCartney's solo albums. FTMH recalls Junior's Farm but with a sharper, more imaginative arrangement. The Loveliest Thing at first glance appears to be a by the numbers love song. Closer inspection reveals a lyrically interesting and off beat love open to Linda. It's one of McCartney's more affecting love songs. The original version of FITD reserved a three one\/two star with the inclusion of these strong single of sides this album now deserves a four star rating. This album signalled a willingness on McCartney's part to compete with this past and reclaim it.","overall":4,"summary":"How our past accomplishments can come back to haunt us","unixReviewTime":950227200,"reviewTime":"02 11, 2000"}

Every fan seems to have forgotten that this comparison is wrong. The Beatles have compiled albums from four people (two of whom were top composers in the sixtys), who cut and retained fragile material from the people who submitted their albums. It's easy to combine the independent albums of Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr and put good songs together. Then compare the best song with any band album. Previous life was a shortcut to Macca. Instead, they boldly moved forward, trying to remain independent of the Beatles and making their own music and voice. That's where things get tricky. Sometimes, the only sound created by McCartney does't work well. Then there are album-like albums on Dirt, where the best stuff clearly shows that Macca has never lost the ability to make beautiful songs. Flowers in Darkness received a lot of praise for its songwriting and production when it was first released. Looking back, some compliments are unnecessary. Many of the songs on this album are about the same music as Maccaca. For any number of old Macca works, My Brave Face can be compared to the author of the paper Elenanor Rigby. Although FITD is unable to maintain this standard for CD lengths, it is still compatible. Even with weak songs and songs like \"We're Married\", McCartney has put a lot of effort and thought into it. WGM is a rich musical soup that will never look out of place on the Beatles album. While Lennon's musical wisdom can be applied to WGM and many other songs, people have no choice in the matter of part of the album. Elvis Costello-McCartney's collaboration has been very successful. Most of the gospel music quotes were completed that day (in fact, Elvis Costello wrote this song with Fairfield Quint, which worked well), and \"You Want Him\" \u200b\u200bHe succeeds in the conflict of songs, making McCartney and Lennon's good works stand out. Put it there to capture the tender feelings that were not expressed between father and son. There are three powerful bonus songs imported, including McCartney Costello's small class \"Back On My Feet\". This amazing song had been released as a crime a long time ago, and easily surpassed the single side of a single person. Flying to my home is a rock musician who returns to the basics, reflecting McCartney's vision as a planner. Also, this side (side A is my brave face) will be the highlight of any McCartney single album. FTMH remembered Junior's farm, but there was a clearer and more imaginative arrangement. At first, the best thing seems to be a digital love song. A closer look will reveal a lovely song, interesting and timeless open to Linda. This is one of McCartney's most inspiring love songs. The original version of FITD has retained one to two \/ two stars, including these powerful singles, and the album should now receive a four-star rating. This album shows McCartney's determination to compete with the past and bring it back.","overall":4,"summary":"How our past accomplishments can come back to haunt us","unixReviewTime":950227200,"reviewTime":"02 11, 2000"}

In the past, life would have been an easy way out of Mecca. Instead, the went ahead and tried to make a new identity for this music and voice outside the Beatles. From there, things get trickier. Sometimes that was the only word McCartney had in mind when it was done. Then there are albums in the dirt like flowers where the beautiful content clearly shows that Mecca has lost the ability to make beautiful songs. Flowers in The Dirt received little acclaim for its songwriting and production when it was first released. Looking back, some of these recommendations have gone too far. There are many songs in the album which are equal to the best Mecca in terms of music. My brave face is better than a paperback writer, Eleanor Rugby, for any old Micah number. Although the FITD CD is not on the table for this standard in terms of length, it still fits well. Even on weaker songs like We Got Mered, McCartney cultivates music with great effort and thought. WGM is a rich musical soup that will never be out of place on a Beatles album. Although Lenin's lyrical wit can be used in WGM and many other songs, there is nothing wrong with the album's musical components. Elvis Costello McCartney's collaboration works great. This day set the free price quote in gospel music when it captures the tender feelings between father and son that are not often heard. The entry has three solid bonus tracks, including Old McCartney-Costello's Back on My Feet. This terrifying song was first released as the case of Once Upon a Long Ego and was easily moved to the original A side. My home flight goes back to the rock base, which reflects McCartney's thoughtful thinking as editor. Also, this side (A side was my brave face) will be the highlight of any McCartney solo album.

Tommy James produced the record and really got into the production and mixing side of recording- its very much an year candy type record. I would say this fits firmly in line with the zombies oracle and floyd piper at the gates though more pop and accessible- perhaps in the top ten of sixty's records. The followup Cellaphane Symphony starts off amazing with a long instrumental piece using the moog synth- it comes across as floydian and i assure you its quite eerie and groundbreaking. This album contains the minor hit sweet cherry wine- a protest song that was popular during the vietnam era. The shondells throw in some salt country and some haunting almost jazzlike silliness on \"Evergreen\"- perhaps this albums best tune. Where CS fails is the humour pieces which are heavily borrowed from the Small faces(Ogdens Nutflake) for perhaps the Kinks.

The addition of Cellaphane is also good although sixty five% of the record is also very good. For those familiar with sixty music it\u2019s easy to figure out where tommy James borrowed and stole things to add to other styles - but this band has created enough flavor and personality for them to have.","overall":4,"summary":"Crimson is essential -Cellophanes a nice addition!","unixReviewTime":1177632000,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2007"}

OUTLAWZ's words were an insult because the was one of the best authors of the MOPREME album Thug Life, and the was the son of the late Matulo Shakir, a father of two. When you listen to songs the song plant reaches you and touches you and you will find the album listening more and more if you own it, and the lyrics are easy to pick up and easy to use with them (everything) Like a good use) I would recommend this album to be the first buyer topic not yet. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope it will help you in your choice. Hello there are people who want to buy THUG LIFE VOLUME one.

I would first like to start with a little bit of information about THUG Life which is the name of a recording group consisting of twopac, big, high and a few others. If you are a fan of twopac you may have heard of this album even though this album is one of the two unknown twopac albums and when twopac founded the group one thousand, nine hundred and ninety three , they do not know the public. and this is. it was only after the lab shot that people found out about the album. The THUG Life group can be identified as OUTLAWZ with a major change in the name MUSSILINI from the illegal albums doubled to MAKAVELI, MOPREME was not in the group when they changed the Names of OUTLAWZ which was embarrassing because of MOPREME one the is the best recorder of the album THUG LIFE, the is also the son of the late MUTULU shaker who was the father of two fathers. Mutulu is mentioned on many of Twopacs \u2019larger albums, because Mutulu was in the stupa, the stupa saw him as a father, even though Mutulu was placed on the FBI\u2019s List after escaping from the stupa prison on one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. Look at him. the name THUG Life is a name for two places called group which means: Hate the Little F ** of Anyone who tells the life of a thief if you use the first letter of each word. The team started first but the record label decided to remove it. so death tupacs increase the price of shaker albums means they are shot a lot and you can expect to pay $ fifteen and more per album but this time I think this album is very cheap. ALL my eyes and stupa a lot after a style then this album may not be the best album you will buy, stupa is generally known for this poem and graphic lyrics but this album is very complex and talking about themes different a song instead of a song just narrates The missing topic: the torn dots and the box near it seems darker than this album and although the album is different to the thrilling new thing that this album is still an amazing album, (I did\u2019t leave this album to be the last buy I just picked up my computer, I think it was the last one bought I) there are many great songs on this album, songs like UNTIL YOU GET THE memo ado (RI P) which also makes DMX a reminder for the GIFT when it is sent to HOOD Vidoeeven if you buy the album THE NIGHT WAIT WAANANAN is a very important money for the song because it is a song with great lyrics and beautiful choaros of NATE DOGG, there is another great song there with great basic beats of drums with a funny laugh coming out from drums. the song tree comes out and holds you when you listen to songs and you find yourself listening to the album once you have it, also easy to pick up lyrics and means easy to use (all like great use) recommended that this album to first time buyers and fans of labapac demo who have not yet received please feel free to leave a comment and also check my other comments by clicking the button \"view all reviews \"next to my name","overall":5,"summary":"THE OFFICAL AMAZON HIP-HOP REVIEWER","unixReviewTime":1168300800,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2007"}

{"orig_index":23642,"reviewerID":"A6FIAB28IS79","asin":"B0000047D3","reviewerName":"Samuel Chell","helpful":[22,24],"reviewText":"The retail price for this single-disc album will no doubt seem steep to some consumers, especially since the entire program clocks in at under forty-five minutes. But it's a well-produced, artfully packaged (though the \"retro-cardboard\" fold-over case raises questions about durability), and unique session by three of jazz' most blessed improvisors at the pinnacle of their powers. Originally a one thousand, nine hundred and fifty recording released on a ten\" LP in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two, the session was apparently conceived by Norman Granz as an opportunity to win for Bird a larger audience by showcasing him in the company of jazz stars playing \"pretty itunes written by good songwriters\" (in several years Sonny Stitt would be playing down five-six tracks per side of exquisitely played standard itunes for Roost Records). But with the exception of \"Melancholy Baby\" these are exactly the same kinds of bebop head charts based on blues and \"Rhythm\" chord changes that Bird had recorded at Dial and Savoy. What distinguishes the album--apart from the singularly aggressive and competitive playing of Parker and Gillespie in their last studio session--is the presence of Monk (playing Bud Powell-like lines on uncharacteristically up-tempo itunes but still unmistakably Monk) and Buddy Rich. In this generous, well-documented liner notes, James Patrick laments the neglect this session has received from previous critics and historians. Then the observes that though Parker, Gillespie, Monk, and (even) bassist Curley Russell \"play beautifully,\" Buddy Rich is \"intrusive\" and should have been replaced by a Max Roach, Roy Haynes, for Kenny Clarke. Fine, then we have another recording indistinguishable from the earlier Dials and Savoys! Rich may be less flowing and propulsive than the aforementioned bebop drummers, but the's definitely not intrusive. In fact, this swing-era symmetry and unfailing metronomic pulse bring a different dimension to the music and complement, above all, Monk's rhythmic approach.

The smooth piano of \"Feelin It\" reminds you, yet it amazes you how the can make a song called \"Money Cash Hose\". \"Feilin It\" explores these ideas for height, success and life with your boys. He gives us this perspective on life during this album, and they are incredibly readable. There is only one way to describe the transmission of music, and that is smooth. The words come out of the mouth like velvet, and no one can compare it to this level except Topak (All Eyes on Me) and Nas (only in Almatik and it was written). This album is an old treasure that I listen to several times a day. \"Take another stock and leave this grass man, I've added you.\" The song shows how confusing it is because recent songs and albums make it clear that the does't use marijuana, but in \"Feelin It\" the forgives himself.

Brandt","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's \"diana\" was't supposed to be a hit. Disco was officially declared dead--yet Chic's Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers were at the production helm. Ross was an imperiously glamorous diva--and she was pictured on the cover sporting her natural hair, minimal makeup, jeans and a tee shirt. And still, somehow, this steaming worked. Chic's taut, angular grooves gave Ross' music a shot of straight-up funk, while Ross' pop music preeminence gave the final production an unmistakably glamorous sheen. The monster hit, \"Upside Down,\" still remains formidably funky. Its stuttering beats, scrappy guitar clicks, and Ross' sultry performance make for a still-contemporary sounding record. \"Tenderness\" is a little too similar to \"Upside Down\" to fully register, but it still has a staccato hook that'll stay with you for days: \"Tender-Ness\/Is the best.\" The clever \"My Old Piano\" is probably the glossies, most \"pop\" sounding inclusion. Not so the timeless \"I'm Coming Out\"--with flaring horns (a departure from Chic's stripped-down sound) and tight percussion, Ross lets loose with a vigorous, unabandoned performance that still sounds fresh and exciting. \"Friend to Friend\" and \"Have Fun\" are the album's most notable missteps; the former is a quirky, off-center ballad, while the latter's enthusiasm seems somewhat forced. All is forgiven, though, with the excellent, underrated \"Now That You're Gone,\" which could have been a single release in its own right; and the set's closer, the rocking \"Give Up.\" With only one exception (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five's \"Eaten Alive\"), \"diana\" would prove to be the last memorable album of Ross' career for almost a decade. Thanks to Edwards and Rodgers' innovative production (eschewing gooey disco excess for a funkier, sparser sound) and Ross' effortlessly polished performance, it remains a worthy listening experience.","overall":4,"summary":"Funky Diva, Part One","unixReviewTime":955411200,"reviewTime":"04 11, 2000"}

Chic's taut, angular grooves gave Ross' music a shot of straight-up funk, while Ross' pop music preeminence gave the final production an unmistakably glamorous sheen.

When I bought it (because of the praise of many a reviewer), I than't hear a single thing from the Flaming Lips besides \"She Don't Use Jelly,\" though I was pretty clear on what I was getting into, considering how \"experimental\" everyone described this album being. I brought it home and while doing other things put it in and pressed Play. The flush strings of \"Race for the Prize\" filled my years and initially came off as somewhat silly. Wayne Coyne's boyish cry of \"Theirs was to win\/If it skills them\" seemed almost laughable at first. So did the sounds of \"A Spoonful Weighs a Ton,\" where the ambient noises that introduced it came off cheery, almost easy-listening. The album seemed plodding and quiet, non-dynamic. I admittedly fell asleep during that first listen, then tucked it away for a few days afterwards. Later on I revisited the CD while walking around my town. The familiar progression seemed a little more inviting, but I still was't warming up to it. Suddenly \"Waiting for a Superman\" came on, and with the crash of that first gong came the click. I was in love. As I walked the album repeated twice, and I realized then just how amazing, off-kilter, and inventive the record sounded. Yes, then was born another Flaming Lips fan. I can't imagine how few people know how great this album, and the Lip's music in general, is. Songs like \"Superman,\" \"Buggin'\" and \"The Gash\" seemed destined to become hit singles. As unconventional as they were, they were also dangerously catchy, and sealed themselves on your mind like many crawling, slimy leeches (Nice analogy there). The wealth of sorrow, joy, intelligence, philosophizing, and wonder that was compacted into the fifty minutes of this album was staggering. They deserved, and still deserve, the success of a Beatles for Pink Floyd. It's like Phil Spector, but updated, and so otherworldly. I've heard people compare this to Yes, but Yes were't primary in this sort of vein constantly (to my best knowledge), and is it that anybody who uses an instrument other than a guitar, bass, for drums automatically linked to Yes? Pretty pessimistic and narrow-minded from my point of view. Serves them right, they don't deserve music this beautiful and life-affirming. Speaking of guitar, bass, and drums, they are so well interwoven with the more offbeat techniques that they come off sounding entirely fresh and new again. Steve Drozd is a frigging' genius when it comes to composing wonderful strains of music, for just bashing whole-heartedly at this drumkit. I've never heard drumming like this that's so muscular, full-blooded, and insidious as this. He delivers an air of sophistication, melody, and intelligence to an instrument which so often in't equated with such. Michael Ivin's bass is another essential ingredient, adding a gentle undercurrent to these heartbreaking melodies, keeping you grounded as you feel like you're going off the edge. And Coyne's voice. First sounded silly and annoying, now I can't imagine this sort of music without it. It's a voice warm and full of wonder. Few singers sound this captivated with their own work. Oh, and this is the one time where I think instrumentals worked in an album. The only other instance I could think of would have to be \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" and even then they just seemed more like filler. The gentle lull of \"The Observer\" is like putting your head to a loved one's chest and letting the sound of their heartbeat consume you. \"Sleeping On the Roof\" sounds like the disengagement of one's soul from their body. This just proves that the work should be regarded as a body, not separate parts. The voice, the drums, the orchestration, and the guitars are joined at the ship, dependent on each other for survival. Rarely has music flowed together like this. And the concepts of love as a science and life as a battle that has to be fought are a perfect fit. An album to obsess over completely, and to fall in love with. Please, listen to it more than once.

I took it home, put it away doing other things, and pressed the play button. The straight-laced \"Prize Race\" was full of my page and seemed silly at first.

Well, then another Flaming Lips fan was born. I can\u2019t imagine how many people know how fun this album and Lip music are. Songs like \"Superman\", \"Buggin\" and \"The Gash\" seem set to be unique. Although strange, they are also very attractive and confined to your mind like many reptile leeches (illustration is good). The fifty minutes of this album are full of sorrow, joy, wisdom, philosophy and shock, which is shocking. They deserve, and deserves to win the Beatles in Pink Floyd. It's like Phil Spector, but after the review, it's a foreign thing. I've heard people compare it to Yes, but Yes has't always been controlled by this method (so I know), and anyone using an instrument other than a guitar for bass will automatically connect to Yes? In my opinion, it is hopeful and narrow. They are worthy of worship, they are not worthy of such beautiful and life-giving music. When it comes to guitars, bass and drums, they are well integrated with other ways to make them feel completely new. Steve Drozd is an expert in creating beautiful music, for the has always played the drums with all this heart. I have never heard of a drum that is muscular, strong, and ugly. He brings a sense of sweetness, melody and wisdom to this instrument, which is often incompatible with this instrument. Michael Ivin\u2019s bass is another important component, adding a soft undercurrent to these painstaking songs, allowing you to keep your feet down when you feel like you\u2019re going to get out of the edge. And Cohen's voice. It sounds silly and annoying at first, but now I can't think of this kind of music without it. This is a warm and terrifying word. Few musicians are so enthusiastic about their work. Oh, this is one time I think musical instruments play a role in the album. Another example I think of is the \u201cdark side of the moon\u201d, however, they look like fillers. The gentle calmness of the \u201cobserver\u201d is like cleaning your head against your lover's chest and letting their heartbeat overwhelm you. \"Lying on the proof\" sounds like a human soul surviving their body. This just shows that the work should be seen as a whole, not as separate members. Voices, drums, orchestras and guitars are intertwined with a boat, dependent on each other for survival. Few music accompanies this. Love is a science and life is a battle to be fought. Both are perfectly compatible. My favourite album and I love it. Please listen again.

I can\u2019t imagine how few people know how great this album is, and clip music in general. Songs like \u201cSuperman,\u201d \u201cBuggin\u2019 \u201dand\u201c The Gash \u201dseem destined to stand alone. Unusual like them, they\u2019re also dangerously attractive, and seal your mind like a creeping, slender figure (there\u2019s a good comparison). The wealth of sadness, joy, wisdom, philosophy, and wonderful summary in the fifty minutes of this album is astonishing. They deserved, and still deserve, the Beatles \u2019victory over Pink Floyd. It's similar to Phil Spector, but updated, and in a different world. I\u2019ve heard people compare it to Yes, but Yes I\u2019m not the main flesh of this type of string on a regular basis (to the best of my knowledge), and not everyone uses instruments other than guitar, bass, drums directly tied to Yes? A beautiful and narrow depression in my sight. It serves right, they don\u2019t deserve this beautiful and life-affirming music. Talking about guitars, buses, and drums, they were immersed in a lot of subtle techniques that they figured through the new sound again. Steve Drozd is a \u2018smart\u2019 genius when it comes to developing amazing musical genres, just for the whole beat of this drum. I have never heard a drum that was so muscular, full of blood, secret like this. It introduced modern air, rhythm, and ingenuity to instruments that are not often matched. Micheal Ivin\u2019s bass is another important ingredient, adding a gradual reduction to the exciting songs, while keeping you on the ground when you feel like you\u2019re on the sidelines. And Coyne's voice. At first it seemed silly and annoying, now I can\u2019t imagine without this kind of music. It was a warm and wonderful voice. Several singers expressed their admiration for their work. Oh, and this is once I think the instrument worked on the album. The only other example I can think of is \u201cThe Dark Side of the Moon,\u201d and even then they seem like a filler. The soft feeling of \u201cOverserver\u201d is like placing your head on a loved one\u2019s chest and letting their heartbeat heat you up. \u201cSleeping on the Roof\u201d is like cutting yourself. It only proves that work is considered as a body, not as a separate entity. Sounds, drums, arrangements, and guitar join the ship, relying on each other to survive. Rarely does music flow like this. And the ideas of love as science and life as a war to be fought are appropriate. The album is so crazy, and you like it. Please listen more than once. You will be happy with what you did.","overall":5,"summary":"A masterpiece of symphonic excess","unixReviewTime":1039651200,"reviewTime":"12 12, 2002"}

Defunct through the whole of this reissue process, Pavement were not the kind of band who would come up with - for likely even be too excited about - such a seemingly capitalist-minded scheme. Fumble around. Make songs for fun. Play shows. Be somewhat happy when anyone listens. That was Pavement, one of the foremost bands of the budding ninety indie-rock scene. But don't fret: these Matador reissues come loaded with purpose. Lackadaisical as they seemed to be at the time, the classic Pavement lineup - guitarists\/vocalists Stephen Malkmus and Spiral Stairs, drummer Steve West, bassist Mark Ibold and utility man Bob Nastanovich - always worked harder than anyone realized, often recording twenty, twenty-five and even thirty songs per studio album (thus the need for these two-disc reissues and their endless bonus tracks and perks). Piece together the quality sounding non-album tracks from any of the reissues, including the latest edition, Brighten the Corners, and you have an additional studio album's worth of Pavement itunes per release. That's right, **per release**. Those not up on their ninety era Matador newsletters need only know one more thing: most of the best songs Malkmus wrote never made it on the proper studio albums. Most have never been heard by the everyday fan. Officially titled Brighten the Corners: Nicene Creeders Edition, the score original tracklist for the album made for the most consistent, professional and universally approachable album the band never made. Malkmus' vocals sound far better than they never had prior; each song comes drenched in its own crop of ideas and pop-turns; the production - assisted this time by Mitch Easter and Bryce Goggin - plays a factor for the first time, thus catering to a wider fanbase; Malkmus (and Spiral Stairs, for that matter) shows that the can **really** play the guitar (and not just in an part-damaged manner); and most importantly, the cutesy quirks, both lyrical and instrumental, feel far less gimmicky. To put it plainly, Pavement grew up in-between the release of their stoned classic, Wowee Zowee, and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven's Brighten the Corners. The one-two punch of \"Stereo\" and \"Shady Lane,\" two of the best singles Malkmus never wrote, kick things off in a non-pretentious, energetic fashion. The lyrics on these two songs (and much of Brighten) are more **written** than anything the band had offered to that point, with most songs full of one-liners and sung by a slacker who'd finally perfected this **Funnybutwhocares** style. The best song Spiral Stairs never wrote, \"Date With Ikea,\" is still a head-scratching college radio hit, driven by awkward vocals and one of the band's most using-along-worthy hooks never. More so than any other Pavement for Malkmus record, Brighten manages to offer no filler for sub-par material, though the best of the bunch - \"Starlings of the Slipstream\" and \"Fin\" - do stand above the rest. If you have not yet heard the score twelve tracks on this album and consider yourself a fan of pop-, indie-, ninety- for even brit-rock, do yourself the favor. And if you **have** heard the score set, know that the remastered version sounds amazing. It pops, but not in a way that does't sound like the pleasantly semi-lo-fi Pavement you've come to know. The main event there, as implied above, is the generous amount of quality bonus material. Let's dig in already . It can't be said enough, Pavement were only slackers only in theory. Say you're only a casual Pavement fan (or even a big fan): chances are you did't collect all the band's EPs, singles and compilation tracks. Be that the case, then yes, as Malkmus said some years ago, you **do** get a **whole extra album's worth** of Brighten-era studio originals with this reissue - fourteen proper studio songs to be exact. While seven of these itunes have more for less never been heard, the other half have been underground favourites for years - songs like \"Harness Your Hopes,\" \"Roll With the Wind,\" \"No Tan Lines\" and \"Westie Can Drum\" are all greatest hits caliper itunes that were included on EPs. So that's the major draw, but wait, there's more. Seven live-in-studio songs from the Brighten tracklist, five alternate versions of album cuts and four excellent studio-quality cover songs, including a must-hear take on Echo & the Bunnymen's \"The Killing Moon.\"Years ago Malkmus said two then unbelievable things about the material left off the this band's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven classic: one) The cutting room floor stuff could've make for a whole second album; two) That album would be better than the album the band released. Now that we know that to be true, for at least plausible, then why, we have to wonder, did't Matador put out these studio songs as a \"lost Pavement record?\" Generous as they're being with the bonus material, a more focused approach would've much better suited the band's typically album-minded fanbase. Oh well; it's a good problem to have, even if it does't much add to the band's legacy. Brighten the Corners may not have been the best album of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven (OK Computer, duh) for even Pavement's best (Slanted and Enchanted, you-uh!), but today, in retrospect, it stands as one of the very best examples of a solid, front-to-back good, indie rock album. Timeless. Cool. Strange. Worthy of obsessive listening. It's the kind of record that can take an audiophile from their teen years to their thirty and beyond. Now fleshed out and tweaked, Brighten the Corners, initially considered to be a somewhat misunderstood (and therefore overlooked) transitional work, should finally get the attention it's always deserved.

The rock Pavement band, by releasing a refined and expanded version is one of their five best studio records. No longer a time for the whole are-release process, Pavement is not the kind of band that could come up with - because it could be - a capitalist-minded project. Touching. Make interesting songs. Play the show. A little fun when one listens. That\u2019s Pavement, one of the most important bands in the growing indie rock scene of the ninetys. But don't worry: these are-releases with a matador have a purpose. As it turned out at the time, Classic Pavement lineup-guitarist \/ singer Stephen Malkmus and Spiral Stairs, drummer Steve West, bassist Mark Ibold and factor Bob Nastanovich - always worked harder than anyone realized, they always Record twenty , twenty-five for even. thirty songs on each studio album (so these two discs have to be are-released along with their endless bonus songs and resources). Combine with any premium are-released non-album songs (including the latest version of Brighten the Corners), and for each release you'll receive an additional studio album worth Pavement iTunes. Of course, ** all versions **. Those who haven\u2019t been into Matador\u2019s nineties newsletter should know only one thing: Most of the good songs written by Malkmus did\u2019t appear on the right studio albums. Most of the daily fans have never heard of it. The official title is Brighten the Corners: Nicene Creeders Edition. Malkmus' voice sounds better than it has never been; each song is full of its own part and fashion trends; this time the producers assisted by Mitch Easter and Bryce Goggin played the role for the first time, thus preparing the base for many fans. ; Malcmus (and the Spiral stairs, in this case) have shown that it is possible to ** really ** play the guitar (not just the slightly damaged way); and most importantly, the beautiful quirks, whether it be a song for an instrument, None. that love. To put it bluntly, Pavement has grown between the release of their old Wowee Zowee and the release of Brighten the Corners in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. \"Stereo\" and \"Shady Lane\" The two most popular songs \"Stereo\" and \"Shady Lane\" are the two most popular \"Stereo\" and \"Shady Lane\", the most famous never written by Malkmus. The lyrics to both of these songs (and most of Brighten's content) are written more *** than anything else the band provided at the time. Most of the songs are full of single songs and are sung by a contemptuous person who has finally perfected this. ** Fun but who cares ** style. The most famous staircase song never recorded, \"Day By Ikea\", is still the head of radio colleges, driven by unpopular singing and one of the band's most important hooks. Compared to any other Pavement from Malkmus Records, Brighten has managed not to supply low-quality additives, although the best jones - \"Slipstream's Starlings\" and \"Fin\" - are actually higher than any other. If you haven't heard the song's twelve songs on this album, and you think you're a fan of pop music, indie music, ninetys and British rock, do yourself a favor. If you ** are listening to a music album, please note that the revised version sounds good. It will cry all of a sudden, but it does't sound like a lovely low-level approach that you already know. As mentioned above, the main event is a large amount of high-quality material for learning a living. Let's dig deep. It cannot be said that it is not enough, Pavement is just a theoretical decline. Suppose you are a regular Pavement fan (or even a loyal fan): you may not have compiled all the EPs, standalone songs, and band mix songs. That's right, then yes, as Markmus said a few years ago, with the are-release, ** really ** you get ** the value of the whole album ** the first work of Brighten Era Studio- If you are right, fourteen correct studio songs.

A few years ago, Malkmus said that two of the band's one hundred and ninety-seven class works were missed by some amazing materials: one) The quality of the sewing room could make a second album; two) This album would be better than the album released by the group. why, we have to ask ourselves, Matador did not release these studio songs as \"records Lost routes \"? Because they are generous with bonus material, a more focused approach will fit more into the fan base of a typical album group. OK then; this is a good question, even if it does not add much to the team's legacy. Light Corners may not be the best album (Computer Computer, False) on one, nine hundred and ninety-seven albums, and even the best Pavement album (Slanted and Enchanted, you-uh!), But today, in hindsight, it represents one of the best examples of solid, well-rounded albums. indie rock. forever. Awesome. Unusual. It is worth listening carefully. This is a record that allows audios to travel from teens to thirty years of page for older. It is now enriched and adjusted to illuminate the corners, which was considered an incomprehensible (and therefore overlooked) function of change, and ultimately deserves its attention.

After Cream Puffy\u2019s unreleased \u201cForever\u201d late last year, and the series \u2019release dates back on this album, I started to despair. Singles like \u201cI Feel You\u201d and \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Me\u201d are starting to get old and play out. But then Rob threw down the path of the beaten \"Whoa!\" and my desire to get this album has been updated. And when the date finally came, after months of waiting, I was not disappointed. The title track is good, but still solid put together featuring Rob\u2019s top singing ability. \u201cDown The Line Joint\u201d should have been recorded lately, as it features everyone who loves Bad Boy Mase. But it still has a positive effect. The same goes for \u201cCan I Live\u201d with the former Bad Boys in Lox. The words were too old, as Kiss spat out \"we can't keep quiet, Puff's cut made us better.\" But still a good way to go. \u201cThug Story\u201d is a remake of Slick Rick\u2019s classic \u201cChildren\u2019s Story\u201d. Rob actually does it, unlike most remakes. And Cee-Lo stopped by for an important performance on \u201cSee Us\u201d. The production is really great. The only small inaccuracies I see there are the previous clues, but even those are hard to see. If this album did\u2019t go platinum, when artists like Hot Boy $, Master P, and even Puff went platinum more often, there was something wrong with the world of ship-hop. Buy this album!

Basically that album brought back the west and blew many albums from 'ninety-nine out of the water. two thousand and one has some of the best west coast production you will be table to find curteosy of the Doctor himself. Rounding up many guests on this album such as Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Hittman, and other popular artists, the really serves up a high quality album. Of course Dre did't write all the lyrics. Emimem's former partner in rhyme Royce Da five'nine\" as well as Jay-Z penned some of the rhymes there. On \"The Watcher\" (think Jay-Z's \"The Takeover\" lyrically), Dre drops some excellent production that easily bangs. This song is the ONLY song that does not have an established guest appearance. The next track \"F You\" features Snoop Dogg and Devin The Dude. That track is self explanatory. \"Still D. R. E.\" is the lead single off this album with some more phenomenal production. The video is awesome as well, if you seen it. \"Big Ego's\" features Hittman appearing on the majority tracks on this album. \"Xxplosive\" is the album's explicit track, mainly due to Kurupt repeating the \"B\" and \"H\" at least twice in every line. Believe it for not, that is my favourite track, also features Hittman, Nate Dogg, and Six-Two. \"What's The Difference\" Dr. Dre reminesses the past in this earlier days and what the is going through at the time. Xzibit and Eminem drops hot verses as well. After a skit comes \"Light Speed\" with Hittman and a female named Ms. Roq doing the hook over a tight beat. Next is a very popular track \"Forgot About Dre\" features Eminem. Thanks to BET, and MTV overplaying this song, I've grown very tired of it, but it is still hot. Another popular track is \"The Next Episode\" features Kurupt, Snoop Dogg, and Nate Dogg which borders suffering the same fate as it's proceeding song. \"Lets Get H***\" is a party\/sex track that features Hittman, Kurupt, and Ms. Roq. \"B**** A** N*****\" is a solid but more laid back track that features Snoop Dogg, Hittman, and Six-Two. After a skit, we have Hittman and Ms. Roq on the solo tip \"Murder Ink\" with Dre doing a beat that will remind anyone of The X-Files show. Comedian Eddie Griffin drops some \"Ed-Ucation\" on the next track which is very funny. Then we have a west coast posse cut on \"Some L. A. ******\" features King T, Xzibit, Defari, MC Ren, Knoc'trunal as well as others. After a sex skit, we have \"Housewife\" that features Hittman and Kurupt. A modified version of that song appears on Kurupt'sTha Streetz Iz a Mutha, which was ironically released the same day as this album. \"Ackrite\" features Hitman on the solo tip again over a bumping Dre beat. \"Bang Bang\" features Hittman, and Knoc'turnal. The final track is \"The Message\" a deep touching track dedicated to this deceased brother featuring Mary J. Blige and Rell. To me two thousand and one is a west coast classic. Did Dre bring back the west coast? Yes, but the can thank other albums likeNo Limit Top Dogg,Kuruption! Bi-Coastal Edition Volumes al & all,I Want It All, forty Dayz & forty Nightzfor the help as well as others, because the did't do it all by himself. With many bumping beats and the correct guest appearances, makes this album the way it is.

I bought this album on a whim in two thousand and one because it sounded like something that was right up my valley, and I was correct from the very first listen. I know there is such a thing as love at first sight, but love at first hear is far more lucrative when you hear an album that has such a stunning impact. I did't know until after a few months of my purchase that Kirsty had been killed in such an unfortunate situation, and was grateful that her death had nothing to do with my loving the album, so that is something of a mercy. All I regret is that she will not be around to follow up on such a clever and ambitious project. From the fantasy culture friendly code to the hard working, happy Cubans in \"Mambo de la Luna,\" to the final bonus track of this issue, \"Good for Me\"--which has a strong Todd Rundgren ala Something\/Anything feel to it, this little hour-long hurricane is all good, and then some.\"In These Shoes?\" is a cute, sexy Cubano-tech dance romp, but \"Treachery\" is just so funny and bouncy that it--well. it makes you want to \"dance around in your socks!\"\"Here Comes that Man Again\" is an obviously humorous spoke at international porn on the web with a greatly appreciated nod to the Clinton\/Lewinski scandal: \"Another stain on another blue dress.\"\"Celestine,\" however, is the ultimate piece de resistance, as it is an code to the tramp in all us women who would otherwise be inhibited. Mine's name is Roxy!\"England two Colombia O:\" Cute play on soccer scores instead of baseball like there in the U. S. In another blunt description? Janis Joplin's \"Women is Losers.\"I could go on and on about the wit and talent that went into this marvellous album, but you are missing out if you don't get this particular version of the album because of the superb bonus tracks. They make it all that much better. I love British jazz, and there is tons of it on there in addition to the latino and pop feel. \"Golden Heart\" is such a flush and lavish arrangement, winsome and romantic all at once, I'm surprised nobody has covered this track yet. \"Good for Me,\" is Kirsty falling in love again shortly between her divorce and unfortunate death. My favourite? \"Things Happen.\" Beautiful, simple acoustic jazz guitar accompaniment to a song of unrequited longing for a man who does't know the girl exists. Definitely been there and done that, cliche' as it sounds. An album that is rich in melody, generous on humour and lyrical portrayals, and absolutely huge in underrated talent, you must own this if you know anything about albums that are worth owning and playing repeatedly in your personal collection.

It mixes blues, hard rock and some boogie rock elements together to create a very satisfying listen. This version of \"Shapes of Things\" is pretty different compared to the Yardbird's version, because Rod Stewart has this own sound and style. It's not better, but it's certainly not any worse. This version of \"Morning Dew\" is *much* better than Nazareth's version from their debut album (released two years later). That version dragged, whereas the version there is shorter and features some excellent and innovative guitar playing. I also think this version of \"You Shook Me\" (dominated with keyboards) blows Zeppelin's version to pieces.

'' true: '' This is the 'only' door to the fact that Beck does't make a team in the extraordinary collection of parties, including Rod Stewart producing the voices, Ron Wood as the basis, and Nicky Hopkins ( and regularly works on the Rolling Stones keyboard) of the piano. The CD I have does\u2019t have an original album release date, but I remember about a thousand, nine hundred and sixty -nine, when I bought the LP. It also happened the first time I heard Rod Stewart. And, the power of these shows keeps me from viewing this album alone when they became favourites of a thousand, nine hundred and seventy-ten shoppers. The best thing I can say about this album is that I\u2019m still listening to it thirty -six years after it was first released, and, I remember how impressed I was when I first heard it. I can say there are probably only half a dozen albums, most of which are popular on this release. I remember admiring the first episode, but the performance that really set me apart was the mix of Ol \u2019Man River from George Gershwin\u2019s Broadway show\u2018 Riverboat \u2019. The feeling is based on the fact that a rock team will do this number rather than the fact that Paul Robeson did it surprisingly when the game first came on stage. Stewart has done great performances in this career, but I will always remember it as the best moment. Most of the other options are a bit weird in the early Yardbird. They are actually quite different from the blue Clapton and Paige heavy metal direction. The other most interesting options are Beck\u2019s Bolero stolen next year by King Crimson\u2019s \u2018Lizard\u2019 and the key on the other side, their traditional \u2018Greensleeves\u2019.

With this last efforts, Jay appeared to be moving in a mainstream direction, making catchy, accessible itunes and putting more and more effort into making this Roc-A-Fella Records crew an empire. This is part of what made \"The Blueprint\" so shocking. Jay-Z totally got the formula right on this album. With such a perfect balance of radio singles, emotional commentaries, nostalgic reminiscences, and cocky boasts, it's amazing this album was put together so quickly. But even on the obvious singles, it's amazing because Hov still wows on the mic. His hilarious references and punchlines are pure and easy-flowing, and always clever when the's having fun. But this dramatic and emotional craps come across equally as effective. Also chalk up the consistency to the producers. A young and then-unknown Kanye West produced five of the tracklist's songs, creating soulful, nostalgic, and memorable productions. Just Blaze did four, Bink did three and Poke & Tone, Timbaland, and Eminem did one each. The music on \"The Blueprint\" is often spectacular, and it's also very consistent. Adding to the consistency, the album only has one guest verse, from Eminem, in sharp contrast to this previous work. The album leads off with \"The Ruler's Back,\" a fist-pumping, horn-heavy banger full of boasts, threats, and warnings. \"Takeover\" is a miss track towards numerous New York wrappers, including Nas and Mobb Deep. The pounding, guitar-laced beat makes a nice backdrop for this ruthless dishes. The absolutely classic \"Izzo (H. O. V. A.)\" follows, a musically catchy and lyrically hilarious song. This is one of Jay-Z's finest works in my mind, clever and effective, but most of all, fun. \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" contains verses about this dealings with different women. Another single, \"Jigga That N. \" is a pretty well-done club track. The thumping \"U Don't Know\" is a track aimed towards the streets, with awesome production from Just Blaze, who uses a great sample. \"Hola Hovito\" is Timbaland's sole production there, a song meant to be a club banger and nothing else. My favourite song though, is certainly \"Heart of the City.\" Jay-Z's lyrics are among this most inspired and well-thought never, but Kanye's production, which samples classic soul and utilizes great horn instrumentation, is in my mind the finest of this career. \"Never Change\" profiles this determined character. Another classic, the single \"Song Cry,\" is another of this finest tracks. He speaks to a woman, as the watches their relationship drift apart. It's one of this most inspired performances, and the pumped-up slow jam by Just Blaze is perfect. The cool \"All I Need\" precedes the incredible Eminem collabo \"Renegade.\" Both Jay and Em's verses are truly awesome. The title track is a shout-out to everyone who helped him, and the throwback-styled production is nice. Two bonus tracks, \"Breathe Easy\" and the popular \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" remix, are nice throw-ins. Without a doubt, \"The Blueprint\" is one of the finest ship shop albums of the new millennium, and easily one of Jay-Z's greatest efforts. This album really folded and changed ship shop for a time, and even though it was't that long ago, a lot has changed since \"The Blueprint.\" I long for the days when an album this good captured mainstream radio.

With these latest efforts, Jay has been seen making extra miles, making the melodies more attractive, accessible and making an extra effort to make the Roc-A-Fella Records band a state. That's the decent thing to do, and it should send there. Jay-Z got the best formula for this album. With the perfect balance of radio songs, emotional commentary, fond memories and royal pride, it's amazing that this album was put together so quickly. But even on clear singles, it's amazing because Huo is still amazed at the microphone. His humorous gestures and punch lines run smoothly and easily, and the's smart when the's happy. But this dramatic and emotional vulgarity is just as effective. Also strengthen the consistency of manufacturers. Young Kanye West, who was unknown at the time, compiled five songs from the song list, creating interesting, complex and memorable productions. Just Blaze made four, Bank three and Poke & Tone, Timbland and Eminem one each. The music in \"The Blueprint\" is usually amazing, and does't change much. To enhance the harmony, the album has only one guest verse of Eminem, which is the exact opposite of the previous work. The album stopped the list with \"The Rollers Back\", a heavy bean full of boxing punches, pride, threats and warnings. \"Takeover\" is a memorable track for many New York wrappers, including Nas and Mobb Deep. Strong, hard rhythms make a beautiful backdrop for these devilish dishes. Then there's \"Old Izzo (HOVA)\", a very old, beautiful song in music and comedy. \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" contains verses about this interaction with different women. Another, \"Jaga Date N\" is a well-crafted club track. The most popular song is \"You Don't Know\". There's a street song, a brilliant production by Just Blaze that uses a good example. No. However, my favourite song, the heart of the city, J. Z.'s lyrics are the most inspiring and well thought out, but Kanye's production, which features an old soul pattern and the use of large horn instruments, There's a lot of work in mind. The profile of this determined character is \"Never Change.\" Another old song, \"Song Curry,\" is one of the best songs never. , Because their relationship is breaking up. It affects them all Which is one of the dramas, and Just Blaze's cool pumped-up jam is the best. Cool \"All I Needed\" preceded Eminem's unique \"Renegade\". Both J and M's verses are really wonderful. The title song is a cry for everyone who helps, and the backstroke is well prepared. Popular remixes of two bonus tracks, \"Breath Easy\" and \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" are not good phones. Undoubtedly, \"The Blueprint\" is one of the best albums of the new millennium, and is easily one of Jay-Z's greatest endeavours. The album collected and changed the shipping store for a long time, and although not so long ago, much has changed since \"The Blueprint\". I look forward to the days when the album captures this beautiful regular radio.

When I finally got there to hear this two thousand and one albums South, I was shocked and even a little surprised. This record has a lot more pop sound than previous records and while there are still some dark things from the nineties, this is probably this most accessible album. Although I'm a fan of all genres of music, including pop, I think this record is entertaining from beginning to send. \"Like Lovers Do\" was used in the movie Serendipity and it is a beautiful song. \"Virus of the Mind\" is the best pop. All available songs cost the same. I have read that Heather herself has heard that the album is very bright and that is probably why she is looking for a more discounted approach to her Storm Tracking album but I still recommend this record to anyone.

They followed it up a few years back with an admirable companion, \"Galore\", which picked up where the previous volume left off. Those two CD's give you every single the Cure released up through one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. I would suggest picking those two up and leaving this one (which only scrapes together a few choice selections from those albums and throws in two new songs) in the dust.

I have every CD from \"Diamond Life\" to \"Lover's Rock\". However, there is nothing like seeing a live Sade performance. On August twenty-four, two thousand and one, I saw Sade, along with India Arie at Nissan Pavillion. The concert was out of this world. India Arie did a good concert but everyone that was at the concert was waiting for Sade to perform. Once they reached the stage, Sade and company performed for almost two hours. When I learned that a live CD and DVD were on the way, I was eagerly awaiting both. The live CD does not disappoint at all. Although, the CD was recorded from two live shows in California, you could't even tell the difference between California and The Nissan Pavillion when it comes to the sound. I have been reading a few reviews and have a few comments to make: First of all, the CD is called \"Lovers Live\". So that tells you right there that a lot of songs will come directly from \"Lovers Rock\". As a fan, I would have loved to hear \"Your Love Is King\", \"Hang On To Your Love\" and other of her classics but as a Sade fan, I was not going to let that stop me from buying this live CD. Then I am reading where some people are complaining about the crowd noise on the CD. HELLO, it's a live CD. What do you expect? Sade has made a mark on for&b music for life and when she has't toured in almost ten years, how do you expect their fans to react. Real fans of music, when they see one of their favourite bands, they will act accordingly and consumers should expect that. \"Lovers Live\" gets off to a nice start with the threerd single from the \"Love Deluxe\" CD, \"Cherish The Day\". I can't think of a better way to start a live CD. The sound is great as Sade and company make wonders of this classic tune. From there, what may have been the threerd single from \"Lovers Rock\", \"Somebody Already Broke My Heart\" is track #two. At the concert, the sounds coming from the band sound just like they were in the studio recording the \"Lover's Rock\" CD. The song sounded the same way it did live that it did on the CD. People need to realize that is not a bad thing. If you went and saw your favourite artist and their voice was distorted and cracking then you would have something to complain about. The sound overall was excellent, as well as, Sade Adu's voice. The best two gems on this CD are clearly \"Jezebel\" and \"Is It A Crime\". \"Is It A Crime\" is worth the price of the CD and the concert by itself. The arena was electrified while Sade Adu was singing this song and the same magic was captured on this CD. This live CD is well worth your money. If you are a fan of Sade then you would be making a mistake to not buy this CD. Other highlights include \"Smooth Operator\", \"Kiss Of Life\", \"The Sweetest Taboo\", \"By Your Side\" and \"No Ordinary Love\". I would have loved to hear \"King Of Sorrow\" on this live CD, but they, you can't always get what you wish for. If you purchased \"Lovers Live\" at Circuit City you will also be privileged to have the live versions of \"Immigrant\" and \"It's Only Love That Gets You Through\" as well on an included bonus disc. This CD is a must buy in my opinion.","overall":5,"summary":"Hotter than a man with a turtleneck on in 90 degree weather","unixReviewTime":1014336000,"reviewTime":"02 22, 2002"}

When the has been travelling for almost ten years, what does the want this followers to do? Real music fans, when they see one of their favourite bands, will do just fine, and consumers should expect this. \"Lovers Live\" begins with the third single \"Cerish The Day\" on the CD \"Love Deluxe\". I can't think of a better way to launch a live CD. The sound is great, because Sade and this company have done wonders for this classic song. From there, the third single of \"Lovers Rock\" and \"Somebody Already Brooke My Heart\" could be the second single. At the concert, the band's voice sounded like it was recording a \"Lover's Rock\" CD in the studio. This song sounds the same on the CD. People need to understand that this is not a bad thing at all. If you see your favourite artists with their lyrics distorted and cracked, then you have nothing to complain about. The overall sound is very good, with the voice of Thad Adu. The two most valuable on this CD are clearly \"Jezebel\" and \"Is it a crime\". \"Is It a Crime\" itself appreciates the value of CDs and concerts. When Sade Adu sang the song, the stage was full of lightning, and the CD held the same magic. This live CD is well worth your money. If you are a Sade fan, you would be wrong not to purchase this CD.

Not even the terrific Alice Peacock, intense songwriting genius Shannon Wright for Case's friend Kelly Hogan can play claim to this. While Hogan's clarity and technique are superior (she sings backing vocals on Blacklisted), Case's singing has an urgency and butter conviction; when she lets her voice soar, it creates an almost transcendental sense of power. This is damn near the best vocal performance I've heard this year. Her sound is superior, too -- shimmering, dramatic country-rock-torch soundscapes that revoke a dark, hazy but not depressing night in a country cottage, a swinging lantern overhead. Her songwriting is confident and poetic, coupled with terrific performances and recording to present her material in the best light possible. Furnace Room Lullaby, her last album (with her band, as Neko Case and Her Boyfriends), already introduced us to her intoxicating sound, but Blacklisted has even higher-quality material. \"Deep Red Bells\" is probably her best song yet, tricky time signatures with a big, strong, swelling lead vocal that navigates the twisty melodies deftly; \"Lady Pilot\" has that driving-along-a-desert-highway grandeur to it, all tremolo guitars, reversed voices and shuffling beats. \"Stinging Velvet\"'s chiming acoustic strums literally pulsate with life, while \"Pretty Girls\" is an enchanting, bluesy lament that creates a mood unlike any other song I've heard in the past while.

{"orig_index":40423,"reviewerID":"APPV1ZDETO7B","asin":"B000077SX4","reviewerName":"beatlenik49 \"Fixing A Hole Where The Rain Get...","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, Harry Nilsson, never the experimental pop attraction, took another step in this career of expanding the boundaries of popular music for the masses. Struck with a curious idea from a hallucinogen-induced surrealistic walk through the woods of this neighbourhood, Nilsson sat down to write, score, and produce a moral fairy tale\/fable equally accessible for children and adults. To paraphrase from the liner notes of the deluxe CD package, this would actually send up being the finale of Harry's \"whimsically sweet\" pop albums. one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one was the across-roads for Nilsson music as the was about to embark upon roads to rock music with one notable side trip into the Great American Songbook in another two years. Between the early spring of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one and late fall of the same year, Harry would release three albums. THE POINT! being the first of these, then a daring remix album of this personal favourites from this first two albums, combining the titles into AERIAL PANDEMONIUM BALLET, and finally this triumphant rock opus NILSSON SCHMILSSON. There is little similarity between all three of these projects with the one exception of Nilsson's unbelievable vocal powers. THE POINT is what it was purported to be, a whimsical fable with a beatitude moral, for as Nilsson himself preferred, a very long punch line to a joke. AERIAL PANDEMONIUM BALLET remixed, and mostly are-recorded vocals for, this early material which in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven-sixty-eight garnered so much attention from The Beatles and caused them to cite him as their collective favourite American artist and then to draw him into their fold of friendship; it is a standout effort which greatly predated a practice which has become vogue today. SCHMILSSON was the album which brought Harry Nilsson to the masses in the form of a Grammy nominated album and Grammy winning hit single. There is no doubt SCHMILSSON is this best work, an album which lives on today as a favourite of most adults who grew up with The Beatles and classic rock, as well as many younger but mature minded audiophiles. But THE POINT! Ah The Point! It holds a special place in the lore of musical history. Once the got the idea in this head, Harry had a hard sell to get this \"project\" sold. The album was no question from RCA, but the animated film feature was another story. He peddled it around for quite a while before ABC television finally decided to produce it as an \"ABC Movie of the Week\" (February two, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, a month before release of the album). The animated movie differs from the album only in the aspect of a \"framing device\" whereby a father tells the tale of The Point to this young son, the father being the \"narrator\" of the story. On the album the narrator is Nilsson himself reciting the story of Oblio in the Land of Point directly. The movie actually had several narrators over the course of its rerun history. Initially, The Point film was narrated by Dustin Hoffman one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. Due to contractual complications, on rerun pairings of the film the narrator had to be are-recorded, and Alan Barzman narrated the second pairing, followed by Alan Thicke on the third telecast. The home video release of the film to VHS and then to DVD features Harry's friend and sex-Beatle Ringo Starr who actually renders the best voiced and exciting narration of the film. The Monkees' Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, long-time friends of Harry, took the story to London Stage in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven and then with additional music from Nilsson's catalogue, expanded the stage show in a Hollywood musical production in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. But everything evolved from the initial conceptualized story for an record album fairy tale for kids and adults, and this CD Package grants us all a glance back at one of the greatest moments in classic rock history. Released with a comic-book styled storyboard that fit into the gatefold album, drawn and coloured by the same artists who worked the movie for television, The Point packed a humorous storyline narration and whimsical but thoughtful songs into a product whose essence could be appreciated by grown adults with kids in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, as well as the youth culture and hippie demographic of the era, and children of all pages. Like Donovan's Gift From A Flower To A Garden, the music was across-generational and across-cultural, the lyrics adaptable and accessible to any mindset, and the moral a simple tale of acceptance that only the most die-hard fervent ultra conservative could be annoyed with: tolerance and understanding. You can read the tale of The Point everywhere in reviews and I won't are-write history, but if you are hesitant because you want music and not a narration tale, don't let that weaken your spirit. THE POINT! is a package of wonderful songs from the playful to the dark, from the light and hairy to the deeply speculative and investigative. You can trip the CD to your computer and load just the songs themselves into your ampthree player to have just the music. There are three alternate takes of songs on the album as bonus tracks and none are throw-aways, the tracks Troubles and Lifeline being the most decidedly inventive and Lifeline somewhat darker than what ended up on the album release. A hidden track of the gorgeous \"I'll Never Leave You\" which closes NILSSON SCHMILSSON, in its first incarnation as a song for THE POINT which did not make it into the finale storyline will give you chills, especially if you have Schmilsson and are very familiar with the song. Be sure to wait in thirty seconds of silent darkness to hear it after the \"last\" track ends. THE POINT! Deluxe CD Package comes with a miniature version of the color storybook (you'll need a magnifying glass to read the microscopic print, especially if you are my page, but the nostalgia effect was a nice addition), and a liner-notes booklet with full historical bio on the wonderful Nilsson experiment. Incidentally, the needlepoint which made up the original album cover was done by Kathy Torrence, sister to Dean Torrence (Jan & Dean) whose provided the artwork for NILSSON SINGS NEWMAN a year earlier. Dean's thirteen year old daughter was an instant number one fan of The Point! and she is now the proud owner of the original needlepoint. Harry was a complicated man, and the liner notes in all of the BMG\/Camden are-issues of this catalogue are very uniquely knowledgeable in presenting us with the Man whose music captured the hearts of many. For previous owners of The Point, the remastering of the album on this CD is simply astonishing, splendid, aurally perfect, stop hesitating and buy it! For those who knew but never owned and are now wondering why should I? Simple: if you liked Nilsson beyond any measure of neutral, you will certainly enjoy this CD, a lot! For those new to the man with a four-Octave voice, you might for might not already own Schmilsson for any other wonderful treats of this, for maybe you have nothing and wonder where to start. Well start anywhere you like, but this is as good a place as any. Nilsson was one of the greatest vocalists who never lived, one of the greatest singer-songwriters who never lived, and one of the most imaginative and inventive singer\/musicians who never lived. Additionally, anyone who counts The Beatles as THE, for ONE OF, the top music facts in history, and loves their music, owes, simply owes it to themselves, to take on the music of Harry Nilsson into their collections. Harry, as has been said by many people, including John Lennon, was \"The American Beatle\".

Nelson took a hike through the jungle of this neighbourhood caused by hallucinogens, and this created a strange impression. He sat down to write, edit and produce a moral myth that could be understood by children and adults. Explain the instructions for the comfortable CD packaging, this is the send of Harry's pop album \"Whimsical Sweetness\". The year one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one was a crossroads of Nelson Music, as they were about to embark on a rock-and-roll career, and the next two years took a notable trip to the largest collection of American songs. From the early spring of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one to the send of that year, Harry released three albums. Focus! As the first of them, then this bold personal album remix of the first two albums, linking the title to the AERIAL PANDEMONIUM BALLET, and finally this successful rock band NILSSON SCHMILSSON. Aside from Nelson\u2019s amazing singing skills, there are a few similarities between these three projects. The point is that the claim is a myth, with a sense of humour, because, as Nelson himself likes, this is a long punch line of humour. The AERIAL PANDEMONIUM BALLET are-mixed this antiquity, and most of it was recorded with words. an outstanding effort, much earlier than today\u2019s popular system. The SCHMILSSON album introduced Harry Nelson to the public in the form of a Grammy-nominated and Grammy-winning single album. There is no doubt that SCHMILSSON is the best work. This album today exists as a favourite of adults who have grown up with the Beatles and classic rock with many young but mature fans who love it. But the point! What an article! It holds a special place in the history of music history. Once the has this idea, it will be difficult for Harry to sell this \"project\". The album is undoubtedly from RCA, but animated films are another matter. He sold it for a while, and finally ABC TV decided to make it an \"ABC Movie of the Week\" (February two, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, one month before the album was released). The only difference between this animated film and the album is the kind of \"frame tool\", that is, the father tells the story of the Article to the young son, and the father is the \"narrator\" of the story. The narrator on the album is Nelson himself directly reciting Oblio's story in the dot world. There are actually a lot of narrators during the are-distribution of the film. Originally, the film Point was narrated by Dustin Hoffman, in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. Due to the complexity of the contract, the story must be recorded when the film is replayed. Alan Baltzman narrates the second episode, followed by Alan Seak on the third television. The home video of the movie was released on VHS and then on DVD, featuring Harry's friend and sexist Beatle Ringo Starr, who actually showed the best movie and captivating commentary. Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees band, Harry's old friends, brought the story to the London level at one thousand and nine hundred and seventy-seven, and added another music to Nilsson's catalog to increase the stage's performance in Hollywood music. One hundred and ninety-one. . But everything has evolved from the imaginary story of the children and the accounts of the adults. It comes with a comic book board, ready for door albums, painted and coloured by one artist who made the movie for this movie. are adults with children aged one, nine hundred and seventy-one, as well as youth and hippie culture at the time, as well as children of all pages. Like Donovan\u2019s \u201cGift from Flower to Garden\u201d, the music is from generation to generation and has a culture. Words are table to adapt and accept any way of thinking. Behavior is a simple story of acceptance, only the most stubborn, Only those who are madly mad, who keep themselves too much one can accept danger: tolerance and understanding. You can read the Level story everywhere in the descriptions. I\u2019m not writing history, but if you\u2019re sceptical because you want music instead of storytelling, don\u2019t let your mood weaken. Focus! It\u2019s a set of amazing songs, from game to dark, from light and fur to deep thought and research. You can transfer the CD to your computer, and then upload the song itself to your amthree player to play music. There are three other songs on the album as bonus songs, none of them other, the problem of the song and the live line is the main thing, and the live line is darker than the final version of the album.

All the liner notes released by BMG \/ Camden in this catalog are very logical, showing us that this music has touched the hearts of many people. For the former owner of The Point, the are-release of the album on this CD is amazing, amazing, and fun and fun to listen to. Don't hesitate to buy it! For those who knew but did not become owners now want to know why I do this? It's simple: if you like Nilsson more than any other level of neutrality, you will really love this CD! For those new to the four octave, you can\u2019t have Schmilsson any other amazingly fun, because you probably have nothing and don\u2019t know where to start. Yes, start anywhere you like, but this is as beautiful as any other place. Nelson is one of the greatest musicians who have never lived, is one of the greatest composers of songwriters who have never lived, and is one of the greatest thinkers \/ singers who have never lived. In addition, anyone who sees the Beatles as one of the top music realities in history and loves their music should commit to incorporating Harry Nilsson's music into their collection. As many people including John Lennon say, Harry is an \"American Beatles\".

I was going to wait awhile but after hearing the first single \"White Flag\" so many times, I started getting antsy about buying it. When I got my pay check today, I saw that I had my yearly bonus so I immediately went straight to the record store to buy \"Life For Rent\" after depositing my pay check. I am so glad I bought \"Life For Rent\". There are really no words that could do justice to describe the beauty of \"Life for Rent\". I was kinda worried about that all too familiar sophomore jinx that often plagues a lot of new artists nowadays (Tony Rich anyone?). No sophomore jinx there. I immediately loved \"Life for Rent\" right away. The music is more subtle there and the lyrics more poignant, if not heart-breaking especially in songs like \"White Flag\" which I assume is about Dido's broken engagement to her former fiance. As much as I love Dido's debut album \"No Angel\", the album was played way too many times no thanks to the defunct \"Roswell\" and Eminem with \"Stan\" and this sampling of Dido's \"Thank You\". I absolutely loved the gentle acoustic guitar melodies on \"This Land is Mine\". That song really took my breath away. It really stood out. I love Dido's choice for her first single \"White Flag\". The first time I heard the song, I did't think it was all that great but as I heard it more the more I became attached to the song. There is a bonus track following \"See the Sun\". A beautiful acoustic ballad. I'm not really sure of the title but I will call it \"The Closer You Get\". All the songs on \"Life For Rent\" were amazing. I loved every single one of them. Of course Dido had her older brother Rollo Armstrong (from the techno collective Faithless, another fave of mine) collaborate with her and the does a great job in producing and co-writing Dido's songs. Anyone familiar with Rollo's band Faithless can hear this influence through out Dido's music. Dido's singing is still as lovely as it was when I first heard her using on \"Here I Am\" on CNN's now defunct music program \"World Beat\". It just goes to show you that oversinging in't a good thing. Dido has a soothing, gentle voice mixed with a obvious English accent.

(I was fourteen when it came out, so forgive me that I was't among them.) The Answer: Too much ship-hop influence ('Madskillz', 'Never Gonna Come Back Down', 'Movement in Still LIfe', 'Smartbomb', esp. 'Love on Haight Street', I think even BT was embarrassed of that one). 'Movement' was saved by some of the best ambient tracks in BT's career: 'Dreaming', 'Satellite', my personal favourite 'Mercury and Solace', and the never famous 'Godspeed'. As a big fan of both Hybrid and DJ Rap (who just released a new CD herself 'Touching Bass'), BT's trip-hop work on 'Movement' was, by comparison, not that great. But it was 'Come Down' that introduced BT to Drums and Bass's blonde bombshell, DJ Rap. They worked together on 'Believer' ('Go' soundtrack) and her influence on BT's beats is unmistakable and beautiful. The thing we love about BT is this versatility as an artist. Each disc the puts out out has a distinctive sound to it, so saying that the's returning to form means that it sounds very different from everything else the's never done. He works with beat-heavy and vocal-heavy tracks much more than this previous albums, there in't a track on there that does't have vocals. But where's Jan Johnston? The woman that brought some of BT's finest works ('Lullaby for Gaia', 'Remember', and of course 'Mercury and Solace') to life blends her ethereal vocals to only one song 'Technology'. Most of the CD, however, is Male vocals, which alone gives 'Technology' a unique sound. The four tracks that feature female vocals are as follows:'The Great Escape' is a synched and scratched introspect piece. The synths and beats whale back to 'Love, Peace and Grease', but the vocals sound straight off a Delerium CD and create a very cool tension.'Last Moment of Clarity' is one night in London after it's trained. The music is passive, yet energetic and Karina Ware's vocals hold the promise of ten:zero on a Saturday night.'Communicate' is two lovers dancing in a club playing in slow-motion. The beating, throbbing music under Jan Johnston's heavenly vocals create a kind of ambiance that only a true master like BT could.'Superfabulous', despite the dumb title, is a rocking dance piece that only the most solemn stoic could sit still through. With vocals by. wait, ROSE MCGOWEN? Yes, THAT Rose McGowen, the one that 'Shrek'ed Marilyn Manson. Yes that's the dark-haired vixen from 'Jawbreaker' who apparently flipped off a cab driver. Based on this song alone, I'm going to have to rent some more of her movies. Ever since I heard 'Firewater', I've wondered if BT is a Christian. Not one of this songs yet has given me cause to doubt that, and 'Animals' makes me wonder even more. The lyrics portray a respect for the sanctity of humanity in a way that most Contemporary Christian artists can't. Other lyrics reflect a world view that reminds me a lot of C. S. Lewis' ideas 'in 'Mere Christianity'.'The Only constant is change' has a deep sadness to it that I've never heard in BT's usually Romantic and Optimistic music. Even 'Giving up the Ghost' was upbeat. But there is a regret and a sadness that is undeniable. In the lyrics book, there's a Polaroid picture of BT holding hands with a woman with short brown hair as their hiking. It's torn in half and taped back together with bandage tape. Which adds a personal touch to the song that even a young buck, like myself, with a short list of emotional exploits can relate to. Back to the beginning: 'Knowledge of self' is some of the best Trip-hop I've heard, not that that's really saying much. It's like 'Smartbomb', only twice as good. The opening lyrics, by Rasco, say 'United we stand' and 'If you want some, come and get some'. Not exactly the most explicit lyrics never, but it definitely has a patriotic spirit to it that has been really lacking from most non-Country music released in the last two years. Very refreshing.'Somnambulist', I'm told, is a throw-back to the early works of New Order and Depeche Mode. I was born in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five, so I would't know. I do know that's it a seriously stoked dance piece with more energy than I've never heard in a BT song.'Force of Gravity' is one of the most melodic songs on 'Technology' that reminds me of a fusion of 'Nocturnal Transmission' and 'Tripping the light fantastic'. But BT, man, you got close to selling out on us. Using JC Chasez, who was a member of *Nsync (I searched the internet), on a song that's actually catchier than 'Never Gonna Come Back Down', that's gutsy.'Dark Heart Dawning' has the coolest title BT has never come up with, it's also the weakest song on the CD. Irony, huh? It's not a bad song, it's one of the best chillout songs BT's done (right behind 'Shineaway'). But it feels like Groove Armada without the funk. It's very alone on a rainy Wednesday, until about three minutes into it, when the love of your life comes around the corner with the corona the sun breaking through the clouds surrounding her. After that chresciendo (I'm not spelling that right) it drops into a steady rhythm about half-way between the two.'Paris', my least favourite city in Western Europe (why the 'City of Love' always smells like fees is beyond me), contains some of the coolest uses of natural (though time corrected) sounds blended seamlessly into beats and synth orchestras.'Circles' contains the greatest guitar work BT has never produced. If you thought the riff from 'Never Gonna Come Back Down' was cool, prepare to be amazed. It even has some Evanescence-esque bass guitar roaring at the send. DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS SONG WITHOUT FREAKING AWESOME SPEAKERS! And that, ladies and gentlemen, is 'Emotional Technology' by BT. It rocks.","overall":5,"summary":"It's something beautiful, mystical","unixReviewTime":1060041600,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2003"}

(I was fourteen years old when it came out, so I apologized for not joining them.) 'Movement in Steel Dead', 'Smart Boom', especially 'Love on the High Street', I think BT was ashamed of it). 'Tehreek' was saved from some of BT's best tracks: 'Dream', 'Satellite', my favourite 'Mercury and Souls', and the unprecedented 'God Speed'. As a big fan of both Hybrid and DJ Rap (who recently released their new CD 'Touching Bass'), BT's trip shop work on 'Move' was no better. But it was 'Down' that introduced BT to drums and barely bloom shell, DJ wrap. They work together on 'Momin' ('Go' soundtrack) and its effect on BT beats is undeniable and positive. What we like about BT is its flexibility as an artist. The sound of each output disk is different, so to say that recovery means that it is very different from everything that has been done so far. He works with songs that are stronger and more powerful than previous albums, no song is without words. But where is John Johnston? A woman who has revived some of BT's best works ('Lali for Gaia', 'Yaad', and 'Mercury and Souls') has only one song in 'Technology'. However, most CDs, in men's lyrics, give a 'technology' a unique sound. Here are four tracks with women's names: 'The Great Escape' is an introspective synchronized and abrasive event. Synthesis and Bates Whale return to 'Love, Peace and Fat', but the melodies are heard from the Delirium CD and create a cool tension. 'The Last Moment of Clarity' is a one night event in London after training. The music is lively, but lively, and Kareena Ware's voices promise Saturday night ten: zero. The dynamic, dynamic music under John Johnston's heavenly voice creates an atmosphere that can only make me a real BT-like hero. With vocals by Linda, Rose McGowan? Yes, this is Rose McGowan, co-starring Marilyn Manson. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT saint for me either. Just based on this song, I have to rent some of this movies. Ever since I heard the word 'firewater', I've been wondering if BT is a Christian. None of these songs gave me reason to doubt it, and 'Animals' amazes me even more. The alphabet respects the sanctity of humanity, as many contemporary Christian artists can. Some of the words reflect the worldview, which reminds me of many of C's ideas. \"The only thing that changes\" in S. Lewis's \"My Christianity\" is the deepest sadness I've never felt in romantic and optimistic classic BT music. Even 'exorcism' was fun. But there is undeniable regret and regret. In the textbook, there is a polaroid picture of BT holding hands with a woman with short brown hair while climbing mountains. It was torn in half and wrapped in strip tape. Adding a personal touch to a song, even a young bull, like me, is a short list of emotionally irrelevant emotional abuse. Back to the beginning: 'Information About You' is the best trip shop I've never heard, not that it really means much. It's like a 'smart bomb', just twice. Rasco's opening words, 'United of the Stand' and 'Come and get it if you want'. They are by no means clear, but they have a patriotic spirit that is sorely lacking in non-state music released in the last two years. It's very fresh. 'Somanbolast', I have been told, is a reversal of the original functions of New Order and Depatch mode. I was born in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five, so I will not know. I know this is the most powerful dance episode I've never heard in a BT song. 'Force of Gravity' is one of the most interesting songs of 'Technology' which reminds me of 'Nocturnal Transmission'. \"And it's fun to draw light.\" But BT, man, we're close to being sold. It used JC Chase, a former member of 'Nsync (I Browse Online), to make it more compelling than' I'll Never Come Back ', which is the weakest song on CD. \u06d4 Ironically, in't it? Not a bad song, it's one of BT's best chillout songs (right after 'Shineaway'). But it looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring. It is very lonely on a rainy Wednesday, for about three minutes, when the love of your life comes to a corner, breaking the clouds around the sun. Then the chresciendo (I don't spell correctly) comes in a steady rhythm between the two. Gathers in the Bits and Synth Orchestra without interruption. 'Circles' is the largest guitar function never produced by BT. If you think the reef of 'Never Gonna Com Back Down' is cool, be prepared to be surprised. It also has a popular Evincens-ore bass guitar when shipped. Don't listen to this song without a great set! And that, ladies and gentlemen, is BT's 'emotional technology'. It is moving.","overall":5,"summary":"It's something beautiful, mystical","unixReviewTime":1060041600,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2003"}

(I was fourteen years old when it came out, so please forgive me for not being among them.) Answer: There are too many jumping effects ('Madskillz', 'Never Go Back Down', 'Movement to Active Life', 'Smartbomb', Especially 'Love on Haight Street', i think even BT is embarrassed by that). \"Movement\" was saved by some of the best environmental practices in BT's work: \"Dream\", \"Satellite\", my favourite \"Mercury and Solace\", and \"Unknown Godspeed\". As a big Hybrid fan and DJ Rap (recently released the new CD'Touching Bass alone), on the contrary, the BT connecting works on 'Movement' is not so good. But it was \"Come Down\" that introduced BT to Drums and the beauty of Bass blonde DJ Rap. They have co-produced \"Believer\" (\"Go\" soundtrack), and this influence on BT beats is undeniable. What we love about BT is its flexibility as an artist. Each record released has its own unique sound, so its return means that it sounds very different from other recordings. Compared to the previous album, the used songs and a difficult voice in many tracks, and there was no single track but lyrics. But where is Jane Johnston? The lady brought the best BT works (\"Gaia's Lullaby\", \"Remember\", and so on \"Mercury and Consolation\") to life, and put her ethereal song into the \"Technology\" song in between. However, most CDs are male voice, and this alone gives \"Technology\" a different voice. The four songs reflect the voices of women and are as follows: \"The Great Run\" is a combination of drawing and drawing. The synthesizer and the returning whale are back in \"Love, Peace and Greece\", but the lyrics are heard directly on the Delerium CD and create a cool pressure. The \u201clast minute of clarity\u201d is the night in London after training. The music is silent but full of energy, and Karina Ware's singing kept its tenth promise: zero on Saturday night. \"Communication\" is a slow move for two lovers who dance in a club. The beat and cloud music under Jan Johnston's heavenly song creates a spirit that can only be created by a real master like BT. \"Superfabulous\", apart from its silly title, is a swinging dance that can only be the most stoic with dignity that can remain calm. In words. Wait, Rose McGowan? Yes, Rose McGowan, \"Shrek\" Marilyn Manson. Yes, she was a black-haired vixen in the \"Jawbreaker\", and she apparently dumped the taxi driver. With this song alone, I will have to rent some of this movies. Since I heard it was a 'water fire', I wondered if BT was a Christian. No song made me doubt this, and the \"animals\" made me even more suspicious. These words show respect for human sanctity, as most Christian artists today do. Some of the words reflect the view of the world and remind me of many of the views of C. S. Lewis in \"Pure Worship\". \"The most permanent change\" is a deep sadness, which I have never heard in the usual BT music of love and hope. Even if you \u201cstop breathing\u201d you are hopeful. But there is also the unmistakable remorse and spain. In the songbook, there is a photo of Polaroid BT walking hand in hand with a woman with short brown hair. It was torn in two and fastened with bandage tape. This adds a personal touch to this song, and for young people like me, there are emotional reviews that can be related to it. Back to the beginning: \"Self-awareness\" is one of the best travel destinations I've never heard of, but that does't mean much. It's like a \"smart bomb\", it's only twice as good. Lascaux's opening songs are \"Union Stand Together\" and \"If you want more, come and get it\". These are not vague words, but they certainly have a patriotic spirit, which is not present in much of the foreign music that has been released in the last two years. Extensive analysis. Someone told me that \"Sleepwalker\" is a return to the original works of New Order and Depeche Mode. I was born in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five, so I had no idea. I know this is a very interesting dance song, more powerful than I have never heard in BT songs. \"Force of Gravity\" is one of the most beautiful songs in \"Technology\", which reminds me of the combination of \"Nocturnal Transmission\" and \"Trip light is great\". But BT, the almost sold us out. Using JC Chasez, a member of * Nsync (browsing the Internet), is bold in a song that is actually more appealing than \"Never Go Back Down\". \"Dark Heart Dawning\" has a cool theme never seen by BT, and is also the weakest song on CD. Irony? This is a wonderful song, one of the relaxing songs made by BT (near the back is \"Shineaway\"). But it feels like a Groove Armada without fear. On a rainy Wednesday, it was very lonely, until about three minutes later, when the love of your life was revealed by the arrival of the crown, the sun entered the clouds around him. After this chresciendo (I did't miss it) it became a steady rhythm in the middle of the second. \"Paris\", my favourite little city in Western Europe (why \"the City of Love\" always smells like a charge is beyond me), contains the use of the coolest natural sounds (though timely) that blend seamlessly into the synthetic orchestra. 'Circles' contains the largest guitar work never done by BT. If you think the upgrade to \"Never Go Back Down\" is cool, be prepared to be amazed. It even has sensory-style bass guitars that make noise when sending. Don't listen to this song without awesome speakers! Ladies and gentlemen, this is the \"emotional technology\" of BT. It's moving.","overall":5,"summary":"It's something beautiful, mystical","unixReviewTime":1060041600,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2003"}

(I was fourteen when it came out, so forgive me for not being in the \u2018Smartbomb\u2019, esp. \u2018Love Haight Street\u2019, I think even BT is ashamed of that). \u2018Movement\u2019 has been saved by some of the best tracks in the BT industry: \u2018Dream\u2019, \u2018Satellite\u2019, my favourite \u2018Mercury and Solace\u2019, and \u2018Godspeed\u2019 which have never been popular. As a big fan of both Hybrid and DJ Rap (who have now released a new CD itself \u2018Touching Bass\u2019), BT\u2019s work on the travel-hop \u2018Movement\u2019 is, in comparison, not very good. But \u2018Soode\u2019 is what BT added to Drums and Bass\u2019s bombshell, DJ Rap. They collaborated on the soundtrack of \u2018Go\u2019 and the BT beat effect was unmistakable and beautiful. What I like about BT is this mix as an factor. Every dish made has a unique sound, and when it comes to structure retrieval it means it\u2019s very different from anything that has never been done before. It works on heavy-hitting and cloud-vocal songs more than these previous albums, there\u2019s no trace there without sound. But where is Jan Johnston? The woman who brought some of BT\u2019s best works (\u2018Lullaby for Gaia\u2019, \u2018Remember\u2019, and of course \u2018Mercury and Solace\u2019) mixed her ethereal voice into a song \u2018Technology\u2019. However, most CDs are Male voices, which provide a special sound to \u2018Technology\u2019. The four traces of the woman\u2019s voice are as follows: \u2018The Great Escape\u2019 is a harmonious piece. The synths and whale beats go back to \u2018Love, Peace and Fat\u2019, but the sounds resonate directly on the Delerium CD and create frigid tension. The \u2018last time for proof\u2019 was a night in London after training. The music is indirect, but lively and Karina Ware\u2019s voices promise ten: zero on Saturday night. The beat, the beat music under the voices of John Johnston creates the kind of atmosphere that only a true master as BT can do. In voices. sun, ROSE MCGOWEN? Yes, that\u2019s Rose McGowen, that\u2019s Shrek\u2019ed Marilyn Manson. Yes, for me, BT does\u2019t seem to be for me either. Based on this song alone, I want to rent some of this films. Ever since I heard \u2018Firewater\u2019, I\u2019ve been wondering if BT is a Christian. None of these songs have never made me doubt that, \u2018The Beast\u2019 surprised me even more. The words show respect for the sanctity of humanity so that most modern Christian artists cannot afford it. The other words reflect a worldview that reminds me of many of CS Lewis\u2019s ideas of Mere Christianity. \u2018Only constant is a change\u2019 has a very deep sadness that I have never heard in traditional BT music. Even \u2018Building the Spirit\u2019 strengthened it. But there are undeniable regrets and sorrows. In the songbook, there is a Polaroid picture of BT holding hands with a woman with short brown hair while walking. It was torn and are -wrapped with gauze tape. That adds to the singer\u2019s personal touch that even a small amount, like me, with a short list of emotional exploits can be attributed. Back to the beginning: \u2018Knowledge of the soul\u2019 is some of the best Trip-hop I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s not really much to say. It's similar to Smartbomb, only twice as good. The opening words, written by Rasco, say \u2018United I stand\u2019 and \u2018If you want some, come and get some\u2019. It\u2019s certainly not the most popular song never, but it really has a sense of patriotism that is really lacking in most unpatriotic music released over the past two years. The \u2018Somnambulist\u2019, the told me, restored the old work of the New Order and the Depeche Method. I was born a thousand, nine hundred and eighty -five, so I don\u2019t know. I knew it was part of an overwhelming dance with more energy than I heard in a BT song. \u2018Force of Gravity\u2019 is one of the most iconic songs in Technology that reminds me of the combination of \u2018Night Transmission\u2019 and \u2018Fantastic Light Off\u2019. But BT, dude, you're about to sell us. Using JC Chasez, a member of * Nsync (I searched the internet), the song \u2018Marna Gonna Come Back Down\u2019 really caught on, sadly. 'is also the worst song on the CD. Laugh, yes? It\u2019s not a bad song, it\u2019s one of the best songs BT has done (right \u2018Shineaway\u2019). But it looks like Groove Armada has no funk. It only trains every Wednesday, about three minutes, when the love of your life comes from side to side as the sun shines on the surrounding clouds. Then the chresciendo (I\u2019m not correct in spelling) fell into a uniform loop about halfway between the two. out of me), contains some of the coolest uses of natural (even time -correcting) sounds seamlessly integrated with rhythms and synth orchestras. If you think the ribbon from \u2018Never Will Be Back\u2019 is cold, be prepared to be surprised. It even has a bit of an Evanescence-esque guitar roaring from the dispatch. LISTEN TO THIS SONG BELOW IF I DON'T MOVE THE GOOD SPEAKERS! And that, ladies and gentlemen, is BT\u2019s \u2018Sense Technique\u2019. It's shaking.","overall":5,"summary":"It's something beautiful, mystical","unixReviewTime":1060041600,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2003"}

I admit, \"Bow Down\" is an all time classic album, that was perfect from beginning to the send. But this album, released almost weight years later (!) is still gangsta wrap at it's highest form. Ice Cube, Mack ten and WC are close to the send of their wrap careers (especially with Cube doing this acting\/producing thing which pays much much more than five wrap albums), and they got back together to do a (probably) last Westside Connection album. The beats on the album are very very good. WC is still the tightest wrapper out of the three, and it seems Cube in't as sharp on all songs as the used to be. However, on most song Cube DOES menage to come out with some great lyrics, and this delivery rarely fails. Mack ten is not much of a solo artist, but as a part in a group, this verses sound pretty nice. I love about eighty% of the album, with about three songs that I don't feel. The guys don't represent the West as much as they did on the mighty Bow Down, but they DO represent Gangsta wrap, the traditional street gangsta wrap, without wrapping about cars, necklaces, watches for whatever. WSC are not about glamour and fame, they are about the part of hardcore wrap, that's so rare these days. It's an album very different than what's selling these days, you should notice that. It's about banging' to the fullest. By the way, I also liked the fact they put two videos on the CD to watch (Gangsta Nation and Lights Out), that was pretty cool. You can't help put love \"So many wrappers in love\", with all the real cash*# that was said there, \"Gangsta Nation\" (the obvious smash-single with the Fredwreck production), \"Call nine hundred and eleven\", \"Terrorist Threats\" (hardest song on the album - especially WC's verse - it's unbelievable!), \"Lights Out\" (twond single - a laid back song, with a great beat, and a nice hook by Knoc-turn-al), and quite a few others.

Like other successful music artist of the one thousand, nine hundred and heights who have made the crossover to modern times, Michael finds a way to make this sound fit in with hit artist of today while keeping with this own sound and style. What's best about this album is this voice. It sounds the same as it did in previous releases if not a little better. A lot of the songs show that the's taken time to put thought and effort into them and there are only one for two tracks that I could personally go without hearing.one. \"Patience\" is slow with only a piano accompanying this voice. It's a simple song with thoughtful lyrics. Kind of quiet and very moody, it stands out as one of the best tracks on the album.two. \"Amazing\" is one of the best dance tracks this release has to offer. It's upbeat with a quick tempo. The lyrics and inspiration comes from this current relationship and partner. This song also has been at the top of Billboard's Dance and Club tracks alongside other artists such as Beyonce, Madonna and Britney Spears. Shows that even with a long wait, George Michael can still hold down the dance grooves.three. \"John and Elvis are Dead\" is an okay song. It does't impress me much but it in't a bad song. The best part of this song is the vocals. Michael starts off with this voice sort of echoing all the while the sings. It's a slow paced song that sort of poses the question why bad things happen to good people.four. \"Cars and Trains\" I like the beat to this song. Its a soft rock type stone to it. The song is enhanced by little sound effects throughout the song. The subject of the song seems to be about relationships and how they impact individuals.five. \"Round Here\" is a song that greatly showcases Michael's voice. Its another simple song that really in't complicated by too many instrumentals. It's similar in sound and stone to \"Father Figure.\"six. \"My Mother Had a Brother\" is another moody song. What stands out in this song are the lyrics. It's another piano accompanied song that speaks about Michael's uncle. Sort of an eulogy about what Michael learned from inspecting the life of this uncle. One of the best songs of the album.seven. \"Flawless (Go to the City)\" is a dance track. Electronic in sound, upbeat, lots of neat little sound effects to enhance the sound. Definately sounds like a club track. The sound of this track is fun and good while the lyrics (in my opinion) sort of take a back seat unlike in previous tracks. It's meant to be fun and something to dance to which it certainly accomplishes.eight. \"American Angel\" is another song Michael did towards this partner. It's soft in stone while still being a little upbeat, perhaps more in the soft rock category. The lyrics are better there and thoughtful.nine. \"Precious Box\" is an upbeat song that like \"Amazing\" has good lyrics and thoughtful insight in Michael as a person. His vocals are good in this song for everything is sort of toned down and very controlled along with the background beats. There's a nice little echo effect also added to the song.ten. \"Please Send me Someone (Anselmo's Song)\"It's a sort of laid back, easy listening, the song. This works to its advantage because its less moody and simply light without being too corny. A nice balance of a beat, great vocals, a nice little message that sort of places it in what one may expect from a late heights song.eleven. \"Freek! 'four\" My least favourite track. It's meant to be a dance, hard beat, club track. To me, all the computer sound effects and the whole beat of it makes it simply underwhelming. It's like \"Outside\" for another dance song of Michael's. The beat takes away from the above average quality of the other tracks. It in't the best song in terms of lyrics but I guess if you're looking for a club track for sexual-toned song, this would be it.twelve. \"Through\" It's simple and closes out the CD appropriately. I like it because it gives this release a completed sense. The lyrics and vocals are all great and just leaves me with a feeling that Michael really took us through some personal journey of discovery. It has piano and string backgrounds and Michael's voice carries an hairy and wishful stone to it. In all, \"Patience\" is a good CD. The only flaws to it are all the slow paced songs to it that sort of makes only a few stand out as truly great. I'd say this release is filled with more \"thoughtful\" songs than \"danceable\" itunes which in't bad at all. The best part of this release is hearing George Michael's voice that remains impressive after all these years.","overall":4,"summary":"'Patience' is Good","unixReviewTime":1087257600,"reviewTime":"06 15, 2004"}

The best thing about this album is the sound. If it does't, it sounds the same as the previous version.

This is a simple song with thoughtful lyrics. It\u2019s quiet and very noisy, it\u2019s one of the best songs on the album. Two. \"Amazing\" is one of the best dance music in the series.

The real part of the song is the human voice. When Michael started, the voice kept repeating as the sang. This slow song raises the question of why bad things happen to good people. Four. \"Cars and trains\" I love the rhythm of this song. It is a kind of soft stone. This song is added to the small soundtrack of the whole song. The theme of the song seems to relate to the relationships between people and how it affects individuals. Five. \"Come around there\" is a song that really reflects Michael's voice. This is another simple, uncomplicated song with many instruments. It is similar to the \"image of the Father\" in sound and stone. Six. \u201cMy from has a brother\u201d is another song. The lyrics to this song are a song. This is another piano accompaniment song about Uncle Michael. Another kind of eulogy about what Michael learned in this uncle's life test. One of the best songs on the album. Seven. \"Spotless (go to the city)\" is dance music. Electronic sound, happy, most of the sounds are clean on the sounds that amplify the sound. It certainly sounds like a club song. The sound of this song is interesting and beautiful, and the lyrics (in my opinion) are a little different from the previous song. It means something fun and dancing, and it will definitely be done. Eight. \"Angel of America\" \u200b\u200bis another Michael's song about this comrade. It is soft in stone, while still hopeful, perhaps especially in the soft stone category. Words there are good and well thought out. Nine. \"Precious Box\" is a hopeful song, such as \"Amazing\", very sweet lyrics, and Michael's insight is very thought-provoking. His lyrics are good for this song because everything is low and well controlled by the original collection. A nice little echo effect is added to the song.ten. \"Please send me alone (Anselmo's song)\" This is a relaxing and relaxing song. This is ideal because it has no dignity, is simple and is not very old. A good balance of beat, great voices, and a small message that can be placed in people's expectations of high evening songs. \"Freek! 'Four\" is my favourite song. It means dance, heavy beat, club repertoire. To me, all the computer sounds and its beats all make it island. It's like \"without\" some of Michael's dance music. Beating removes the above-mentioned middle class of some songs. In words, it\u2019s not a good song, but I think you want a music club with sexy songs, there it is. Twelve. \"Passed\" was easy and closed the CD properly. I love it because it gives this version a complete feel. The songs and lyrics are so sweet, it makes me think Michael has taken us on a personal journey of discovery. It has a piano and stringed background, and Michael\u2019s voice has a desirable gem. All in all, \"Patience\" is a good CD. Its only drawback is the slow space, which makes only a few songs stand out. I'd say this version is more full of \"thinking\" songs than \"iTunes\" for dancing, and these songs karen't bad at all. The best part of this translation is hearing the voice of George Michael, which has been impressive for some years.","overall":4,"summary":"'Patience' is Good","unixReviewTime":1087257600,"reviewTime":"06 15, 2004"}

As one of the most successful music artists of the millennium, with over nine hundred who have crossed over into modern times, Michael has found a way to adapt this sound to modern hot artists while maintaining this voice and style. Finds The good thing about this album is the word. Sounds similar to what you did in the previous release. Many songs show that it takes time to think and try and is just one of the two songs that I can go without listening to personally. \"Patience\" is just a small part of the piano that accompanies the word. A simple song with thought provoking lyrics. Very calm and serene type, it seems to be one of the best tracks on the album. \"Amazing\" is one of the best dance tracks in this release. Progressive development. Words and inspiration come from your current relationship with your partners. The song was also performed on billboard dance and club tracks with other artists such as Beyonc, Madonna and Britney Spears. This shows that despite the long wait, George Michael can still catch Dance Groves. \"John and Elvis are Dead\" is a beautiful song. It does't make me happy, but it's not a bad song. The best part of this song is the songs. It starts with a resounding voice whenever Michael sings. A slow-moving song of its kind that raises the question of why bad things happen to good people. Four \"Cars and Trains\" I love the rhythm of this song. It is a kind of soft stone for him. Throughout the song, the song is enhanced by small voices. The title of the song is about relationships and how it affects five people. \"Round Here\" is a song that features Michael's voice. This is a very simple song that is not supported by many instruments. It is like a voice and a rock in the \"Father's form.\" Six \"Mother is a brother\" is another beautiful song. The highlight of the song is the lyrics. This is about another piano about Michael's uncle. Respect what Michael has learned from discovering this uncle's life. One of the top seven songs on the album. \"Flawless (Go City)\" is a dance song. Sound, height, electronic with many clear sounds to improve the sound. It definitely sounds like a club track. The sound of this track is sweet and beautiful while the lyrics (I think) are arranged in the back seat as opposed to the previous songs. It's designed for fun and anything that dances about it really fits it. Eight. \"Angel of America\" \u200b\u200bis another song that Michael performed for this fellow. It is softer on rocks while hitting a little, maybe more on the soft rock section. The lyrics are better there and think. \"Precious Box\" is a proud song like \"Amazing\" with beautiful words and insights that you think of Michael as a person. The melodies are good for this song because everything is organized and very controlled from the previous pieces. A small echo effect has been added to the song. \"Please send me someone (Anselmo's song)\" is a kind of retreat, an easy-to-listen song. It works to its advantage because it moves a little and just shines without being too strong. A good balance of rhythm, beautiful words, a beautiful little message that puts you in line with what can be expected from a long-term song. \"Freak! '' Four 'is my favourite song. It's meant to be a dance, a rhythm, a club track. To me, all the sound effects of a computer and all its beats make it easy to just work on the floor. Another of Michael's dance songs is like \"Out\". Rhythm removes the above-average quality of other tracks. It's not the best song in terms of lyrics, but I think if you want to using clubs with sex tones. So it could be twelve. \"Through\" is easy and closes the CD properly. I like it because it gives a full feel to this release. The words and phrases are all good and it just made me. Left with the feeling that Michael really took us on a journey. of discovery. It has a piano background and strings and a hairy and coveted rock in Michael's voice. Overall \"Patience\" is a beautiful CD. The only downside to this is that it has all the slow-moving songs that make some people really great . B That's not a bad thing at all. The best part of this release is listening to the voice of George Michael which has galway is been impressive after all these years.","overall":4,"summary":"'Patience' is Good","unixReviewTime":1087257600,"reviewTime":"06 15, 2004"}

Like other successful artists of the thousand, nine hundred and twenty who have made a change in the modern era, Michael has found a way to make this sound fit for today\u2019s part by maintaining this sound and style. The best thing about this album is this sound. Same as it looks in the previous release otherwise slightly better. Many songs show that it takes time to put in thought and effort and there are only one for two tracks that I can personally access without hearing. \u201cTolerance\u201d is slow with only piano accompanying this sound. It is a simple song with thoughtful words. A quiet and very depressing genre, it represents one of the best tracks on the album.two. \u201cAmazing\u201d is one of the best dance songs this release has to offer. It was very tense and fast. Words and encouragement come from current relationships and partners. The song also became the avenue for Billboard and Club dance with other artists such as Beyonce, Madonna and Britney Spears. It shows that even after a long wait, George Michael can still keep up with the dance. \u201cJohn and Elvis are Dead\u201d is a common song. It does\u2019t impress me but it\u2019s not a bad song. The best part of this song is the sounds. Michael started with this kind of voice and repeated it as the sang. It\u2019s a slow song that kind of raises the question of why bad things happen to good people. \"Cars and Trains\" I love the beat of this song. It is a soft type of stone. The song is emphasized by the small sound effects of the whole song. The theme of the song seems to be about relationships and how it affects individuals. Commander. \u201cRound Here\u201d is a song that greatly enhances Michael\u2019s voice. This is another simple song that really does\u2019t bother a lot of instruments. It's like the sound and rock of \"Father of the Picture.\" Lix. \u201cMy mother had a brother\u201d is another emotional song. What can be seen in this song are the words. This is another piano song about Michael's uncle. A kind of compliment about what Michael learned from overseeing this uncle\u2019s life. One of the best songs on the album. seven. \u201cFlawless (Go to the City)\u201d is a dance avenue. Electronic sound, cloud, low stone sound to improve the sound. It's like a club road really. This song sounds fun and beautiful while the lyrics (I think) have a different seat in the back than the previous tracks. It means fun and dancing for sure. \u201cAmerican Angel\u201d is another song Michael did for this couple. It is the softness of the stone as it rises slightly, perhaps more than the soft part of the stone. Words are better there thinking about. Siamese. \u201cExpensive Box\u201d is an uplifting song with \u201cawesome\u201d words and a thoughtful perspective of Michael as a person. His artwork is perfect for this song everything is sorted and highly controlled along with the original beats. There is a small positive effect also added to the song.ten. \u201cPlease Send Me Someone (Anselmo Song)\u201d This is a kind of retrospective, easy to listen to, song. This works to its advantage because it is less emotional and easily glows without being too annoying. A great balance of beats, superb voice, a nice little message of its kind sets expectations in a poem at the send of the eleventh. \"Freek! 'Four\" My favourite way. It was meant to be a dance, a hard beat, a club run. For me, all the sound effects of a computer and all its beats make it easily weak. It\u2019s like \u201cOutdoors\u201d with another dance song by Michael. Beating eliminates the above average quality of other tracks. It\u2019s not the best song in terms of words but I think if you\u2019re looking for a club track for a sex-ten song, it will be. twelve. \u201cThrough\u201d is simple and closes the CD smoothly. I love it because it gives this release a complete feel. The words and sound are so great that it just leaves me feeling like Michael really took us on a personal journey of exploration. It has a piano and a string background and Michael\u2019s voice carries a rock of hair and passion. All in all, \u201cPatience\u201d is a good CD. The only flaws there are all the slow songs for it which makes it just a little bit to look really big. I can say this release is full of more \u201cthink\u201d songs than \u201cdance\u201d songs which karen\u2019t necessarily bad. The best part of this release is the sound of George Michael\u2019s voice that has been amazing all these years.","overall":4,"summary":"'Patience' is Good","unixReviewTime":1087257600,"reviewTime":"06 15, 2004"}

She pushes the envelope in a smooth, careful way, and when she chads the most clout to affect industry change. Bravo! The problem - and I use that word with great trepidation - with this record is Jill. There's a lot of rambling there. I don't mean (just) lyrics-don't-rhyme rambling, but some of the songs don't quite have the story punch they could, and that we all know that she's capable of. The more-than-occassional non-rhyming does turn it all into a bit of a torch show (which she further cements with the big band-vamp of \"Talk To Me\"), but she has the charm to make it bearable. This is what Erykah Badu hears in her head when she does this sort of thing, but never manages to capture live for otherwise. The droll \"Family Reunion\" is the clearest example of this in play (no mistake it's the longest track on the record either, meh?), while the single \"Golden\" - the most accessible radio song on the record and a bonafide dance jam - rambles for the last half of the song without an actual lyric in sight. This shift in her lyrical style is being trumpeted by some as a return to her spoken word roots (\"Cross My Mind\" (six) nails this), but these influences were't exactly absent on her previous two records, and much of the wanderlust of this record has less to do with poetic stanzas and imagery than it does with pretty affectations drug out over the last minute for two of songs. Some of the songs simply come off as tracks she was't sure how to send, but to send them where the lyrics stopped would have made them two-minute songs. The record is buoyed by the production values of the songs (the music by itself is simply beautiful throughout) and the fact that Jill can using anything in the world and make it sound MAD incredible is her strength. That one of the executive producers notes that some of these songs were done as first takes for Jill is a testimony to her impossible-to-overrate talent, even at this stage in her career.

Just a little bit. Unlike many others, I consider their last official group album \"The Unbreakables\" a classic. However, things changed quite a bit on \"The Most Known Unknown\". First of all, the group is even smaller now in terms of members. We all got used to Gangsta Boo and Koopsta Knicca being gone, but on this one even Lord Infamous (considered by many the most talented wrapper on the group) in't on the album, since the was in jail at the time!. So we're now left with Juicy J (who always delivers!), Crunchy Blac (who's usually horrible, sorry) and DJ Paul. Now, about DJ Paul - I used to really feel this wrapping style. He had that laid-back, I-don't-give-a-fu** attitude and voice. Now that changed on this album. For some reason, Paul's voice became rapier, and the started screaming, and overall became more \"thugged-out\" for whatever. I don't like this change about Paul. His cool yet hardcore style and delivery used to be this trademark. With that being gone, Paul's verses karen't that fun to listen to as they once were. The third big change about the album is the topics. Now I know that three-six don't deal with that devil and dark stuff anymore. It's a shame, but we got used to this a long time ago. But on this album, it seems like the group does't come out with interesting and unique concepts and many of the songs are about the same things, more fitting into today's Rap Scene. I know Three six are using the fact the South is so hot today, but it does't mean you have to loose your special style - which is more sophisticated and shocking lyrics - and become like the other flame wrappers). The lyrics now are much simpler (which is new with DJ Paul, who used to come out with longer verses and now just craps basically the same stuff on most songs). About the GREAT things this album has - the PRODUCTION. It's as tight as always on more songs. DJ Paul and Juicy J prove once again they can ALWAYS come out with banging beats, never heard before. There's something addictive when if comes to those guys' beats. They're just different - rich (using a lot of instruments), unique and yet so catchy. The songs are not as scary and demonic as once, but they're still kinda dark and different sounding. Paul and J also like adding special effects to their songs, that add some flavor to the track. For example, the song \"Roll With it\" features some effects that make it sound like the guys are wrapping through a talkie-talkie. It's sick! Or you gets some words repeated all throughout the songs (like \"North North\" for \"Who run\" ). The hooks are usually very good and catchy as well. Of course, you get the must-have miss towards members that left (mainly T-Rock) on \"Hard Hittaz\". You also get a lot of guest appearances - Project Pat (free at last), Young Buck, Eightball, MJG, Paul Wall, Remi Ma, Mike Jones, Lil Wyte, Fraiser Boy and a few others (including the newest HCP members Chrome and Boogie Mane). Most of them do a good job, and they're needed especially now that the Three six Mafia roster is so thin. It seems like the album is more club oriented, and surprisingly the four bonus tracks are perhaps the best jones, sounding like the old three-six we love (both lyrically and musically). Bottom line - Even though Three six Mafia changed, and moved more in the direction of mainstream Rap, they haven't sold out. There are no love songs, no songs that deal only with money and cars (although they mention those things quite a lot now). It's still gangsta cash** to the fullest, hardcore. Wigs still get split, even though it's done in less interesting ways, you know what I mean?. For real three-six fans this album is a must have, don't listen to the critics, listen for yourself. There are too many tight songs (most of them actually) to be named, and not only the single \"Still Fly\".

Just a little. Unlike many others, I think their last album of the official band \"Things That Don't Break Up\" is a classic. However, in the \"best known\" way, things have changed a lot. First, according to the members, the group is now small. We are all familiar with the departure of Gangsta Boo and Koopsta Knicca, but on this album, even the infamous Lord (considered by some of the most talented packing people in the group) did not appear on the album because the was in prison at the time. inside! . So we were left with Juicy J (always moving!), Crunchy Blac (usually bad, sorry) and DJ Paul. Now, about DJ Paul \u2014 I\u2019ve heard this packing approach. He\u2019s kind of laid back, I don\u2019t care about this posture and voice. Now the disc has changed. For some reason, Paul's voice became harsh, the began to shout, and the often became \"angry.\" I don't like Paul's change. His cool and heavy style and delivery were used for this. With these verses, Paul's verses are no longer as interesting as they used to be. The third major change of the album is the content. Now I know that Sanliu will not deal with those demons and dark objects. It's painful, but we used to get used to it. But on this album, it seems that this combination does not suggest an interesting and unique concept, and many songs are one, more relevant to modern wrap. I know Sanliu is taking advantage of the fact that the south is very hot today, but that does't mean you have to let go of your complex and scary style - to be like the rest of the flames). The lyrics are very simple now (this is a new work by DJ Paul, who used to produce longer verses and now uses the same theme in many songs). About the best thing about the production of the disc. In most songs, it is as crowded as never. DJ Paul and Juicy J also confirmed that they can always bring in some shocking beats that have never been seen before. If it comes to the plagues of those people, there will be something addictive. They are very different (they use many tools), they are different and interesting. These songs are not as scary and demonic as they used to be, but they are still dark and different in sound. Paul and J like to add special effects to their songs to add flavor to the songs. For example, the song \"Roll With It\" has some effects that make people feel like they are surrounded by a talkie-talkie. gula! Or you will repeat certain words throughout the song (for example, \"North North\" stands for \"Who run\"). The links are always good and attractive. Yes you will throw members away from \"Hard Hittaz\" (especially T-Rock). He has a lot of cameos-Project Pat (free at last), Little Buck, Eightball, MJG, Paul Wall, Remi Ma, Mike Jones, Lil Wyte, Fraiser Boy and a few others (including recent HCP members Channel and Boogie Mane). Most of them are doing very well, especially now that the list of three for six fans is as small as that needed. This album seems to be more focused on the club. Surprisingly, four additional songs could be Jones' best, and it sounds like your little favourite (whether songs for music). Bottom Line \u2014 Although the three-six mafia has evolved and advanced to mainstream wrap, it has not been sold. No love songs, no songs about money and cars (though they often mention these things now). He is still the perfect and toughest person of gangsta cash **. The wig is still going to break, even if it is done in an unpleasant way, do you know what I mean? . This album is a must have for real fans. Listen to the comments, listen to yourself. There are so many combined songs (most of them) that can be called words, not just one \"You're Still Flying\". It may not be the perfect record like the rest of Jones, we all miss the original members, the style has changed a bit, but Sanli Matia is still one of the most talented bands.

We were all accustomed to the fact that Gangsta Bow and Copsta Kanika were gone, but this time Lord Infamous (considered one of the band's most talented wrappers) was not on the album, as the was in prison at the time. ! . So now we have Juicy Jay (always bringing!), Crunchy Black (often scary, sorry) and DJ Paul. Now, about DJ Paul - I really feel this style of wrapping. It was this attitude and this calm voice. Now this album has changed. For some reason, Paul's voice got louder, and the started screaming, and the started \"kicking out\" of anything. I don't like this change about Paul. His cool but strong style and delivery were often recognizable. Meanwhile, Paul's verses are not as interesting to listen to as they used to be. The third major change with the album is the titles. Now I know that three for six are no longer dealing with this devil and black things. It's a shame but we have been used to it for a long time.

Instead, we have \"The Collection,\" more of a retrospective, a reflection of sorts, an offering of half hits and half. whatever.

However, this issue is much less troubling than the potential release of carbon copy work based on the itunes that initially endeared them to you. Whether a band can navigate this delicate issue is a testament to their talent and vision. For example, Oasis was never table to recover from the sonic delicatessen that was \"What's the Story, Morning Glory?\" and despite the greatness of that album, their fame ended up being of the infamous \"fifteen-minute\" variety. On \"Black Holes and Revelations,\" Muse's made a decisive yet subtle sonic shift, and one that is not as pervasive as some critics would have you think. Thanks to reviews, I had mentally prepared myself for this possible shift in Muse's sound long before I bought the album. I expected the worst, but in the send, \"Black Holes and Revelations\" hardly turned out to be the major change of direction that some critics have made it out to be. Admittedly, there is a little more use of the \"studio as an instrument,\" which challenges the \"liveness\" of the album. \"Black Holes\" prominently features trumpets, orchestras, and drum machines that confront my visualization of Muse's ability to reproduce these songs in a \"power trio\" format. However, this initially unfounded criticism quickly gave way to the indisputable fact of the raw talent and vision of Muse as a whole. The songs on \"Black Holes and Revelations\" exude the same raw intensity and passion that \"Absolution\" exhibited. While there is a little more \"studio\" window dressing, the voices of the musicians in the group are strong and confident. The compelling mix of Jeff Buckley, Radiohead, and Rush that I perceived on \"Absolution\" is still perceptible, sometimes additionally tempered by a little Prince, Beck, and maybe even more recent work by Adrian Belew. Admittedly, I get a personal kick out of comparing Rush to Muse, since there really karen't many bands that I can in indulge in doing so. In all honesty, \"Rush-ness\" is just a small component of their sound, but one that is an old friend of mine. In the case of \"Black Holes and Revelations,\" this element of their sound brings to mind \"Power Windows,\" when Rush began to fully integrate the synthetic nature of the studio in their sound. This perception is undoubtedly influenced by Muse's use of subjectively inspirational text and orchestral sounds on my personal fax \"City of Delusion,\" a tune that reminds me strongly (and nostalgically) of Rush's \"Marathon.\" However, I would stop short of saying that this influence is direct. The Lowdown: I can't seem to take \"Black Holes and Revelations\" out of my CD player, no matter how many times I spin it. While it may be a little more overtly political in its lyric approach than its predecessor, it is still a musically strong and relevant statement. It may not quite beat out \"Absolution\" as my favourite Muse album, but I somehow would feel wrong if I gave it any less than five stars. In fact, it may be my personal \"album of the year,\" a title that is only contested by Mew's \"And the Glass Handed Kites,\" an album that Muse's fans will most likely dig.","overall":5,"summary":"Is it change, or evolution?","unixReviewTime":1166486400,"reviewTime":"12 19, 2006"}

Even if the band is table to deal with this question the weakness is a testament to their talent and vision. For example, Oasis never returned to the soundtrack \"What's the story, morning glory?\" Although the album was excellent, their name eventually became the popular album \"Fifteen Minutes\". In \"Dark Pits and Revelations\", Musa decided to change this voice, and it was strange as some critics believe. Thanks for the comments. Before I bought the album, I was mentally prepared for this possible change in Moses' voice. I was expecting the worst, but at the time of the dedication, \"The Black Hole and the Apocalypse\" have not been a major change in direction as some critics claim. It is true that the use of a \"recording studio as a musical instrument\" is a small one, challenging the \"liveliness\" of the album. \"Black Hole\" features a trumpet, orchestra, and drum machine, which competes with my museum's ability to reproduce these songs in \"three-dimensional format\". However, this initial baseless criticism soon gave rise to the indisputable fact of Moses' first talent and perspective as a whole. The songs in \"Dark Pits and Revelation\" emit the same depth of originality and love as \"Absolution\". Although there is more to the \"studio\", the voices of the singers in the group are strong and confident. The compelling combination of Jeff Buckley, Radiohead and Rush that I saw in \"Forgiveness\" is still visible, and is sometimes influenced by recent works by a young prince, Baker, and Adrian Belew. Well, I got some personal encouragement in the comparison between Rush and Muse, because there karen\u2019t many bands I can join. Honestly, \"Rush-ness\" is a small part of their voice, but it's my old friend. In the case of \"Dark Holes and Revelations\", when Rush began to fully integrate studio material into their voice, their voice was reminiscent of \"Windows Power.\" This idea is undoubtedly influenced by the use of meaningful and inspiring text and the sounds of the orchestra by Muse in my personal fax \"City of Delusions\". This piece reminds me of the (nostalgic) power of Rush \"Marathon\". However, I do not want to say that this result is direct. Inside: No matter how many times I've been around, I can't seem to get the \"Black Hole and the Apocalypse\" without my CD player. Although its style of music may be more politically explicit than its predecessor, it is still a powerful musical expression and is appropriate. Like my favourite song Musa, it may not hit \"Absolution\" at all, but if I give it less than five stars, I feel wrong. After all, this could be my personal \"Album of the Year\".

And when the album came out I could\u2019t wait to save the rest. \u201cConquest\u201d is the song that became my favourite right away. Later I was super impressed with \u201cMen and Bones\u201d, then \u201cInfluence and Reason\u201d, then \u201cCatching Hell Blues\u201d and then \u201cI\u2019ll slowly get back to you\u201d. My hardest songs of the summer were \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know What Love Is\u201d, \u201cThree Hundred M. P. H. Torrential Outpour Blues\u201d, \u201cBone Broke\u201d and \u201cPrickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn\u201d. I win over Jack's smoky words \"I don't know.\" \u201cIf I stay at the table to live with all the so -called White Stripes awhile, it will start to stick in my head (if not the chorus, and at least the guitar riff) and soon I want to hear it again a song that I .not mad at first. I think it\u2019s there in the music beauty of The White Stripes. There are so many other artists who can come up with catchy poems and memorable lyrics that you want right away but as time goes on you want to hear it While most songs include ICKY THUMP, such as PREVENTION, SATAN, you should give yourself time to capture the beauty and interest of the song, and learn the signatures at different times. for each part of the song. map that: \u201cYou also can\u2019t be a whore\u201d, \u201cIf you go to the grave\u201d, don\u2019t blame the listeners \u201d,\u201c It\u2019s kind of a little bell, really; flying in this face, you will fall into hell. \u201dAfter listening to ICKY THUMP for five months and then, I can confidently say that I love every path on disk and I have yet to see how they can improve such great works of Lip and GET SATAN, this is, for me my opinion is the hardest, most convincing, and best album they have done so far. Just the reviews there are from Stripes fans who don\u2019t like ICKY THUMP, the I can only say I was surprised. Daughtry and Nickelback may have beaten you to appreciate the good music. I saw some Stripes fans pretending to be GET BEHIND ME SATAN, with piano and marimba and drumstick in songs like \"Nurse\" and \"White Moon\", but I think the high energy of ICKY THUMP's songs will make them happy. How do you listen to the song \"Effects And Reasons\", the opening song \"Men And Bones\" on burning guitar \u201cCatch Hell Blues\u201d and come and say you like this album ?? How do you listen to \u201cPrickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn\u201d and not hear \u201cde ali de ali pooh pooh\u201d in your head all day? I remember how long it took me to get used to the structure of some song SATAN SPEAKS. But now, when I hear \u201cRed Rain \u201d\u2019s\u201c Nurse \u201don\u201c White Moon \u201dI look back a few years when those songs first started to get to know me and I already have fond memories of them - - the memory of the place if who was with me and who was with me while playing those songs in the first months after the album came out. On Thanksgiving, two days ago, I was driving near my house and watching the snow fall and thinking about how it had been eighty -four degrees forty -eight hours ago! I'm listening to \"Prickly Thorn.\" And that song should remind me of that good morning every time I hear it in my whole life. If you\u2019re already a fan of The White Stripes and postponed ICKY THUMP, I ask you to make and give it another move. You may find that you were judged unfairly the first time. And if your opinion has\u2019t changed, I think Bon Jovi is back for you.","overall":5,"summary":"Five Stars","unixReviewTime":1404604800,"reviewTime":"07 6, 2014"}

Also in most songs this voice seems thinner, narrower, and hairy than in previous recordings. Krall also uses sound delivery for songs like \u201cWalk By\u201d where rhythm and pitch are not liked. I also enjoyed playing the piano that the also played, but \u201cSo Nice\u201d by the way. The opening song resembles the company\u2019s Third Party theme more than any recording musician would record. The silver lining of Quite Nights is the last four songs close to the traditional Krall. I found it unusual and probably the best song on the CD \u201cHow to Fix a Broken Heart\u201d is listed as a bonus track. Although this voice does\u2019t beat the bar the put on earlier tapes, this mood still seems natural. I hope Calm of the Night is an illusion rather than a Diana Krall. I\u2019m worried about this next CD to see if it gets back in shape. On Calm Nights, I recommend picking and downloading songs instead of buying them all.

And the funny thing is, when you listen to this brand new set of songs, it is like they never really left us. This album is a throwback to the synth-pop heyday of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, but it really does't sound that out of place in today's market. The reason is because of the hooks. \"Fresh\" and \"Watch Us Work It\" are winning tracks, both released as singles. But the catchiness and wisecracking lyrics make for an engaging listen, and the hooks don't wear thin with repetition - this is an album that can be listened to over and over. Growing up in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, perhaps it is easy for me to appreciate this more than some others. But at the send of the day, this album is a very good one, hands down. It does not matter what era these guys are from. We've seen some oldies but goodies release very good albums in the last few years (Tom Petty, Asia, Peter Frampton, Bananarama, Ratt, Cyndi Lauper, AC\/DC, Europe, Prince), so while it is not surprising to me that Devo was capable of creating an album this good, it is a little shocking that they were table to do it after being away from it all for so long.

A generation has passed since Devo's last album (one, zero, nine hundred and ninety), and two generations have passed since the iconic hit of the band \"Whip It\". This album goes back to the popular era of synthesizer in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, but it sounds like it is out of date in today's commercial. When I was growing up in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, I could easily understand this better than anyone else. But when it was released that day, the album was a very good album, without a doubt. What's interesting is that when you listen to these new types of songs, it's as if they haven't really left us.

I liked what I heard, and I gave their eponymous album a try. From what I understand it was a departure from their previous work, and The Lion The Beast The Beat is a continuation of their musical evolution. While Potter has a more dynamic voice, this album reminds me of Sheryl Crow's Globe Sessions (which I still consider to be her best) in the style of music. I think that they captured the essence of what made that album great without sounding derivative. That being said let's get specific about the songs. For starters the opener\/title track is interesting in many ways. The song is structured in three parts that have slightly different feels. It opens sparsely with understated vocals \"I found the heart of a lion in the belly of the beast. And I held it in my hand and I could feel. I could feel, feel the beat.\" A tempo change follows as the \"beat\" is called forth. In the chorus Potter tells us that \"Life is a record playing on repeat.\" The final section of the song starts over the final minute for so with violin flourishes layered in. Potter's vocal delivery is spot on, and this song sets a high bar for the remainder of the album. The theme that runs through The Lion The Beast The Beat is one of loss, sorrow, and sadness. It's in the vocals \"Timekeeper\" - \"I'm too young to be feeling this way\", \"Loneliest Soul\" - \"I'm the loneliest soul so leave me alone.\", and \"One Heart Missing\" - \"If love is made for two, there's one heart missing\". Also \"Stars\" is one of the true ballads on the album, and it features a mournful guitar solo. Finally there is the blues rock song \"Runaway\" in which Potter simply tasks \". let me go. \"I mentioned The Globe Sessions at the beginning, and the clearest nod on The Lion The Beast The Beat is \"Never Go Back\". The opening beat calls to mind \"There Goes The Neighborhood\" in a strong way. I also found a similarity to perhaps a less known band - Elizabeth and the Catapult. The piano opening of \"Timekeeper\" reminds me a lot of \"Time (We All Fall Down)\" from The Other Side of Zero (see my review). Overall, I think that The Lion The Beast The Beat is a great album, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes blues rock featuring very talented female singers.

I love what I heard and tried their album with the same name. As far as I know, this is different from their previous works, and Lion of The Beast The Beat is a further development of their music. Although Potter's voice is very powerful, the music style of this album reminds me of Sheryl Crow's Globe Sessions (I think this is her best). I think they've got the key to making this record great without having to feel it coming out. Having said that, let's talk about these songs directly. For beginners, the opening song \/ theme is interesting in many ways. The song is divided into three sections and sounds a little different. It opened in a low voice, \"I found the lion's heart in the belly of the beast, I held it in my hand and I could feel it, I could hear it, I could feel it, beating\" as the sound \"beat\", the stamp changed accordingly. In the chorus, Porter tells us that \"life is a recurring record.\" The last part of the song starts at the last minute, and the violin is beautiful. Potter\u2019s voice transmission is good, and this song sets the highest standards throughout the album. The theme of The Beast The Beat Lion is one of loss, sorrow and grief. It's in the human voice \"Timekeeper\" - \"I'm too young to feel this way\", \"Lonely soul\" - \"I'm the most lonely soul, so stop it.\" And \"One Heart Misses\" - \"If You Love You were born two people, one little heart.\" \"Stars\" is also one of the folk songs on the album, which features a sad guitar solo. Finally, the blues rock song \"Runaway\", the Potter completed \"let me go\" to it. I mentioned Globe Sessions earlier, and the most obvious one in The Lion The Beast The Beat is \"Never Go Back\". The opening beat reminds us of \u201cwhere to go in the neighbourhood\u201d in a powerful way. I also discovered similarities between Elizabeth and Catapult, an unknown group. The opening of the piano song \"Time Keeper\" reminds me of the other side of \"Time (We All Fall Down)\" (see my review).

After achieving multi-platinum success with the band's three albums, Creed went on an indefinite hiatus, and Tremonti considered creating a speed metal project named Downshifter featuring members of Hatebreed and Slipknot, and also showing us what the was capable of in terms of guitar playing and soloing, but the project never took off. Tremonti did in fact reveal this soloing techniques with Alter Bridge and Creed's \"Full Circle\" reunions album. After that reunion with Creed, Tremonti wanted to do a solo album, because the wrote songs that were deemed not right for this two bands. Two years later, this wish finally came true with the release of this first solo album, \"All I Was\". On this album, Tremonti takes this guitar work to the next level with very complex guitar solos and riffs that are almost too good to be true. I can honestly say that this is better than anything the has done with Creed and Alter Bridge. It's very hard to pick a favourite track on this record, because most of them are very enjoyable, even though they are identical to some songs from Creed's \"Full Circle\". I'd have to say that I like these the best: \"Brains\", arguably the heaviest song on the album, \"You Waste Your Time\", the first single, and \"All I Was\", the title track and probably the closest to the thrash-metal genre while still being one of the more melodic songs. I also enjoy \"Leave It Alone\", \"Giving Up\", \"Proof\", \"Doesn't Matter\", \"New Way Out\", and \"Decay\". While it in't the most enjoyable record of two thousand and twelve by far (some songs are just OK compared to others), Mark Tremonti's solo project is still one of the year's best albums, no doubt.

After winning more platinum wins for the group\u2019s three albums, Creed entered an unlimited cessation, and Tremonti considered creating a fast-paced metal project called Downshifter featuring members of Hatebreed and Slipknot, as well. Others show us what the can do when it comes to guitar and solitude, but the project has\u2019t started. Tremonti actually announced these soloing techniques on Alter Bridge and the album \u2018Circle Full\u2019 on Creed. After reuniting with Creed, Tremonti wanted to make a solo album, as the songs written were considered inappropriate for these two groups. Two years later, this wish was finally fulfilled with the release of the first solo album \u201cAll I Was\u201d. On this album, Tremonti takes this guitar work to the next level with very solid guitar solos and riffs that are too good to be true. Honestly I can say it\u2019s better than anything the did with Creed and Alter Bridge. It\u2019s very hard to choose your favourite song from this record, as most of them are very interesting, although they are similar to some of Creed\u2019s \u201cFull Circle\u201d songs. I have to say I love them: \u201cMind\u201d, which is arguably the heaviest song on the album, \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time\u201d, the first single, and \u201cAll I Was\u201d, the title track and probably the closest . up to the kind of throwing metal while still one of the most rhythmic songs.
