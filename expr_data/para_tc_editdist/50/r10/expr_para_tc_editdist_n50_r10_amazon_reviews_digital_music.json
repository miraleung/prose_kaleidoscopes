Especially in electronic music, there has tended to be a preoccupation with either enormous sonic walls of sound for more minimalist, ambient sounds. Either way, the sound explorations as such tend to be somewhat like a frothy dessert stopping: it has a certain thickness and flavor but it's very easy to dig through. It is not surprising that the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea would be involved in the revival of that original concept. But Radiohead's Thom Yorke, despite a solo release already pointing this way, is another matter. In the opener \"Before Your Very Eyes\", the concept is realized fully with Flea's high toned rhythmic bass playing, similar to a guitar and the heavy percussion playing away. \"Default\" and \"Judge,Jury and Executioner\" bring the often (in the late ninety's anyway) very overused drum 'n bass sound with much more of a fluid and less stiff rhythmic patter. \"Ingenue\" blends a slower funk beat into this early eighty's style electronic \"video game\" style synthesizer pattern that strongly recalls boogie and electro funk. \"Dropped\" and \"Useless\" take the spare, ambient sound Yorke is known for and adds a mild rhythmic kick to it, just below the surface. \"Stuck Together\" and \"Reverse Running\" point back to that fully realized electronica\/funk type groove whereas the closing title track brings the quality of each track together in a full coda as it were. It's been such a long time since I've seen an album produced by an artist known for more stripped down musical productions make music that was so heavily oriented around rhythmic invention. Rather than coming from the source of one individual there,I have the feeling that this is very much the result of a creative synergy between the obviously groovecentric sound of Flea, as a funk\/rock bassist and Thom Yorke's electronic sounds-capes. The send result is not only completely built around rhythmic invention but also a strong sense of instrumental texture that is at the very score of making music percussive and funky in the most Afrocentric sense of the word. I am unsure if any of these artists are intent on expanding in this direction in the future.

Especially in electronic music, people tend to focus on the big walls of sound for the simple sounds of nature. Either way, that sound check is as slow as a bubble dessert stop: it has a certain texture and taste, but it's easy to press. Not surprisingly, the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist flea will take part in the revival of this original idea. But Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke, despite releasing the album alone, is something else. In the opening line \"Before Your Eyes\", the performance of the high Flea and bus rhythm fully understands this, much like the guitar and the heavy metal work. \"Defaults\" and \"Judge, Judge, and Judge\" introduced drum sounds that were often misused (in the late ninetys), with smooth, rhythmic and rhythmic movements. \"Ingenue\" incorporates slow funk beats in this eightys style of electronic style \"video game\" style, which is very reminiscent of boogie and electronic funk. \"Drop\" and \"useless\" use well-known Yorke sounds, and add a little rhythm under the surface. \"Stuck Together\" and \"Reverse Running\" point to a fully-fledged electronic \/ funk style, and the final title track combines the quality of each track into a full epilogue. Long ago I saw an album produced by an artist. Instead of being the source of one person out there, I feel that this is mostly designed between Flea's funk \/ rock bassist and Thomas Yorke's electronic soundtrack. The effects of shipping are not only built around the rhythm, but also have a powerful musical instrument, which is the key to making music more influential and fashionable in the most important parts of Africa. I'm not sure if any of these artists plan to expand this side in the future. However, this will be a powerful new guide worth considering the rhythm of the funk.","overall":5,"summary":"A Very Exciting Rhythic Shock To The Senses","unixReviewTime":1363046400,"reviewTime":"03 12, 2013"}

But Radio Head's stop, York, despite being single, is already pointing the way, that's another thing. In the first play, \"Before Your Eyes,\" the concept is fully realized by playing cloud beats, such as guitar and heavy music from time immemorial. \"Default\" and \"Judge, Judge and Criminal\" brought frequencies (in the late nineties) that used drums and bass with a lot of solid and solid water. \"Anjino\" combines this cheap funk into an \"electronic style\" video game \"synthetic style\" that vividly recalls boogie and electro funk.

Money changes everything. The second single on the album. Amazing song. Girls want to make fun of the album's first single. This song really describes Cindy's voice and image.

In fact this tops their debut Exposure by miles! What You Don't Know is the Miami-based girl trio's second go-around with producer Lewis A. Martinee, who also does many different instruments on many of the tracks. He also writes for co-writes all but two tracks. The girls harmony vocals is also used to great effect. The horn-enhanced title track contains the same bouncy energy backed with intense percussion and drum-machines that \"Come Go With Me\" and \"Point Of No Return\". The Jets would't be out of place doing this, and tracks like this would've saved their career. The \"In Effect Mix\" of this song, with wrap-scratching effects and enhanced bass, give it an early Janet Jackson flavour. The space continues when Ann sings on \"Stop, Listen, Look & Think\" which could also have done wonders for Brenda K. Starr. The string-like keyboards opening the Paula Abdul-ish \"Tell Me Why\" hint at a more serious message, that of the effects of senseless crime: \"Tell me anybody why can't we live together\/end all the fighting erase it all forever\/listen to this reason before it gets too late\/soon there will be no one, no one left to hate.\" The are-chorus refrain is sung in unison by the trio to great effect. The nocturnal slow dance R&B number \"When I Looked At Him\" demonstrates why Jeanette does best as the balladeer and singer. Message there: \"It's not a dream\/we all need love and understanding\/we must break thru\/and make a love that's everlasting.\" Added piano, strings-keyboard decorate the more flush \"Suave Mix\", also on this album.\"Let Me Down Easy\", which mirrors the same instrumentation as the title track, is also sung by Gioia, and could've been a good Jets for Cover Girls number. Songwriters Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly give \"Still Hung Up On You\", which could give Bananarama a run for its money in bubble-gum style music. Gioia on vocals there. Then ballad number two with Jeanette, written by Diane Warren (oh yes!) and its a heartbreaker. The impending collapse of a relationship is central to \"Your Baby Never Looked Good In Blue.\"Ann sings \"Now that I Found You\", whose bounce is lightweight compared to the first three songs, but is decent enough, as it segues into the similarly tempted \"Love Don't Hurt (Until You Fall), backed by string-synths and brass, and sung by Gioia. If you thought the previous Jeanette ballad was a heartbreaker, \"Didn't It Hurt To Hurt Me\" goes even further in emotion. Gioia blacks the suppleness of Jeanette but does wonders there in a world that's unexpectedly turned upside down. The string-keyboards help the atmosphere, as does the bridge: \"When I think of all the spain\/the spain that was left to subside\/but now I think it's too late for you to cry.\" An awesome number. The brass-enhanced \"Walk Along With Me\" gets back to the quick tempo of the first three songs and is a perfect way to send the album, not counting the remixes. All three take turns on lead vocals. When they using \"Walk along with me\/change all the feelings\/sing along with me, shape the world\" I'll accept that invitation gladly, for the following reason. I went to see Expose in concert in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety while they were promoting this album, and it's the best concert I've never been--in fact, when the girls, generosity booming in their hearts, asked those of us to come on up to get closer to them, I brushed forward from Row seven and got to the penultimate row, almost shaking hands with Gioia! A night to remember! What really helps is that the individual song credits list the lead singer. Jeanette comes off as the best vocalist. Wonder why she never went for a solo career--I would've sprung for an album of hers. This was Gioia's last album with the trio, as she left to have a family. One of the most danceable albums of the eighty's, with a really appealing trio.","overall":5,"summary":"What I know is What You Don't Know outdoes Exposure","unixReviewTime":1061424000,"reviewTime":"08 21, 2003"}

The song \"On the Impact of Influence\" has the effect of rotating the surroundings and the improved buses, giving it a taste of Janet Jackson's original.

The relationship that will fall apart is in the middle of the \"Your baby never looked green\". Equally appealing \"Love Can't Hurt (Till You Fall)\", accompanied by bracelets and brass instruments, sung by Gioia. If you think the former Jeanette ballad breaks the heart, \"Did you hurt me?\" Going on. Gioia showed Jeanette's toughness, but she worked wonders in a world that had changed so suddenly. The keyboard string helps to make the atmosphere, and the bridge also says: \"Come down when I think about all of Spain \/ all of Spain \/ but now I think it's time to cry.\" A large number. The brass-enhanced \"Walk With Me\" is back to the fast track of the first three songs, and is a great way to send a record, not a mix. The three men take turns acting as leading musicians.

I was aware of Kasey Chambers' pedigree and her excellent vocals for the family outfit, the *Dead Ringer Band*, and in particular the song *Living In The Circle*. When I played this CD the initial production and sound surprised me. There were extremely personal and sparse songs with equally sparse vocals, that I immediately connected with. It was a refreshing change and she was attempting to deliver a country sounding,Lucinda Williams,Shawn Colvin *ish*project aimed at the international market. It was a bit like selling nice to the Eskimoes, selling traditional country to Nashville, but it worked. and it still does!! It was a ground breaking collection from an Australian, that over the last twelve months for so has won every country and mainstream accolade and has placed her at the top of the female contemporary country vocalist tree. and all with her debut effort and at the ripe old page of twenty-two!!! From the title track*The Captain* which is a haunting track that grows on you after every listen, so much so that it appears in the Sopranos* soundtrack, and deservedly so. and gives her richly deserved exposure. She has been on Letterman and has received some fame in the US. and we can only wait for the follow up release. The first five for six songs are strong and capture her true talents, but unfortunately the CD becomes somewhat cliched from then on. The lyrics are generally pleasing but the striving to sound like American country detracts somewhat from the overall feel of excellence. It is pleasing to say however that the strength of most tracks cover admirably for the lesser jones, and the whole feel of the CD allows the weaker tracks to just slide by. This is a watershed CD for Australian country, and has produced a flood of activity from female country vocalists. The CD has a maverick quality. It is well produced and the vocal variety is excellent. Her Brother and father contribute throughout the songs and her brother produces.this has the confidence of a family effort, a familiarity that produces confidence. I recommend that you purchase this CD and savour the emotion and feel contained. I am eagerly awaiting her next effort. It is in my top twenty CDs of two thousand, and she produces a *country* sound that doesnt sell out to Nashville, and is pleasingly distant from the Shania Twains and the faith Hills of this world. four.five to five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"On an Impulse...A Different Maverick Sound..Very Original","unixReviewTime":991785600,"reviewTime":"06 6, 2001"}

Unfamiliar to me, their beautiful voices about Casey Chambers' children and family attire, * Dead Ringer Band *, especially the song * Staying in the Circle *.

It has been a recent change and it is trying to bring the world to the forefront, Lucinda Williams, a Sean Colon * Eyes * project that has been targeted in the international market. It was like a good sale to Eskimos, selling conventional land in Nashville, but it worked. And so far !!

And all with this first attempt and on the old adult page twenty-two !!! The title of the track is * The Captain * which is an awesome track that grows after listening to all of you, so much so that the song comes from Supranus *, and you deserve it. And it gives quite a rich exposure. He has been a letter man and has gained fame in the United States. And we can only wait for the next release. The first five songs of six are powerful and take on real potential, but unfortunately the CD is almost hidden from there. Ordinary words are funny but try to sound like an American country that somehow interferes with the full sense of well-being. It's interesting to note that the power of many tracks encompasses the little Jones well, and the whole feel of the CD just keeps the weak songs from slipping. It is one of the most delicious CDs in the Australian country, and it has created a flood of work for women's voices. The CD is of marquee quality. It is well crafted and has a great variety of sounds. Her brother and father contributed to all the songs and her brother also produced. It involves the confidence of the family effort, a habit that reflects self-confidence. I suggest you buy this CD and enjoy and feel it. I look forward to this next attempt.

Dillinger \"www.timdillinger.com\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"This is my favourite Teena Marie album (tied with \"Robbery\") for a multitude of reasons. This is Teena's first album as sole producer of her work, which makes this album intensely personal and a true reflection of Teena's identity as an artist. Teena's two prior albums (Produced by Rick James and Richard Rudolph, respectively) served as a sort of mentoring for her. This album is a combination of those influences, coupled with her own, making an explosive effort.

Lush with strings and slamming horns and Teena's classic lyrical touch (\"I feel it in my third eye\/love will never send\"), it is another example of why twenty-five years later, we still love this woman's work. My personal favourites on this album are the ballads, specifically the jazz infused \"Irons In The Fire\" and the very much underrated \"Tune In Tomorrow\". \"Tune In Tomorrow\" is a follow-up so to speak of \"I'm Gonna Have My Cake\" from \"Wild & Peaceful\". Here, Teena becomes the jazz chanteuse and gives us a glimpse (as she continues to do) of where her future work may take her. That scat at the send climaxes the song. and creates one of Teena's Top five vocal performances. Teena also shows off her Latin influences with the heavenly \"You Make Love Like Springtime\" and it's glorious reprise at the send of \"Tune In Tomorrow\". I agree with the previous reviewer and note that \"First Class Love\" is perhaps the weakest moment on the album. but it's orchestration is so tight it overshadows whatever lapses there are in the track.

This is Tina's first album as the main producer of her work, which makes the album personal and proves Tina's authenticity as an artist. Tina's previous albums (produced by Rick James and Richard Rudolph, respectively) played a role in her. This album is a combination of these influences, as well as its influence, to make an explosive effort. Perhaps the most famous work is the smash hit \"I Want Your Love.\" Tina expresses her love of funk music in this seven-minute work. Lush strings and horn beats and Tina's typical song (\"I feel in the third eye \/ love will never send\"), which is why we still love it twenty-five years later Another example of a woman's work. My favourite thing about this album is the traditional songs, especially the \"Irons In The Fire\" featured in jazz music and \"Under Tune In Tomorrow\". \"Tune Tomorrow\" can be said to follow \"I'll Find My Cake\" in \"Wild & Peaceful\". Here, Tina becomes a jazz musician, giving us an idea (as she continues to do) where her future career could take her. The place where it was posted brought this song to a climax. And the created one of Tina's top five songs. Tina has also demonstrated her Latin influence on the natural world \"She Makes Love Like Spring\", which is repeated in honor of \"Tune Tomorrow\". I agree with the previous reviewers and realize that \"First Class Love\" may be the weakest moment on the album. But its alignment is so tight that any errors in the recording area are covered.

This requires more money for New Order fans.","overall":5,"summary":"Definitive cd issue of this album","unixReviewTime":1194393600,"reviewTime":"11 7, 2007"}

T. I. has been in the wrap game for some time now, but the only recently started getting a lot of mainstream attention after the success of this songs \"Rubberband Man\" and \"Let's Get Away\" featuring Jazze Pha. Both of these hit songs were featured on T. I.'s two thousand and three hit album Trap Muzik. Urban Legend is the follow-up to Trap Muzik. Urban Legend was released in late two thousand and four and is in stores now. The first single from Urban Legend, \"Bring Em Out,\" has been the party anthem of the winter club season. This was the perfect first single to be released from this album which is hot like fire. The album opens up with the song, \"Tha King,\" everyone knows that T. I. is the King of the South and the affirms this on this track. This song is followed by the mellow track, \"Motivation.\" This laid back track is the perfect album cut. T. I. fans got a taste of track \"U Don't Know Me\" at the send of the video for \"Bring Em Out.\" This trunk song really gets the club trunk to pieces. The fella's are really feeling this song.\"ASAP\" is a CRAZY track. This melodic track is just off the hook. I think this will be a great threerd for fourth single from Urban Legend. \"Why U Mad At Me,\" is another song with a crazy track. The production on Urban Legend is melodic, original, catchy and fresh. The first six tracks of Urban Legend feature T. I. doing this thing solo. Tracks seven-eleven feature guests artists. Nelly is up first on \"Get Loose.\" I personally found this collabo a bit of a disappointment. I expected more from these two powerhouse wrappers together. It's an okay album track. Fellow Southern Rapper BG is featured on \"What They Do,\" Mannie Fresh is featured on \"The Greatest,\" Lil Kim is featured on \"Get Ya S*** Together\", and Pharrell is featured on track #eleven \"Freak Through.\" Out of these four songs \"The Greatest\" seems to be radio friendly and Mannie Fresh does't disappoint with this production. \"Freak Through\" featuring Pharrell is crazy and I think it would be a great second single.\"Chillin With My B***\" is another laid back track that features Jazze Pha. So if you liked \"Let's Get Away,\" you will probably be feeling this song. One of the most anticipated songs on the album is the all-star track \"Stand Up\" which features Lil Jon, Lil Wayne, and Trick Daddy. This song is okay, a perfect album track. Urban Legend is an album that T. I. fans will enjoy. T. I. is best on the tracks by himself, the could really have carried the entire album without any guests artists. Album after album you can't help to notice that T. I. is just getting better and better. The flow and lyrics are on point and the production rocks. Other guests artists featured on Urban Legend include Daz Dillinger, P$C, and Big Kuntry. Bella Rap Editor","overall":5,"summary":"T.I.

The album begins with the song \"Tha King\" Everyone knows that TI is the King of the South, and this is evidenced in this song. This song is followed by the beautiful song \"Encouragement\". This track is back to perfect album editing. IT fans have tasted \"You Don't Know Me\" when posting a video for \"Take Em Out\". The suitcase song broke the club suitcase. The boys love this song. \"ASAP\" is a crazy track. This piece of music is over. I think this will be the third album of Urban Legend\u2019s fourth single. \"Why Are You Disappointed With Me\" is another song with crazy songs. The Urban Legend product is very interesting, original, interesting and new. The first six tracks of Urban Legend show TI doing this on its own. A seven-eleven repertoire of special guest artists. Nelly was ranked first in \"Get Loose\". Personally I have found the collaboration disappointing. I expect more from these two powerful threats. This is a good song for the album.

Fella lovers really listen to the song. \"ASAP\" is a crazy track. This sleek track is just off the hook. I think this will be a big hurdle for Urban Legend's fourth single. \"Why are you mad at me,\" is another song with a crazy song. Urban Legend's production is a beautiful, real, interesting and new song. The first six urban legend tracks featuring TI do this alone. Tracks of seven and eleven guest artists. Blue woke up first in \"Gate Loose\". Personally, I find this cooperation disappointing. I was expecting too much from the risk of a power outage at the same time. This is a good album track. Fellow Southern wrapper BG featured on \"What They Do\", Money Fresh on \"The Greatest\", Lil Kim on \"Gate for S *** Tugred\" and Farrell on # eleven \"Freak Throw\". \"Freak Throw\" Farrell's feature is crazy and I think it will be the second single. \"Walking With My B ***\" is one of the hit songs featuring Jazzy Fa. So if you like \"Let's Get Out\" you will probably hear this song. One of the most anticipated songs on the album is the star song \"Stand Up\" which includes Lil June, Lil Wayne and Trek Daddy.

You began to see and hear the beginning of what would become two major transitions that's about to take place with the group. First, this is the last album made with the original members founded back in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine, after this, Maurice and Verdine would be the only carry covers into the atwood incarnation of the band. Second, the bands contract would expire with the completion of this album and Maurice decided it was time for a change to a company that would invest more into the growth of the band and help to market them to a more wide variety of audience. Their live shows were already legendary and the felt that if they could get the added promotion dollars from their record company that the group would begin to have the kind of world wide appeal that the'd always envisioned. So in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, the band signed with Columbia Records and the found the score members who would truly allow the band to become \"The Mighty Elements\" and have a platform to truly show off their musical genius. As for the proper review of this album, I love their earlier work as it's a much \"harder\" and \"grittier\" sound than what would come later. And although, their later albums would become the stuff of legend and truly establish them and rightful so as the greatest band never, I always felt that these early albums were more along the lines of what you would hear in their live shows and gave you that incredible energy that only a live performance can sometimes bring. The band was being produced at this time by Joseph Wissert, the was Maurice's first production mentor prior to the late, great Charles Stepney. Wissert would produce the bands first four albums and was instrumental in the development of their lives shows and sounds. You can hear this formula on the song \"Energy\" with it's nasty funk influenced instrumentation that are the perfect jam to start this album off with. The intro to the song has some great lyrics that are very spiritual and sets the stage for what the bands lyrical content would feature as a foundation from then on for both this and later incarnations. Those with a desire to actual reflect, study and think rather than just listen to lyrics will certainly get the message. The next track, \"Beauty\", is one of my all time favourites by the band which again introduce simply yet profound lyrical content that allows the mind to soar as you think about what true \"Beauty\" is really all about. \"Think About Loving You\" which is a beautiful ballad led & written by the female vocalist in the group, Sherry Scott, is unique in that it's the only time that a female vocalist would lead and write one of their recorded songs. As a matter of fact, the female vocalist as a part of the actual band would be something that would be gone altogether after the next two albums. Altogether, this is a great album that truly showcases the bands musical talent and allows for them to throw caution to the wind and from certain restrictions that were the order of the day for how an album was put together. They truly were \"polishing\" up the act so to speak for the remarkable things yet to come. This may be their most relaxed release and the one where you could tell they had fun recording it. I would highly recommend this album for those who are may not be familiar with EWF's earlier are-Columbia Records\/Charles Stepney period.

Second, with the band's contract expiring with the completion of the album, Morris has decided it is time to change the company that will invest more in band development and help sell it to a wider audience. Their play is now a thing of the past, and they believe that if they can get the extra money from a recording company, then the band will start to have the kind of global appeal we have been thinking about. Then in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, the group signed a contract with Columbia Records and found the members of the sheet that really made the band a \"universal\" and a platform to truly showcase their musical talents. As for the right ideas on this album, I love their first work because it is \u201charder\u201d and \u201charder\u201d than the last work. While their latest albums will be mythical and actually establish their status and legitimacy as the biggest band, I always feel like these early albums are very much in line with what you hear in their games and give you time Only live games can bring incredible power. The band was produced by Joseph Wissert, who was Maurice's first production consultant before the great and last Charles Stepney. Wissert will produce the band's first albums and will play a key role in their performance and sound development. You can hear this formula for the song \"Power\", a powerful funk instrument, and the perfect jam to start this album. The introduction of this song has beautiful soul lyrics and laid the foundation for the band's music. From then on, this song and the later birth will be the foundation. Those who wish to be exposed, to read and think rather than listen to words will again knowledge. The next song \"Beauty\" is one of my favourite bands of all time. It also introduces simple and in-depth music content, which will make you think about the true meaning of \"Beauty\". \"Think of Your Love\" is a beautiful ballad, composed by leading lead singer Sherry Scott (Sherry Scott). After all, the female singer who was part of the real band will disappear completely after the next two albums. All in all, this is a good album. It really shows the band's musical talents and allows them to leave the warning and disobey certain restrictions, which is the order in which the albums were compiled that day. They actually \"polish\" this behavior, it can be said to be made for strange things to come. This can be their easiest release, and you can see they had a great time during the recording. For those who may be unfamiliar with the first season - the Columbia Records \/ Charles Stepney's EWF season, I recommend this album. You will be amazed and happy.","overall":4,"summary":"Great Transition Album","unixReviewTime":1254873600,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2009"}

First, this is the last album made with the original members founded back in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine, after this, Maurice and Verdine would be the only carry covers into the atwood incarnation of the band. And although, their later albums would become the stuff of legend and truly establish them and rightful so as the greatest band never, I always felt that these early albums were more along the lines of what you would hear in their live shows and gave you that incredible energy that only a live performance can sometimes bring. So in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, the band signed with Columbia Records and the found the score members who would truly allow the band to become \"The Mighty Elements\" and have a platform to truly show off their musical genius. \"Think About Loving You\" which is a beautiful ballad led & written by the female vocalist in the group, Sherry Scott, is unique in that it's the only time that a female vocalist would lead and write one of their recorded songs. The next track, \"Beauty\", is one of my all time favourites by the band which again introduce simply yet profound lyrical content that allows the mind to soar as you think about what true \"Beauty\" is really all about. As for the proper review of this album, I love their earlier work as it's a much \"harder\" and \"grittier\" sound than what would come later.","overall":4,"summary":"Great Transition Album","unixReviewTime":1254873600,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2009"}

You start to see and hear in the beginning what will be the two big changes that will happen to the team. First, it was the last album made by the original members of the are -established thousand, nine hundred and sixty -nine, after that, only Maurice and Verdine would be the cover bringing atwood entry into the band. Second, the group\u2019s contract would expire at the send of this album so Maurice decided it was time to make it a company that would invest heavily in the group\u2019s growth and help market to different people. Their live performances are legends already and they felt if they could get a promotional dollar from their enrolment company that team would start the kind of appeal the world always thought of. So one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, the band signed with Columbia Records and learned member points that would really allow the group to become \u201cThe Elemen Elemen\u201d and have a platform to truly showcase their music. In terms of proper review of this album, I like their previous work to seem \u201charder\u201d and \u201cgrittier\u201d than the next one. Although, their albums would eventually be the thing of legends that would really build and qualify as the greatest band never, I\u2019ve always felt that these previous albums were superior in line with what you hear on their live shows. I have given you incredible energy only a living activity can bring sometimes. The team was made up at this time by Joseph Wissert, who was Maurice\u2019s first production consultant before graduating, the great Charles Stepney. Wissert produced bands for the first four albums and was part of developing the performances and sounds into their lives. You can hear this formula in the song \u201cEnergy\u201d with horrible funk affecting the device which is the best jam to start this album. The introduction to the song has very good and very spiritual lyrics and sets the stage for what the subject of the songs will be the basis from then to the next. Those who really want to think, learn and think instead of listening to songs will really get the message across. The next track, \u201cBeauty\u201d, is one of my favourites that is always on the band and it is again presented in a simple and profound way that allows the mind to rise when you think of what \u201cBeauty\u201d really is. \u201cThink I Love You\u201d which is a very good song led by the band\u2019s vocalist, Sherry Scott, is unique in that it\u2019s only time that a vocalist will lead and write one of their recorded songs. In fact, a female vocalist who is part of the real band will be something that will go perfectly on the next two albums. All in all, this is a great album that really showcases the musical talent of the bands and allows them to be carefully thrown into the air and some limit fixes of the day as the album is put together. They really \u201cclean up\u201d the action to talk about the wonderful things to come. This may be their most relaxing release and you would say they enjoyed the recording. I highly recommend this album to those who may not be familiar with the previous EWF era of Columbia Records \/ Charles Stepney. You will be amazed and happy.","overall":4,"summary":"Great Transition Album","unixReviewTime":1254873600,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2009"}

But that does't mean it's bad, it does't mean it's fun, but first it's a great way. But it should be the second best album to see where the performance was still gangsta. You left the roots of these gangstas after the day of your death, so none of these limited albums can affect these things. Dr. Dre left Detroit before the did so, so none of these beautiful songs. However, I would say that the producers who produced this album did a very similar job. My next ranking introduction ninth \/ ten best introductions. Dog Father Ten \/ Ten Classic, a good track kicking album. The beats are strong and Snoop follows all the verses and is a great course for Charlie Wilson III. Ride four I zero \/ ten stupid squares to lengthen the album. Go upstairs with six boogie ten \/ ten great courses and more cool beats. Freestyle interview six \/ ten is not good, Snoop always talks for time sex. When I grow three \/ ten, I don't care about this skirt, which is the only scheme in the album that I don't hate at all. Snoop Bounce Tan \/ Tan Classic, great for BOUNCE tonight. Gold Rush Nine \/ Ten are some tough ** beats, but Snowpane is just one verse. Imagine seven for ten, a little crazy song with a lot of guests. (Ter M Off) Me and My Dogs Ten \/ Ten Solid Layer Solo. Definitely one of my eleven favourites. Steam Ten \/ Ten Classic, I can really see why it was a hit. Through Snoop, another solo Thai dog talks to Beat Bates about the lives of all the members of Pound Valve. Group seven-five \/ ten plus, it's a small fill with a bad title and thirteen guest attendance. Two thousand and one ten \/ one solid solo. It should have been called Snoop Bounce II to make people nervous and talk about making a fuss. Six minutes and ten \/ ten pretty no thanks, I've noticed that some people have given this song a bad rating. But to me it's a great song, and Snoop is fifteen miles behind. (OJ) Wake up. Five \/ ten Hmm, appeals to a lot of guests, but half of it is snoop, and snoop works especially well on Corsostein. Snoop's Upside for Head Ten \/ Tan Classic, another favourite with all Snoop's verses and a great foursquare. Blueberry Weight \/ Ten Okay, Snoop Anyway. If there is no Snowpiton, I cannot weigh it more than ten. Traffic jam zero \/ ten and WBALLZ stupid, not funny at all. That WBALLZ boy is a nineteenth grader. Dougieland Ten \/ Ten is another great track, Snoop is in every verse and there is a great song in it. Downtown Assassins cannot give more than nine in nine.five \/ ten. Five \/ ten I see that there is only one verse of Snoop. But it's definitely a solid track with twenty-one bumps. Exit five \/ ten.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","unixReviewTime":1154736000,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2006"}

However, to say that this does not mean that it is bad is to say that it is good, but this case is even more appealing. But this should be the second best album, when the album is still a gangster. You left this gangster root behind the left death row, so there are no restrictions on the album that can touch these things. Dr. Dre left Deathrow before making the film, so no beating is so much fun. However, I want to say that the work done by the producer who made this album can be said to be equally good. My next rating. One. Introduction Nine \/ Ten is very good for the introduction. Doggfather ten \/ ten old, big song starts the album. Beating strong, Snoopy performed all the verses, and a great choir by Charlie Wilson III. Ride four Me Zero \/ eleven silly graphics, just to make the album longer. Skip Ta Boogie Ten \/ ten large choirs and beatsfive coats. Freestyle six\/ten Conversation Yeah, that's not right, Snoop is just talking all the time six. When I was third \/ tenth, I did't care about this skit, it was the only square on the album that I did't completely hate. Snoop Bounce ten \/ ten classic, good BOUNCE tonight. Gold Rush nine \/ Eleven holds the beats, but has a poem of Snoopnine. You want seven \/ ten Naaa, a stupid song with lots of cameos. (Tear Em Off) Me and My Doggz ten\/ten A solo with stroller a ** beats. Definitely one of my favourite eleven people. Ten \/ ten older Vapors, I certainly understand why this is so popular. Another hit hit with Snoop, talks about the lives of all members of Tha Dogg Poundtwelve. Groupie seven.five \/ ten Also, it's kind of filling in a bad title with too many posts. Two thousand and ten \/ eleven one time alone. This can be called Snoop Bounce II. Watch the discussion about making people slow down and completing fourteen. Six minutes Sixx ten minutes unbeaten. I have seen some people give this song a very bad review. However, for me, this is a very sweet song, and Snoop is very sleepy. (OJ) Wake up at nine: five\/ten. Yes, many cameos, but half of them are Snoopy. Snoopy worked very well on chorussixteen. Snoop's Upside Ya Head Ten \/ Ten Classic is one of the favourites of all Snoop verses and great chorusseventeen. The Blueberry weight \/ ten is fine, but where is Snoopy. If there is no Snoopy XVIII, I can't give it more than ten weights. Zero traffic \/ zero ten Another silly drawing WBALLZ, not funny at all. That WALLZ guy is stupid. Doggyland Ten \/ Ten is another great song, Snoop appears in every verse, and has a great choir. Downtown Assassin nine.five\/ten I can no longer give this nine.five\/ten I saw that there is only one Snoop verse. However, this is definitely a solid track, hitting twenty-one.

However to say that does\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad, that means it\u2019s surprising but this first game is even more surprising. But it has to be this second best album to see when it\u2019s done and it\u2019s still gangsta. He left the roots of this gangster after this left -handed death so none of this limited albums can handle this product. Dr. Dre left Deathrow before it could be done so none of these amazing beats. Yet I would say the makers who made this album did a job that can be said to be that way. My Rating is Intro Nineteen years It's great to get to know each other. Doggfather Ten \/ Classic, a great way to get started at the door. The beats are tight and Snoop does all the verses and there\u2019s a great Charlie Wilsonthree song. Follow the four Me Me zero \/ ten Stupid, just there to speed up the four albums. Up Jump Tha Boogie ten \/ ten great songs with lots of beats. Free Chat Sixteen Well it's not a big deal, Snoop really talks all the time. When I was growing up I did\u2019t care about this skit, the only skit on the album that I did\u2019t really hate. Snoop Bounce Ten Classic, good for BOUNCE tonight. Gold Rush nine \/ ten Some close a bit ** beat, but it only has one Snoopnine verse. You thought seventeen Naaa, quite a silly song with congratulations. (Tear Em Off) Me and My Doggz A ten with a hard cramp ** hit. Definitely one of my favourites. Vapors Ten Classic, I\u2019m sure I can see why this one was beaten. The only one with Snoop beats is talking about the lives of all the members of Tha Dogg Poundtwelve. Groupie pit.five Again, this is a little mess with a bad theme and a lot of thirteen guests. two thousand and eleven \/ ten Another narrow. It will be called Snoop Bounce II looking at discussions about how people can get up and be fourteen. Six Minutes Ten Pretty Pretty Grateful, I found out that some people gave this song a bad rating. However for me it was a very good song and Snoop was a delayed fifteen. (OJ) Wake up at nine. Five \/ ten Hmm, looks like a lot of guests but half is Snoop and Snoop works well especially with chorussixteen. Snoop\u2019s Upside Ya Head is Ten \/ Ten Classic, another favourite of all Snoop\u2019s verses and great chorusseventeen. Blueberry \/ Ten Weight Well, but Snoop. I can\u2019t give you more than ten pounds without Snoopeighteen. Traffic Jam zero \/ ten other silly WBALLZ skits, at least funny at all. That WBALLZ guy is stupid. Ten \/ ten other great ways Doggyland, Snoop is in all the verses and there is great chorustwenty. Downtown Assassins nine \/ five \/ ten I can't give nine over five. Five \/ ten when I saw there a Snoop verse. However it was really a difficult road to beat at twenty -one.

The album won a gold medal, but hopes to sell more. It is expected that the tears of fear will be another major group that fell in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys and enjoyed a moment in the visible world.

All the World's A Stage was raw and gushed energy, but drew from a limited number of songs. The integrity of Exit Stage Left and A Show of Hands was diluted by overdubs and polished production jobs. But this is the real deal, with tons of intensity and dreams of great songs to perform. There are three CDs in this collection. While it is impossible for a single live release to capture the true scope of Rush's career, this package does a nice job. The first two discs (the \"main\" jones) draw heavily from the band's most recent releases: Roll the Bones, Counterparts, and Test for Echo. The stirring \"Bravado,\" the energizing and ironic \"Resist,\" and the aggressive \"Stick It Out\" are just a few examples of the newer songs given intense live treatment there. A number of the band's well-known classics are there as well. \"The Spirit of Radio,\" \"The Trees,\" \"Freewill,\" \"YYZ,\" and an incredible version of the band's best loved epic, \"two thousand, one hundred and twelve.\" Unlike the version found on All the World's a Stage, this performance keeps every section of the song intact (whereas the older one is five minutes shorter). Without a doubt, the song is a devastating feat of hard rock in the live setting. Explosive riffs and rapid-fire percussion, along with an intimate acoustic solo during part three validate the epic's standing as one of the bands best works. \"Closer to the Heart,\" the requisite concert staple is again performed there, and again it gets a fun jam tagged on at the send. Rare songs such as the emotionally charged \"Analog Kid\" and the butter masterpiece \"Natural Science\" are included. There in't much from the Signals-to-Presto era, which is especially unfortunate in Presto's case because that album has yet to be covered sufficiently on a live recording. But they, no one's never one hundred% pleased with a live album. this one does come close, though. The third disc, which is something of a bonus, was compiled from a show in London in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, during the A Farewell to Kings tour. The sound quality is as raw as it gets, which is a plus in that it means the energy is completely unadulterated. Here you can get the only live recordings of \"Cygnus X-one Book one,\" \"A Farewell to Kings,\" and \"Cinderella Man.\" The crowd's reaction to the segue between \"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" and \"Xanadu\" is one of the best moments on any live rock album. The CDs there also present an interesting contrast in the band's development over the years. Back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight the keyboards were simple, Peart's drum kit was a titanic thing, and hard rocking' riffs came hard and fast without relent. Geddy Lee's voice screamed at some high registers. Twenty years later, the band relies heavily on sequences synthesizers and backup vocals, and more melodically-savvy songs, with Lee singing at more relaxed octaves. (Compare the studio \"two thousand, one hundred and twelve\" to the live version there!)All in all, this is the best of Rush's four live albums. Hopefully the fifth will provide the Cynus X-one saga in its entirety. that'd be a dream come true.

Of course it is, except for the real thing. All World Levels are a Start with great power, but based on a limited number of songs. The authenticity of the Left Level Exit and Hand Display was refined by a combination function and perfect production function. But this is the real deal, with a lot of difficulty and dreams of great songs that can be made. There are three CDs in this collection. While the one-time release may not capture the actual size of Rush\u2019s work, this package does a great job. The first two albums (\"best\" Jones) borrowed heavily on the latest band results: Roll Bones, Computers, and Echo Testing. This \"Bravado\" song, The Stick It Out, and the \"Stick It Out\" march are just a few examples of the new songs that have been edited there. Many well-known classical activities are also present. Incredible versions of \"Broadcast\", \"Trees\", \"Free Freedom\", \"YYZ\" and the most popular band \"two million, one thousand, one hundred and twelve\". Unlike the version in Worldwide Phase, this performance leaves all parts of the song gone (while the old section has five minutes shorter). There is no doubt that this song is a distraction from the hard rock in the living space. Improved blasting and fast play, with acoustic solo in the third instalment, confirm epic status as one of the band\u2019s outstanding functions. \"Closer to the Heart\", the theme song of the much-needed concert was performed there again, and was marked with a funny jam when posted. Included are rare songs such as the emotional \"Analog Kid\" and the \"butter of Natural Sciences\" part. There\u2019s not much in the Sign-to-Presto era, which is very painful for Presto, because the album in\u2019t quite finished yet on live records. But look, no one has never been satisfied with a one hundred% live album. However, this one is really close. The third report is an added bonus and was compiled during a farewell to the royal tour of London in one thousand and nine hundred and seventy-eight. The sound quality is the oldest, which is advantageous because it means that the energy is completely clean. Here, you can find only live recordings of \"Cygnus X-one Book one\", \"Farewell to the King\" and \"Cinderella Man\". Audience response to the debate between \"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" and \"Xanadu\" is one of the best moments on any live song album. The CD where it also makes an interesting difference with the growth of the band over the years. As early as one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, the keyboard was very simple, the Peart drum kit was a big deal, and the hard stone repairs came quickly and quickly, without stopping. Geddy Lee's voice echoed at other high places. Twenty years later, the group relied heavily on the rhythm of things and the supporting voice, and more songs, and Li sang free octaves. (Compare the recording studio \"two million, one thousand, one hundred and twelve\" with the live version there!) Overall, this is the best of Rush's four albums.

Here you will find live recordings of \"Cygnus X-one Book one,\" \"A Farewell to Kings,\" and \"Cinderella Man.\" Man\u2019s reaction to the split between \u201cBy-Tor and Snow Dog\u201d and \u201cKindergarten\u201d is one of the best moments of any live rock album. The CDs there also show an interesting contrast in the team\u2019s progress over the years. Returning to a thousand, nine hundred and eighty -eight tapes was easy, the Peart drum kit was a titanic item, and the hard rock \u2019ruffs came hard and fast without giving up. Geddy Lee\u2019s voice echoed on some of the top notes. Twenty years later, the band relies heavily on sequences and storage of sounds, and very sweet songs, with Lee singing soft octaves. (Compare the \u201cTwo Thousand, One Hundred and Twelve\u201d live studios there!) Overall, this is the best of Rush\u2019s four live albums. Hopefully the fifth will give the Cynus X-one saga overall. it would be a dream.

In the 'ninetys, the tradition was kept alive by Teenage Fanclub and Matthew Sweet, who married Big Star and Badfinger to 'eightys college rock - there was also Jellyfish, who acted as if the 'eightys never existed - and in the two thousands, it's been the New Pornographers, an indie-centric act who fills the Fanclub's spot, and Detroit-based singer\/songwriter Brendan Benson, who is this decade's Matthew Sweet. Not that the Sweet-Benson analogy is one hundred percent accurate. For one thing, Benson does't favor the messy guitars and confessionals that marked Sweet's 'ninetys masterworks Girlfriend, Altered Beast, and one hundred% Fun, preferring tightly constructed songs and precisely detailed arrangements that emphasize this sweet melodies. Also, where Sweet's music tied neatly into the zeitgeist of the Alternative Nation of the early 'ninetys, Benson's music is deliberately classicist and proudly out of time, belonging neither to the sounds nor the fashion of the two thousands. That is, unless the defining characteristic of this decade truly is smart, sharp revivalism, from the Strokes through LCD Soundsystem, but even if that's the case, Benson is the their to a tradition that has never had much commercial (or critical) potency since Badfinger and the Raspberries developed it in the early 'seventys - too-shy, sensitive pop tunesmith who are also skilled record-makers but whose sense of pop remains rooted in the golden era of the 'sixtys, so it chiefly appeals to other pop geeks raised on similar sensibilities. Benson, like the New Pornographers and their leader, A. C. Newman, primarily plays to this small, insular cult that cherishes sugary melodies and knowing, preferential productions above all else, but the, like the Pornographers, breaks out of this small world thanks to a combination of skill, fortunate timing, and good luck. As the was working on this third album, Alternative to Love, this friendship with White Stripes mastermind Jack White intensified, leading to a collaboration (unreleased as of this writing), which raised Benson's profile considerably around the time of the album's spring release in two thousand and five.

And make no mistake, this is close to a great power pop record, due to Benson's strong writing and impeccable sense of craft, which are the primarily appeals for power pop fanatics in the first place. Perhaps it does't have the kinetic energy for sense of adventure that mark the genre's true classics from No Dice still Girlfriend, but Alternative to Love also exists in an era that's enamoured with the past and does't take many risks, and on those terms, it's the perfect power pop album for its decade.","overall":5,"summary":"Power Pop the way its meant to be played","unixReviewTime":1119571200,"reviewTime":"06 24, 2005"}

And like these famous partnerships, the solo efforts, while in some cases were't bad efforts at all, they just did't equal the heights the combinations did. While it would be a stretch to compare Dino Cazares and Burton C. Bell with Lennon and McCartney, in the world of metal, their collaboration far outshines solo efforts. Cazares' first Divine Heresy CD has some punch, but the follow-up, \"Bringer Of Plagues\", for all its ferocity just does't have the itunes and although this reviewer gave it a good review in hopes it would grow on me, I'm sorry to say it has't. In fact, it's pummelling without purpose and sadly bereft of hooks. So Dino hooks back up with Burton C. Bell, and suddenly the spark has been rekindled, very much so. It's been a wait for classic FF fans worth waiting for. \"Mechanize\" also brings along Gene Hoglan, possibly the greatest heavy drummer out there, with the possible exception of Dave Lombardo, and that's good company. Hoglan fires away with machine gun precision and can also cool it when necessary, which lots of thrash drummers seem to have lost the ability for interest in doing. But the real stars of course are the riffs and great synth programming of Rhys Fulber. This slab has musically squeezed in between \"Demanufacture\" and \"Obsolete\", which one may have thought impossible. While the claims on the CD promising new ground breaking territory karen't exactly accurate, \"Mechanize\" still proves that FF are the quintessential metal industrial band. A few tracks stand out, including \"Christploitation\", that has a few lead clicks in it, not a common thing for Fear Factory, and the ghostly \"Designing The Enemy\", which is the musical highlight. \"Final Exit\" fades away with Fulber's patented synth work, reminiscent of some of the more musical moments on the \"Demanufacture\/Remanufacture\" series. And after all, you should't own \"Demanufacture\" without its remix partner. It's high time Fear Factory give Rhys Fulber this due and feature him as a full blown member.

Three songs stand out as first rate. \"It's Up to You\" by Justin is the best on the album, and one of my favourite Moodies' songs of all time. It is loose, energetic rock 'n roll, and I remember a rock guitarist commenting what fun it is to play leads like Justin's on this song. Notice also, this gentle power chords during the \"we have got nothing to close\" section - brilliant! \"How is It We are Here\" is my favourite of all Mike Pinder's songs, thanks to the snappy beat of John Lodge's bass, Mike's brilliant use of electronic keyboards and Justin's guitar solo that seems to throw off fireworks. \"Dawning is the Day\" by Justin is also nice and tight. There is an extended alternating of tonic-dominant chords just before the final section of repeating \"Listen we think we have found you\", during which Graeme, the never-subtle and unobtrusive drummer, punctuates Justin's strums with off-beat wiggles of percussion that make you feel something is about to be born. Graeme can do that to you, even if you are not paying attention to him. Most of the other songs are enjoyable, if unexceptional, and it is pleasing to see Graeme, the shyest writer of the group, score with \"Don't You Feel Small?\" The original hit single of \"Question\" included a knock-out fast acoustic guitar introduction by Justin that in the album version is overwhelmed by the bombastic \"TA-DA\" orchestral sound that ruins this segment of the otherwise good song. \"Melancholy Man\" includes a spectacular electronic keyboard instrumental section that climaxes with a descending cascade of notes like a shower of falling stars that alone makes this otherwise dull song by Mike well worth listening to. John's \"Tortoise and Hare\" tries a little too earnestly to be a hard rocker, but I enjoy it anyway. \"Minstrel's Song\", John's other contribution is enjoyable only up to a point, and overstay its welcome. Ray Thomas' two songs are overly sweet and I usually skip over them. Overall, another very strong album from this unique band.","overall":4,"summary":"Five strong albums in a row - incredible!","unixReviewTime":1015113600,"reviewTime":"03 3, 2002"}

The title is unusual, because on this album, they found the sound of a \u201cbalanced\u201d band that is more interesting than any previous album. In particular the proper alignment between Mike Pinder and Justin Hayward has been breached. Mike's electric products are unique, playful and clever, and Justin has developed a wider range of sound effects on electric guitars than never before. There are three great songs. Justin\u2019s \u201cUp Up to You\u201d is the best on the album and is one of my favourite Moodis songs. It is a free and live rock music. Note that this soft-spoken energy in the \"We Have Nothing to Turn Off\" section - is great! \"How Is It We Here\" is one of my favourite Mike Pinder songs, thanks to John Lodge's quick basketball rhythms, Mike's efficient use of the electronic keyboard, and Justin's guitar. Extinguish the fire. Justin's \"Dawn is a day\" is also very beautiful. Before repeating the last part of \"Listen, we think we got it\", there is an extended element of stone change, during which Graham hits carelessly and invisibly when playing Justin's play makes you feel like something is about to be born. Graeme can do this to you, even if you don't pay attention to him. Most of the other songs are interesting, if not, it's good to see Graham, a shy writer on the band, learning notes \"Don't you think you're young?\" The singles single \"Question\" included Justin's rapid beat of a guitar, which was touched by the \"or -stral\" sound of \"TA-DA\" in the album, which ruined the scene of the beautiful song. \"The Man in Melancholy\" includes a beautiful section of the electronic keyboard device. John \u201cTortoise and Rabbit\u201d is a very difficult thing in trying to be a strong singer, but I still love it. \"Minstrel's Song\", some of John's contributions are just as fun and timeless as they are. Ray Thomas' two songs are very, very good, I always skip.

The title is confusing because the album sounds more \"balanced\" and appealing to them as a band than any previous album.

Mike's electronics are very diverse, playful and subtle, and Justin creates a wide range of sound effects on electric guitars compared to previous attempts. All three songs stand as the first level.

Justin's \"Dawn of the Day\" is also beautiful and strong. The last episode of \"Listen We Think We've Got It\" is preceded by an extended exchange of tonic notes, in which Graeme, an obscure and hidden drummer, inserts Justin's calls with off-beat wiggles so that you Feel that something is about to happen. be born. Graeme can do this to you, even if you ignore it. Most of the other songs are entertaining, if unusual, and fun to watch the band's shy writer Graeme score, \"Don't you feel young?\" The first hit song \"Question\" included a quick introduction to the version of Justin's album, which is proud of this unique song section with TA's orchestral sound. \"Melting Man\" includes a powerful section of electronic keyboard that ends with a stream of notes, like a bath of falling single stars that enables you to listen to this slow mic song. John's \"Turtle and Green\" is trying hard to be a worker, but I still enjoy it. \"Monster's Song\", another of John's contributions to this place and beyond.

I had never heard of Josh Joplin as Garrison Starr before hearing this track come out with the same name. In general, I prefer rare works because they are mostly guitarist, and there is nothing else, for example, \"Wide Water\" sings beautifully. The second track \"Peggy-O\" is very fashionable. If you do not know their previous records, it can easily be mistaken for a current folk song. Singing capappella \"Pretty Saro\" did't help me at all. The last song, the cover of The Smiths' one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six song \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\", seems inappropriate to be included in a group of traditional songs, I guess they love this song enough to cover it. It's more like a rock song than a traditional song, but even though I love the Smiths in the millennium, nine and a half times, I think I'd like this version of \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\" more than Morrissey's reason. in kind.","overall":4,"summary":"Nice somewhat modernized renditions of traditional folk songs.","unixReviewTime":1248307200,"reviewTime":"07 23, 2009"}

Without a doubt, this disc is one of the best of Elton's career. The first thing a listener will notice is the intense clarity of the sound on this disc: every instrument, every nuanced vocal, every moment literally \"pops\" out of your speakers. Elton wisely dumped longtime producer and music-murderer Chris Thomas who flattened everything into AM oblivion. Instead, we have a Greg Penny, who, after working with such artists as of.d. lang, knows what sound is about. This disc comes alive with life and sound through this sparkling production. The next thing you'll notice is some serious songwriting there. This in't the goofy Elton & Bernie that gave us \"I Am Your Robot.\" We find songs with deep meaning -- \"Believe,\" which is a philosophy; \"House,\" a stark, haunting tribute to John Lennon; \"Belfast,\" a poignant sport-on tribute to Ireland and the turmoil tearing it apart; and even the title track which is about as fitting a British anthem as \"God Save The Queen,\" with not-so-subtle messages from Elton: \"Here's my middle finger\/I had forty years of spain and nothing to hold on to.\"The lyrics are touching and deep; the songs are extremely well-crafted. The icing on the cake is the sheer musicianship. Penny's production allows the listener to come inside the music. A world of Beatles-esque strings and Elton-only piano rules in this world. This disc is so maddeningly underrated that it burns every time I hear it. The only hit track was \"Believe,\" which is certainly a standout, but this disc is brimming with gems that were ignored. This disc, the second one after Elton's recovery, is simple and unabashed in its clarity. It's clear that Elton wants you to experience talent and music in it's purest form. And after listening to this disc, you rest assured that it's only Made In England.","overall":5,"summary":"Easily one of Elton's best recordings ever","unixReviewTime":1101081600,"reviewTime":"11 22, 2004"}

We find songs that have a deeper meaning - \"Believe\", which is philosophical; \"House\", a vivid and memorable exhibition by John Lennon; The title track is suitable for a British national anthem as \"Bless the Queen\", and there's a vague message from Elton: \"This is my middle finger \/ I live in Spain for forty years, nothing stuck.\" The songs are touching and profound; the songs are well done. The icing on the cake is a pure musical gift. Penny\u2019s work allows the listener to get into music. This country is a world of Beatles strings and Elton's different piano rules. This record is so low that it burns every time I hear it. The most important song is \"Believe\", which is great, but this record is full of unseen gems.

We Hear Now was an okay track to start off the album with. World's Most Dangerous(feat Nemesis) is good. Let's Ride has Ja wrapping like Twista on the track and it want a bad album. Nigguz Theme(which borrows from NWA's Efilfourzaggin) is cool. The Suicide freestyle with Case is great because it shows what Ja is capable of. Holla Holla was a good first single and Murda four Life(feat Memphis Bleek) is a dope follow up. E-Dub And Ja(feat Erick Sermon) is dope collabo by itself.

Its Murda was a great match up which featured DMX and Jay-z(before Ja fell out with DMX). Kill Em All also features Jay-z-- the only thing the's on the hook. Only Begotten Son is Ja dripping this father a new one for not being is this life as a kid. As for flaws I cant recall any. Bottom Line: Venni Vetti Vecci is Ja's best work to date.

I\u2019m not mad at him for jumping to pop, I apologize to anyone who leaves these fans in the window to do so quickly and remove the task. I take care of him a little bit by popping. This door will be returned to anyone who remembers what it is and not what it is. Common Tracks: HERE ARE THE MOST DAKEROUS, NIGGUZ THEME, SELF-CONFIDENS, STORY, STORY, E-DUB AND JA, CHILDREN, TIME and WI competition. PS: If you did\u2019t like Ja, that\u2019s cool. If you never found him while you were contemptuous it turned out beautiful but you just killed it because Fifty Cent modernized it then turn around and put it back fifty years ago. The guaranteed group behavior that your kids regularly display should stop!","overall":5,"summary":"Ja before he became pop","unixReviewTime":1159747200,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2006"}

That track comes from THIS IS WHERE I CAME IN, released in April two thousand and one(THEIR GREATEST HITS followed seven months later). MASSACHUSETTS is from HORIZONTAL, originally released in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight on the Atco label. The song also appeared on GOLD, released on RSO in 'seventy-six. WORLD and WORDS are from HORIZONTAL also. DON'T FORGET TO REMEMBER is from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's CUCUMBER CASTLE(minus Robin Gibb). I'VE JUST GOTTA GET A MESSAGE TO YOU is from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight's IDEA, also appearing on GOLD. From the SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER soundtrack album, released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, are STAYIN' ALIVE,HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE and NIGHT FEVER. Also on SNF but originally from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six's CHILDREN OF THE WORLD is YOU SHOULD BE DANCING. Also from COTW is LOVE SO RIGHT. From one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five's MAIN COURSE is the disco-flavored JIVE TALKIN'. From one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine's SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN are TRAGEDY,LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT and TOO MUCH HEAVEN(the latter track was released as a single before the album). From one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven's E. S. P. is YOU WIN AGAIN. In addition to JIVE TALKIN',TRAGEDY,STAYIN' ALIVE,YOU SHOULD BE DANCING,NIGHT FEVER and LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT are ideal for discotheque play since all those songs were recorded during the disco era of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. If this album had one for two new songs on it,I'd purchase it. I won't since I already own THEIR GREATEST HITS. Some copies of this album are accompanied by a bonus DVD containing some of the Bee Gees' live performances. I dedicate this album to the memories of Maurice and the Bee Gees' father Hugh Gibb.","overall":5,"summary":"Chart-toppers!","unixReviewTime":1100044800,"reviewTime":"11 10, 2004"}

Pretty amazing for a guy who achieved no real commercial success while the was active and has now been dead for over thirty years.\"Pink Moon\" was the last album Drake recorded. It's a haunting experience to listen to it now with the benefit of hindsight, knowing that the artist was only a couple years from taking this own life (though many will argue whether this death was a suicide for just an accidental overdose). According to Drake's producer\/engineer John Wood, \"Pink Moon\" was laid down late at night over two evenings in early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two and featured almost no overdubs. The tracks average roughly two minutes in length, and the whole thing clocks in under half an hour, but the brevity and immediacy only add to the emotional impact. The more complex arrangements that marked Drake's first two albums, \"Five Leaves Left\" and \"Bryter Layter,\" are gone. What remains are Nick's soft, wistful voice, this guitar, and a little piano piece on the title track. The album is drenched in loneliness, disconnection, and the hard-earned advice of someone who was learning the difficult lessons of a world with which the could not scope. It is also dotted with signs of Drake's desire to depart this life; the four-line lyric to \"Know\" sounds an awful lot like a goodbye note. At the same time, tracks such as \"From the Morning\" reveal someone still table to find beauty and hope around him, even if the was only finding it for others and not for himself.

I think few would argue that the best music is honest and offers us a look inside the performer. \"Pink Moon\" certainly meets that description, providing a window into an injured soul.

For someone who has not achieved real success during this career and has now been dead for more than thirty years, it is truly amazing. \"Pink Moon\" is the last album recorded by Drake. Looking back, listening to this song is now an unforgettable experience, because you know that the artist is only a few years away from the send of this life (although many people argue that this death was just a coincidence and led to suicide). According to Drake producer \/ engineer John Wood, \"Pink Moon\" was placed at midnight both in early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, with almost no dubbing. The normal length of the trail is about two minutes, and the whole process is less than half an hour, but the simplicity and indirectness only increase the emotional impact. Complex arrangements marking Drake's first two albums \"Five Leaves Left\" and \"Bryter Layter\" are no more. What is left is Nick's soft, passionate voice, this guitar and a short piano in the title song. This album is full of loneliness, division, and hard-earned advice for someone learning difficult lessons in a world that cannot be fixed. It is also embellished with signs that Drake wants to leave this life; the four-line word \u201cknow\u201d sounds very much like a farewell note. At the same time, collections of items such as \"From the Morning\" reveal that a person is still looking for beauty and hope next to him, even if it is for the benefit of other people and not for themselves. I would prefer some songs, but \"Pink Moon\" is a mixed experience; the perfect kind of traditional music and the sad image of a young man in an emotional state cannot be corrected when this section is performing well. I think there are very few people who will argue that it is the most authentic music, and let\u2019s see the heart of the factor. The \u201cpink moon\u201d certainly fits this description, providing a window to the wounded soul.

Both lyrically and musically, the album takes us into an alternate world, a world populated by young women who are fatally attracted to seriously flawed men, but this does't seem to bother them. They not only accept it, they revel in it. Although most of the songs are built around this theme, redundancy is avoided because the characters are vividly detailed and the musical presentations are diverse. I would like to mention that any comparisons I make to musical genres for other artists must be considered approximations; the music on this album is highly original and frankly, rather difficult to describe. In the opener and title song, \"Born To Die\", Lana sings a ballad with a world-weariness and fatalism that calls to mind Marianne Faithfull for even Marlene Dietrich: \"Feet don't fail me now\/Take me to the finish line. Choose your last words\/This is the last time\/Cause you and I, we were born to die\". The next track, my favourite, \"Off To The Races\", is completely different, an upbeat ship-hop track. In this song a girl with \"a Las Vegas past\" is kept and well-tended by a gangster type who \". loves me with every beat of this cocaine heart\". This relationship would seem dysfunctional to most, but the picture Lana paints makes it sound valid, desirable and a lot of fun. In the bomber \"Video Games\", she coaxes her young lover, \"Tell me all the things you wanna do\/I heard that you like the bad girls honey, is that true?\" We return to ship-hop and enter the playground of the wealthy in \"National Anthem\": \"Money is the anthem of success\/So before we go out, what's your address?. God you're so handsome\/Take me to the Hamptons\". \"Carmen\" in the ballad by that name is one character not preoccupied with relationships. Her problems are different: \"The boys, the girls\/They all like Carmen. Doesn't have a problem\/Lyin' to herself\/'Cause her liquor's top shelf\". \"Million Dollar Man\" is sung in a style that I would have to call forty's for fifty's blues (very interesting vocal there), and the reason she is blue is, as she tells her man, \"You're screwed up and brilliant\/You look like a million-dollar man\/So why is my heart broke?\"The total effect of the album would be depressing except that the interesting lyrics and Lana's varied vocals are such a delight that any sadness is mitigated. Then too, why feel sorry for someone who does't feel sorry for herself? Lana's characters are content with the lives they are living. I hope Lana gets to make a second album because I certainly want to see where she takes us next.","overall":5,"summary":"Astonishing Debut","unixReviewTime":1336176000,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2012"}

Aren't you tired of talking about sex?\" \"Girl, what are you waiting for?\" \"If you want me to wet you, we don't have to go to the lake pool.\" Good guy. Satirical activities are not always interesting. I just hope the fans know they agree with them. The sound of splashing liquids and the moans of women is not what I think is the best ending. Hey teacher: Common thoughts of teachers. \"I will never speak nonsense in class again.\" Yes, at least some senior students will feel safe. But I don't know what the teacher is like. All the little pieces: Why can't I find the songs for this song? It could be a survivor's song, the only good song on the album. Twin Ball: A theme that ends with a terrifying irony. sexkittens relax, preparing for the next day. In addition to sex and drugs, there is more rock music. But it is possible that one person has bought this, and they are unable to control their thoughts and send different grapes of rape. But they. Support this group. I always want to know what it is like to have AIDS. Other than that, just buy Lil'Kim for Franz Ferdinand's albums. At least Franz Ferdinand will not run away and try to be embarrassed.

Want to climb mountains, want to climb all canals. Swim across the gorge, speaking symbolically. The fact is that music seems to be produced at a rate where such an instrument is not needed. Who else sees the situation worse when the jet enters? Jason Hill, who looks like Ozzy Osborne, talks about who Jehovah was with all the women and thinks Pharaoh is Pharaoh. (Pharaoh gave birth to more than fifty women and had more than seventy children. Could the have more?) \"Louis XIV\": \"I am a weapon of mass destruction.\" Yes. AIDS and apathy are weapons of mass destruction. Why is this record included? It does't matter if you whisper, \"Who is your father?\" And the drums are very similar and the sounds come together. In \"Finding True Love is Blind\", the contract becomes a game as it eventually ends up looking for someone with big mountains and open space. Yes, they say it blinds you, even if it helps you. What else do you think when things say: \"Hey, carrots up, I want to squeeze you in every way until you bleed.\" Glass and all your books and I want a stupid girl to give me all that dirty look. Have you come to any conclusions yet? Moving forward Three \"Pepperdoll\" does more than just cover the song, the grape variety is slightly larger than the women she meets. \"If you want pure fun, fly a kite,\" the says. I see you've never seen Kung Pao! We were afraid the would shake us from behind. We may be so shocked that one day we see him having sex in the park in front of a family playing with this family's Labrador.four. I know blasphemy is wrong but I doubt that when the song \"God Kills the Queen\" we are talking to the people there about this fire. Letter to Dominic: Ah, what is this? My guess is that Sexton should't die after running out of batteries with different users. \"I am writing to tell you that you are full \/ yet know that I want to choke on petrol so that my mouth can be filled so that you can be tied up and stoned.\" If this is really a strength, I will really kill them for attacking their house. Illegal Tender: Really Illegal How many lovers can rent porn without a camera? I had to ask a man if the thought there was more to a moment of sex for women? There is a sense that they are the cause of life. However, once we enter, there is nothing but death. I wonder if Gina Jameson has a server who commented on this album, because she should be referenced today and in the industry. Promise: \"Okay boy. Don't you get tired of talking about sex?\" \"Little girl, what are you really waiting for?\" \"We don't have to go to the pool if you want me to wet you.\" Oh boy. Humor gets a little funny every minute. I just hope the fans know why they're joining them. I did't think the sound of splashing liquid and the woman's groaning had a good ending. Hello Teacher: A typical story of a school teacher. \"I won't talk about coming to the classroom again.\" However, distinguished students will feel safe. I don't know about teachers. All the little pieces: Why can't I find the songs for this song? It could be at least a surviving song, the only fun song on the album. Ball of Twins: Finish the theme in a terrific simulation. Sex Cotton is all taking a summary and getting ready for the next day. There's more to rock and roll than just sex and drugs. But there is a good chance that the people who are buying it are the jones who can control their minds and send out various wrap haiku for promotion. But look. Support this group. I always have water to know how AIDS feels. Also, only buy Lil Kim with Franz Ferdinand's album. At least Franz Ferdinand does't run and tries to complain to this ancestors.

Who else sees the situation worsening when Jet enters? Ozzy Osbourne who looks like Jason Hill talking about what every woman the thinks is Pharaoh. (Pharaoh had more than fifty wives and had more than seventy children, probably more.) \"Louis XIV\": \"I am a destructive weapon.\" Yes. AIDS and apathy are weapons of mass destruction.

In terms of \u201cFinding True Love is blind\u201d, it was agreed to be this hobby because it would send up to the liking of anyone with a big mountain and open access.

We would be so sad to even picture a day in the garden with dark sex in front of a family playing catch-up with their labrador.four family. I know the insult is wrong but I doubt when this song is called \u201cGod killed the queen\u201d, we are talking about this fire with those present. Si Shan. Letter to Dominique: Yes, what is it about? I think it was a faulty sexton that died after it was depleted by various user batteries. \"I wrote to tell you that you were happy.

The satire encounters a little joke every minute. I just hope fans know what they\u2019re getting into. The sound of liquid dripping and a woman sighing was not really my idea of a good ending. Hey Teacher: Imaginary regular school teacher. \"I won't speak in class again.\" That way, at least respectable students will be safe. I don't know the teacher. All Small Categories: Why can't I see the lyrics of this song? It may be the salvation song somehow, the only good song on the album. Ball of Twine: End the topic with a bad irony. The sexkittens do it quickly and prepare for the next day. There is more to Rock and roll than Sex and Drugs. But chances are both consumers are the same people who can\u2019t really control their minds and can send different haiku incentives. But they are. Support this group.

One of the most polemic Madonna`s albums, \"Erotica\" is also one of the weakest, providing some controversy due to its taboo subjects (at least at the time it came out) but failing to engage and surprise on a musical level. Most of the moments there are weak and dated, consisting of quasi trip-hop rhythms, club-oriented tracks and pop\/jazz\/spoken word whispers that recall the early nineties dance scene but karen`t very engaging for captivating songs. Although somewhat stylish and with a cool atmosphere, this record is too flat, linear, unsurprising and forgettable. It seems like a collection of fillers and of-sides with two for three decent songs that appear randomly (the title track and \"Rain\", the latter being completely out of place there). Madonna`s image and attitude usually come before her music, and in \"Erotica\" this is more than evident. The record is also too long and by the middle of it all the songs seem to sound the same, generating a bland and generic pop album.","overall":1,"summary":"Unecessary","unixReviewTime":1079308800,"reviewTime":"03 15, 2004"}

Also, as a big Ghostface fan, I have to admit that \"Walletproof Wallets\" are not the best work. After listening to it a few times, it\u2019s easy to understand why this album is still unknown (Oh, I don\u2019t know Know Ghost to stop at this).

The \"walletproof wallet\" does't seem to be between AWESOME \"Supreme Clientele\" and Dope \"Pretty Toney\" - I scratched my head!

At this point, all have failed. But has failure stopped any of them? Has failure kept inspired listeners from forming their own bands and trying to bring the world to a thumpworthy halt with raw guitars and girls mimicking orgasms? No, failure has failed to abide its implicit promise. That's a downer, dude. For real. One definition of insanity is failing and then trying the same tactic over and over again. If such a definition contains any truth at all, it must mean that America is one big psychopath. Which, by the way, seems to be the message of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, a relatively youngish band reflective of New York's newfound interest in the value of spanking out, throwing up and still managing to get back to work on time the very same morning. Faced with a restrictive musical environment which mandates that Britney Spears and Marc Anthony safely make millions of dollars while the real artists are doomed to dumpster diving and shilling for pennies outside Madison Square Gardens, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have firmly promised that they're not going to take it anymore. Millions actually believe in them. Not that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are doing anything exceptionally new for earth-shaking. To the contrary, comparisons to P. J.

Steve Ferrone (AWB) on drums, the regretted Hiram Bullock on guitars, and Philippe Saisse, who came as a revelation on this albumMasques, playing the keyboards in an impressive fashion.

Once again, Jarreau shows good taste at the time of doing cover versions, just like the did with Chick Corea's \"Spain\", for Bernie Taupin's \"Your song\". So why only three stars ? Simple : the whole is too overproduced. Jarreau's voice is often swamped, overpowered by the instruments and sound. At times you can't even decipher what the is saying, and you have to go to the lyrics to get it. While that is not surprising for many artists, it is for him, who has always been known for this voice power and profile.

People blamed him in the past for not really getting deep with this lyrics like Styles was table to do. So now Jada does get deeper, but the does it a little too much on 'Kiss of Death'. After the intro and the crappy \"What You So Mad At?\" we arrive at \"Shine\". This song is the first alright song on the album. Snoop and DJ Quick guest star on this one over a funky beat. \"Bring You Down\" is next, but it is a weak song. \"Time's Up\" is luckily the song that follows. This is one of the great songs on the album, featuring Nate Dogg on the hook. \"Why\" is next and luckily is another great song. Jada tasks why all these things in the world today are happening. Next comes \"U Make Me Wanna\" a very poppy song featuring Mariah Carey. After that comes \"Hot Sauce To Go\". I don't know why people hate this song. While it in't the best, it is better than a few songs on this album. \"Real Hip-Hop\" follows with Jada rhyming with Lox member Sheek Louch over an old school beat. And now we come to my personal favourite, \"Shoot Outs\". This song has the best beat on the whole album and is overall the best song in my opinion. Jada and Styles do their infamous rhyme trade about battling enemies. \"Still Feel Me\" follows with good verses but a weak beat. \"By Your Side\" follows which is an okay song, but is shippable. \"Gettin It In\" comes next and features Kanye giving the beat and a guest verse. The song is cool made and both wrappers give great verses. \"Air It Out\" is just boring and not worth much. \"Welcome To D-Block\" is a cool song featuring Eminem and The Lox. Em produces the beat and is on the chorus and one verse. Everyone drops cool verses so it is listenable. The title track follows. While it's not one of my favourites, but it is listenable. \"I'm Goin Back\" ends the album on a good point luckily. Jada basically goes back in time and makes things right. Overall, Jada has improved a bit since this debut, but the needs to learn how to do what Styles did with this debut; give a little bit of gangsta and gentleman.","overall":4,"summary":"Good Songs, But Doesn't Compare To Styles Debut","unixReviewTime":1094256000,"reviewTime":"09 4, 2004"}

In the past, people accused him of not understanding songs as deeply as the styles. And now Jada has gotten deeper, but has done very little in the \"Kiss of Death\". After the introduction and crappy \"What You So Mad At?\" We reached \"Shine\". This song is the first proper song on the album. Snoop and the fast-paced DJ made a guest appearance at the show with fashion hats. The next \"bring down\", but a weak song. Fortunately, \"It's Time\" is the next song. This is one of the biggest songs on the album, and Nate Dogg was selected. \"Why\" is next, and fortunately another great song. Jada explains why all these things are happening in the world today. Next up is \"You Make Me Want\" a popular song, Mariah Carey. Then \"Hot to go\". I don't know why people hate this song. Although not, it's better than a few songs on this album. After \"The Truth of Hip Hop\", Jada made a sound with Lox member Sheek Louch on classic beats. Now we will love my \"gun\". This song is the best hit in the whole album, and in my opinion it's also a good song. Jada and Styles engage in unfriendly alliances when they fight enemies. \"You Heard Me\" is closely followed by beautiful verses, but with a weak rhythm. Followed by \"On Your Side\", this is a good song, but it can be posted. \"Gettin It In\" is closely followed, with Kanye leading the beat singer and the appearance of the guests. The production of this song is cool, and both of these threats provide beautiful verses. \"Take it out\" is boring and worthless. \"Welcome to D-Block\" is a cool song composed by Eminem and Lox. Em produces beat and is in chorus and poetry. Everyone puts this cool verse down, so it makes sense. The title track is as follows. While it\u2019s not my favourite thing, it sounds good. Fortunately, \"I'm back\" ended the album with a positive note. Jada can go back in time and do things. Overall, Jada has improved since her inception, but she has to learn how to do the things Styles did when they were visible; Give it to the gangsters and ladies.","overall":4,"summary":"Good Songs, But Doesn't Compare To Styles Debut","unixReviewTime":1094256000,"reviewTime":"09 4, 2004"}

And now we come to the part where we talk about the middle ground. This song is the best rhythm in the whole album and in my opinion it is the best song. Jada and Style build their business into a rhetoric that has a bad reputation for fighting enemies. \"Still feel me\" is with good verses but a little defeat. \"By Your Side\" follows the correct song, but it is posted. \"Getten at In\" comes next and Khan plays to the rhythm and rhythm of the guests. The song is well done and both threats provide beautiful verses. \"Air out\" is just boring and inappropriate. \"Welcome to the D-Block\" is a great song featuring Eminem and The Lux. M produces rhythm and is in course in one verse. Everyone throws cool verses so that it can be heard. The title track is as follows. Although not one of my favourites, the listens. \"I'm going back\" ends the album with a good point. Jada goes back in time and fixes things. Overall, Jada has made little progress since its inception, but needs to learn how to create the style it did for the first time. Give me a little gangster and a gentleman.","overall":4,"summary":"Good Songs, But Doesn't Compare To Styles Debut","unixReviewTime":1094256000,"reviewTime":"09 4, 2004"}

People have accused him in the past of not really writing as deeply into these words as Style does at the table. So now Jada is deeper, but the Lord is small in the \u2018Kiss of Death\u2019. Intro then and crude \"Why are you mad?\" we go to \"Shine\". This song is the first accepted song on the album. Snoop and DJ Fast host this one more than a fun beat. \"Download\" is next, but this song is weak. \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d is just as good the next song. This is one of the biggest songs on the album, starring Nate Dogg. \u201cReason\u201d is next and fortunately is another great song. Jada activities are why all this is happening in the world today. This was followed by \u201cMake Me Wanna\u201d which is a very sweet song featuring Mariah Carey. Then comes the \u201chot sauce to go\u201d. I don\u2019t know why people hate this song. Although not the best, it\u2019s better than the few songs on this album. \u201cReal Hip-Hop\u201d follows Jada singing along with Lox member Sheek Louch beating up an old school. And now we come to my own choice, \u201cShoot Outs\u201d. This song has the best beat of the whole album and is generally the best song in my opinion. Jada and Styles are doing their bad business in rhythm about fighting the enemy. \u201cStill Me Feel\u201d follows the beautiful verses but weakly beat. \u201cYour side\u201d is next to a good song, but it can be moved. \u201cGettin It In\u201d follows Kanye giving the beat and verse to the guests. The song is cool and both recordings provide great verses. \u201cAir It Out\u201d is boring and inexpensive. Welcome to D-Block \u201dis a cool song by Eminem and The Lox. Em makes a beat and is in a song and a verse. Everyone throws in cold verses to listen to. The track track follows. Although not one of my favourites, it can be listened to. \u201cI\u2019m Going Back\u201d ends the album in a good place fortunately. Jada usually goes back in time and improves things. Overall, Jada has improved a bit since the first time, but the need to know how to do what Styles did in this first game; quite gangsta and conventional.","overall":4,"summary":"Good Songs, But Doesn't Compare To Styles Debut","unixReviewTime":1094256000,"reviewTime":"09 4, 2004"}

Now as I understand, Aphrodite's Child came from France, but Evangelos Papathanassiou (Vangelis) came from Southern Greece.

A number of things set this album apart from the rest of Petra's catalogue. For starters, Louie Weaver is absent from this project. He was released by the group for reasons that are still undisclosed. Secondly, there is the glaring omission of keyboards on this disc (a good move as far as this album is concerned). Lastly, this album was produced by Peter Furler of the Newsboys, and the did a grand job of it. The first song on the album is the title track, and it kicks things off cloud and proud. \"All About Who You Know,\" \"Stand\" and \"Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda,\" keep the Gospel train a'rocking as Bob Hartman shows that the has't lost anything in the guitar department and John Schlitt's vocals are still very well intact. The next song, \"Perfect World,\" is my personal favourite. The rest of the album is solid Christian rock, with things slowing down only slightly for \"Till Everything I Do\" and \"Sacred Trust\" finish off the album. Old fans of Petra will notice the musical changes almost immediately, what with a much heavier sound than Petra's never produced. With Furler at the helm, the group has taken its older and wiser sound to a new level. Gone are the soft and wonderful itunes such as \"Don't Let Your Heart Be Hardened\" and \"Why Should The Father Bother.\" This album is more akin to old songs like \"Sleeping Giant\" and \"He Came, He Saw, He Conquered,\" but even they should be considered mild rockers compared to the bulk of this album. If you've never heard Petra before, for only know them for their softer itunes which get heavier airplay on most Christian stations, this in't the album that I'd start my collection with. \"Wake Up Call\" and \"This Means War\" are two great starting points for any Petra collection. After those albums, I'd go with one of the older, Greg X. Volz fronted albums. After that, \"No Doubt\" for \"God Fixation\" will give you a decent feel for the group in later years.

The next song \"Perfect World\" is my favourite. One album is a solid Christian rock, only \"until everything I do\" and \"Sacred Trust\" which slowed down a bit at the send of the album. Old Petra fans will immediately see a change in music, a sound harder than Petra never produced. Under Furler's management, the band took its old and wise voice to a new level. Gone are the soft and beautiful songs such as \"Don't let your heart cache\" and \"Why bother?\" The album is very similar to older songs such as \"Sleeping Giant\" and \"He came, the saw, the won\", but compared to the content of this album, it should also be considered as a low-key music singer. If you haven't heard of Petra before, you only know that their soft iTunes plays a lot on Christian radio stations. This is not the first album I've never collected. \"Wake up call\" and \"This means War\" are the first two beautiful articles in any Petra series. After these albums, I will select the old album by Greg X. Volz. Then, the \"no doubt\" of \"Shending\" will give you a sense of the band's value in your years to come. So I think you are ready to take part in a tour of one of the leading Christian music groups. The album ended the band with a high profile.","overall":4,"summary":"Petra's Heaviest Album","unixReviewTime":1154563200,"reviewTime":"08 3, 2006"}

Many things are different on this album than Petra\u2019s book. Initially, Louie Weaver was not on this project. It was released by the group for reasons not yet disclosed. Second, there is an obvious exception to the tape on this tape (a great lift as far as this album is concerned). Finally, this album was produced by Newsboys \u2019Peter Furler and did the work.

The rest of the door is the solid rock of Christianity, and they slow down a bit until the send of the album \u201cAll I Do\u201d and \u201cHoly of Holies\u201d. Former Petra fans will immediately notice the changes in the music, it has a heavier voice than Petra did. Leading Furler, the team took their bigger and smarter voice to a new level. They came out on soft and amazing iTunes like \"Don't Dry Your Heart\" and \"Why Daddy Will Explode It.\" This album is very similar to previous songs like \u201cSleeping Sleep\u201d and \u201cHe came, the saw, the won,\u201d but it should also be considered a light bias compared to most of this album. If you haven\u2019t heard about Petra before, just let them know that their soft iTunes gets a lot of air on most Christian stations, it\u2019s not the album I\u2019ll start my collection with. \u201cCall of Duty\u201d and \u201cThis Battle Means\u201d are the two starting points for each Petra collection. After those albums, I will follow one of the older, Greg X. Volz previous albums. After that, the \u201cno doubt\u201d of \u201cGod\u2019s improvement\u201d will give you a good feel for the team in the years to come.

First of all, Louis Vuitton is not in the project. You have been released by the team for unknown reasons. Second, there is a clear black of keyboards on this disk (a good step towards this album). Finally, the album was produced by Peter Furler of Newsboys, and Jehovah did a great job with it.

The next song \"Perfect World\" is my favourite. Another album is The Solid Rock of Christianity, in which old fans of the slow-moving \"Till Everything I Do\" and \"Sacred Trust\" Petra will immediately notice a change in music, much heavier than Petra. Leave with the sound. With Ferrer taking the lead, the band has taken on its old and very smart voice. There are no longer soft and wonderful songs like \"Don't Let Your Heart Be Hard\" and \"Why Daddy Should Suffer.\" The album is almost like old songs like \"Sleeping Giant\" and \"He Came, He Saw, He Conquered,\" but still the should be considered a young singer for most of the album. If you've never heard of Petra before, because you know her only through her soft melodies that are heavily streamed on many Christian channels, this is not the album I started collecting for my collection. will do. \"Wake Up Call\" and \"This Mean War\" are the first two great places in any Petra collection. After those albums, I was with an old man, Greg X. Wales waited for the albums. After all, \"no doubt\" for \"God's correction\" will give you a good feeling for the team for years to come.

I am a music dork who enjoys listening to all kinds of music on an emotional and intellectual level, but Math Rockers always seem to be purely intellectual and the Battles appear to be no different. They can sure rock the interesting time signatures and the experimental vocoder stuff, but they seem to black any genuine emotion. I don't really feel much outside of my own head when I listen to Mirrored. I'm no lover of Math Rock so it's hard for me to really come up with a comparison of what this band sound like but I'll give it a shot. They're kind of a middle ground between electronic music and post punk stuff like Wire. They're very repetitive like electronica but they're also concerned with texture like Wire. They are also very precise which is another characteristic of Wire's later albums. But they're also kind of peppy. The vocals are indecipherable but they sound like a demented version of the It's Small World ride from Disneyland. They also kind of sound like the vocals on The Knife's Silent Shout but not as dark. It's also vaguely danceable, but I could't see myself busting a move to this. What sticks out the most on this album is the drumming. Former Helmet drummer John Stanier adds a really sturdy backbone to the most of these compositions. His drumming not only adds the beat, but it adds a good bit of texture to most of these songs. This album proves how versatile Stanier is. He can do the heavy and brutal drumming from Helmet for the experimental stuff for Battles. Music can be intriguing on a purely intellectual level. Mirrored is not something I'm liable to listen to on a regular basis, but it's interesting. I would say it's a three and a half star album.

I\u2019m a musical idiot, I like to listen to all kinds of music on the emotional and psychological level, but mathematical rock musicians always seem to be only psychological, and the Wars seem to be different. Sure they can shake things up with interesting signatures and voice testing, but they seem to obscure any real feelings. When I listen to Maling, I don't feel much better. I'm not a fan of Matt Rock, so it's hard for me to compare the sounds of this band, but I'll try. It\u2019s a middle ground between electronic music and pop-punk music like Wire. They are very repetitive like electronic music, but they also ignore the wire-like texture. They are also very accurate, one of the hallmarks of Wire's latest albums. But they are also interested. The human voice is unreadable, but it sounds like a crazy version of Disneyland's \"Little World\". They also sound a little like the voices of the people in the Conference of Peace, but not like the darkness. It can be endless, but I don't see myself working hard at it. The most important part of this album is the drum beat. Former headmaster John Stanier added really strong bones to many of these works. His song not only increased the beat, but also added character to some of the songs. This plaque testifies to Staniel's ingenuity. You can play the hard and cruel drum in the trials of War. Music can be fun at the level of intelligence. Simulation is not something I always listen to, but it is very interesting. I would say this is a disc with three and a half stars.

It's been dancing incredibly well, but I don't see myself pushing forward. The strongest part of this album is the drums. Former drummer John Steiner added a really strong comeback to these songs. Not only do their drums add to the rhythm, but they also add beautiful texture to many of these songs. This album demonstrates just how flexible Steiner is. You can make heavy and brutal drums from helmets with Beatles test kits. Music can only appeal to the mind. Feature is not something I should always listen to, but it's interesting.

She mixes funk, soul, for&b, hard rock and pop and gets a wonderful effect. From \"Like A Feather\" (with her voice mixed way back) to \"Everybody Got Their Something\", Nikka rocks as if she were the love child of Janis Joplin and Tina Turner. She has a huge range and wonderful vocal power, but wisely she does't overuse either of those assets. One moment she's soft and sensitive, her voice plaintively calling out for lost love, the next, she's wailing at the top of her lungs with danger. And what makes Costa's vocal ability so impressive is that she goes from one extreme to the other, yet while she lets us see the transition she never shows us the cracks in between. There used to be a category of singer in the sixty called \"blue eyed soul\". for caucasian artists who could rock out with soulful music, understand it and not get lost. Costa has that down pat. she belongs in the pantheon of other legendary blue eyed soul artists like Dusty Springfield, Janis Joplin and Annie Lennox. A stand out track is \"So Have I For You\". chilling, emotional, heartfelt. The only reason this whole affair in't a five star experience is the production.

Greiner \"onlyget1shot\"","helpful":[7,13],"reviewText":"The debut album \"Daughtry\" by Chris Daughtry and this band is a solid building point after coming off of this success as an unlikely rocker type finalist on the Fox network's \"American Idol\". If you're an \"Idol\" fan, you are probably no stranger to this bald-headed North Carolina native and this rock-based but highly versatile musical style. And in this first release, Daughtry is more than effective. The album starts off strong with a rock tune packed with emotion in \"It's Not Over\". From there, Daughtry and this band move on to take the listener on a ride through everything from power ballads to hard rock to songs with a bit of a poppy for even country edge to them. To break it down, I'd rate the songs something like this:one. It's Not Over - three.five\/fifty-two. Used To - three.five\/fifty-three. Home - three\/fifty-four. Over You - four\/fifty-five. Crashed - three.five\/fifty-six. Feels Like Tonight - three\/fifty-seven. What I Want - four\/fifty-eight. Breakdown - three\/fifty-nine. Gone - three.five\/five hundred and ten. There and Back Again - three.five\/five hundred and eleven. All These Lives - three.five\/five hundred and twelve. What About Now - three\/fiveThe keys to this album are two fold. First off, Daughtry's voice proves to be more than sufficient to belt out an array of catchy and powerful lyrics.

I was told this was an average album with great production but lyrically could't hold up to any other G-Unit member. I was also told that Joe Budden's album was better (which i believe it is, but Game's in't as bad as its being made out to be). Game's album has several high points. Yes, the production does carry some tracks through that otherwise would've been trash (\"Put You On The Game\", \"How We Do\", \"Higher\") but Game shines lyrically on so many other tracks its hard to notice. The uptempo feel-good fifty Cent collabo \"Hate It for Love It\" comes to mind in this category, seeing as how Game outshines this G-Unit partner throughout the entire track. Other tracks where Game lyrically shines are \"Westside Story\" (which suffers from being almost a year old before the albums release), \"Dreams\", \"No More Fun & Games\" & \"Like Father Like Son\". The thing about The Documentary that makes it good, though, in't the high-standard lyrics but rather the entertainment. On \"Start From Scratch\" the craps an entire song flat out drunk & it comes off as the best track on the album. Why? Because its entertaining, its something we haven't heard before & its emotional. Another track like this is the title track, which is basically just him linking together classic LP titles in the chorus & name-dropping several times throughout this verses.

Yes the production includes other ways that can be a waste (\"Let's join the game\", \"How do we do that\", \"Top\") but the game shines brightly with songs in many other songs that are hard to identify.

What makes the documentary beautiful, however, is the entertainment, not the high quality songs. The whole song in \"From the Beginning\" is intoxicating and has emerged as the best track on the album. Why? Because it's fun, it's something we've never heard of before and emotionally.

She is so diverse in the musical style but yet all of her songs have a common sound. On her debut album she manages to put together folk, country, rock and at times ship shop and jazz to make a outstanding debut album. However this is not like her following two albums because its real more like a band than a solo artist. All the songs are co-writen and two of the songs the lyrics were co-wrote. Also Sheryl does't actually play any of the interments on the album so that kinda a bummer. However the people who do play the interments are good and so is the music. The album starts with \"Run Baby Run\" a powerful song that seems to be about a African American girl from the South and her escape from the racism in the South. At least that my interpretation I done know for a fact for anything. This is a good powerful song that grips you and pulls you into the album. \"Leaving Las Vegas\" is another good song. The percussion and guitars real catch my attention on this track. \"Strong Enough\" is a simple song but I love it and it seems to be one of the most popular tracks on this album. I like the next two songs but their nothing amazing. One of the things that I love about Sheryl Crow is that every album of hers has one song where she craps. \"The Na-Na Song\" is that song on her first album. I think ashes actually pretty good at it. Its always a song I look forward to. \"No One Said It Would Be Easy\" is a good slow song. She makes you real fell this track. The next song \"What Can I Do For You\" is a good song with real good rithym in it. Good interments and its real catchy. \"All I Wanna Do\" is the song that real got her famous. When you listen to it you can tell that was the sole purpose of the song but its still a fun song to listen to. \"We Do What We Can\" sounds nothing like anything else on the album. Its a full on jazz song. Its a great song and has great breakdown in it. This is the type of the song that sets Sheryl apart from other artists out there. So few take the risk and leave their style for a moment. She always does that good. \"I Shall Believe\" seems a bit repetive musicly and lyricly. They probably just needed a song that sounded right at the send of the album but its too repetitive. Overall this is a great album that deserved all the recognition it got. However I can't give this album five stars because her other albums are smarter and wittier. She was more hands on with her others and showed more musical talent. Still this album is consistent and has many memorable songs and a few fillers. Still evan those songs are worth listening to.

His style of music is different, but all this songs have the same voice. On this debut album, the was table to combine humanity, country, rock, and occasionally with jazz and produce the first album. However, this is not the same as this next albums, as it is more like a band than an artist alone. All the songs are written together, with the lyrics of the two songs written together. In addition, Sheryl did not play funerals on the album, so it was a disappointment. However, the funeral is very good and the music is also very fun. The album begins with \"Run Run Run\", a powerful song that looks like a South African American girl from the South and her escape from the South African race. At least in my opinion I know any facts. This is a powerful and good song that can draw you and bring you to the album. \"Leaving Las Vegas\" is another good song. The sound and guitar caught my attention in this song. \"Strong enough\" is a simple song, but I love it, it seems to be one of the most popular tracks on this album. I love the next two songs, but they\u2019re not a good one. One thing I love about Sheryl Crow is that her entire album has a song that makes her a hit. \"Na-Na Song\" is a song from this debut album. I think Ash is very good at it. It\u2019s always the song I\u2019m looking at. \"No one said it would be easy\" is a good slow song. To make you fall on this track. The next song \"What Can I Do For You\" is a very beautiful song with a beautiful rhythm. A beautiful combination with its true charm. \u201cAll I Want To Do\u201d is the song that made her famous. When you listen to it, you know that this is the very purpose of the song, but it is still an interesting song. \"We do what we can\" sounds different from anything in the album. This is a song full of jazz. This is a beautiful song, and there is a lot of distraction. The genre of this song sets Sheryl apart from other artists. Few people take the risk and leave their style for a while. He is always right. \u201cI Believe\u201d seems to be repeated in music and lyrics. They can only look for a song that sounds good when the album is posted, but it repeats itself a lot. Overall, this is a beautiful album, worthy of all acceptance.

He is very different in style of music and yet all this songs have the same sound. On this debut album, the managed to get people together, Malik, Rock and sometimes the ship and jazz shop made their first great album. However, it's not like the following two albums because it's more like a band than a real solo artist. All the songs were written and two songs were written together. And Sheryl does't actually run any collaborations on the album, which sounds like a rush. However, people who play entertainment are good, and so is music. The album begins with \"Run Baby Run\", a powerful song that sounds like an American girl from South Africa and an escape from racism in the South. At least that was my interpretation of the truth. It's a beautiful, powerful song that has the power to pull you in and out of the album. \"Leaving Las Vegas\" is another great song. Guitar and guitar beats draw my attention to this line. \"Strong Coffee\" is a simple song but I like it and it seems to be one of the most popular tracks on this album. I really like the next two songs but no wonder. One of the things I love about Sheryl Crow is that there's a song in her entire album where she hits. \"Na-Naghma\" is the song from their debut album. I think cash is great for that. I'm always looking forward to her singing. \"Nobody said it could be easy\" is a beautiful slow-moving song. It really knocks down the trail. The next song \"What Can I Do For You\" is a beautiful song that has a really good rhythm. A good combination and its original grip. \"All I Wanna Do\" is a very popular song. If you listen to it, you can see that it was the sole purpose of the song, but listening to it is still a fun song. \"We do what we can\" does't sound like anything else on the album. It's a great jazz song. It's a beautiful song and it hurts a lot. It's the kind of song that sets Sheryl apart from other artists. So some put themselves in danger and gave up their style for a while. He always does what is right. \"I Shall Believe\" sounds a bit repetitive in music and song. All they needed was a song that sounded good when the album was sent, but it was very repetitive. Overall, this is a beautiful album that deserves all the recognition it deserves. However, I can't give this album five stars because some of its albums are smart and talented. He worked with others and demonstrated additional musical skills. However, this album is permanent and has many memorable songs and a few feats. Get the songs you want to listen anyway. Check it out by clicking on it.","overall":4,"summary":"Strong Debut","unixReviewTime":994204800,"reviewTime":"07 4, 2001"}

He is very different in style of music but still all of this songs have the same sound. His debut album was table to bring people, country, rock and sometimes ship shop and jazz together to make the first album. However it\u2019s not like the next two albums because it really looks like a band rather than a single artist. All the songs were written together and two of the lyrics were written together. Also Sheryl does\u2019t really play any of the mixed albums so annoying. Yet the people who do balance are good and the music is so. The door begins with \u201cRun Baby Run\u201d which is a powerful song that seems to be about a young American boy from the South and how the escaped racism in the South. Somehow in my interpretation I know for sure everything. It\u2019s a great and powerful song that captures and draws on the album. \u201cLeaving Las Vegas\u201d is another great song. The mix of drums and guitar really caught this attention. \u201cStrong Enough\u201d is a simple song but I like it and it seems to be one of the most popular songs on this album. I loved the next two songs but not surprisingly. One of my favourite things about Sheryl Crow is that every album she has has a song to beat. \u201cHeesta Na-Na\u201d is the song from this first album. I think the cash is really good. It\u2019s always a song I\u2019ve been waiting for. \u201cNobody Says It\u2019s Easy\u201d is a slow song. It makes you really fall down this path. The next song \u201cWhat Do I Do To You\u201d is a beautiful song with a very good melody. Great mediation and real practice. \u201cAll I Wanna Do\u201d is the real song the made famous. When you listen you may realize that this is only the purpose of the song but it is still an interesting song to listen to. \u201cWe Do What We Want\u201d does\u2019t look any different on the album. It\u2019s all about jazz music. It\u2019s a great song with great destruction. This is the kind of song that sets Sheryl apart from the other singers out there. Then a few take the risk and leave their form for a minute. He always does it for good. \u201cI\u2019ll Believe You\u201d is repetitive like music and poetry. Maybe they needed a song that properly announced the release of the album but very repetitive. Overall this is a great album that deserves all the recognition it has received. However I can\u2019t give this album five stars because this other albums are smarter and smarter. He was very hands-on with others and showed great musical talent. This album is still permanent and has many memorable songs and many fillings. Evan still these songs are worth listening to. Examine it clearly.","overall":4,"summary":"Strong Debut","unixReviewTime":994204800,"reviewTime":"07 4, 2001"}

Beautiful and deep songs are very different from the trance music that was released earlier. \"Night spreads\", \"Quark\", \"Welcome to the future\" and \"Bright Sun\" are my favourite.

The Orange Remnant Dictionary has exceeded my expectations and is my favourite CD below New & Original. I can't find their music \/ songs at all, I actually thought the songs should be the same. What happens in your life and the lives of your friends? I don't think anyone else thought of it as a CD concept. This concept is personal, unlike many others in the story \/ politics \/ social media (Leitmotif \/ OK Computer \/ The Wall). The first few songs are about virgins \/ situations that are disturbing and hit a bit through the song on 'Sea Animon': \"Now I'm shaping. Like a baton, can it carry my weight?\" \u06d4 Then after the song \"Conrad\" (about the death of a friend), the slow-moving words took a good turn. The most hopeful point is the last song and the last line of 'Sweet Avenue' which is: \"As they gave me my life, for the first time it felt worth it. As I deserved it.\" I was shocked to hear \"Sweet Avenue\", yet it was a song I heard that made me feel better when I was depressed.

There was a time when I would have agreed. Fortunately, I found a way to approach this music. I was giving this some thought this morning while listening to Coltrane's Om and ruminating on how form eventually started to reveal itself in what originally sounded like a mess. It occurred to me that the later works are very much like those puzzle pictures we used to see back in the ninety's. When you first looked, it was just a rectangle with a bunch of tiny random shapes and color. Your friend kept telling you that there was a clipper ship in that picture. You strained to see it, got frustrated, put it down, picked it up, tried it again without success. And then you found that when you stopped trying to see that clipper ship and simply relaxed a threeD hologram emerged from the backdrop and yes, there really was a clipper ship hidden in that mess. That's what listening to Coltrane's later day works are like. The emperor is in fact wearing cloths, you just haven't relaxed, put away your preconceived notions for \"looking\" allowed yourself to see them. Original Review:There is so much I want to write about Ascension that I'll probably update this review from time-to-time. First, Robert Rub III and this \"Emporer's New Clothes\" review. Robert, I know exactly where you are coming from and I've written much the same sort of review about other \"post-modern\" works. I'm afraid I can't agree in this case though, for one thing, Coltrane has an incredible pedigree of a career. The man KNEW exactly what the was doing. That pedigree legitimizes this work. I fear you have sold yourself short in this instance. You have to get beyond your comfort zone in order to discover what is happening there. Anyway, enough of that. Ascension is a wild roller-coaster ride with twists and turns and free-falls that take your breath away. And when the first forty minute ride is complete we get to say \"Let's do it again!\" and listen to the thirty-eight minute Ascension I (which was really take two in the studio). Ascension is Coltrane as Shiva (the Hindu destroyer & creator), this session is truly the continental divide of Coltrane's solo career and yeah, the destroys what the built up, but the also creates something very new, so new in fact that we have to step away from your assumptions about what music should be in order to glimpse what the has discovered. Ascension is so much like life. We are all improvisers. We go through life with your own framework (values) but whether we admit it for not, we are swinging' and making up your lives as we move along. We encounter others, it changes us. We oscillate from chaos to order then back to chaos. Ascension is very much like that oscillation from chaos to a kind of improvised order. People who call this noise are not REALLY listening to what is happening. When the horns play together, the players are communicating to one another, call and response, shouts, hollers. It's incredibly powerful stuff. Then we get the alone voice of a soloist, telling this story. Freddie Hubbard stands out in particular, what an amazing player. Is it any accident that the ended up on some of the most important \"new jazz\" works such as Out to Lunch, Ole, Point of Departure? If there is one single flaw with Ascension, it might be that Hubbard's mic is too hot and at times this playing obscures the other players (during the ensemble passages). Ascension is an awe-inspiring work. It in't easy to listen to this music. Your year has been trained to what is called \"natural cadence\", resolving the Vseven to the I chord. Coltrane, in this role as Shiva, offers no such rest for you. You have to be willing to go with him, destroy what you know and then listen. This is the key to listening to every Coltrane work from Ascension onward (like Meditations for instance). That's it, that's all I'm gonna write. Yeah, I like the pretty stuff, like Trane's earlier work, for the Miles Davis Quintets. But I can dig Ascension too! Let go and let it wash over you.","overall":5,"summary":"A Musical Tour-de-Force Thrill Ride","unixReviewTime":1208649600,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2008"}

I will agree for a while. Luckily, I found a way to deal with this type of music. I was thinking about this when I listened to Coltrane\u2019s Om this morning and I was thinking about how this form will start to look like it sounds like a lot of noise at first. It suddenly occurred to me that the latest works are very similar to the puzzles we saw in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. When you first look at it, it is just a rectangle with a bunch of small shapes and color on it. Your friends keep telling you that there is a clipper in that photo. You try to look at it, feel anxious, put it down, identify it, and try again, but to no avail. Then you find out that when you stop trying to see Clipper, just relax, the threeD hologram appears in the background, yes, there is a Clipper hidden in that problem. This is how it feels to listen to Coltrane's performance later. The director wears clothes, but you are not yet comfortable. Put your \u201cseeing\u201d ideas in and let them see for themselves. Original comments: I want to write more about Ascension, and I may update this information from time to time. First, Robert Rub III and this review of the \"New Employee's Property\". Robert, I know exactly where you come from, and I wrote a review about other \"current\" jobs. In this case, I'm afraid I don't agree. On the other hand, Coltrane has a wonderful history. This person knows exactly what the is doing. Interest legalizes this activity. I'm worried you sold yourself briefly in this situation. You will need to go beyond your comfort zone to find out what is going on there. In short, it is enough. The ascent of a fast roller coaster ride, turning and turning and free fall will amaze you. When the first forty-minute journey is over, we will say \"Let's do it again!\" And you listened to Ascension for thirty-eight minutes myself (I really want two people in the studio). Ascension is Coltrane as Shiva (the destroyer and creator of Hinduism). from your thinking about what music you should have to get an idea of what you found. Climbing is as real as life. We are all developers. We live your life in your frame (values), but whether we accept it for not, we all advertise and shape your life as we move forward. Together with others we changed. We went from chaos to order, and then we went back to chaos. The Ascension increase is very similar to the shift from chaos to non-order order. The caller did not pay much attention to what was happening. When the horns are played together, the players communicate, call and respond, shout, and shout. This is a very powerful thing. Then we heard the voices of the musicians and told a story. Freddie Hubbard is exceptionally good, the's an amazing player. It finally appeared in some of the most important works of \"new jazz\", such as Out to Lunch, Ole, Point of Departure, was it by chance? If Ascension has a single defect, it is likely that Hubbard's microphone is too hot, and sometimes this type of performance will overwhelm other players (in the music sector). Ascension is an amazing job. It is not easy to listen to this music. This year the trained in the so-called \"natural rhythm\", interpreting Vseven as a chord. Coltrane plays the role of Shiva and will not provide you with this kind of relaxation. You will have to be willing to go with him, destroy what you know, and then listen. This is the key to listening to all Coltrane work that starts with Ascension (as meditation). That's it, this is what I want to write. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Trane's first works of Miles Davis Quintet. But I can dig and climb! Let him go and let him wash you.","overall":5,"summary":"A Musical Tour-de-Force Thrill Ride","unixReviewTime":1208649600,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2008"}

There was a time when I agreed. Fortunately, I found a way to get closer to this music. I was giving this idea while listening to Coltrane's Om this morning and pointing out that the farm finally started to manifest itself which at first looked like garbage. It just so happened that the latest work is very similar to the puzzle pictures we saw in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. At first glance, it was just a line with many small shapes and color. Your friend has been telling you that there is a graphic plane in this picture. He was shocked, disappointed, put it down, picked it up, and tried again without success. And then you find out that when you stopped trying to see this clipper plane, only the threeD hologram that appeared in the back was loose and yes, there was actually a clipboard hidden in this mess. That's the decent thing to do, and it should send there. In fact the emperor is dressed, you are not comfortable yet, put down your preconceived notions that you are allowed to see. Original Review: I would like to write a lot about Ascension. I will review this review from time to time. First of all, Robert Rob III with this review of \"Emporr's New Clothes\". Robert, I know exactly where you came from and I've written a similar review for other \"modern\" works. I'm afraid I can't agree with this case, but, in some cases, Coltrain has an amazing job descent. Man knows very well what Jehovah is doing. The granddaughter legitimizes the plan. I'm afraid you have shortened yourself to this. You have to go through your comfort zone to know what's going on there. Still, that's enough. Ascension Jungle is a roller coaster ride with twists and turns and free spells to clear your air. And when the first forty-minute journey ends, we get \"Let's do it again.\" And listened to the thirty-eight-minute Ascension I (which actually took two to the studio). Ascension Coltrain as Shiva (Destroyer and Creator of Hindus), this session is a real breakthrough of Coltrain's work continent and yes, it destroys what has been built, but also creates something new, so You have to give up your thoughts on what kind of music you get. Height is like life. We are all developers. We live according to your framework (values) but even if we accept it, we change and move your lives forward. We meet others, it changes us. We move from chaos to order and chaos. Rising is like the transition from chaos to advanced configuration. People who say this noise are not really listening to what is happening. When the horns sound together, the players talk to each other, call and answer, shout, shout. Things with great power. Then we get a voice of a solo singer telling a story. Freddie Hubbard stands out in particular, what an amazing player. Is it a coincidence that it became perfect for some important \"jazz\" activities like Out Out to Lunch, Ole, Point of Departure? If there is anything wrong with the Ascension, it may be that Hubbard's microphone is too hot and sometimes the play hides the other players (during the reunion). Rising is a difficult task. Listening to this music is not easy. Your year has been trained in the so-called \"natural cadence\", which is solved by Vseven in I chord. Coltrane, in the role of Shave, does not offer such comfort. You have to be prepared to go with it, to close what you know and to listen. This is the key to listening to all of Coltrane's activities since the ascension (meditation, for example). That's it, I'm just going to write. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT saint for me either. But I can dig ashes too! Stop washing it for you.","overall":5,"summary":"A Musical Tour-de-Force Thrill Ride","unixReviewTime":1208649600,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2008"}

There is a time I will allow. Fortunately, I found a way to get closer to this music. I was thinking this morning as I listened to Coltrane\u2019s Om and wondered how the style began to reveal what seemed like a mess. It turns out that the latter works are very similar to the puzzle pictures we used to see in the nineties. The first time you look at it, it\u2019s just a rectangle with lots of random shapes and color. Your friend always tells you that the picture is a cutting ship. You struggle to see, you fail, you get down, you take it, you try again without success. Then you realize that when you stop trying to see the ship in a trance and you just notice the threeD hologram coming out in the back and yes, there is actually a docking ship hidden in that mess. That\u2019s what Coltrane\u2019s later listening looks like. The king is really wrapped in cloth, you don\u2019t relax, hide your former attitude of \u201clooking\u201d allowing yourself to be seen. Original Review: I have a lot to write about Ascension that I can update from time to time. First, Robert Rub III and the \u201cNew Emporer Dress\u201d. Robert, I know exactly where you come from and I\u2019ve written many similar reviews about other \u201cmodern-day\u201d jobs. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t agree with this case, though, for one thing, Coltrane has an amazing professional genealogy. The man knew what was being done. That race became legitimate in this work. I'm afraid you could sell yourself short. You need to across your comfort zone to find out what\u2019s going on there. However, that is enough. The climb is a wild type of climb with twists and a free fall that will take your breath away. And when the first forty minutes of the ride were over we said \"Let's do it again!\" and listen to thirty -eight minutes of Ascension I (which actually took two studios). Ascension is Coltrane just like Shiva (Hindu destroyer & creator), this session is really continental splitting the single Coltrane skill and yes, it destroys the built, but it also creates something very new, so it is new departure in your the thoughts about music is supposed to see what the found. Climbing is like life. We are all reformers. We go through life with your own structure (values), but whether we recognize it for not, we will change \u201dand improve your life as we go along. We get to know others, it changes us. We rise from the mess to ask and then back to the mess. The amplification is very similar to the vibration from the disturbance in some kind of improved arrangement. People shouting this noise really don't listen to what's going on. When the horns play, the players talk, call and answer, shout, hollers. It's so cloud. Then we get the alone voice of the song, which tells this story. Freddie Hubbard is standing up, the's an amazing player. Is there anyone accident that ended with some of the most important \"new jazz\" works like Out to Lunch, Ole, Point of Departure? If there's a defect in Ascension, it could be the Hubbard micro upon is very hot and sometimes this game hides the other players (across the planes). Climbing is a daunting job. It is not easy to listen to this music. Your year is trained for the so -called \"natural cadence\", which Vseven's team solves I. Coltrane, in this role as Shiva, does not give you such a break. You have to be willing to follow him, destroy what you know and then listen. This is the key to listening to any Coltrane work from Ascension previously (as an example of Meditations). That's all, that's all I'm going to write. Yes, I like good products, like Trane\u2019s previous work, by Miles Davis Quintets. But I can also dig Ascension! Leave it and wash.","overall":5,"summary":"A Musical Tour-de-Force Thrill Ride","unixReviewTime":1208649600,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2008"}

Hotel California is probably a better batch of songs, but they don't fit together as well as the jones found there do.

Admittedly, the opener, \"Doolin' Dalton,\" in't much like anything else they never did, but the edgy harmonies are great and it does set the stage for the loosely bound tale that follows. \"Out of Control\" is the most savage rocker of their career and the very epitome of the wild-guys'-night-out motif that appears throughout their catalog, although the bland guitar solo shows why it's a good thing they hired Don Felder on their next album. Other heavy moments include \"Certain Kind of Fool\" and \"Outlaw Man,\" which could be about the same small town misfit running amok in the desert.

Other heavy moments include \"Certain Kind of Fool\" and \"Outlaw Man,\" which could be about the same small town misfit running amok in the desert. You probably know the title track even if you don't own this album, but \"Saturday Night\" is a lovely buried treasure that deserves to be just as well known. That, along with the relatively uncommercial Old West motif, is probably why this was their only album with no hit singles. Also featured there is the mid-tempo \"Tequila Sunrise,\" which should have been the album's hit single. Hotel California is probably a better batch of songs, but they don't fit together as well as the jones found there do.","overall":5,"summary":"No sophomore slump here","unixReviewTime":1186617600,"reviewTime":"08 9, 2007"}

But there's no overeating the Butterfield gang's music for debut album - almost forty years after the sextet first laid it out, it's riveting, elemental, and demands to be heard all through each player of the thrustingly sensitive sound. They may have anchored themselves with Howlin' Wolf's rhythm section (Lay and Arnold), but Butterfield's heart seemed more to belong to Little Walter, both in the preponderance of Walter's material covered (and with reverence but not redundancy) there and in elements of this own harmonica style. (As it happened, Butterfield, Bloomfield, and second guitarist Elvin Bishop had each known, played with, and learned from the Chicago electric blues masters previously, and never lost the old masters' respect.) Bloomfield, of course, was already an outsize talent in this own right - the's not quite the sleek, polished old pro who would go from drop-dead to existentially expressive (by way of this luminous work with first the Electric Flag and, later, the Al Kooper \"Super Session\" projects), but the's exuberant, committed, and passionate, and the's already figuring out how to temper this chops and subordinate them to taste and to melodiousness in this solos by the time the set begins to wind down. Not that it's so bad when the just lets fly - in fact, the's the main instigator behind \"Screamin',\" possibly the wildest instrumental to spring up from any of the decade's blues revivalists, both as its co-composer and its prime cattle prod, dropping off a solo there and there to deliver little sharp stings to either Butterfield (with some choice harmonica sweeps and cries), Bishop (an occasional spiky click there and there and effectively), and keyboard face Mark Naftalin while letting the rhythm section whomp it up shamelessly. Still, the band was wholly accessible, from the romping \"Shake Your Moneymaker\" to the strolling \"Last Night\"; from the rocking \"Born in Chicago\" to the galloping \"Thank You, Mr. Poobah\"; from the dripping \"Our Love Is Drifting\" to the bristling boogie joyousness of Sam Lay taking the vocal for \"Got My Mojo Workin'.\" Butterfield was a passable vocalist with perhaps more feeling than voice, but the proved himself a legitimate comer as a blues sharp specialist and bandleader. That the elders from whom the and this merry men learnt their blues directly accepted them as one of their own testifies even more potently to how powerful this album was then. and now.

It's very easy to pick up the original Butterfield Blues team. They started the first revival of the blues between the one thousands and nine hundred and sixtys, and it happened that they sent out the usual song of the \"revival\" of the decade as a popular tradition.

Vol.one was a compilation of hits\/rare songs. This is more a compilation of remixes and FOUR new songs. A couple rare songs, Hook It Up and Dont Hate On Me are on there, but should't have been. Hook it Up is wack, I done why Bone collared wit Master P in the first place. Dont Hate On Me is an alright track, but where was the classic song \"Everyday Thing\" from the Show soundtrack?? Of course, this cd does have some classic hits on it, like All Good & Ghetto Cowboy [from the Family Reunion album] and Thug Luv [from The Art Of War album]. But its the NEW songs which REALLY make this album. The first one is called \"CLandIA\", and its a Bizzy\/Flesh duo. Ive always wanted to hear a Bizzy\/Flesh duo, and they done disappoint there. Clearly a unreleased song from Resurrection, the beat is very uptempo and Bizzy drops two fast but crystal clear verses, and Flesh drops a nice verse just like the did all over the Res album. \"Weedman\" is another unreleased cut, and its a Bizzy solo. DJ Uneek produces it, and of course its tight. Bizzy uses this style from \"Look Into My Eyez\" on this cut. \"Frontline Warriors\" is a Layzie\/Bizzy duo. Not quite as good as CLandIA, but its right. The beat has lot going on with it, and its sometimes difficult to get the lyrics. \"Sleepwalkers\" of\/Eazy E. I had HUGE expectations for this song, and though the song is good, it disappoints a little. It was originally gonna be on Bone's landmark album \"E.one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Eternal\". Eazy's verse is cut short, and the explosion between this verse and Lay's throws the song off a all bit. Also, after Wish's verse is done, I done like how the song abruptly ends. Other than that, a nice track. The rest of the cuts are remixes. The best one, and my fax song on the WHOLE cd, is the Look Into My Eyez [atlantis remix]. This song is AMAZING. Much better than The Art Of War version. The lyrics are the same, but the beat is just beautiful, right up there with Shoot Em Up, Crossroads, Dayz Of Our Livez, and Its All Mo Thug. The \"two Glocks\" remix is slightly better than the original, but its nothing incredible. The \"Cant Give It Up\" remix is HORRIBLE. I want crazy about the original, but the remix makes it look like a masterpiece. The \"Change The World\" remix is good, but I would done one thing differently on it: Keep the original beat, cut it goes with the song better. I do like the new chorus, and Krayzie's added verse is nice. Overall, a must for Bone fans.

Vol.one was a collection of rare hits \/ songs. It's more of a remix and a combination of four new songs. There are some rare songs, How to Up and Don't Hate On, but they should't be. Hook It Up Week, I wondered why Bone called Master P in the first place. Dawn Hate On Me is a real track, but where was the show soundtrack's old song \"Every Day Thing\"? Of course, there are some old songs on this CD, like from All Good and Ghetto Cowboys [from Family Album Reunion] and Thug Lo [from The Art of War]. But the new songs that really make this album. The first is called \"Clandia\", with its Bezie \/ Flash group. I've always wanted to hear the Bezie \/ Matt duo, and I'm disappointed there. The seemingly unreleased song of Bedar, the rhythm is very high and Bezi drops two fast but crystal clear verses, and the flesh throws out a sweet verse as is the case throughout the race album. \"Wade Man\" is another released kit, and that's this boss. DJ Uneek produces it, and it's definitely solid. Buzzie is using this style of \"look in my eye\" style. \"Frontline Warriors\" is a Layzie \/ Bizzy character. It's not as good as Clandia, but it's okay. Rhythm moves with it, and sometimes it becomes difficult to find words. I was expecting a lot from this song in Easy E's \"Sleep Walkers\", and although the song is entertaining, it's a little disappointing. In fact, it will be on Thambo's historical album \"E.one Thousand, Ninety Eternal\". Easy's verse is short, and the interval between this verse and Lee throws the song a little. And, after the verse was over, I acted as if the song had suddenly ended. Also, a good track. All kits are remixes. Best of all, with my fax songs on all the CDs, look [Atlantis Remix] in my eye. This song is amazing. Much better than the Art of War version. Same words, but the rhythm is fine, with Sho Em Em, Crossroads, Dayz Of Our Livez, and all this Mo Thug. The remix of \"To Glux\" is better than the original, but not surprisingly. The remix of \"It Can't Give\" is on fire. I want to be crazy at first, but the remix makes it look like part. The remix of \"Change the World\" is great, but I can do one thing differently: keep the original rhythm, cut and move the song better. I love the new course, and Crazy's extra verse is beautiful.

It was originally to be included in the Bone album icon \"E. nineteen thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine Eternal\".

As the son of Ethiopian immigrants, the migrated from Africa to the United States, where this family settled in Virginia. It was there that the phoned this skills as a musician, and got recognition as a songwriter. He made this debut on fellow singer-songwriter Shea Seger on her two thousand and one debut \"The May Street Project\" co-writing the song \"Clutch\". Two years later, the signed to Flawless Records- an Interscope distributed imprint owned by Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. The album suffered from numerous delays until the decided to leave the label for Columbia Records to release this debut \"New Sacred Cow\"- which was primarily produced by Chad Hugo of The Neptunes. The record was critically acclaimed but did rather lukewarm numbers, which resulted in Kenna's departure. There was a brief feature done on him in the two thousand and five Malcolm Gladwell authored book \"Blink\" about this troubles within the music industry. After the laid low for a few years, the signed with The Neptunes' Star Trak Entertainment label to release this sophomore effort \"Make Sure They See My Face\". Though this second album is billed as being produced by The Neptunes, it was done separately with every song being produced by Chad Hugo, with the exception of the radio accessible \"Loose Wires\" and the first single \"Say Goodbye To Love\", which were produced by Pharrell Williams. On this album, the continues down the road of industrial music and mid-eighty's synth-pop- a sound that's made familiar by the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Duran Duran and Depeche Mode. He steps outside of this comfort zone with the dance-rockers \"Sun Red Sky Blue\" and \"Baptized in Blacklight\". The song \"Phantom Always\" features a left field guest appearance from pop singer Justin Timberlake. Producer Ethan Johns (who is best known for this work with Leona Naess, Tift Merritt, Ryan Adams and Kings Of Leon) plays bass on the opening track \"Daylight\". The album is fairly uptempo, but Kenna manages to sneak in a few ballads there and there, such as the piano driven \"Static\", \"Be Still\" and the closer \"Wide Awake\". For the most part, \"Make Sure They See My Face\" is a little more radio friendly than its predecessor and Kenna shows how versatile the can be sonically. The only downside to this album is that- much like this debut- the record label left a lot to be desired on the marketing and promotion.

As sons of Ethiopian immigrants, they migrated to the United States from Africa and settled in Virginia. It was there that they called this skill as a musician and gained acceptance from the composer. He started starring in the two thousand and one drama \"May Street Project\" by fellow singer-songwriter Shea Seger and wrote the song \"Clutch\". Two years later, the signed a contract with Flawless Records, the release of Interscope by leading Limp Bizkit artist Fred Durst. The album received so much delay that it decided to abandon Columbia Records and release the first single \"Holy Cow\" - produced by Chad Hugo of Neptune. The record was still widely known, but this performance was tireless, which made Kenner leave. In two thousand and five, Malcolm Gladwell (Malcolm Gladwell) in the book \"Blink\", gave him a brief introduction to this type of trouble in the music industry. After several years of low key, the signed a contract with Neptune's Star Trak Entertainment, releasing this second work \"Make sure they see my face\". Although the second album was released as produced by Neptunes, each song produced by Chad Hugo was produced separately, with the exception of \"radio Wose Loose\" which is accessible on the radio and the first \"Say Goodbye To Love\". Produced by Pharrell Williams. In this album, we continue to follow the style of factory music and pop synthesizer music in the mid-eightys - a sound familiar to people like Nine Inch Nails, Duran Duran, and DePage Mode. You have come out of this comfort zone with the dance music \"Red Sun Blue\" and \"Baptized in Blacklight\". The song \"Phantom Soloko\" features the pop singer Justin Timberlake. Producer Ethan Johns (known for this collaborations with Leona Naess, Tift Merritt, Ryan Adams and King Leon) played bass on the opening track of \"Day\". The album is moving very fast, but Kenna has been table to secretly add a few ballads there and there, such as the piano performed by \"Static\", \"Be in It\" and the nearby \"Wide Vide\". In many cases, \"make sure they see my face\" is better in broadcasting than never before, and Kenana demonstrates its performance in sound. The downside of this album is that \u2014 like this first album \u2014 the record company still has many marketing and advertising shortcomings. Overall, this record is worth seeing.","overall":5,"summary":"Kenna channels a retro sound on \"Make Sure They See My Face\"","unixReviewTime":1303862400,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2011"}

The album was delayed until Columbia Records decided to release the label to release the first single, \"New Sacred Cow\" - which was largely released by Chad Hugo of The Neptune. The record was very respectable but was made for hot numbers, which led to Kina's departure. A short essay on them was made by Malcolm Gladwell's book Two Thousand and Five Thousand \"Blinks\" about these problems in the music industry. After graduating a few years later, the signed with The Neptune's Star Trek Entertainment label to continue the mob's effort to \"make sure they see my face.\" Although the second album is billed as produced by The Neptunes, it was produced separately for each song released by Chad Hugo, the radio station \"Loose Wires\" and the first single \"Sea Good\" produced by Ferrell Williams.

He walks out of this luxury avenue with dance artists \"Sun Red Sky Blue\" and \"Black Light at Baptism\". The song \"Phantom Forever\" features pop artist Justin Timberlake's left-wing tourist figure. Producer Ethan Johns (known for this work with Leona Ness, Tuft Merit, Ryan Adams and Kings of Leon) plays the bass on the opening track \"Daylight\". The album tops the list, but Kina has managed to get a few songs there and there, such as the piano performed by \"Static\", \"Be Steele\" and \"Wide Awake\". For the most part, \"Make sure they see my face\" is more friendly than never on the radio and Kina shows how useful it is. The only downside to this album is that it is similar to this point - the recording label has left a lot to be desired and promoted. Anyway, at least this is the only record you should look for.","overall":5,"summary":"Kenna channels a retro sound on \"Make Sure They See My Face\"","unixReviewTime":1303862400,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2011"}

The album features interesting party songs such as \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" and \"HOVA\", which are currently playing, but are also very important for tracks such as \"Blueprint\" and \"Song Cry\".

Instead, the next album, \"Caribou\", was a return to the simpler, more mainstream \"Caribou\". Despite getting mixed reviews from critics, the album continued Elton's string of number one albums and yielded two top ten hits. While this album has its share of weak tracks (\"Stinker\"), some of Elton's best stuff is on \"Caribou\". \"Pinky\" is one of Captain Fantastic's finest ballads, with a brilliantly understated vocal and a simple yet spellbinding arrangement. The rollicking \"Grimsby\" is a downhome rocker driven by Davey Johnstone's guitar prowess and the strong rhythm section of Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray. I should probably take the time out to mention that this trio is possibly the best group of backing musicians for any artists, and it's a shame the three never collaborated as their own album, which would gave been awesome. Anyway, back to the album. \"I've Seen The Saucers\" is a song about UFO sightings. The idea of the song is rather stupid, but the sinister arrangement keeps it aloft. \"Solar Prestige A Gammon\" is a good tune but only if you don't take it seriously. \"You're So Static\" is a tongue in cheek denouncement of NYC that is good but the live version on \"Here And There\" is much better. \"Ticking\" is an absolute masterpiece. I can't really think of any words to describe this song. But when I saw Elton at Madison Square Garden in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, the did a haunting version of this song. I was breathless. Then there's the album's two hit singles.\"The Bitch Is Back\" is a tongue in cheek rocker that was banned by many radio stations but still became a massive hit, reaching number four on the Hot one hundred and remaining a radio staple. Then, there's \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\". Wow, what to say about this. This may well be the best song Elton never did, and without a doubt one of the finest pop singles never released. This is truly a moment of absolute perfection, from its chilling piano intro to its triumphant outtro. The bonus tracks are excellent additions to this already strong album. \"Pinball Wizard\" is indeed a cover of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine classic by The Who, and to be honest, (and I know I will be blasted for this over and over), Elton's version is so much better. It is so energetic and fun. \"Sick City\" is somewhat of a novelty number but is can be taken seriously and is overall a very good track. \"Cold Highway\" is a midtempo tribute to a friend of Elton and Bernie who was killed in a car accident. Closing out this remastered edition of the album is Elton's holiday standard \"Step Into Christmas\". It's a Christmas song, but can be enjoyed all year around. Ovverall, \"Caribou\" is definitely not as strong as \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\", and is definitely worth owning. I say that you should't listen to all the reviews (maybe not even mine) and see for yourself just how good you might find this album.","overall":5,"summary":"An Understated (And Underrated) Gem","unixReviewTime":1116547200,"reviewTime":"05 20, 2005"}

On the contrary, the next album \"Caribou\" goes back to the simplest and most original \"Caribou\". Despite the mixed reviews of critics, the album continues with a series of Elton's first albums and won ten top albums. Although the album has some weak songs (\"Stinker\"), some of Elton's best performances are \"Caribou\". \"Pinky\" is one of the best writers of \"Captain Fantastic\", with a great singing voice and a simple and interesting arrangement. The cheerful \"Grimsby\" is a country music group driven by the strongness of Davey Johnstone's guitar and the strong rhythms of Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray. I will have to take the time to mention that this trio may be the best singer among all the artists. Unfortunately, these trio have never collaborated on their albums, which would be great. After that, go back to the album. \"I've seen flying sauces\" is a song about UFO sightings. The idea of this song is silly, but the bad organization makes it far away. \"Solar Prestige A Gammon\" is a good song, but only if you don't take it seriously. \"Very static\" is a ruthless condemnation of New York City, which is good, but the live report \"Here and There\" is much better. \"Ticks\" is certainly a work of part. I really can't even think of words to describe this song. But when I saw Elton at Madison Square Garden in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, the song's song was unforgettable. I was out of breath. Then there are two beat songs from the album. \"Rabbit is back\" is a rock and roll artist who has been shut down by many radio stations, but is still very popular. So, there is the \"Let the sun not set on me\". Wow, what is being talked about. This is the best song that Elton has never done. Undoubtedly this is the best song that has never been released. This is truly the perfect moment, from the first piano sound to the triumphant introduction. The bonus track is an excellent addition to this already powerful album. \"Pinball Wizard\" is actually the cover of the Who's one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine classic. Honestly, (I know I'll be attacked a lot more often for this), Elton's version is much better. It is powerful and fun. \"Sick City\" is a novel number, but it can be taken seriously, and it's all a good idea. \"Cold Highway\" is a tribute to the speed bump that went on to Elton and Bernie's friends who were killed in a car accident. The only are-release of this album is Elton's \"Christmas\" holiday standard. This is a Christmas song, but you can enjoy it all year around. Overall, the \"Reindeer\" certainly in't as strong as the \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\", it's certainly worth having.

Freed from the somewhat restrictive shackles of the series, the band came up with a wholly fitting soundtrack album that mixes a variety of interesting songs and spoken dialogue cleverly into a strange but compelling audio experience. The most commercial song on the album was the \"Porpoise Song,\" but songs like \"Can You Dig It\" are more representative of the film as a whole. Without question, the best song on the album, and one of the Monkees' greatest songs never, is \"Circle Sky,\" a wonderful Nesmith rocker (the most disturbing footage of the film also takes place during the course it.) On this release the excellent live version is included as an bonus track. Comparing the studio and live versions is interesting (there is also an alternate studio take available that is excellent, though it is not on this CD.) Truly this is one of the greatest unknown songs of the sixties, and makes the album worth buying by itself. I recommend the album and the film. Any soundtrack with track listings with titles like \"Dandruff?,\" Frank Zappa and this talking cow, Jack Nicholson, Annette Funicello, and Sonny Liston has to be interesting, and is. It's a weird combination of pop culture and social commentary (\"Are you telling me that you don't see the connection between government and laughing at people?\") that never fails to entertain.
