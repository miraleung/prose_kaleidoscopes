521,"The movie throws you into a lot of funny magic, like a villa for all women. There's not much about the plan, but the simulation- amazing. > When asked about my favourite movies, this is the first one I mentioned. There are special films (in the working part like this film, “The Dark City”, and “Breaking the Waves”) that seem touching inside, a very protected and hidden but very sensitive place, which makes a living impression. viewers, no different than a life -changing event, such as the send of a life -threatening relationship.

828,"Truly appalling waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about thirty minutes from the send. And i can count the films I have switched off before the send on one hand. The script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring. I would't be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. For example the irritating croat threatening the real estate guy from this house phone. I mean seriously. The police would be beating this door down in minutes. The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. Oh and what ""characters"" they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful. He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After sixty for so minutes of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from this generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. Is the happy? Is the sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. And the native American theme is just awful and pointless. The good guys are at best unlikeable. A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic sex-wife stereotype. Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy, ""you karen't going to shoot me"" that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying. The richie unix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic for at least realistically motivated. Roasario Dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to believe her character was SO attracted to Rourke's? Or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! In summary a complete mess of a film. Hopeless characterisations and performances. A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely dull. Its not even comedy bad either. Laughing at Rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first fifteen turgid minutes of the film.",negative
828,Script and director are lovely and boring. Shows and events have been washed away by you like water in a river. Good people are not very popular. Dark white collar concept.,negative
828,"What a shocking waste of space. My friend and I tried to finish watching the movie, but I had to close it about thirty minutes after posting it. On the other hand, I could list the movies I closed before posting. The script and the instructions are far away and tedious. I would not be surprised if they found the script among the one, nine hundred and eighty-three responses left. For example, annoying Croatian intimidates real estate agents by using this home phone. I speak deeply. The police would knock on the door for a few minutes. Shows and events were washed away by you like dung in the river. It is difficult to understand the real content of this movie. The story between the characters flies in a seemingly insignificant way, breaking down the painful attempts to show the characters. Oh, what a “role” they are. The protagonist played by Locke is awesome. He could cut a piece of cardboard and sit on the bed. After sixty minutes of this movie, I can’t totally stick to this character. He has no compassion for hatred. It's a broken dummy from the grocery store, stuck all over the place. His intentions are not to be understood in this discourse remains vague and vague. are you happy? Are you sad? are you angry I do not know. Just the eyes of death looking at you in the twisted flesh. And Native American content is awesome and meaningless. Good people are not loved at all. The vague white stereotype and the stereotype of a stupid woman. It’s annoying and annoying to remind a normal woman to face the wrong person with a gun, “You’re not going to shoot me”. The character Richie unix seemed interesting at first, but soon turned into an annoying character. This seems to contradict the further purpose of making the wicked sympathetic to at least some real intentions in some way. Roasario Dawsons' role began with some promises, but the soon fell into the disgusting and childish drama of the gangster factor Jackie Brown. Do you really want me to believe that this character is attracted to Rourke's character? Or what’s worse is the madman sleeping in anything that moves? Real female characters FTW! After all, the movie is a mess. Despair and performance. Black and old script and uninspired guide. It ended up being very boring. There is nothing wrong with comedy. After the first fifteen minutes of watching the movie, Rourkes' heavy face became very old.",negative
828,"Really awesome space waste. My friend and I tried to watch the movie still the send but we had to stop it for about thirty minutes from the post. And I can count the movies that I deleted before I sent them with one hand. The scripts and guides are guiding, not deeply encouraging. I would't be surprised if they found any of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty texts in a collection of thousands of records. For example, a disturbing hurry that threatens the property boy with this home phone. I mean honestly. Police will knock on the door in minutes. Scenes and events bathe you like streams in a canal. It is difficult to understand the real purpose of the film. The story moves between characters in a seemingly random way that breaks the tragic character building efforts. Oh and who are the ""characters""? The main role played by Rorke is very good. He could only sit on the bed with a cut-off cardboard. Sixty minutes after the film, I was completely attached to the character. He is insensitive for hateful. It's just a bad reputation from the shop window that is stirring all sorts of incidents. Its purpose is unlikely to be seen in this extraordinary and emotional demolition. Are you happy does it hurt? are you angry? I don't have a vague idea. The same dead eyes are staring at you with a piece of rotten flesh. And the traditional American context is very bad and meaningless. Good boys are very different. A bright white stereotype and a simple sex wife stereotype. Look at the archaeological wife facing a gun and a bad guy, ""You won't shoot me."" It's not real for disturbing. Richie Unix's character may seem interesting at first, but it soon turns into a disturbing one. Which, of course, made the video an overnight sensation. Rosario Dawson's character begins with a promise but soon lands on Jackie Brown's sick for childish chicken hunter show. Do you really want me to believe that this character was very attracted to Roverke? Or worse, is the just a fool who sleeps with anything moving? Real female character FTW! In short, complete film pollution. Disappointing characters and performances. Leiden and Hackney script and unwanted guide. And in the send it's too slow. Even this humour is wrong. After sitting in the first fifteen minutes of the film, the laughter on Rourke's troubled face grows old.",negative
828,"This place is really scary. My friend and I tried to watch this movie eventually, but I had to turn it off about thirty minutes after it was sent. I can also count the movies I killed before sending a hand. Writing and directing are leads that are not deeply rooted. I would not be surprised if they see a finger on a finger thrown at a thousand, nine hundred and eighty -three. For example an angry detective threatening a real estate agent on this phone. I mean really. The police knocked on this door for a few minutes. You are just bathed in scenes and events like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the true purpose of the film. The story told between the characters is so obvious that it relentlessly destroys the compassionate attempt to build the characters. Oh and what “characters”. Rourke’s acting is shocking. He can send this own cartoon and stay in bed. After sixty minutes of that film I totally posted zero on this character. He is not compassionate for hateful. A little mess from the shop window passing through every place. His motivation is unmistakable in the usually confusing and unemotional delivery. is the happy Is it sad? Angry? I have no idea. Other dead eyes stared at a piece of flesh that was gone. The original American theme was awful and meaningless. Great men are the best and unseen. Lack of vision of a lazy white neck and a nervous structure of a nervous woman. Cue archetypal wife with a shotgun is confronted by a bad guy, ""you won't shoot me"" which is unfounded and annoying. The richie unix character seemed interesting at first but immediately fell into a side-effects psychological character that seemed to contradict the apparent purpose of having the bad guy somehow feel any real motivation. The character of Roasario Dawsons started out with promises but soon turned into a painful story that looked like a gangster from Jackie Brown. Do you really want me to believe that this character attracted you to Rourke? Or worse is she a slut moving into something? Real FTW female characters! In other words a complete noise movie. Descriptions and demonstrations of despair. A hacked lead text with uninteresting directions. And in the send it was very boring. Its also bad comedy. The old laughter on Rourkes haggard's face after sitting down for the first fifteen minutes of the film.",negative

1787,"Beware, My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, Harry Horner, better known for this set designs. Robert Ryan plays a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her. The problem is that the is a psychopathic murderer and does't know it. Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over, to little avail. He is not the sort of man compassion could help for cure. Thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can't do well because there is something wrong with him. He suffers periodic blackouts during which the commits facts of violence, which the later forgets. Essentially the effect Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and this prey, for in another sense a sadist. The audience finds out early on that Ryan is a mad killer, but it takes Lupino much longer. Thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to 'win' Ryan over in order to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. But getting on with things in't in Ryan's makeup, as the is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening this paranoia asserts itself. As a study in mental illness the movie in't too impressive. What it's superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical in that we know Lupino can't 'fix' Ryan, yet we want her to. The result is that, if one is willing, one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure. Horner shows us, gradually, the layout the Lupino house , a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We become familiar with staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which jones she can't.",positive

1787,"Beware, My Beloved is an experimental film in the early one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys, directed by a man named Harry Horner, known for this kind of set design. Robert Ryan plays the handyman, and Ida Lupino hired him to do the housework for him. The problem is, it's a mentally will killer, and I don't know. Miss Lupino is a caring person, she tried to win Ryan, but with little success. It is not the kind of person who can heal with compassion. So, we have an interesting situation where two people have good intentions, but one of them can’t do well because the has a problem. He was suffering from a power outage, and the violent facts of the day were later forgotten. Basically, Ryan's influence on Lupino is the influence of hunters and prey, because otherwise it's sad. Audiences soon found out that Ryan was a crazy killer, but it would take Lupino a long time. So, when we see poor Miss Lupino doing her best to “succeed” Ryan in making things go smoothly, work done, and move on with life, we need to embrace this knowledge. But continuing to deal with things is not something Ryan has done, because the can't do anything without the most basic of routine, and it will only happen that this kind of paranoia has happened. As a study of mental illness, this movie is not very impressive. At its score is the demonstration of the effects of a serious mental illness, mixed with dangerous psychopathology, and its effects on the general public. In this case, the film is real and sympathetic, and although we know that Lupino can't ""fix"" Ryan, we hope the can. The result is that if you want to, if you can put your opinion aside, if you want to, you can be emotionally invested in this movie. Horner gradually showed us the nature of the Lupino house, a fearsome Gothic beast that can feel at home. We are familiar with stairs, kitchens and storage rooms; we begin to know which windows Miss Lupino can use to escape, and which windows she cannot.",positive

In a study of mental illness, the film is not very enticing. Shown above are the effects of major mental illnesses, with mixed risk psychology, and its impact on the average person. Looking at the film is really kind and kind, although relentlessly and logically we know that Lupino can’t ‘fix’ Ryan, we still like him. The result is that, if one wishes, one can become more involved in this film emotionally if one can set aside, therefore, this singing style.

Robert Ryan is playing the role of an employee hired by Ida Lupino to do the housework for him. The problem is that Jehovah is a psychic killer and the does not know it. Miss Lupino is a sympathetic spirit and tries to win over Ryan, but she achieves very little. He is not the kind of person whose compassion can help heal. So we have a cute attitude of two people who describe well, but one of them can't do good because there's something wrong with it. He sometimes suffers from extinction where the reveals violent facts, which the later forgets. The main effect of Ryan on Lupino is that of the hunter and this dish, because in a sense the is Sardis. The audience soon learns that Ryan is a crazy killer, but it takes Lupino a long time. So we have to live with that knowledge because we see that Miss Lupino tries her best to 'win' Ryan to get things done, to move things forward, to move forward with life. But the continuity of things is not in Ryan's construction, because it cannot be achieved in any conventional way, and as soon as it opens, this distortion strengthens itself.

But I felt like I was entering into a positive view of someone’s psyche and then laughing as it moved to make an interesting point. A friend said: “I feel like we’ve broken into someone’s house and now we’re watching their bad videos at home without them knowing”. Another of those facts is the whimsical elements of the film’s storytelling. “Groovin’ Gary ”, which comes from“ Beaver Kid ”, is a little guy who attends a TV show hoping to get a movie - and the does, though not, perhaps, as originally expected. In high hopes for reputation and importance they invite Harris to go and record the wonderful gift of the Lord organized in this native city -titled it the action -packed “Olivia Newton -Don”. Director Trent Harris, does a great job on this slowly evolving story. Some images of a ruthless child aspiring to be a morphs, more than two later reinterpretations, about the story of repressed sexual identity in a small American city. Harris was equally critical of the attitudes of the small city in America, popular worship, and exploitative practices in the film and television industry. Sean Penn and Grispin Glover both drew impressive performances. Young Sean Penn is the most provocative-he’s a fan of following ‘Gary’s look’, but has a lot of energy given to push the feeling of contact like Harris wants to go. When it comes to sending a lot of eyeballs the original Gary excites me - compared to possible interpretations of this scenario. Lost movie that I have never seen like this. Jacob.",positive

11788,"Amy Heckerling's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers' tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at this life of hard knocks when the catches a kid trying to steal something from this pet store in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early page via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother turned district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor this wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's moll. The film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film. The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly closes steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing this best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the ""once"" bit one time too many. Several supporting factors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit for miss television show type stone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties' actual one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine release date. *one/two of four stars.",negative

11811,"When I watched L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: ""How complicated!"" And she is right, of course. When you are used to simple, one-linear plots, especially violent hero tvs crook schemes, L'Appartement is hard to follow. A couple of the negative reviewers there also have missed one for more important points. Other whine about the confusing flash backs. Come on! This is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet, come back and get hooked again within a few seconds. This one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details. Then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when. The director has left more than enough clues in all scenes. The first three/four of the movie center about the question: why did Max and Lisa split? The film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as a romantic lovestory, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. Having experience with French movies, I predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and I was right. In the send of the first part it becomes clear, after many twists and turns, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know, that Lisa had left and why. Lisa did not know, why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without a trace, when she returned to Paris. The only one who did was Alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut. After both Max and Lisa have found out the truth, the question of course becomes: can Alice's manipulations be undone? Well, of course not, time has passed by and things have changed. Many European movies use a story telling technique I fully enjoy. There is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide in their own advantage. Instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half Alice seems to be a side character; slowly it becomes clear, that she is key figure. Acting is simply great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past. Monica Belucci is very beautiful of course, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret. The only reason I did not gave it a ten is the somewhat unsatisfying send. Of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events Max is exactly on the point where the movie begun, only wiser and sadder. Alice has paid for her sins. But still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial. Max too easily exchanges Lisa for Alice; Alice too easily decides to reject Max, who has been her dream for so long; Max too easily returns to this francée. But then again, I don't know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.",positive

When you are familiar with simple one-line sites, especially TV hero fraud, L'Appartement is hard to understand. Some of the opponents there also missed an even more important point. Some complaints about the confusion of times. bring it on! This is not the kind of movie where you can leave to go to the bathroom and be addicted again in a few seconds. This requires full attention and attention to detail. So, it's not hard to figure out what happened and when it happened. The director has left enough clues in all the images. The first / fourth movie theatre about this question: Why did Max and Lisa split up? As my daughter said, the movie begins with a love story, which means that two different lovers will reunite. Having experienced French movies, I thought this story would soon change, and I am right. In the first part of the post, after a lot of twisting and turning, Max and Lisa are treated by Alice. Max did't know if Lisa was gone, for why. Lisa did not know why Max had not met her in Rome when she returned to Paris, leaving her without a trace. The person who did this was Alice, who had her reasons for shutting up. After both Max and Lisa have found the truth, the question remains: Can Alice's work be done? Of course not, over time things changed. Many European movies use my favourite storytelling techniques. The underlying dispute was not initially stated, and then two (or more) parties tried to make a decision based on their interests. Instead the audience is gradually filled with a piece of the game, and they know nothing more than the main character. L'Appartement is a good example of this technology. Alice seemed to be a supportive role in the first half; little by little, the was a leading player. The acting skills are excellent. Vincent Cassel (Vincent Cassel) is perfect as an ignorant and hurried man, putting this safety at risk in order to pursue the dream of the past. Monica Bellucci is good, but she can. Jean Paul Ecoffey provided the necessary humour. Romane Bohringer begs as a neurotic woman, suffering from a guilty conscience and remorse. The only reason I did't contribute much was that the delivery was't satisfactory. Of course, this is necessary because of the required balance. After all, Max was where the movie started, intelligent and miserable. Alice paid the price for her sin. But small turns and turns at the airport are still automatic. It is very easy for Max to replace Lisa with Alice; it is very easy for Alice to decide to reject Max, it has been her dream for a long time; it is very easy for Max to return to this France. But after that, I don't know how I can do this without sacrificing good organization. I think sometimes artists have to give up the truth for the sake of beauty.",positive

Others lament over the tangled flash. come on! This is not the kind of movie you can get out of there to watch the toilet, and come back and take part in a few seconds. This requires full concentration and attention to detail. After that, it is not difficult to know what is happening and when. The director has left more than enough references in all scenes. About the first three / four questions of movie theatre: Why did Max and Lisa separate? The film, as my girlfriend puts it, begins as a love story, suggesting that two lost lovers will be reunited. Having experienced French movies, I predicted that the story would stop soon and I was fine. It is clear from the first post, after many twists and turns, that Alice treated Max and Lisa. Max did't know why Lisa was gone. Lisa did not know why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her unaccounted for when she returned to Paris. The only one who did it was Alice and she had reasons to shut up. After both Max and Lisa find out the truth, the question is: can Alice's methods be worked out? Well, no, it's too late and things have changed. A lot of European movies use storytelling, which I really enjoy. Initially there is no outline of the underlying dispute, after which two interested parties (or more) try to determine for themselves. Instead, the viewer is gradually fed up with the plot and knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a good and hidden example of this process. In the first episode, Alice appears as a side character. Gradually it becomes clear that you are an important person. Imitation is fine. Vincent Castle is right as an irrational and hasty character, risking this life just to find an old dream. Monica Bellucci is great, but she is also very talented. Jean-Paul Ecofi provides the essential humorous touch. Roman Bohringer is a convincing woman with feelings of guilt and remorse. The only reason I did't give a tenth was an unsatisfactory post. Of course it was necessary because of the measurement you want. After all, Max is still where the movie started, the's very smart and sad. Alice paid for her sins. Still, the slight twist at the airport is fake. Max easily exchanges Lisa and Alice. Alice easily decides to reject Max, who has been her dream for a long time. Max easily returns to the widow.

The film, as my friend told me, begins with a love story, suggesting that the two lost lovers will find themselves again. Experienced in French films, I predicted the story would soon get sick and I was right. The posting of the first part proves, after many grounds, that Max and Lisa acted like Alice. Max does't know, that Lisa has left and why. Lisa does not know, why Max did not contact Rome and left him without a trace, when the returned to Paris. The only one is Alice and she has her own reasons for keeping her mouth shut. After Max and Lisa find out the truth, the question of course will be: Can Alice’s consciousness be changed? Well, of course not, time passed and things changed. Many European films use storytelling techniques that I thoroughly enjoy. There is no indication of a major conflict in the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties will try to decide in their own interests.

The first part Alice seems to be a side character; Gradually it became clear that the was an important man. The simulation is just fine.

Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these. This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name.

What's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a who-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real initial rise and fall.

But they fully understood the nature of the underground at the time (I’m a bit criminal) - something that the original film and the books were right (written by a lawyer who is now a judge on Edwin Torres). They have completely spit on every Carlito Road fan; adding insult to injury by throwing Luis Guzman, who played the lead role in the original film, in a different role. The three stars are because, just looking at the boxing stand alone, it’s not scary - there are great shows (Jay Hernandez in’t Carlito but other roles might be good for you) and the story is nothing too. . The truth is, although it does’t stand out - it’s probably the most frustrating introduction never recorded. I put this film on low expectations - I knew it would sound like a sad TV movie - but it still failed to achieve them.",negative

He uses this physical power in picking up other's trash and hauling it to the town dump. He reads comic-book hero stories and loves wrestlers and wrestling, Going to WrestleMania with this twin brother Eugene on their birthday is a yearly tradition. He talks kindly with the many people the comes in contact with during this day. He reads comic books, which the finds in the trash, with a young boy who the often passes by while on the garbage route. Unfortunately, Dominick has a diminished ability to use this mind. He has a disability. Dominick's disability came as a result of an injury to the head in which the suffered traumatic brain injury (TBI). This injury left him slower, though it did not change this score characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others. Dominick is actually more table to live independently than the may seem at the beginning of the film. He lives with Eugene who is studying to become a doctor. Dominick provides the main source of income, while Eugene is off studying. Eugene must face the fact that the is to continue this education in a different city, and that the must move away from Dominick. Eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from this twin brother. The film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals, families, and then society as a whole. The strain that escalates between Eugene and Dominick as Eugene realizes that the must eventually leave Nicky, exploded on their birthday night. Eugene yells at Dominick and throws him against the wall. In this moment, Eugene must confront this own fears of being like this abusive father, the father which Dominick protected him against while the himself became the victim of the abuse. This event cemented the love between the two brothers, who from then on became the best of friends. Though they needed each other, they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others. The fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain. However, by the send of the film, Dominick is table to say good bye to this brother and wish him luck. Eugene is table to leave this brother with the confidence that the has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with this independence. When Dominick witnesses the abuse of this friend the is forced to come face to face with the cause of this own trauma. In this state of extreme stress, Dominick almost completely shuts down. He then runs after the ambulance to the hospital to see what happened to this friend. After learning that the boy has died, the is confronted by the abusive father who, fearing this testimonial, tells him the did't see nothing, does't know anything, and not to say anything, and that if the does the will kill him. Now that this own life has been threatened, the goes and find the hand gun that Larry used to kill the rats. He goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at gunpoint, kidnaps the baby of the grieving family. He runs away from the scene and hides in a building. When the police surround him, Eugene goes in the building to talk to this brother. Eugene then reveals the cause of Dominick's disability and they bring the baby back. The abusive father then wields a gun of this own threatening to kill Dominick, but Eugene stops him and Dominick tells the crowd that the saw the father throw this son down the stairs. Through the climactic ending, the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view. Though Dominick's instinct to save the baby can be understood, we also see how damaging this response is. Dominick put the baby's life and this own life in grave danger. The larger societal consequences of these events is not directly implicated, but rather shown through the films ending. Despite the more optimistic ending portrayal, another sequence of events might just have likely occurred, in which Dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a firearm. It is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely unaccounted. Furthermore, even if Dominick is not charged, there may still be a stigma against him within the community, not that there was't one before these events. Instead, the film shows that we must be table to recognize problematic behavior and act to curb it. Dominick and Eugene was released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, the same year as another film, Rainman, which won five Academy Awards. While Rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities, it could be argued that Dominick and Eugene holds more valuable lessons for society. Whereas, Rainman demonstrated that mainstream American society might be table to learn from and care for a 'savant', if the 'savant' is the inheritor of a large estate. Dominick and Eugene show that a person with a disability might be table to care for and help save members of American society. The message of an independent person with disabilities may have been too strong for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. Hopefully someday society will see the strengths of individuals with disabilities, not as a threat, but as imperative for the strength of society.",positive

He uses this power to pick up other people's garbage and drag it into the city's garbage dump. She reads stories of heroes in comic books and loves wrestlers and wrestlers. It is a tradition of the year to join the wrestling mania with Eugene's twin on their birthday. He spoke kindly to many of the people the had met that day. She reads comic books found in the rubbish bin with a little boy who often goes through a garbage can. Unfortunately, Dominic's ability to use this type of thinking has diminished. She is disabled. Dominica's paralysis was caused by a head injury, traumatic brain injury (TBI). The injury has slowed him down, but it has not changed this scores as a strong man who helped protect others. Dominic is actually more suited to an independent life than it seems like the movie is just beginning. He lives with Eugene, who is studying to become a doctor. Dominica provides the main source of income, while Eugene does not study. Eugene has to face the fact that the must continue to receive education in a different city and must separate from Dominica. Eugene also developed a relationship and began to separate from this twin. The film focuses on domestic violence and how it affects individuals, families and the community at large. The tension between Eugene and Dominic grew as Eugene realized that they had to leave Nicky at last, which erupted on their birthday. Eugene shouted at Dominic and threw him against the wall. In the meantime, Eugene has to deal with fear, like this abusive father, Dominic protects this father, and the too becomes a victim of abuse. The event brought love between the two brothers, and they have become close friends never since. Although they need each other, they also need independence and the ability to improve and develop relationships with others. The fact that they have to split up in ways becomes a real emotional stress. However, with the release of the film, Dominic has said good-bye to the brother and wishes him well. Eugene left the brother with confidence, believing that the had begun to build a social network with people who scared about him, and they would help him find freedom. When Dominic saw this friend's abuse, the was forced to face the cause of this shock. In this state of extreme despair, Dominic was almost completely shut down. He then brushed an ambulance to the hospital to see what had happened to the friend. After hearing that the boy was dead, the met this abusive father, feared the evidence and told him that the had seen nothing, knew nothing, said nothing and would kill him if the did so. Because their lives were in danger, they went to look for the gun Larry used to kill the mouse. He went after the deceased and abducted a child from the affected family at gunpoint. He fled the scene and hid in a building. When the police surrounded her, Eugene entered the building to talk to the brother. Eugene then revealed the cause of Dominic's disability, and they returned with the baby. The abusive father then waved this gun and threatened to kill Dominic, but Eugene stopped him and Dominic told the crowd to see this father throw this son up the stairs. Reaching the climax, a problem of inefficiency emerges. While we can appreciate Dominic's instinct for saving babies, we have also seen the devastating nature of this response. Dominica puts the child's life and life in grave danger. The major social effects of these events are not directly involved, but are explained by the send of the movie. Although the outcome is promising, something else may happen, in which Dominic is accused of kidnapping and possessing a firearm. It's hard to believe that this is completely lost. In addition, even if Dominic was not prosecuted, the would still be stigmatized in public, than there was no one before these events. Instead, the film shows that we need to be vigilant to identify the problem and take action to control it. Dominique and Eugene were released in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-eight, and another film, ""Rainmaker"" released that year, won five Oscars. Although Rain Man is successful and helps increase the visibility of people with disabilities, it can be said that Dominica and Eugene provided important lessons for society. However, Lehman has confirmed that ""scholars"" are the their of a man, a typical American society can learn and care for ""scholars."" Dominic and Eugene have shown that people with disabilities can care for and help save members of the American community. The message of an independent disabled person can be very powerful for eighteen, zero people. Hopefully, one day, society will see the power of people with disabilities, not as a threat, but as a necessary condition in human power.",positive

He uses this physical force to pick up other people's garbage and move it to the city dump. You read comic book heroes and love wrestling and wrestling, going to WrestleMania with twin Eugene on this birthday is a tradition of the year. He speaks kindly to many people during this day. He reads comic books, is found in the trash, and a little boy who often goes out of this way to the rubbish cheap. Unfortunately, Dominic has limited ability to use this concept. She is disabled. Dominic's stroke was the result of a traumatic brain injury (TBI). These wounds have left him slowly, although the has not changed this human nature as a strong man who helps protect others. Dominic is more than just an independent living table that can be seen at the beginning of the film. He lives with Eugene, who is studying for a doctorate. Dominic provides the main source of income, while Eugene is illiterate. Eugene will face the fact that Jehovah will continue this teaching in another city, and that Jehovah will have to leave Dominic. Eugene also develops a romantic relationship that separates him from this twin brother. The film is directly about domestic violence and how it can affect individuals, families and society as a whole. Rising tensions between Eugene and Dominic made Eugene feel that the should finally leave Nikki, bursting into tears on this birthday night. Eugene yells at Dominic and throws him against the wall. At this point, Eugene has to deal with the fear of being like this abusive father, whose father, Dominic, rescues him while the is abused. The ceremony strengthened the love between the two brothers, who have since become close friends. Although they needed each other, they both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationships with others. The fact that they have to be broken has become a real emotional issue. However, with the release of the film, Dominic is about to say goodbye to this brother and wish him well. Eugene leaves this brother with the conviction that Jehovah has begun to build a network of people who care about him and who will help him in this freedom. When Dominic saw this friend's abuse, the was forced to confront him because of the abuse. In this state of extreme depression, Dominic is almost completely shut down. He then brushed to the hospital by ambulance to find out what had happened to the friend. After hearing that the boy had died, Jehovah confronted the abusive father, who, fearing the evidence, tells him that the sees nothing, knows nothing, and says nothing, and if Jehovah skills him Will Now, endangering this life, the leaders found a gun that Larry used to kill rats.

When police surrounded her, Eugene went to the building to talk to her brother. Eugene then identified the cause of Dominic's disability and returned the child. The abusive father then used a shotgun to kill Dominic, but Eugene stopped him and Dominic told the crowd that the had seen the father throwing the boy down the stairs. With the send of the climax, there is the issue of rudeness. While Dominic's concern for child custody is understandable, we also see how devastating this reaction is. Dominic put the child's life and soul in great danger. The major social effects of these events are not directly affected but are shown in the last films. Despite the disappointing speculation, another series of incidents may have taken place, in which Dominic was accused of kidnapping and possession of firearms. It's hard to believe that this was not the case at all. Furthermore, if Dominic is blamed, there will still be disrepute in the community, not that no one was there before the events. Instead, the film suggests that we should be on the table to watch the anxious behavior and take action to prevent it. Dominic and Eugene were awarded one, nine hundred and eighty-eight, the same year another film, Rainman, won five Academy Awards. Although Renman was successful and helped increase the visibility of a disabled person, it can be argued that Dominic and Eugene have important lessons in society. However, Renman has shown that the average American community can be at the table of learning and caring for the 'respected' if the 'assistant' inherits a large area. Dominic and Eugene show that a person with a disability can be at the table to help care for and save members of the American community. The message of a disabled person is probably the strongest in one thousand nine hundred and eighty-eight. We hope that one day the community will see the power of people with disabilities not as a threat but as an important element of community power.",positive

Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways, but none too differently than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson, a ""true believer"" in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with this mother, still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting. Compounding their task, however, is the Grunski brothers, two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned. By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit, albeit harmlessly. Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts, who think Pack seven is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out. All in all, the movie still has bits of charm.

The setup was promising, in the one thousand, nine hundred and twenty's Cecil B. Demille makes this opus of the Ten Commandments. It seems in using real Egyptian artefacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil (don't they always?). Aware of what had been unleashed DeMille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down. Hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time. Then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site (the movie's first mistake, but they those period costumes are expensive and this is a Sci-Fi channel movie). The first sightings we get of the Anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy CG effect. Then the body counts starts. This is were the movie went south for me. The reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction. Once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do? They make the usual stop to the ""guy who knows the truth but never told anyone"". After getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site? No, they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk. Really I'm not the most motivated person but if I knew a demon from ancient Egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me I'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem.

Demille makes this opus Ten Commandments. It seems that the use of real Egyptian artists in the film scene they presented an ancient horror (isn’t it always?). Knowing what was released DeMille ordered that all parts be buried instead of the usual demolition. We hope that evil will be buried forever. Then we move on now and a team tries to dig into the site (the film’s first mistake, but that element so far is expensive it’s a sci-fi movie). The first impression we get from the Anubis pet is well made and it is a fabric they are working on and not a normal CG effect. Then the body count will begin. This is the movie heading south for me. The reaction to the fact that people are dying in shocking and surprising ways is getting a shocking and down-to-earth reaction. When they find out that old evil has been released again along with murder what leads to the issue of stock in man and woman? They make the usual stop “someone who knows the truth but does’t tell anyone”. After receiving this important information do they share it with friends on the site? No, they stop at a hotel to shower and have a nice chat. Of course I’m not the bravest person, but if I found out there was a demon from ancient Egypt and would kill everyone in this sight who was next to me I would put it up faster to solve the problem. After this long and meaningless middle section they approach to destroy the Anubis beast as before, running dune buggies and shooting missiles while standing on phosphor grenades. Sci-Fi movies are more than the usual hits they make, which I’m not saying much. What frustrates me is that it can be great if someone writes a good post.",negative

28848,"I was lucky enough to watch this without any are viewing hype. I was surprised at the resilience of the ghost's image in my mind the next day, and the day after that. I've watched it three-four times, and each time I appreciate it even more. The settings are gorgeous, the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects, the marsh long shots, and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss. The main hero is so likable and good natured, that the is easily sympathized with. To the person who complained that there was't enough 'spark' in this film, I'd say that it's because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person. It is a fairly slow paced film, with an unusual amount of time being spent , are and post ghost attack, on developing this character with family and work life. SPOILERS discussion/I especially liked the turning point, when the comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost. He describes the Woman in black, and then at the send of the conversation the says that the is going back, because after all, what charm had she done to him? The other man says, ""you can't go back. alone!"" and blends the hero this dog. The cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief, with it's bounding through the house and even into the locked room. The many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out. The woman shows up in mid shot at the church, showing that it is not afraid of the church, and is also not shy for bound to the house. This is all in the very beginning. Another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence, watching the funeral. As the camera pans to the right, the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones. The older man won't even look at it, but the kids are all yelling and taunting it. Crreeepy. Usually ghosts are hidden in shadows, haunting specific locales for people. As has been mentioned, the ghost's malevolence and wrath are frightening, and I feel it's attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified. The ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house. Or perhaps the was marked no matter what, by saving the gypsy girl.

I have watched it three for four times, and each time I appreciate it more. The view is beautiful, the lighting effect of a small town on a beautiful evening, a swampy place far away, and the house itself is covered with moss. The main character is so charming and kind that it is easy to empathize. To those who complain that the movie does not have enough “sparks,” I would say that this is because all the fighting and spiritism was started by this man. This is the slowest movie, and it took an unusual time to develop this role in family and work life after being attacked by ghosts. Robbers Conversation / I really like the place to turn when the returns to the big city and meets someone who helps him and explains that the has seen ghosts.

The woman appeared from the center of the church, showing that she was not afraid of the church, nor was she ashamed to be tied to a house. Everything is original. Another memorable event was the children watching a funeral outside the church wall. With the camera panels on the right, a woman can be seen in the background among the tombstones. Older men don't even know how to look at it, but kids scold it and make fun of it. It's scary. Ghosts are often hidden in the shadows and are visible to specific areas of the human body. As mentioned earlier, the cruelty and danger of ghosts are terrifying. The finale emphasizes that the hero made a big mistake when the returned home. Or, in any case, to keep the gypsy girl marked. The person who played the hotel manager was very loyal, and the well describes this role. I was encouraging my friends how much I loved this movie, and I was relieved to see other people feel the same way. I can see that people have different ideas about the same part, especially when they put in a lot of comments and hype.

The main character is charming and this nature is beautiful, so the is easily sympathetic. For someone who has complained that there is not enough 'spark' in this film, I would say that it is because of this one person who has fought all the battles against this ghost. It's a slow-moving film, with an extraordinary amount of time spent, and it sends a ghost attack, building the character with family and work life. Spoiler talk / I especially liked the turning point, where the goes back to the big city and meets the man who was helping him and explains by looking at the ghost. She describes a woman dressed in black, and then in a conversation she says that Jehovah is going back, because how did the treat her? One man says, ""You can't go back alone!"" And a dog hero. A cute little dog offers a little softness of humour, tied to the house and even in a closed room. The strange shape of a ghost really surprised me. A woman appears in the middle of a bullet wound in a church, indicating that she is not afraid of the church, and is not ashamed to be tied up at home. It's all in the beginning.

30928,"Lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to watch Garfield's gritty, breakthrough performance (introducing a new kind of rebellious acting style that would carry over to the Brandos and Clifts and so on after the war) but all that sisterly affection is a bit suffocating.

I can see what the author David Renouk was trying to achieve: misunderstandings and negative miracles embedded in ""One Foot in the Grave"" and so on. This reflects the fact that the BBC did not ignore the series when it was broadcasting. There will be another series in the fall of two thousand and seven - though without the male lead. Another painting mentions a place where a woman sat watching a video of herself and her dead boyfriend shaving. It looks like the BBC has decided to turn it into a standard thirty minute set of work.

I mean, anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. But the did it well, anyway. Still, there was one bright, shining aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named way down the credit list, just absolutely stole everything. Liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling. I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theatre. For some strange reason, my friend LOVED it. I sort of think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honest, she should't have), though the tried to claim it was other, more artistic, reasons. Anyway, I thought even then, after this first scene, that Ray Liotta would become a major star, for at least a major, highly-respected factor. Despite the garbage aspects of the garbage script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, Liotta made it almost worth watching. In fact, it is worth seeing, once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, for one thing, this name is now usually listed at for near the top. Even then, even in a pile of garbage, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. Just, if you do see this trash, be prepared to hold your nose. Every major character is either amoral for immoral.

In any case, even then, after the first place, Ray Liotta will be an important star, at least something important and honorable.

38136,"The greatest compliments to the other commentator there at IMDb who asked himself why this series did't ""get stuck"" in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the heights did. It is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continued. I will at the send of this my comment post some thoughts about the other movie realizations, rather: attempts of the Robin Hood legend. First of All, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever. Nothing is as fun as the entire two, if one wants, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. And at the same time absolutely agreeing with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of Terry Jones' history documentations about Egypt, Greece, Rome, Konstantinopel, the Goths and Barbarians, and the middle pages and crusades (. yes, THE Monthy Python-Terry Jones):If you have seen those brilliant and funny Jones-Docs you will better, much better understand all the historical background stuff Carpenter, the writer of the Robin of Sherwood-series (which happens to be the brother of John Carpenter, who made ""The Thing"", their third brother makes music), intended to tell us. The writer of ""Dick Turpin"", ""Catweazle"" and the first two seasons of ""Robin of Sherwood"", called ""Kip"" Carpenter, is my movie overlord. He's better than all those others who criticize this ""sword-and-sorcery"" element for ""defectiveness"" (taken from the Robin of Sherwood Webring) of this series (that I can not see) for have other non-fundamented criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now. That's why, when you get to know this ""Robin of Sherwood"" better, you'll be severe. You will at first loathe the third season. Not only that: I did myself go thru this, and on top of it, I have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart - DESPITE the fact that Praed, the factor of Robin, left this series, because after the series had enormous success, the was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series called ""The new Adeventures of Jules Verne"" - already the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project. Praed went for money, and not for fame, the did't stick with this gang and skin, I mean: as factors. Actors who personally represent the afterwards ""really"", in your present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the Robin-Legend. The potential of this series could and should have been let blossomed a lot more without any degrading nivea of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues. Again, obligatory to say: A change of the main role was forced by Praed's stupid decision of leaving Robin of Sherwood for a silly remake-series of the Verne-tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story. Still it is in some aspects a catastrophe. Anyway: If one is informed about this, and that Connery was maybe really advertised by this father, but that the young Connery DID NOT AT ALL ""chase Praed away"", how I prejudicially thought in the first place, then one can absolutely enjoy the threerd season. Sad there is that the script was not anymore written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we don't have anymore that critical and free-thinking historical background like i.e. in ""The Witch of Elsdon"", for in ""The King's Fool"", two episodes of the first series that is A) funny, B) historically educating and C) brilliantly acted. ===""Don't trust the Lion!""Unlike many other characters that wished him dead for the sake of their own again of power, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and as in real history, was a greater authority than John for others, but used it only for this wicked idea of the crusade and the war against Normandie in France. He slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in the ""wholy"" crusades, and this soldiers even devoured the children they slayed out of hunger for poverty. On top of that, after this capture by the Saracens (muslims) in the crusades, Britain was squeezed out for this ransom, one hundred.zero marks (at that time, eleventh century, comparable to approx. thirty Billion - thirty'zero'zero'zero.- Dollars of current value), to get him safely back, and then the just visited England for a month to return to Normandie (in France, where the Norman Invaders went first) for the crusades (one learns that in the episode ""The King's Fool""). For this new crusade, possibly kind of a revenge for this capture, Richard Lionheart again ""drains the country of money"" (cited out of Clive Mantle's mouth, when the lectures Robin in being critical with even the King). Robin criticizes this warfare unsocial ruling of Richard's, the addresses Richard himself, telling him ""The poor gave everything to set you free, how CAN you ask more of them?"" - Richard: "". Give me your courage and strength, not your words!"" . Later, in private, Richard orders the assassination of Robin. So, the crusaders were the real ""barbarians"". P. S: Already when I watched Kostner in ninety-one, I got upset, because after-wards, I found out in history course in school that Richard was not that good just man as displayed by Sean Connery in this appearance at the send of ""Prince of the Thieves"". Well, as Terry Jones would put it: It is a lie, a treacherous lie!"" Sean plays humorist and charismatic, and this son does a better job than expected in the third season of ""Robin of Sherwood"". Again: Praed is, according to my info up to now, the one who left Sherwood for a stupid Verne-series nobody with brains will EVER remember for want to remember.",positive

38136,"A great compliment to one IMDb commentator, the wondered why this series did't ""get into trouble"" for longer than most others in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. It is not true that this process will get worse if it continues. I’ll post some thoughts on the accomplishment of some movies when I post this idea, no: Robin Hood’s effort. First of all, Robert Eddie (Gisborne), among us, is always alive. Nothing is more interesting than both seasons (if you want to) in this very special series. At the same time, I fully agree with Terry Jones' recent findings and changes in the historical documents of Egypt, Greece, Rome, Constantinople, the Goths and Barbarians, and the middle page and the Crusades (yes, Python Month - Terry Jones): If you read those amazing and interesting documents Jones , you will better understand all the historical origins of Carpenter, author of the Sherwood Robin series (possibly Brother John Carpenter, made ""Something,"" and three of them. Brothers make music) and plan to tell us. The screenwriters for the first season of ""Dick Turpin"", ""Catweazle"" and ""Sherwood's Robin"", better known as ""Kip"" Carpenter, are my filmmakers. You’re better than all the other critics of this “sword and magic” because of the “flaws” of this series (taken from Robin of Sherwood Welling) (I don’t see it), because there are other baseless criticisms. it exists then and now. That's why, the more you understand ""Sherwood Robin"", the harder you become. He will hate the third time at the beginning. Not only that: I’ve seen all of this for myself, and most importantly, I remember fondly the first two seasons of the year — even though Robin’s factor Prader left the series because of the great success behind this series. titled ""Jules Verne's New Adventures"" to find a role that can pay the most - the title highlighted the emptiness of the whole project. Recommendations are for money, not for fame and fortune. You represent yourself the real ""real"" factors of the past, in your current time, the famous faces and legends and roles of Robin's mythology. The possibilities for this list can be made and need to be further developed without the undermining content and knowledge of history and the accuracy of the revolt in current political issues. Again, it has to be said: Prader made the foolish decision to leave Sherwood's Robin in a silly series to make Verne's story and was skilfully integrated into the photography of the story, forcing the main character to act. However, it is still somewhat catastrophic. After all: if anyone knew this, and Connery could be announced by this father, but little Connery did't ""hold this pride"" at all, the way I originally chose, then people would certainly enjoy a third time. Sadly, the script is no longer written by Superman Kip Capone, so we no longer have the historical origins of critical thinking and freedom as ""Elsdon Witch"", because in ""The King's Fool"", these two set the first series of A) interest, B) history education and C) excellent work . === ""Don't believe the lion!"" It was used in the depravity of the Crusades and the war against Normandy, France. He killed and killed tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in a “complete” Crusade. The soldiers even slaughtered their starving children. Most importantly, after being captured by the Saracens (Muslims) in the Crusades, Britain was slowed out of this ransom, a hundred points (at that time, in the eleventh century, amounted to three and thirty billion ""Zero"") zero zero - the current value of dollars), let him return safely, then visited England for a month and returned to Normandy (France, where the Norman invaders would first take part) to take part in the Progress (someone was King's Fool ""). (quoted from Clive Mantle, Robin When criticizing for criticizing the king.) Give me your courage and your strength, not your words! ""After a while, Richard secretly called Robin's assassination secret. So, the Crusaders are not"" bars "". as Sean Connery in this competition. Prince "". Yes, as Terry Jones said: This is a lie, a false lie! ""Sean plays a funny and lovable man. This boy has done better than expected in the third season of Sherwood's Robin. sword and magic.

38136,"A great compliment from another IMDb commentator who wondered why the series did't ""catch"" in its time as much as the other eighty's series. It is not true that this would have been worse if it had continued. As I post these comments, I will post some thoughts on another film's success, not: Robin Hood's experimental efforts. First of all, Robert Eddy (Gusburn), among all of us, lives forever. Nothing is as interesting as the two, if anyone wants, the three seasons of this series are completely different. And at the same time I fully agree with the new and varied discoveries of Terry Jones' historical writings on Egypt, Greece, Rome, Constantinople, the Goths and the Berberis, as well as the pages between the religious wars (yes, Monte Python Terry ). Am Jones): If you've never seen Jones, clever and funny documents would work better, understanding all the background of history better. Carpenter, author of the Robin of Sherwood series (possibly John Carpenter's brother). , Who made ""something."" His third brother made the music) to tell us. The author of ""Dick Turpin"", ""Kate Weasel"" and the first two episodes of ""Robin of Sherwood"", called ""Cape"" Carpenter, towns my film. You are the best of all the critics of this ""sword and sorcery"" ""disability"" of the series (taken from Robin of Sherwood Webering) (which I don't see) and many other unsupported critiques in the past. Was and still is Therefore, once you get to know this ""Robin of Sherwood"" better, you will face a difficult time. You will start hating the third season. Not only that: I personally pushed it forward, and on top of that, I only had the first two seasons in my deepest heart - note that Pard, Robin's character left the series, because after the series a It was a huge success, given A well-played role in the Canadian apathetic series ""Jules Verne's New Adventures"" - already the title shows the emptiness of the whole project. Parade wanted money, not fame, the did't live with this gang and skin, even: as a feature. Characters representing the latest ""real"" with Robin Legend characters in your current time. The power of the current political issues could not have been allowed and greatly increased without the Scandinavian insulting material and historical message and rebellious accuracy. Also, the responsibility to say: Change in the main character was forced to make the foolish decision to release Robin of Sherwood in the remake series of Raintails and was brilliantly woven into the recording of the story. However, in some cases it is a disaster. However, if anyone is informed about it, and that Connery may have been advertised by this father, but this young Connery did not ""Expel Praed"", as I did before about racism. Thought, so anyone can fully enjoy the third season. . It is unfortunate that this text was no longer written by Superman Cape Carpenter, so we no longer have the critical and freely imaginative historical background that exemplifies ""The Witch of Elsden"", ""The Kings Fool"". I, in two episodes. In the first series, A) is funny, B) is historically instructive and C) does good things. === ""Don't trust the lion!"" Unlike many other characters who also wished for this death for this power, Richard Lane Hart, as shown in RoS and as a true historian, John had more authority than others, but it was only used in it. Religious war against Normandy in France and a negative view of the war. It slaughtered and killed tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in ""holy"" wars, and the soldiers also date children who were starving. Furthermore, after the enslavement of the Sarsin (Muslims) in religious wars, Britain was pressured to accept this ransom, so Marx zero (now eleventh century, compared to thirty billion - zero 'zero' zero-value), To bring it back safely , and then return to Normandy (France, where the Normandy invaders began) in the newly-arrived religious wars in England for a month (an article reads ""The Fool's King""). In this new religious system, which could avenge the abduction, Richard Leon Hart also ""destroyed the world of money"" (in the words of Clive Mantel, in which Robin's speeches also criticized the king). Are). Robin criticized the war over Richard's unpopular decision, speaking to Richard himself, saying, ""The poor have given them all to set you free. How can you ask them more?"" - Richard: ""Give me your courage and strength, not your words!"" . Later, in private, Richard ordered Robin's assassination. That is why crusaders can be real ""savages"". PS: Already when I saw Costner at ninety-one, I was upset, because after that, I learned from a history lesson at school that Richard was not a good person as Sean Connery showed in this post. ۔ ""King of Thieves."" Yes, as Terry Jones put it: a lie, a deceptive lie!

38136,"The biggest compliment from another IMDb commentator who wondered why this series ‘didn’t stick’ to its time that lasted as many other series did. It’s not true that the series would have been worse if it had continued. When I post my comments, I’ll be posting ideas about the facts of another film, instead: the trial of the legendary Robin Hood. First, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are all of us, you are eternal. There’s nothing as fun as both, if one will, the three seasons in this series are completely different. At the same time fully agree with the new results and revolutions in the history of Terry Jones concerning Egypt, Greece, Rome, Constantinople, the Goths and Barbarians, and the Middle Ages and the Crusaders (yes, THE Monthy Python-Terry Jones funny -Jones-Docs the more you understand all the historical elements of the carpenter, author Robin of the Sherwood-series (which happens to brother John Carpenter, who made ""Things"", their third brother is makes music), for The author of ""Dick Turpin"", ""Catweazle"" and the first two seasons of ""Robin of Sherwood"", known as ""Kip"" Carpenter, the leader of my film. He is better than all the other critics in this article and the ""magic"" of ""flaws"" (from Robin of Sherwood Webring) in this series (which I don't see) there is other baseless criticism. Many then.aa now So, when you learn this “Robin of Sherwood” well, it will be of you are serious. At first you hated the third season. Not only that: I myself went through this, and moreover, I only spent the first two seasons in my deepest heart - DESPITE the fact that Praed appeared in this series, Robin’s article, because after the series was the had a huge success, being given a well -paid role in a comedy series in Canada called “The New Adventures of Jules Verne” - whose title shows the emptiness of the whole project. Praed went for money, not fame, the did’t go with this gang of thugs and skin, I mean: issues. The characters personally represent those behind the “true”, currently famous and legendary faces and characters of Robin-Legend. The power of this series has been and should have been developed without compromising the essence and message of history and the correctness of the rebellion in relation to current political issues. Again, it must be said: The major change in role was forced by Praed’s foolish decision to leave Robin of Sherwood in a remake of a series of dramatic Verne-tales. recorded for story recording. It is still a tragedy in some respects. However: If one finds out, and Connery may have actually announced this father, but that young Connery is NOT AT ALL “Ceryan Praed away”, as I thought at first, then someone will fully enjoy the third season. . Sadly the text was no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we don’t have important historical background of independent thinking like “The Witch of Elsdon”, “The King’s Fool”, two parts of the previous series a) funny, B ) historical teaching and C) act admirably. == ""Don't trust Leon!"" Unlike many other factors hoping to die back to power, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and as a true historian, is a higher authority than John. others, but they only used this bad idea of ​​the Crusades and the war against Normandy in France. He killed and murdered more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in “deliberate” crusades, and these soldiers even date the children they had starved to death. Moreover, after the Saracen (Muslim) conquest of the Crusades, the British were compelled by this redemption, a hundred.zero symbol (at that time, in the eleventh century, comparable to approximately thirty Billion - soddonzero '' zero'zero. Incident ""Stupidity. King""). In this new crusade, which may have been a form of revenge for this capture, Richard Lionheart was once again “out of the country of money” (according to the mouth of Clive Mantle, when Robin’s speeches greeted even the King ). Robin criticizes this non-social warlord Richard, headlines Richard himself, saying ""The poor have paid for everything to liberate you, how can you ask so much?"" - Richard: ""Give me your courage and strength, don't give me your words!"" . Then, in particular, Richard orders Robin to be killed. Thus, the crusaders were the real “barbarians”. P. S: When I watched Kostner ninety one, I was upset, because eventually, I realized in the course of school history that Richard was not a good man as Sean Connery introduced in this post sent by “Prince of Thief "". Well, as Terry Jones said: This is a lie, a deceptive trick! According to my data so far, the one who left Sherwood for the silly Verne series will not be remembered by anyone mentally this desire to be remembered.",positive
38136,"Not only: I have seen this for myself, and besides, I am the only one. Although Robin Praed left the series with great success after the series, Canadian comedy series ""Jules Verne's New Adventure"" received a more rewarding role - the title highlighted the emptiness of everything.

Normally, these movies require all four items. PG rating is appropriate - it does not use the word ""f"" twice as in ""Sixteen Candles"" and has a short explicit nude exposure. I just hope the romance between Corey Haim and this lover can grow even stronger. This movie always has a tough site, and the best possible plans are pushed aside. Instead of developing a chemical reaction between the two, we watched their three-minute indifference in their romantic endeavours. They sent a kiss when they sent it, but there was almost no chemical reaction, and it seemed necessary. ""Dream Machine"" is not a gem, but it is good, and pure entertainment.

I found this site by accident, while looking for other Marine Corps movies. So, let me start by telling you that I played in the movie Marine Boot, Pvt. Labarsky, and was stationed at MCRDep, San Diego at the time. Jack Webb and crew selected fifteen Permanent Staff, some of whom had speech units, and fifteen other Marines who have now completed Boot Camp. It consisted of Platoon and Marines who displayed various “DIs”. To my recollection, Capt. Iyo Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) is not in the navy. We spent about three weeks in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot), CA where we filmed the part of the film we were’t involved in, and then completed the other photos when we left. So as I wander around, let me clarify some of the questions in the previous notes as much as I can. “Father Cuff” commented on your Platonic ability to shout “Yes Sir” without moving and so on, Yes we shouted for Voice Guys, and that was when the scene was shot. When you remember your friends in the Marines, when you did’t start asking you DI and before they finished, you exhaled your breath making it easier for you to yell into your upper lung for proper answer. It did. ""It was built with photos from Paris Island and field trips and maritime consultants from Paris Island. Sorry, you're in the real buildings, not the buildings. Because of the accident, and the Navy did't want to do anything .affects one of the Marines family members who died that night. Remember, also at the time of the self-portraits I thought this conversation was very clean and obviously it did’t come down to real life. In the fifties, that's what it had to do. One story I wanted to share was about the interaction that took place between us Marines and Crew Films, and between Crew Film and Jack Webb. At the beginning of the custom the navy responded of ""Yes sir"" to whoever moved in. When I entered the second week it was normal to hear ""Yes Sir"" from all sides. On stage someone would shout a request to do about the light and not far from the top of the window placed a of the answer ""Yes Sir"" will appear. All this in one of your informal meetings, Jack Webb said. ""If I only knew I received so much respect from the ship's crew, the men brought you years ago."" Lt. was there. grew up in San Diego to play the role of DI in the other chapter and Jack Webb's fight, but one piece in a row the got the number thirty -two, but Webb tried it. work as desired and do not show anything black and tolerant of him. The next day they used Paris Island consultant DI Sgt. from the Island of Paris and worked well. At the time I was quite a cameraman and I met the Good Camera Man to get some clues and because of this the would give me a still shot and some thirty-fivemm daily shooting film that was not used. I cut out some of those films and made them pages. After the movie came out on a VHS tape (DI, eleven thousand, seven hundred and six B & W / one hundred and six minutes.) My children and grandchildren exploded when they tried to use who could find me of most screen time.",positive

45240,"This movie was for a while in my collection, but it was't before a friend of mine reminded me about it  until I decided that I should watch it. I did not know much about Close to Leo  just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of page movie and it deals with a very serious topic  Aids. Although the person who has aids  is Leo  the scenario wraps around the way in which Marcel (the youngest brother of Leo) coupes with the sickness of this relative. At first everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel  the is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of this brother  the fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young Marcel. I know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that the will not be table to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves . With exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from Marcel, they have left quite an impression for me  the way they supported their son  even after discovering the truth about this sexuality and this sickness. The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel along with Leo to Paris to meet this sex boyfriend was quite a gesture from them most families I know will be reluctant to do that. There is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together  you can see them being real friends , concern about each other.

47330,"""Walking with Dinosaurs"" is absolutely brilliant in every regard. Kenneth Branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen. The script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework, it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go. The music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it needs to be. But the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well. The scenery is breathtaking, and the dinosaurs look so real, thanks to the simply astounding effects. This is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids too. In conclusion, this is a must watch. Not only did I love this, but this is quite possibly the best documentary I have never seen.

47330,"""Walking with dinosaurs"" shines in every aspect. The text of the documentary really looks like researchers and writers have done their homework. This place is amazing, and the dinosaurs look realistic because of the amazing effects. There are two factors who work in completely different categories. At the top of this game are young playwright and Maximilian Shell. All the nuances of Frank are obvious. On the rocks are Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I can't imagine how Shell and Plow Wright could have played so well while Gilbert and Roberts were working to fight their magic. Gilbert spends all this time. It was as if Dad knew a lot about the ghetto. She's a wonderful Anne Frank. For Helen Keller, her run was short but not bad. This is blasphemy. Doris Roberts made Mrs. Van Dam is just angry. Playing the role of a sexually hungry woman is an inappropriate choice, and the presence of flirtation and dissatisfaction has created a major problem for Whet Acherhuis. It needs to be paid for by a woman who can reassure us that she at least remembers what it was like to explode. Its weight is not a problem. Young Plymouth could play this role well. Roberts was at the forefront of this process, getting more printing and more opportunities. His performance there shamefully shows this weakness as an factor. He has many scenes of this own with James Coco and Clive Revel, Gilbert and Roberts, and, although strong, they have completely failed to repair the damage done by their partners. Revel is a clever feature that can make Ed Wine look like the icon in the first movie. He does not have the support of Gilbert. Brings color to all scenes. I read your comments with frustration that you grew up watching this version, which is full of restrictions on these games. This is a tutorial on how the version you watch affects you first. It forces me to reconsider my review of some of the lower quality products I used to like as a child. I encourage you to look real.

The scenery is amazing and the dinosaurs look real because of the amazing results. : forty-seven thousand, three hundred and thirty-one> This is a real person who should not leave the stable. It has two characters who play roles in completely different roles. The leaders in their play are Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. how well they play when Gilbert and Roberts use their anti-magic. Colored. Gilbert ruined everything the had. Just as the father of the slums knows better. By Ann Frank Light. Her play for Helen Keller was still thin, but not bad. This is blasphemy. Doris Roberts angered Mrs. Van Dam. It's the wrong choice, to act like a sexually hungry woman. Her foolish, unsatisfied life has put Archer Hughes in a lot of trouble. This requires the woman to play, which can lead us to believe that she at least remembers what it is like to be attractive. Her weight is not a problem. Joan Plowright could play this role well. When the made the film, Roberts was at an all-time high in this career and received many media outlets and many opportunities. His performance there in disgrace showed this weakness as an factor. Most of the shows are James Coco and Clive Reville and Gilbert and Roberts. Although they are strong, they cannot do the damage done by their partners. Reville is a subtle, know-how type of iconic performance given by Ed Wynne in the first movie. He did not receive Gilbert's support. Draw a color for each scene. I was disappointed when I read the comments of those who grew up watching this version, full of adherence to these games. This is a lesson about how the change you saw affected you in the first place. This made me rethink my adherence to some of the inferior products I had enjoyed since childhood.

47647,"This movie looked like a classic in the cheesy heights slasher genre, which is my favourite genre of them all, so when I saw it was Free on Demand, I had to watch it! It stars Caroline Munro, from both Dr. Phibes films (she was this wife that died!), Dracula A. D. one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, The Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac, and Faceless. Brought to you by the people behind Don't Open Til Christmas and Pieces, Heres my thoughts on this. It opens on April Fools Day, where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower, and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet (all while hes naked!). The coach puts a stop to it, but both parties swear revenge. But, the cool kids send up burning the nerd alive. Cut to the future, and its beth High School reunion, for so they think (bwahahha?). The only jones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid, and its April Fools Day (or really, the day before April Fools, but the fun starts at midnight), yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall. Then they finally break into the school and it starts storming. Inside they find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them, each of their blockers and belongings, along with Marty's (the nerds) locker and yearbook. They also find the old black janitor/caretaker who spends this time saying ""Oooh lesser! Yesser! I don't want no trouble, sir!"" and then is killed instantly. Pretty pointless character, but hes still my favourite. The movie takes a page out of Alien's book, in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see! Thats when everyone realizes that they're there to die, and they start freaking out, except for Shirley, who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this. Of course, it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off (very cool, mind you) The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and Marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask. Whats their plan? ""All we have to do is stay awake and wait still noon. Marty wont kill us during mid-day!"". Seriously, that what the said. Apparently you can only kill at nighttime. But will they survive through the night? Who will live and who will die? And why are all the bodies disappearing? Rent, buy, for steal this great movie to find out! The movie is actually very good, filled with clickés (car wont start, DAMMIT!) and just plain slasher fun. Not to mention they all have names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to all of you! And, not to mention, it has a Spin Off! one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine's Cutting Class is a spin-off from this slasher gem, and that movie starts the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell.

Yet, suddenly, they're being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pick-up truck. Hmm, where have I seen this premise before? Oh yeah, now I remember, we've seen this a THOUSAND times before already, and approximately nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than ""Rest Stop""! This weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans, as it does't feature a single original twist for memorable gimmick. It's very sadistic and nasty, but every teenkill-slasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays, so that's no real surprise anymore, neither. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots. Writer/director John Shiban damn well realized that the ultra-thin basic storyline nearly was't enough to fill a whole movie with, and thus the stuffs up this film like a Thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material. Nicole's boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in California. Killing off her character right away would't result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks, suffers from visions (?) in which she talks to the deranged killer's previous victims and she has deeply emotional (and boring) conversations with a police officer who just won't die even though a truck iran over him. twice! The dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and they're definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movie's length I've never seen. Instead of all the pointless padding, Shiban should have paid more attention to building up tension and make this lead characters a little more likable. Jaimie Alexander's character Nicole is an annoying and brainless girl, and you won't really care whether she'll survive the ordeal for not. Her boyfriend Jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still were't painful enough, if you ask me. I counted exactly three sequences, all including torture and gratuitous mutilation, that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face. That's still way too few for a nowadays horror movie. Basically, ""Rest Stop"" is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Hostel"", but you're better off watching the originals. This was the first film of the new production company called 'Raw Feed'. They're promoting themselves as the new name in great horror, but they'll have to come up with something much better than ""Rest Stop"" if they want us to believe that.",negative

Rather than all the insignificant fillings, Slate should focus more on the formation of stress and make this protagonist more attractive. The role played by Jaimie Alexander, Nicole, is an annoying and irrational girl, and you don’t really care if you will survive this crisis. If you ask me, her boyfriend Jesse and the police are all complaining, and their brutal death is not yet tragic enough. I specifically mentioned three successive episodes, all of which involved torture and nonviolence. In today's horror movie, this is still very young. Basically, ""Rest Stop"" is just trying to take advantage of the success of films like ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Hostel"", but you'd better watch the first version.

Suddenly, though, they are frightened and terrified of an entangled psychopath in an old, rusty truck. Hmmm, where did I first see this system? Oh, yeah I remember, we've seen it a thousand times before, and maybe nine hundred and ninety-nine other cases are much better than ""Rest Stop""! This weak and gloomy new film also discredits the understanding of horror fans who don't need anything, because it does't have the first twist of a memorable trick. It's very sad and ugly, but all the Ten Kill Slash games are sad and ugly these days, so it's no longer a real surprise. The big problem with this product is the surprisingly large number of dumb holes and tiny pieces. Writer / director John Sheeban is well aware that the basic premise is not enough to complete the whole film, so the film has to be wrapped up with difficult and mediocre material as Thanksgiving Turkey. Nicole's boyfriend disappeared from a useless and dirty lounge in California. Killing this character right away won't lead to very long films and as a result the meets a family of weird cars, tormented by thoughts (?) Where the talks to former victims of a depressed killer. And has a deep (and disturbing) conversation with him. A police officer who will not die even if a truck arrives. You! Dumb sites have never led anywhere and it's a sad and frustrating attempt to lengthen the film that I've never seen. Instead of all the empty stakes, Sheiban should have focused more on creating tension and making these important characters less attractive. Jimmy Alexander's character Nicole is a disturbing and irrational girl, and you don't care if you live for not. Both her boyfriend Jessie and the policeman failed to cry, and if you ask me, her brutal death is no longer painful. I recorded three sequences, all of which involved unreasonable violence and distortion, which was scary and amusing enough to put a sad smile on my face. This is rare in today's horror movies. Basically, ""Rest Stop"" is just a sad attempt to make money on the success of movies like ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Hostel"", but it's better when you see the real thing.

Basically, the success of movies like ""Rest Stop"", ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Hostel"" is just a sad attempt to make money, but it's better when you see the real thing. Oh yeah, now I remember, we've seen it a thousand times before, and about nine hundred and ninety-nine were far better than ""rest stops"" in some respects! I've listed three live series, all of which involve unwarranted harassment and biting, which was nice and fun enough to put a painful smile on my face.

Suddenly, however, they are intimidated and frightened by an annoying psychopath on an old and busy pickup truck.

Basically, ""Rest Stop"" is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Hostel"", but you're better off watching the originals. Oh yeah, now I remember, we've seen this a THOUSAND times before already, and approximately nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than ""Rest Stop""! I counted exactly three sequences, all including torture and gratuitous mutilation, that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face. They're promoting themselves as the new name in great horror, but they'll have to come up with something much better than ""Rest Stop"" if they want us to believe that. Yet, suddenly, they're being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pick-up truck. Writer/director John Shiban damn well realized that the ultra-thin basic storyline nearly was't enough to fill a whole movie with, and thus the stuffs up this film like a Thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material.",negative
