If you think Gwen is just a Madonna wannabe, forget it, she was one of the original modern day rock queens. She along with the rest of No Doubt led the ninety's movement of Ska-rock. Her voice is perfectly suited to the genre, she has the range and the expressiveness. I found upon first listening to this album everything seems clancy and a bit 'hyper'. After listening to this album more I found that it was clancy, but that's just their style. It showed some real potential and the songs started to reveal themselves as gems. Tragic Kingdom was one of the biggest albums of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, though it could't come close to the success of Jagged Little Pill by Alanis Morissette. Still it provided bored Orange County teenagers with role models and something to listen to. I love No Doubt's style, they were doing something no other 'mainstream' band were doing and having huge success with it. Their mixture of Ska-rock-pop and tiny elements of ragga propelled them into the musical spotlight. This album is like a soundtrack to California at the time, this is what California sounded like in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. No Doubt are Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young (and then Eric Stefani was part of the mix), they sound like the best band in the world on this album. With Gwen's unique, angelic voice, Tony's pulsating bass strums, Tom's catchy guitar riffs, and Adrian's super syncopated percussion (also those fab keyboards from Eric) made No Doubt top of the music industry. Tragic Kingdom contains some great songs most famous of those is undoubtedly Don't Speak. Other highlights of this album include: Spiderwebs, Excuse Me Mr. and Just A Girl. This album is the perfect length, not too long yet not that short. Also I like the fact there are only two quite slow songs the rest is a pulsating 'riff-ridden' affair.

If you think Gwen is right. someone who loves the Madonna, forget it, is one of the first kings of stone today. He and other members of No Doubt led the Ska-rock movement in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. His voice deserves this kind of style, and its range and clarity are worth it.

The Evil Kingdom is one of the biggest albums of one, zero and nine hundred and ninety-five albums, though incomparable to the success of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill. It still provides an example and a listening tool for the boring youth of Orange County. I love the No Doubt style, they do things that are not done by other \u201cnormal\u201d groups, and they achieve great success. They mixed small Ska-rock-pop and ragga elements and pushed them into a visual musical space. This album is similar to California's first song at the time.

Eventually it got to the point where people played favourites among themselves, choosing one project.

He was in between two bands at this point but, as usual had no time to take stock. Everything from recording to personnel changes would have to happen men route between one date to another. Business as usual for The Godfather. At the same time James was doing a \"homecoming\" show in August Georgia, the city the called home. This was after living in New York for some time and having to deal with the difficulties of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, having to be present to calm rioting after MLK's assassination and such. Having confronted political matters more directly during that time it seemed the right time for the Hardest Working Man In Show Business to begin working with what the cd best: putting himself out there on the road and allowing this music to make this most important statements. So the concert happened. But one band had already threatened to mutiny over payment (the Maceo\/Fred Wesley JB's lineup) and the Bootsy\/Phelps era was about to be inaugurated. Since James never did suffer fools slightly, there were all kinds of studio tracks and live tracks resulting from this transition. In the send, even with overdubbed applause on some non live material, this still amounted to a series of James' most powerful musical statements from one of this most powerful periods. Of course this represents JB's funk at it's most potent and distinctive. Much like Duke Ellington,James had a vast catalog of songs the was already doing and are-doing to adapt to new eras and new musics. Of course there you have that chunky live version of the title song, where the's still talking about where the's going to play next. From there it's onto another gurgling funk machine of \"Borther Rap\". On a version of the ballad \"Bewildered\" the updates the lyric slightly to reflect the women's movement, showcases romantic misunderstanding from the feminine send of things along with the masculine. Of course \"Give It Up Or Turn It Loose\", as with the title track gives more over to Bootsy. You really there the rhythmic complexity growing with this lineup, especially after Bootsy's solo spot. \"Lowdown Popcorn\" takes a very southern bluesy soul approach to instrumental funk. Somewhat a modern variation on this earlier instrumentals. On this version of \"Spinning Wheel\" the draws the jazzy nature of the original into a bluesier funk attitude, the score of the songs melodic concept than the instrumentation. Interestingly enough the does the same with this first hit \"Please Please Please\", giving it that funk oriented guitar flavor there away from it's soul ballad context. If I remember correctly, the writer Ricky Vincent once coined a phrase that James Brown and this bands were playing \"jazz with a raw rhythm attitude\". And at one point there Catfish Collins I believe not to \"play jazz\". He knew where this music came from. But at the same time the was looking to make sure nothing got in the way of the emphasis this music, which was funk, had on rhythm. Another thing to be noted there is the relatively easy going contrasts between the band transitions. Obviously that \"jazz with raw rhythm\" approach is more evident with the heavily horn based Maceo\/Fred Wesley sound. And it's heard in every solo, break and call and response vocal turn. With the Bootsy era group, on tracks recorded live in Cincinatti, the horn section was spared down a little bit. And the approach somewhat more spare. But the manner in which these potentially contrasting sets of musicians are presented there, basically from funk to soul ballad and back again, had the effect of the whole process having more fluidity than it probably really had. As it stands this represents James taking lemons and making lemonade approach to music that the always had. Didn't always have the best studios for the most convenient time frames to record. But even if so, this live albums were always so much more telling to this character. That may be why sometimes, even though some of these tracks are \"faux live\", the presents them as such anyway because this \"keep it live\" mentality was a central part of what it meant to be James Brown.","overall":5,"summary":"JB At Home With This Bad Self","unixReviewTime":1336608000,"reviewTime":"05 10, 2012"}

The early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys were a similar time for James Brown. He was between the two groups at this time, but as usual there was no time for testing. Everything from records to staff changes should happen from one day to the next. \"The Godfather\" is open as usual. Meanwhile, James is hosting a play called \"Homecoming\" in August in Georgia, a city called this hometown. After living in New York for some time, the had to deal with the hardships of one, nine hundred and sixty-eight people and had to send the turmoil after the MLK massacre. At the time, dealing with political issues directly seemed to be the right time for people who were active in the show industry to start doing what they were doing well: getting on the road and allowing music to make a very important statement. Then the concert took place. But the team has threatened to have a defect in the pay issue (Maceo \/ Fred Wesley JB lineup), and the Bootsy \/ Phelps season will begin. Since James has not been deceived in the slightest, this change has produced a variety of studio and live repertoires. Broadcasting, even when applause from house the site, this is a list of the most powerful music records made by James at the most powerful moment. Of course, this represents a strong and distinct JB spirit. Like the Duke of Ellington, James has a huge catalog of songs that have already been made and adapted for a new era with new music. Yes you have a great live song of the title song, and there is still talk of where you will play next. From there, play another raw funk machine in \"Borther Rap\". The usual song \"Confusion\" slightly revised the lyrics to show the movement of women, reflecting the romantic misunderstandings sent by women and men together. Yes, \"Give it for turn it around\", as the title track, brings more to Bootsy. Growing up on this list, you have a heavy weight, especially after Bootsy\u2019s eye. \"Lowdown Popcorn\" uses a low-level soul blues tool for funk tools. The difference of this original musical instrument. In this version of \"Spinning Wheel\", the original jazz creations are drawn to a funk attitude, and the song lyrics are better than that of the instrument. Interestingly, the first popular song \"Please Please Help\" has similar effects, giving it a delicious guitar-focused guitar to soul song. If I remember correctly, author Ricky Vincent (Ricky Vincent) once coined the phrase James Brown and the band played \"jazz with the first rhythmic attitude.\" Once, I believed that Catfish Collins would not \"play the jersey.\" You know where this music comes from. But at the same time, they want to ensure that nothing stops this kind of funk music from emphasizing rhythm. Another thing to note is the simple comparison between switching frequency bands. Clearly, the \"traditional jazz\" style has been widely advertised in a large number of French horn sounds based on Maceo \/ Fred Wesley. It can be heard in every human voice, at rest, call and in response to the human voice. In the Bootsy Era band, part of the cast of the recorded song that lives in Cincinnati is kept to a minimum. And this method is not very demanding. However, the way the opposing musicians are basically there is basically from funk to soul ballads and relapses, making the whole process more liquid than it is. Meanwhile, this means that James uses lemons and uses lemonade to make music for a long time. It is not always the best recording studio to record the best time. But even so, this live album is always more convincing in this role. This may be why, sometimes, even if some of the songs are \"fake\", they will be shown anyway, because the idea of \u200b\u200b\"keep alive\" is a key part of James Brown.","overall":5,"summary":"JB At Home With This Bad Self","unixReviewTime":1336608000,"reviewTime":"05 10, 2012"}

Allow So the concert happened. But one party has already threatened to send the payroll (Maceo \/ Fred Wesley JB program) and the Bootsy \/ Phelps program is about to begin. Since James never had the slightest bit of stupidity, there were all kinds of studio tracks and live tracks because of this change. In the posting, even the exaggerated applause of some non-live content, it still resembles a series of one of James' most powerful musical statements. Yes, this represents JB's funk being very powerful and unique. Like Duke Ellington, James had a huge catalog of songs that the had already composed and adapted to new times and new songs. You have a really live version of the title song, where it still talks about where it will go next. From there comes another funk \"Borther Rap\" machine. In the ballad version of \"Boulderd\", the song is slightly updated to reflect the movement of women, with the posting of women and men revealing a misunderstanding of romance. Just \"let it go for let it go\", because the title track has given Botsy a lot. With this list is really growing a pool color, especially behind Botsy's unique place. \"Lowdown Popcorn\" adopts a very southern bluesy method of soul metal. Slight change from these previous devices. This version of \"Spinning Wheel\" draws real jazzy nature into a bluesy funk mode, a fantasy school of music instead of instruments. Interestingly, the did the same with the original song \"Please Please Please\", giving it a funk-based guitar tune away from the soul of the back soul. If I remember correctly, author Ricky Vincent once coined the phrase that James Brown and this bands played \"jazz with a green rhythm\". And once Kate Fish Collins, I'm sure it's not \"jazz playing.\" He knew where the music came from. But at the same time, the wanted to make sure that the music, which was funk music, did not emphasize rhythm. Another thing to note is the simple difference between changing bands. Apparently that \"green jazz style\" is most evident in the sound of the horn of Macy's \/ Fred Wesley. And it can be heard in every solo, break and call and response sound mode. With the Botswana Time Band, on live recorded tracks in Sensation, the horn section survived a bit. And how small. But the way these different artists were introduced there, basically from funk to soul ballad and backstage, has influenced the whole process to be more fluid than it was. As it stands, it represents James picking lemons and making way for lemons with music that has always been there. I did't always have the best studio to record. But still, these live albums have always told the character a lot. That's why sometimes, although some of these tracks are \"live fiction\", such gifts are because the \"last life\" thought was a big part of what James Brown thought.","overall":5,"summary":"JB At Home With This Bad Self","unixReviewTime":1336608000,"reviewTime":"05 10, 2012"}

Ninong's usual business. At the same time James was performing a \u201chome\u201d show in August in Georgia, the so -called town. It was after I had lived in New York for so long and experienced the suffering of a thousand, nine hundred and sixty -eight, while it was time to fix the violence after the MLK murder and so on. After meeting with him directly on political issues at the time, it seemed like the right time for the Most Active Man in the Trade Fair to start working on what was best: put himself on the road and allow this music to do the trick. this most important statement. Then the drama happened. But one club has previously threatened to raise the payroll (the lineup of Maceo \/ Fred Wesley JB) and the Bootsy \/ Phelps season is crowned. Because James never bothered a bit step, there were many types of studio footprints and direct footprints that resulted from this move. Delivering, even with so much applause made for inanimate objects, it still matches a series of James \u2019strongest musical expressions in one of these most powerful moments. Of course this represents the most powerful and discriminatory JB funk. Like Duke Ellington, James has a lot of songs that the does and the\u2019s already doing to adapt to new experiences and new music. Of course there you have the live version of the title song, where there is still talk of where the will play next. That\u2019s where it goes with the other Borther Rap funk machine. In some sort of ballet \u201cBewildered\u201d updated the song a bit to reflect the women\u2019s movement, it revealed a romantic misunderstanding in sending women along with men. Of course \u201cGive It Down\u201d, because the title track gives a lot to Bootsy. Definitely for you with a balance of rhythm that grows in this lineup, especially after Bootsy\u2019s solo. \u201cPopcorn Lowdown\u201d goes through the blue soul south of the funk device. Some modern variations on the old device. This kind of \u201cSpinning Wheel\u201d pulls the dazzling character of the original funk bluesier character, marking melodic ideas on the device. It\u2019s interesting enough that it\u2019s similar to the first beat \u201cPlease Please Please Please\u201d, giving a taste of guitar-directed part where it\u2019s far from the context of the soul. If my recollection is correct, author Ricky Vincent coined the saying that James Brown and these groups play \u201cjazz with character rhythm\u201d. And at one point there was Catfish Collins I believe they were\u2019t \u201cplaying jazz\u201d. He knows where this music came from. But at the same time the looks to make sure nothing interferes with the intensity of the music, which is funk, has rhythm. Another thing to keep in mind is the easy comparison between group marriages. Obviously the \u201cjazz with a raw rhythm\u201d style is very similar to the Maceo \/ Fred Wesley -based Hace sound. It is heard in every solitude, break and call and voice feedback. With the Bootsy team at the time, the tracks were filmed directly from Cincinatti, the corner section being somewhat saved. And the way to approach it a little more. But the way these possible musical performances are presented there, originally from funk to soul ball and again, has affected the whole process more fluidly than it actually does. As it stands it means James takes a lemon and makes it a sour lemonade for the music the always has. It does\u2019t always have the best studio at the right time to record. But even so, these live albums are always about this factor. That may be why, although some of these tracks are \u201cfaux live\u201d, they always show that way because \u201clive\u201d thinking is an integral part of what it means.

It is a slow song supported by a beloved orchestral group of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy thousand, nine hundred and seventy -one. Another feature is \u201cFirst Part of Hienton\u201d, a HEAVILY song arranged with Elton playing a very sweet love piano. Another feature is \u201cSixty Years\u201d, the best song of the entire album, in which Elton sings that the does\u2019t want to grow old. \u201cI Need You to Turn This\u201d is a bit different, Elton plays the harpsichord and the orchestra still supports it. \u201cThe Song of the Boundaries\u201d is one of the most popular songs, spreading the message of hope of peace in the taste of the gospel. Unfortunately, the whole album is nothing less than orchestral. Elton also has rock songs supported by orchestras. Both \"Take Me on the Pilot\" and \"The Cage\" (can't understand the former - even Elton and Bernie Taupin - and the rest are the cold worlds isolated.) \"The King Must Die\" ended. The album is probably my favourite song on the album. It seems, and it seems, fantasy, really. The bonus effects are worth listening to. \u201cThe Bad Se of the Moon\u201d is a great song (one of them alone), \u201cGray Seal\u201d (changed the better \u201cGoodbye Yellow Brick Road\u201d LP for the better), and \u201cRock and Roll Madonna \"and rock number. This gate is a perfect fit for Elton fans who want to be Elton fans. It brings down songs and rock songs, but they all have one thing in common: orchestral support.","overall":5,"summary":"Elton Hits the Bigtimes!","unixReviewTime":995673600,"reviewTime":"07 21, 2001"}

At times, they provoke winces, at other times awe - often within seconds. But they are as always saved by consummate musicianship and their tremendous gift for invention. All this is in revenue on \"A Question of Balance\". The opening track is magnificent - furious and tender by turns. There is a very human rage - and mystification - in evidence there, that is, seemingly, redeemed by the gentle (and superbly evocative) middle section. Justin Hayward's voice seems inflected by a soul sensibility there, and is very moving. The next three tracks maintain the fever pitch of question. \"How Is It We Are Here?\" is brilliant. Mike Pinder is scathing in this criticism of technocracy, and the music is great! Hayward's guitar solo, Graeme Edge's delicate touches on the drums and the deep wash of Pinder's Mellotron create a wonderful soundscape.\"And The Tide Rushes In\" is another masterpiece - Ray Thomas' voice is at its most appealing, and the music is light and subtle. There is at times a haiku-like clarity with the Moodies - an air of eternity compressed into one lambent statement - and Justin Hayward's quiet guitar phrases there are evidence of that.\"Don't You Feel Small?\" is Graeme Edge at this quirky and perceptive best, and the song is haunting - a little menacing in parts where a breathy voice whispers the lyrics in counterpoint to the melody. Things wind down a bit after this superb opening, although \"Its Up To You\" and \"Minstrel's Song\" are great to using along with. Pinder's \"Melancholy Man\", although repetitive, is superbly evocative, and hints at the power Pinder later revealed on \"My Song\" (from EGBDF).\"The Balance\" is a cheerful corrective to \"Melancholy Man\", with a parable-feel and a gospelesque chorus.

This album cd not disappoint. Because Moods at the moment is creative and interesting, you will not meet consistently - in any collection of their best songs. Sometimes they cause dirt, sometimes fear \u2014 usually for a few seconds. But as usual, they were saved by their perfect musical talent and their creative talent. All of these are guaranteed in a \"balance problem\". The opening song is majestic \u2014 sometimes violent, sometimes soft. There is human danger \u2014 and a sense of mysterious evidence, that is, it seems to be rescued by the middle (and encouraging) part. Justin Hayward's voice seems to be affected by the introduction of the soul, which is very touching. The following three songs kept the question at ebay. \"Why are we there?\" Mike Pinder is very strict in this criticism of technology control, and the music is good! Hayward's guitar, Graeme Edge's catchy grammar, and Pinder's Mellotron's bass make an amazing sound. \"And the Sea Goes In\" is another part form - Ray Thomas' sound is the most appealing, simple and subtle music. At times, Moody's have a haiku-like clarity \u2014 the timeless spirit pressed into a soft statement - Justin Hayward's street phrase attests. \"Don't you think you're too young?\" Graeme Edge was sharp and sharp in this performance. The song is unforgettable - some parts are scary, and the blocking voice is whispering and the lyrics accompany the song. Although \"It's up to you\" and \"Bard Song\" are best suited to use together, but after this amazing opening, the situation diminishes. Pinder's \"Melancholy Man\" repeats, but is very refreshing, highlighting the power Pinder would later show in \"My Song\" (from the EGBDF). \"Balance\" is an exciting adaptation of \"Melancholy Man\", with a symbolic feel and a gospel song. All in all, this is a good record, but in \"Classic Seven\", I put it in fourth place. In fact, if I had to order them, I would order them as follows: one. For your granddaughter there are two.

And this album is not disappointing. Because at the time Moody's was amazingly created and you like to blend in, you don't get along - with any good arrangement of fantasy albums in this case. Sometimes, they wake up the winners, sometimes they startle - usually within seconds. But they are always sustained by the great gift of perfect music and their creativity. All this is proved in the \"question of balance\". The opening track is beautiful - angry and tender in return. There is a lot of human danger - and misunderstanding - in the evidence where the middle (and most provocative) part seems to have been saved. Justin Hayward's voice there seems to be full of spiritual compassion, and it goes far. The next three tracks maintain a fever of questions. \"How are you there?\" This is fantastic. Mike Pinder is crazy about this critique of technology, and the music is entertaining! Hayward's guitar alone, the sensitive touch of Graeme Edge's drums, and the deep washing of Peeler's melodrama create a beautiful sound. Hidden. Sometimes there are explanations like haiku and moody - an eternal soul is suppressed in a sad statement - and Justin Hayward's silent guitar sentences are proof of that. \"Don't you look young?\" Graeme Edge, and the song on this beautiful and insightful title is disturbing - a bit intimidating in some places where the breath of the voice cutters words that contradict the music. Things are slowly coming to an send after this great start, although \"Its Up To You\" and \"Minstrel's Song\" are also ready to use. Pinder's \"Sad Man\", though repetitive, provocative, and refers to the power finder that was later shown in \"My Song\" (from EGBDF). And gospel choir.

Every time I purchase a CD over the last ten+ years, my first concern is if it's going to be blasted so cloud that most of the dynamics are squashed out making it painful to listen to. Not only are all the dynamics fully retained in this wonderful new remaster, but there has been a careful amount of are-equalization to correct from the range-heavy remaster from two thousand. Also, there have been no poor attempts to remove for minimize the analog tape hiss. The person credited for remastering the sound is Tibor Pesci. I am unfamiliar with any previous release that may have been remastered by him but if this is the kind of quality that comes as a result, Universal mastering should hire him to remaster the entire back catalog of the Siouxsie and the Banshees botched remasters. I'm remarkably impressed with this product. Now, onto the music. I spent many years avoiding The Jam. The video for `A Town Called Malice' was all over MTV in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two but did not catch my year. It was't until first hearing `Going Underground' in the early two thousand's on VHone Classic that I decided to investigate some of The Jam's music. Based on a compilation I purchased, I avoided the early punk albums and started with the `Setting Sons' album. I was somewhat underwhelmed, but liked enough to move to the next album, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's `Sound Affects'. This album was a revelation for me. There are plenty of wonderfully catchy hooks and great songs that made me think The Jam's overblown and overrated reputation may not be entirely exaggerated. I eventually purchased their final album, `The Gift'. While I enjoyed many tracks on that album as well, I still find `Sound Affects' to be the most consistent album.`Sound Affects' is filled with so many great songs: `Set The House Ablaze' has a great whistle-hook, `Monday' has an attractive melancholy melody, `Scrape Away' is a strong and hook-filled album closer. This special edition also comes with a bonus disc of twenty-two period rarities and curiosities. Though many are only of minor interest to me, it's nice to have all of it collected in this one package for any future interest. If `The Gift' and `Setting Sons' are given the deluxe treatment, and remastered by the same engineer, I'll happily are-purchase those as well.

I don\u2019t know of a previous release that might have are-edited him but if this is the kind of quality that comes with the result, Mastering Universal should hire him to manage all the back-end booklets for are-editing Siouxsie and Banshees. I was amazed at this product. Now, get into the music. I spent many years from Jam. The video titled \u201cHate City\u201d hit all of MTV at over one thousand, nine hundred and eighty -two but it did\u2019t catch on in my year. Until the first \u201cUnderground\u201d listening earlier in the two thousand VHone Classic I decided to explore some of Jam\u2019s music. Based on the collection I bought, I moved away from the old punk album and started with the \u2018Setting Sons\u2019 album. It bothered me a bit, but I wanted to move on to the next album, Thousand, Nine Hundred and Eighty\u2019s \u2018Sound Effect\u2019. This album has been an inspiration to me. There are so many amazing and catchy hits and great songs that make me assume that Jam\u2019s reputation and over-the-top reputation may not be entirely over. I finally bought their latest album, \u2018Gift\u2019. While I also enjoy many of that album\u2019s tracks, I still see \u2018Sound Effects\u2019 being the most permanent album \u2018\u2018 Monday \u2019\u2019 has a catchy melodious melody, \u201cScrap Away\u201d is a strong album full of hooks nearby. This special edition includes a bonus disc of twenty-two custom treatments and interesting items. While many are just for me, it\u2019s better to put everything in one package for every future interest. If \u201cGifts\u201d and \u201cChildren\u2019s Community\u201d are given a gold treatment, and are -modified by the same engineer, I would be happy to buy them. A positive change from some of my other audio commentaries, I\u2019m happy to send it by saying, great Universal Music.","overall":5,"summary":"The Jam's best album, wonderfully remastered","unixReviewTime":1292025600,"reviewTime":"12 11, 2010"}

Long Run: The leadoff track is one of the best songs on the album and it's a pretty happy song sung by Don Henley and I think that this was their first single off of the album, ten\/ten. I Can't Tell You Why: Tim Schmt (formerly of Poco) sings lead on this song and this song is a beautiful sounding ballad and it's a staple on the soft rock\/classic rock stations, I only wish that the got to using more songs with the Eagles, ten\/ten. In the City: Joe Walsh takes the vocals on this song and the was riding high the previous year with this smash hit 'Life's Been Good, Don Henley sings lead on the chorus and Joe Walsh sings lead on the verses, and it's a great song that should've been on Greatest Hits two. ten\/tenDisco Strangler: I consider this the lowest point of the album cause Don Henley sounds really annoying throughout the song and disco was starting to fade away by this point, at least that this song is under three minutes long, it is somewhat enjoyable to listen to depending on my mood. five\/tenKing of Hollywood, I don't know why people do not like this song, I actually think that this song is even better than the hit singles and it is a pretty dark song with Glenn Frey and Don Henley taking the vocal duties. ten\/tenHeartache Tonight: This was another smash single off of the album and it is still frequently played on the classic rock stations, I like the growling bass at the beginning and the third verse, I was surprised that singer Bob Seger co-wrote this song. ten\/tenThose Shoes: Another standout for the Eagles and I like the talking voice on the guitars, lot of songs certainly don't have that, great guitar playing. ten\/tenTeenage Jail: I don't know why people would put down this song and I actually like it, Glenn Frey takes the vocal duties on this one and while it may not be a classic like the other songs but it is certainly enjoyable to listen to. weight\/tenGeeks Don't Want No Freaks: Okay, while this song may be off the wall but I do enjoy listening to this song, it reminds me of those Revenge of the Nerds movies and Animal House, it's not as great as the classic tracks though. seven\/tenSad Cafe: I think that they picked the perfect closer for the album, we all know that this is going to be their last album for fifteen years and it's nice that they ended it with a classic song, this is rather a ballad type tune and I'm surprised that this song was't released as a single. ten\/tenIf you're a fan of seventy's music for classic rock then you must own this album, I would recommend this album even if you're just a casual fan of the Eagles and don't listen to those bad reviews that you hear and it's kind of sad that they disbanded after this album cause this was a good one.","overall":5,"summary":"Great album and I'm not even a fan of the Eagles","unixReviewTime":1085875200,"reviewTime":"05 30, 2004"}

I've often heard of it referred to as Rush's stab at alternative, which I really don't agree with either-- certainly, the band was influenced by a return of guitar-based rock music to the forefront of popular consciousness, and no doubt that assisted in this album fully embracing the guitar as main driver behind the music, but this is the direction the band had been heading for the past several albums-- after the synth wash of \"Grace Under Pressure\" and \"Power Windows\", \"Hold Your Fire\", \"Presto\", and \"Roll the Bones\" all walked the path of guitar based performance. What may have been more alternative influenced on this record was the focus on rock rhythms rather than the budding focus on funk and even ship shop rhythms that was so present on \"Roll the Bones\". As a result of this sonic shift, this album features some of the most inspired playing by guitarist Alex Lifeson in a long time-- Geddy Lee's bass, so often the most interesting component in Rush material on the past few albums, moved into a more traditional rock roll, freeing Lifeson to fill space better (mind you, Geddy Lee still has one of the most distinctive voices on the bass guitar in rock music, and is instantly recognizable). I also find that Lee's singing is superlative, perhaps the best the's done-- this confence as a vocalist allows him full control over this range and the fills each song with an investment of emotion I don't feel we'd heard from him in the past. Lyrically, the album also continues the evolution of previous records-- Neil Peart's early albums were fantasy\/science fiction influenced, often allegorical for parable. As time wore on, the brought this lyrics into a more modern society, into the current view. The past few Rush albums began to show a trend of lyrics with a much more personal bent, this album continues that trend-- themes largely of love and relationship dominate the album, and even the more globally minded songs (\"Nobody's Hero\") have a personal slant to the lyrics. To talk a bit about the songs themselves, there really is a wealth of stunning material there. The rolling, jangly opener, \"Animate\", with its synth soaked bridge, stands out as one of the best cuts on the album, ditto for instrumental \"Leave That Thing Alone\", which musically manages to portray a haunting, tense feel. Beyond these two, the album seeks several directions, easily viewed in its thematic content-- the two I mentioned previously fit in with a sort of struggle in relationships theme that's all over the album, including the great, driven \"Cut to the Chase\" (with another stunning Lifeson guitar solo), \"Alien Shore\", lyrically an explosion of metaphor, musically its funky in a way much of the material on the last album was, and one of the album's singles, \"Cold Fire\", a bitter love song with clever word play (how can you not love a love song with the line \"she said, 'this is not a love song'\") and a sufficiently affected vocal delivery by Lee. There's also definitely an undercurrent of sort Whitmanesque uplifting of the everyday people, the single \"Nobody's Hero\", reflecting on how the death of a loved one means everything to some but nothing to most, and the fairly obvious message of \"Everyday Glory\", the latter a powerful, swelling song, again with a great vocal by Lee. Finally, there's a handful of experimental songs-- Rush seeking new directions continuously stabs out in a number of ways-- \"Stick It Out\", with its covert guitar (and great bass playing in its bridge) does't quite succeed as well as you'd hope, nor does the straightahead \"Speed of Love\". The funkier songs on the record though, the unique \"Between Sun & Moon\" (with great lyrical word play and a monster riffing) churns and chugs and spins and explodes in its chorus, one of the great, overlooked Rush songs, and one of Peart's cleverest moments as a lyricists, and the bizarre, funky, bass-driven \"Double Agent\", with its strange spoken word vocal, as the speak of 'ninetys Rush experimentalism, it does far better than expected. Overall, this is a great album, with a lot of varied, intriguing, and successful material. Experimentation abounds, and Rush does well with it.

I do have to admit that some of the song lyrics on there make very little sense to me, yet the beauty, power, and obvious insights of Tori's songwriting and singing still amaze me. Like every Tori CD, this one is quite different from her others.

There is a lot of soft piano music and tender, lilting singing on many tracks; on several occasions, you may think the album has stopped playing if your volume is turned down too low.

You really have to read the liner notes to see what Tori is actually saying; the song is rather deliciously naughty and more controversial than the better-known \"God.\" Several songs highlight Tori's ability to suddenly and effortlessly switch her sound and mood from soft and unaffecting to forceful and powerful, especially \"The Waitress\" and \"Space Dog.\" \"The Wrong Band\" has a sort of jaunty melody and seems to deal with opening your eyes and facing reality. \"Cloud on My Tongue\" is a pleasant little number, and \"Pretty Good Year\" is an excellent song with which to begin the album. \"Baker, Baker\" strikes me as being the most emotional song, as it seems to address the problems of a failed relationship. \"Yes, Anastasia\" is a long, very soft song with which to close the album. Every song on Under the Pink is enjoyable and meaningful in some way. I prefer the faster songs, so there are a few slower tracks I skip over sometimes when I listen to this CD. Tori's unusual style sometimes makes a few words hard for me to understand, and I find it very useful to refer to the included lyrics; the true poetry and power of the vocals is only increased when you can actually read them rather than just hear them. If you love Tori Amos, you already have this CD. If you are unsure about this artist, I recommend purchasing Little Earthquakes before purchasing Under the Pink because this album is more quirky and less accessible than her debut CD.","overall":5,"summary":"Under the Pink put me under Tori's spell","unixReviewTime":1026604800,"reviewTime":"07 14, 2002"}

Like all Tori CDs, this CD is completely different from this other CDs.

The best example is \"Icicle\", which opens with two minutes of soft piano music. In terms of lyrics, \"Icicle\" is certainly the most interesting song on the album. You will need to read the liner notes to understand the real content of Tori; this song is obscene and contradicts more than the famous \"God\". Many of the songs highlight Tori's ability to quickly turn her voice and her soft and uncomplicated emotions into strong and powerful, especially \"The Waitress\" and \"Space Dog\". \"Wrong Band\" has some fun music that seems to be aimed at opening your eyes and facing reality. \"The Cloud in My Language\" is a sweet little note, and \"Happy New Year\" is the opening song for this album. \"Baker, Baker\" is the most emotional song in my opinion, because it seems to solve the problem of a failed relationship. \"Yeah, Anastasia\" is a very long and soft song that ends the album. Every song under Pink is fun and meaningful in a way. I choose faster songs, sometimes skipping slow songs when I listen to this CD.

The heavy emphasis on melody and hooks that defined Presto and Roll the Bones was being tempered by a heavier approach. The riffing on \"Dog Years,\" \"Virtuality,\" and \"Time and Motion\" is the heaviest stuff they've done in twenty years. In most cases when the heaviness goes up, melody goes down. What's admirable about Test for Echo is that Rush breaks the rules by maintaining a tuneful element to the music even when the album is its most aggressive. While this does't quite approach Presto in terms of sheer hooks, Test for Echo still has its share of hummable moments. The songs themselves? I don't want to use the F-word (you know. \"Filler\"), but there's definitely some less-than-great songs on Test for Echo. It's a bit of an ambivalent release, sporting superb melodic tracks like the memorable \"The Color of Right,\" the minimalistic and textured \"Test for Echo,\" the furious crunchy-catchy dynamics of \"Dog Years\". There's also the great \"Carve Away the Stone,\" a song I find surprisingly underrated. It shows killer chops and melodic sense. All in all, there's some great songwriting there. On the other hand, however, a good deal of the album blacks impact. Peart's poetry is brilliant, as always (\"Dog Years\" being a twinkling of humour), and the instrumental \"Limbo\" is sonically amusing even though the melodies are hard to grasp.

The great thing about the Echo Test is that Rush broke the rules even though the album was violent, keeping the best thing in the music. While this is not entirely close to Presto in terms of clean links, the Echo test still has its ups and downs. The song itself? I don't want to use the word F (you know. \"Installer\"), but there must be some unpleasant songs in the Echo Test. This is a controversial release, featuring great musical songs, such as the unforgettable \"Right Color\", \"Simple and Recorded Echo\", and the violent, rough, rough \"Dog Years\" Attractive dynamic. There is also the best stone \"Cut the Stone\", which I found unexpectedly low. It shows the symbol of the killer and the meaning of the music. All in all, there is a good songwriting out there. However, on the other hand, black people on the disc have a huge impact. Peart's poems are more astonishing than never (\"The Dog Years\" is a funny flash), and while it's hard to understand a musical song, instrumental music \"Limbo\" has a musical appeal.

Inspiring from the start - St. Etienne uses a combination of syntheses, guitars and beautifully recorded images to create a great product. Techno-pop out there that can make me feverish to listen to all the notes they never created. . I like it too But where could I go from there? According to Amazon.com, St. Etienne's answer was! After buying all the eighteen CDs I could make, I sat down and listened to them for just a moment. I lost my temper because I had just bought five CDs from them and I and't know where to start. Well, I finally got started with Smash the System, which showed me that I need to find Etienne soon! (All the CDs I bought were good comedy and later) I found Fox Base Alpha on beBay and I like it. There is nothing like listening to the early beginnings of a great group and seeing how they got to where they are today. This album in't great, but it's a good start. The cover of \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" will not leave you silent (and I admit that at first I wondered why Sarah's voice sounded so different. I should have thought the answer was so Just as easy as a different artist!) I loved this song before I got this album, but now I don't like it until before it was \"Radio Etienne\". \"I Can't Sleep\" and \"Spring\" are both great pop songs with two very different emotions: one is about the black of lost love, the other has high hopes that love will find a way to it. \"Girl VII\" has an amazing guitar sound. \"She\" is a short striped song that turns the title into a doubt. \"Stones to See the List\" and \"Like the Swallow\" are all voice attacks, and \"London is My Relationship\" is kept clean in the middle. Obviously they had a lot to learn about making the album. For example, I don't think they can add an acidic journey like \"Wilson\" to any of their albums today. I'm sure they enjoyed doing it, but that kind of thing often gets ridiculous for the people involved, and not so much for the outside audience. I'm sure they won't make any noise. A movie clip that lasts a few minutes. It's not so much fun to have half a dialogue on a movie and put it to the beat of a drum (although I would say the movie looks like I want to watch it!) But these complaints are very small. And by adding \"nothing can stop\" to the album, the group is made up entirely of them. It has sixty senses while it seems real and new. Santa Etienne has replaced Dad as my favourite team. If you're a fan of dance-pop, electronica, sixty-something, almost every other genre you can think of (except Death Metal!) Please listen to this band! It can change your life! (Although I can't make promises, so if your life does't change, please keep in mind that I really can't, and if I did, I would't say that.) If you dance-pop Lovers of electronic, cutthroat sixty, so please listen to this group!","overall":5,"summary":"Eclecticism at its finest.","unixReviewTime":1003104000,"reviewTime":"10 15, 2001"}

The record featured mostly 'sixtys Brit pop itunes heavily influenced by the early-day Bee Gees. They then left Decca Records and signed on ABC Records in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. By this time, the band was Peter Gabriel on vocals, Anthony Phillips on guitars, Mike Rutherford on bass guitar, Tony Banks on all keyboards, and John Mayhew on drums (no Phil Collins just yet -- the'd join in later in the year). The new lineup (Mayhew replaced drummer Chris Stewart later in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) went into the studio and released 'Trespass' in October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. With this album, Genesis proved a clear indication of things to come -- goodbye, simple pop itunes, and hello progressive rock royalty. So, how does this album measure up nearly forty years later? Well, it's an outstanding album. Sure, the band would again more confidence as they progressed, but they were still capable of writing some mighty-fine prog rock in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. 'White Mountain' is one of my all-time favourite songs; Tony's morgan and Mayhew's drumming drive the song and make it one of the great early progressive tracks. This song was so popular, in fact, Genesis would frequently play it live in on their one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six 'A Trick of the Tail' tour with Phil Collins (who was't even in the band at this time) singing lead on it.'Looking for Someone' could have easily been featured on their next album, 'Nursery Cryme.' Gabriel's mellow voice is accompanied by Tony's morgan throughout most of the song. This is another clear indication of things to come for this legendary band. I've always liked 'Visions of Angels.' Critics have ripped on it in the past for having \"weak lyrics.\" I hear nothing of the sort. I think it's a very good and quite interesting track, another Tony-dominated track. Anthony also plays very nice acoustic, classical style guitar. 'Visions' is a good song; sure, it's no 'Fountain of Salmacis,' but it's still a fine song that is definitely worth a listen.'Stagnation' and 'Dusk' are also songs heavily driven by Anthony, and also Mike. Gabriel's voice is calm on these tracks, which are perfectly mellow. 'Stagnation' is also a song the band would sample in the future; Genesis would play a part of it -- albeit very briefly -- during their one thousand, nine hundred and eighty tour with their 'Cage' medley. 'Dusk' is probably the weakest song on the album; believe me, it's very good, but it's just not as great as the others. Although it is a nice acoustic-driven tune that I do appreciate very much. And finally, to conclude the album, Genesis delivers their (well, at least up to that point) magnum opus. 'The Knife.' At weight:fifty-five, Genesis makes the most out of these nine minutes. It's by far the best song on the album; it's so complex, and the entire band dominates throughout. Mike's haunting bass line, Tony's incredible skill at the morgan, Ant's virtuoso moves on the guitar, Pete's chilling vocals, and Mayhew's steady beat dominate this song throughout. Genesis would play this song live up until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one (although sporadically after Collins became lead singer). This song, musically, gave more hints as to where the band were going then other song on the album. What an incredible song. (Note: look for the great live version of this on their one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three live album 'Genesis Live'). As you all probably know, after this record, guitarist and founding member Anthony Phillips departed, as did drummer John Mayhew. Mayhew was replaced by twenty-year old drummer Phil Collins; Phillips was replaced by Steve Hackett, who would stay with the band until early-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. The group got musically better with their next album, 'Nursery Cryme' and even better with the albums that followed. But overall, if you are a Genesis fan, you need to own 'Trespass.' This is basically where it all began. This is where the band became the progressive band that dominated their sound for the next twelve years (before they \"sold out,\" but that's a different story). 'Trespass' is a must own record for any Genesis fan, and more importantly, for any progressive rock fan. Highly recommended for any progressive rock for Genesis fan.

Yes, this is an excellent disc. Yes, as they move forward, the band will be more content, but they will be table to record a powerful savant-garde rock in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. \"White Mountain\" is one of my favourite songs of all time; Tony\u2019s Morgan and Mayhew drums performed this song and made it one of the most moving songs never. This song is very popular. In fact, Genesis will always play as the lead singer on their one, nine hundred and seventy-six tour \"Tail Trick\" with Phil Collins (he was't even in the band at the time). Their next album \"Nursery Cryme\" likes to \"look for someone\". Throughout the song, Gabriel's soft voice accompanied Morgan's Morgan. This is another clear indication of what will happen to this iconic band. I've always loved \"Angel's Vision\". Critics have criticized \"weak words\" in the past. I do not hear anything. I think this is a very good and interesting song, another song led by Tony. Anthony also plays a great acoustic, classic style. \"Ideas\" is a beautiful song; of course, it's not \"The Fountain of Salmacis\", but it's still a beautiful song to listen to. \"Stagnation\" and \"Dusk\" are also songs strongly encouraged by Anthony and Mike. Gabriel's voice is calm and around in these songs. The song \"Stagnation\" is also a band that will be sampling in the future; Genesis will play part of the \"Cage\" medley one, nine hundred and eighty tour - albeit for a short time. 'Night' may be the weakest song on the album; believe me, it's very good, but it's not as good as the others. Although this is a very good song that sounds aloud, I am very grateful for it. Finally, to send the album, Genesis released their part (well, at least so far). 'It stands. 'Difficulty: fifty-five, Genesis spent most of these nine minutes. This is the best song on the album so far; it is so difficult that the whole team is always in control. Mike's unforgettable bass line, Morgan's amazing skills, Ant's guitar, Pete's cool voice, and Mayhew's rhythm singing throughout the song. Genesis will continue to play the song until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one (although it will appear from time to time after Collins became the lead singer). This song features music on the music side more than any other song on the album. What an incredible song. (Note: check out this live version of their one, nine hundred and seventy-three live album \"Genesis Live\". As we all know, after this record, guitarist and lead member Anthony Phillips and drummer John Mayhew are both gone. twenty-year-old Phil Collins; Phillips was replaced by Steve Hackett, who will remain in the band until the early one thousand's and nine hundred and seventy-eight's.

Sing in front of him. 'In Search of Someone' could easily have appeared on this next album 'Nursery Crime'. Gabriel's cool voice echoes Tony's Morgan throughout the song. This is a clear indication of what lies ahead for this popular group. I've always liked 'Angel's Vision'. Critics have torn it down for having \"weak words\" in the past. I don't feel that way. I think this is a very good and interesting track, another track that is dominated by Tony. Anthony also plays an excellent sound guitar, a classic style. 'Ideas' is a beautiful song, of course, it's not 'Fountain of Slammy', but it's still a beautiful song to listen to. 'Jamud' and 'Disc' are also the most sung songs by Anthony and Mike. Gabriel's voice in these songs is calm, very cool. 'Standing' is a song and a group that will be a model in the future. Birth will play a part in this - albeit a very short one - during this millennial journey, nine hundred and eighty and this 'cage' medal. 'Sham' is probably the weakest song on the album. Believe me, it's beautiful, but not as big as the others. Although it's a good soundtrack that I really appreciate. And finally, to conclude the album, Genesis introduced their Magnum Ops (well, at least to this point). 'A knife.' Weight: Fifty-five, Genesis uses the most in these nine minutes. It's the best song on the album, it's very complex, and it dominates the whole party. Mike's amazing bass line, Tony Morgan's amazing ability, Ant's goodness with guitar, cool belly sound, and Mayo's strong rhythm dominate the whole song. Genesis will play the song live until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine (although Collins has been the lead singer from time to time). This song, in terms of music, gives a lot of hints as to where the band is going and another song from the album. Amazing song. (Note: Watch the live version of this on this one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-seven live album, Genesis Live). As you all know, this record was left behind by Anthony Phillips, a guitarist and first member, as well as drummer John Mayhew. Mayo was replaced by twenty-year-old drummer Phil Collins. Phillips was replaced by Steve Hackett, who will remain with the team until the first one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. The group got better with music with their next album 'Nursery Crime' and got better with the following albums. But overall, if you are a follower by birth, you should own 'Trespass'. This is exactly where it all started. That's when the band became a thriving group that dominated its voice for the next twelve years (before it \"sold out\", but that's a different story). 'Trespass' is a record that belongs to any genius fan, and more importantly, to any ongoing rock fan. This is highly recommended for any follow-up rock at birth.

G. nor twoPac were the greatest of all time; not even close. Who's better than B. I. G. and 'Pac? GZA, Nas, AZ, Ghostface, Big L, Big Pun, Immortal Technique, Redman, Method Man, Keith Murray, Canibus - the list goes on. B. I. G. and 'Pac are so overrated, it's not even funny; if they were alive today, B. I. G. would be just as criticized as Jay-Z, and twoPac would be just as washed-up as Snoop Dogg. Yet you people can't see through this, and choose to worship them because they were martyrs in the game. Since stating that, I feel the need to say that does't mean I dislike either B. I. G. for 'Pac, nor discredit them as emcees. I just don't see them as the Gods that some people, who know very little about ship-hop beyond the fifty Cents and Kanye Wests of the world, proclaim they are. As an overall emcee, B. I. G. was also the better of the two; lyrically, twoPac's simple rhyme-scheme fails miserable in comparison to B. I. G.'s complexity, and great word play. twoPac's passionate delivery made up for this, but B. I. G. even admittedly had a better, more traditional flow. B. I. G. also had a much more vivid imagination, and intricate way with stories. His production was also much finer, and balanced than twoPac's almost strictly G-Funk trunk rattlers. I know I'm going to get numerous \"not helpful\" votes for pronouncing that neither B. I. G. for 'Pac learned the legacy they were given in their post-mortem life, but I'm giving you nothing more than the truth in this review, and can't help but point out the facts, especially with all the twoPac ****-riders inhabiting this product, carrying out a beef they were NOT around to even experience, mostly due to their thirteen-fifteen year old page range. With that said, this was a great release, and one of my favourite albums to come out of the mafioso genre; unfortunately, there's far too much filler to call this the classic so many others make it out to be. It may not be as raw as Ready To Die, but that works in its favor more than it takes away from it; this was a much more mature, and vibrant production musically and lyrically than its predecessor. Maybe the rich cinematic scheme is a little too much for people who think \"Ambitionz Az A Ridah\" is the greatest ship-hop track of all-time, and all albums should carry that Thug Life tradition, but for true ship-hop heads, the theme carried out in this album is a real treat.\"Kick In The Door,\" \"Hypnotize,\" \"Last Day,\" \"What's Beef,\" \"Notorious Thugs,\" \"Going Back to Cali,\" \"My Downfall,\" \"Long Kiss Goodnight,\" and \"You're Nobody(Till Somebody Kills You)\" are undoubtedly certified ship-hop classics. The rest of the album, sadly, is filled with good tracks, and filler, and that's why this album is not five stars in my opinion. If you cut off the fat from this prime piece of sirloin, you have an undeniable classic; if you leave it on, you've got about a dozen classic tracks surrounded by another dozen 'meh' tracks. In the send, this is a grand album, but the double disc idea was too ambitious for B. I. G. at this stage in this career. It's definitely a much better product than this rival's All Eyez On Me(which had fewer classic tracks, and much more filler - as well as lacking any one theme throughout, and simply being thrown together), but it still in't a top ten, let alone top five album from the illustrious genre of ship-hop.

Some people know little about fifty cents of the world and the ship jumps out of Kyan West, claiming to be gods. As the full festival manager, BIG is also the best of the two; according to the songs, in comparison to the complexity of BI G. and the best word games, Pac's two simple contract scheme has failed miserably. The TwoPac shoulder transmission does this for you, but B. BIG also has a clearer perspective and more complex storytelling. His performance is even better and more balanced than twoPac's almost strict G-Funk trunk rattlesnake. I know I will get countless \"useless\" votes declaring that \"Pac's BIG has not read the legacy they have inherited in life after death\", but what I am giving you in this explanation is only true, and I cannot help it. Explain the facts, especially if all two Pac **** riders live in production and own a beef they have never met, mainly because of their fifteen-year-old paper list. Having said that, this is a great album and it\u2019s one of my favourite albums; Unfortunately, there are too many filters to call it classic, many others call it classic. It may not be as old as Death Ready, but it benefits more than it brings; Compared to its predecessor, this is a much bigger and vibrant work in music and song. For those who think \"Ambitionz Az A Ridah\" \u200b\u200bis the largest ship ship, the rich movie strategy can be very large, all albums should inherit the cultural heritage of Thug Life, but because of the true nature of the ship, the content of this album will be fun really. \"Kick the Door\", \"Hypnosis\", \"Last Day\", \"What a Beef\", \"Notg Thug\", \"Back to Cali\", \"My Fallfall\", \"Long Kiss Good Night\" and \"You're Not People\" (Ade Someone killed you) Unfortunately, the rest of the album is full of good tracks and fillings, which is why this album is not five stars in my opinion. If you cut fat in this premium beef, you have an irresistible classic; if you open it, you will have twelve old tracks surrounded by ten other \"meh\" tracks. Delivery, this is a great album, but the concept of two discs is very interesting to BIG at this stage of this career. It\u2019s definitely a much better product than All competitor\u2019s All Eyez On Me (it has a few classic songs and more fillings \u2014 and there\u2019s no single theme in the whole process, easily integrated), but you\u2019re not in the top ten, let alone the first five albums in the popular ship-hop genre.

Like all good music, this gets better with each listen: subtle melodies come to the surface; lyrical nuances eventuate; beautiful musical riffs come out of hiding. There is just enough Elvis Costello in this not to close it's pop\/rock flavour, and just enough Burt Bacharach for it not to close it's easy listening, romantic lounge feel. The history behind these men speaks for itself: Bacharach is something of a god when it comes to creating mellow moods and Costello is revered amongst this fans as the king of pop-rock. Both are equally hailed as being song-writing geniuses. Painted From Memory combines their musical virtuosity and the result is breathtaking - this surely is one of the best albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. Upon first listening, Painted From Memory may seem a bit routine: a bit too Englebert Humperdinck. However, like good literature, upon each revisitation it gets better and better. Costello's trademark strong, albeit slightly querulous vocals merge with the smooth piano of Bacharach to create twelve beautiful songs, each more varied than the last. There are the haunting melodies of the sinister, yet strangely romantic `In the Darkest Place'; the ruminations of `Tears at the Birthday Party'; the mellow and very Bacharach `Toledo'; and the restrained danger towards a serial adulterer in `What's Her Name Today?' The album finishes with the piece-de-resistance: the Grammy nominated `God Give Me Strength' - this song evokes real emotion in the listener and is the triumph of the album. Fans of Costello will be more taken aback by this album than fans of Bacharach. Costello has long established himself as a rock statesman thanks to the rhythmic, heavy beats of this early albums such as `This Year's Model', `Blood and Chocolate' and `Armed Forces'. However, during the eighties the became more experimental and more restrained: this period in this career saw triumphs like `Spike', `Trust' and the brilliant `King of America'. The nineties has seen the performer really expand this horizons in `The Juliet Letters' and `All This Useless Beauty', where the performed with The Attractions, this long-time supporting band. And now, in `Painted From Memory', Costello has really matured. This is not a bad thing; rather, judging by the quality of the album, it's an excellent thing. Costello is a songwriter who has changed over time and for that all of this fans should embrace him - `Painted From Memory' really shows off this musical virtuosity. This album not only showcases two musical geniuses, but also marks something of the complete evolution of Costello - the, like Tom Waits, Lou Reed and David Bowie, has matured, and so has this music. It is as good, if not better, than it used to be. For this reason, `Painted From Memory' should be on every Costello fans' CD track, and is essential listening for any die-hard Bacharach fan.

As with all good music, it will always be better to listen to it: more hidden songs; the nuances of the songs finally took place; good music enhancement comes out of hiding. Enough Elvis Costello there will not extinguish its pop \/ rock flavor, and enough Burt Bacharach will not erase its relaxing listening, romantic feeling of relaxation. The history behind these people is evident: Bacharach is a god in creating soft emotions, and Costello is revered as the king of pop rock among these fans. These two are also called songwriting songs. Paint from Memory combines their musical skills, and the result is breathtaking \u2014 undoubtedly one of the most outstanding albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. When I first listened to it, the paint from the memory may seem familiar: a bit with Englebert Humperdinck. However, as a good writing job, you will get better and better every time you are tested again. Costello's vocal, powerful but slightly murky melodies blend Bacharach's smooth piano, making twelve beautiful songs, each of which is very different from the original. There is a subtle and strange love in the \u201cdarkest place\u201d humorous songs; thinking of \u201ctears at a birthday party\u201d; cool Bachalach and \"Toledo\"; and \"what's your name today?\" The danger of catching the most important adulterers. The album ends with \"Opposition\": Grammy-nominated \"God Gives Me Strength\" - this song evokes real feelings of the audience and is the success of the album. Compared to Bacharach fans, Costello fans will be amazed by this album. Because of the rhythms and heavy beats of this debut album (such as \"Model This Year\", \"Blood and Chocolate\" and \"Armed Forces\"), Costello has long been a politician. However, in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, it became an experiment and a deterrent: in this work, there were victories such as the \"Spike\", the \"Trust\" and the brilliant \"King of America\". In the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys, factors realized in \"Letter of Juliet\" and \"All Le Useless Beauty\" that factors really expanded this idea, where they played with the long-term support band The Attractions. And now, in \"Painted From Memory\", Costello has really grown. This is not a bad thing at all; on the contrary, from the album quality, it\u2019s a big deal. Costello is a songwriter who has changed over time, so all fans should welcome him - \"Painted from Memory\" reflects this musical talent. The album not only reflects two musical ideas, but also reflects the full emergence of Costello \u2014 like Tom Waits, Lou Reid and David Bowie, who have grown up, and this is the song. It's as good as never, if not better. For this reason, \"Painted In Memory\" should be featured on every Costello fan CD song, and is essential for any Bacharach fan-hard fan.

Like all good music, this one is perfect for any listening: the deceptive melody will come to the surface; the essence of the songs emerged; beautiful riff music will appear in hiding. There\u2019s enough Elvis Costello for it not to be tied to the taste of rock \/ roll, and the only Burt Bacharach not to tie it is the simple listening, romantic feel of the room. The history behind these men speaks for itself: Bacharach is a god when it comes to creating mood and Costello is revered by these fans as the king of pop-rock. Both are equally praised for being creative songwriters. Paint From Memory combines their goodness with music and the result is amazing - it\u2019s definitely one of the best albums of the thousand, nine hundred and ninety. At first glance, Memory Paint may be pretty normal: a bit too Englebert Humperdinck. However, like the good literature, each review gets better and better. Costello\u2019s strong brand, even the amazing voices mix on the Bacharach piano to create twelve beautiful songs, each different from the previous one. There\u2019s a surprising melody of evil, but the wonder of love \u201cThe Darkest Place\u201d; Satire of \u201cBirthday Tears\u201d; Bacharach is very soft and very \u201cToledo\u201d; and the limited threat to the pampa series in her name Now? Door Completes The Fight: Grammy Named \u201cGod Strifying Me\u201d - this song evokes a real sensation in the listener and the success of the album. Costello fans will be more surprised by this album than Bacharach fans. Costello has long established himself as a rock leader thanks to the rhythm, heavy beats of previous albums such as \u201cStyle This Year\u201d, \u201cBlood and Chocolate\u201d and \u201cArmed Forces\u201d. However, in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys the experiment became more controlled: during this time the profession was as successful as \"Spike\", \"us Amen\" and the good King of America.

Like all good music, it's perfect for every listener: fine songs appear. The nuances of the song are revealed, and when it hides, beautiful music sounds. Elvis Costello is enough in this non-stop pop \/ rock flavor, and just as much as Bert Bacharch is enough to keep an easy-to-hear, romantic lounge off. The history of these men speaks for itself: Bacharch is a god when it comes to creating a cool atmosphere, and Costello is revered among fans as the king of pop rock. Both are equally praised for being good at writing songs. Painted From Memory combines the beauty of their music and the result is amazing - it is definitely one of the best albums of one, nine hundred and ninety, zero. At first glance, paint from memory can be seen as a common exercise: with little Engelbert Humperdink. However, like good books, every review is better and better. Costello's strong trademark, albeit a little sound, combined with Bacharch's smooth piano to create a dozen beautiful songs, each very different from the last. There are funny songs of evil, yet strange love `in the darkest place ' The sound of tears at the birthday party Bacharach `Toledo 'cool and cool; And the danger to the adulterer is 'Whose name is the today?' The album ends with resistance from the piece: Grammy nominated 'God Give Me Strength' - the song evokes real emotion for the listener and is the album's victory. Costello's fans will be more surprised by this album than Bicharch's fans. Costello has long established himself as a rock leader, thanks to the heavy beatings of this first albums, such as 'This Model of the Year', 'Blood and Chocolate' and 'Armed Forces'.

The standard system consists of thirty-two B sides. Some of the first stop tracks include \"Bind Your Hopes,\" \"Roll With The Wind\" Floor, one of this five most relevant studio records by releasing an improved and expanded version. Since it is no longer in the process of are-releasing, Payment was not the kind of band that could come up with - perhaps for most passionately - such a seemingly capitalist system. Wandering around Make fun songs. Run the program. Have a little fun while everyone is listening. That was the sidewalk, one of the leading bands in the emerging indie rock scene. But don't worry: these Matador updates are purposeful. The Lock Dialectical, as it seemed at the time, is an old-fashioned program - guitarist \/ musician Stephen Malcolm and Spiral Stairs, drummer Steve West, bassist Mark Abould and assistant man Bob Nestanovich - worked harder than anyone else, usually twenty, recording. - Five for thirty songs per album (so the need is also available for two discs and their endless bonus tracks). Combine sound-quality non-album tracks from any are-release, including the latest version, Lightup Corners, and you have an extra number of iTunes albums for each episode. Okay, ** for each release **. Those who karen't in Matador's books in the ninety's need to know one thing: Malcolm's best songs have never been in the right studio albums. Most have not heard of daily fans. The official title, Brighton the Corners: Nikken Creditors Edition, points to an original album track record created for a permanent, professional and accessible album that the band has never done before. Malcolm's words sounded better than before. Each song will be immersed in a crop of ideas and conversations. The producer - currently with the help of Mitch Easter and Bryce Gauguin - plays the object for the first time, thus eating up a large fan base. Malcolm (and the spiral staircase for this case) shows that the can play the guitar (not only partially); And most importantly, sweet songs with both song and instrumental music feel very funny. To put it bluntly, the sidewalk grew between their stone-sized classics, Vavi Zoi, and the release of One Hundred and Nine Nine Brighton. A hit \"Stereo\" and \"Shady Lane\", two of the best songs Malcolm has never written, kick things off in a proud, dynamic way. The lyrics of these two songs (also mostly Brighton) are written *** more than anything the group has at the moment, and many songs are filled with one line and sung by a slowly person who won it. ** Funnybutwhocares style spiral staircase song \"Date with Ikea\" is the best song never written, it is still a college-led, headline-driven college radio station and one of the band's most popular hits to date. There is one More than any other floor of the Malcolm Records, Brighton is table to provide a complete finish, although the band's top performers - \"Starlings of the Slip Stream\" and \"Art\" are above the rest. If you haven't heard the result of the twelve tracks of this album and you consider yourself a fan of pop, indie, nineties - even Bert Rock, do yourself a favor. And if you've heard of the set of points, know that the redesigned version looks amazing. It appears, but not as subtly as the semi-fi floor you know. The main event there, as mentioned above, is the generosity of high quality bonus items. Let's go inside. Due to not mentioning enough, the sidewalk was just slow to think. It says you're a regular pound fan (or a big fan): You may not have collected all the EPs, singles and band mixing tracks. As it may be, yes, yes, as Malcolm said a few years ago, you get the full amount of an extra album ** With this are-release Brighton-era studios-fourteen suitable studio songs are correct. Although seven of these itunes have never been heard before, the other half have been popular for many years - such as \"Horns Your Hopes,\" \"Roll With the Wind,\" \"Nine Ten Lines,\" and \"Vesti Can Drum.\" All major caliper hits included in the EPs. So this is a big draw, but wait, there's more. Brighton's tracklist includes seven studio songs, five more album kits and four best quality cover songs, including an echo soundtrack and \"The Killing Moon\". Years ago, Malcolm said incredible things about this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven year old band: a) Modern things can make it another complete album. Two) That album will be better than the album released by the band. Now that we know it's true, at least credible, we have to ask ourselves, did't Matador release these studio songs \"as a lost floor record?\" They are generous because they have bonus assets, a more focused style would be better for album fans who are more familiar with the album. Oh well that's a good thing, even if it does't add much to the team's legacy. Brighton the Corners may not be the best album of one, nine hundred and ninety-seven (OK Computer, Doh) and not even the best fit (Silent and Enchanted, huh ooh!), But today, if we look back, it One of the best examples of a strong indie rock album. It never ends. Okay fine. Strange. It's very audible. It is a type of record that can take audio files from teenagers to people in their thirties and older. Now complete and stable, Bullion Corners, which was originally considered a mysterious temporary (and therefore neglected) work, must finally receive proper care at all times.

{"orig_index":33622,"reviewerID":"A2CV1ZEKKH5OQD","asin":"B00004YC1I","reviewerName":"Jon Huff \"designer and aritst\"","helpful":[23,30],"reviewText":"As Jason K said in an earlier review, it is unfair to compare albums as they all have quite unique sounds. Unfortunately, The Magnificent Tree simply does not hold up to repeat listening. The first time I listened to it, I was really dissapointed. I loved Bluewonderpowdermilk and enjoyed their debut album, but TMT just does't have any stand-out tracks. It's agreeable enough background music and if that's all you want then it should suit you just fine. I expect more from my music and TMT rarely delivered. The album starts out with the rather clumsy Autoharp. Nothing about this song flows. Perhaps that's the point, but the send results are pretty boring and does't capture your attention (a bad sign for the first track of an album!)Mad About You is a pretty nice bit of pop. The orchestration is bright, reminding me of an old movie score. Geike's voice brings to mind images of particularly adept lounge singer. One of the few songs that come close to being memorable, but it still ends up like sonic wallpaper. Waves is an absolutely wonderful track. It's probably my favourite of them all. It takes all the nice things The Magnificent Tree's sound has going for it and maximizes it producing a lovely effect. The chorus is dreamy and stunning. More tracks like this in the future would be much appreciated. Jackie Cane is my second favourite track. It would't be out of place on a St. Etienne record at all. It's got a great retro feel without sounding OLD. The chorus is great and probably the most memorable of any track \"Salty days for Jackie Cane. \"I love the title to this album. Something about \"The Magnificent Tree\" just seems really cool and it's a phrase that's just ripe for being made a part of a cool song. Fortunately track five does pretty deliver on most accounts. We start out with some really nice guitar picking and some beautiful voice work from Geike. It's hairy and haunting and beautiful. Vinegar and Salt is pretty forgettable in just about every way. I've often gotten involved in another activity and not realized I've even listened to it. Frosted Flake Wood is just to bizarre for it's own good. Something tells me someone date some of the mushrooms the song talks about before writing this song. The song is fun in a way, but it's slow and does't go anywhere. I don't have much to say about Everytime We Live Together We Die a Bit More. I usually hit the next track button when I come to this one. Out of Sight starts out with some more of the wonderful orchestration that is a hallmark of Hooverphonic. It has a reasonably hooky chorus and a really nice sound. It practically cries out for deserved attention, saving what in the largely forgettable second half of the pablum. Pink Fluffy Dinosaurs is a light price of stripey fluff. There's nothing wrong with stripey fluff, but then there's nothing to celebrate about it either. Something about the track smacks of underachievement as well as thought no one could be bothered to come up with something to hold on to emotionally for the song. L'odeur Animals - Slow. Very slow. Not a bad track to nod off too however. Renaissance Affair (bonus track) - A song I already have, serving as a painful reminder of what Hooverphonic can do when they get going. Yeah. Nice Bonus. All in all, if your a long-time Hooverphonic fan for just a fan of their earlier work I suggest you do pick up The Magnificent Tree. It's not wonderful but fans will appreciate it. If you've never heard Hooverphonic DO NOT get this album first. Do like I did and pick up Bluewonderpowdermilk, then the debut, and then this.","overall":3,"summary":"Even on it's own, TMT is a dissapointment","unixReviewTime":971049600,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2000"}

Unfortunately, the Wonderful Tree cannot be repeatedly listened to at all. When I first listened, I was really disappointed. I love Bluewonderpowdermilk and their debut album, but TMT does\u2019t have great songs. This is fun enough for background music, and if this is what you want, it should be well suited for you. I hope to find out more from my music, and TMT rarely provides. The album starts with a heavy Autoharp. There is no movement in this song. Maybe this point, but the results are very disappointing and did not attract your attention (a bad sign of the album's first song!) Mad About You is a very good pop music. The orchestra is very bright and reminds me of the sound of an old movie. Geike's voice reminds us of a typical musician with a special talent. One of the few memorable songs, but it still ends up as sonic wallpaper. The waves are definitely a fun track. This might be something I love. It uses all the sound benefits of the Sweet Tree and enhances its beauty. The chorus is amazing and wonderful. These more songs in the future will be much appreciated. Jackie Cane is my second favourite song. In the record of St. In Etienne, this is completely out of date. It has a nice retro feel, but it does't sound old. The chorus is great, perhaps the most memorable \u201cSalty Days of Jackie Cane\u201d in all the songs. I like the title of the album. Something about \"The Magnificent Tree\" seems really cool, a phrase that goes well to be part of a cool song. Fortunately, the fifth song is performing well on most accounts. We started with an excellent selection of guitars and amazing sounds from Geike. It is furry, memorable, and beautiful. Vinegar and salt are remembered in almost every respect. I always take part in an event without realizing it. Cold wood is amazing only because of its benefits. Someone told me that someone loves mushrooms mentioned in this song before writing this song. This song is somewhat interesting, but it is slow and goes nowhere. I have nothing to say, every time we live together, we die a little. When I come to this song, I always press the next button. Out of Sight started with a good preparation, which is a Hoverphonic sign. It has a tempting choir and a very beautiful voice. It really requires the right kind of attention, thus keeping most of the forgotten second half of the content. Pink Fluffy Dinosaurs is a low-cost fluffy striped fluff. There is nothing wrong with fluff with stripes, but there is nothing wrong with celebrating. There\u2019s something about this song that does\u2019t work well, and you think no one will bother coming up with something soul-catching in this song. L'odeur's animals - slow. too late. However, drowsiness is also good. Renaissance Affair - A song I already have, a poignant reminder of what a Hoverphonic did when it started. Oh yeah. A nice bonus. All in all, if you are a long-time fan of Hooverphonic and a follower of their original works, I suggest you choose Sweet Tree. It's not interesting, but fans will appreciate it. If you have never heard of Hooverphonic, please do not purchase this album first. Choose Bluewonderpowdermilk like me, then get started, then.","overall":3,"summary":"Even on it's own, TMT is a dissapointment","unixReviewTime":971049600,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2000"}

Unfortunately, this amazing tree does not stop to hear again. I was really disappointed when I first heard it. I loved Blue Wonder Powdermilk and enjoyed their debut album, but TMT does't have a bright track. Background music is great and if you want it, it should be right for you. I expect more from my music and the rare delivery of TMT. The album begins with a strange auto sharp. Nothing works with this song. Maybe that's it, but the posting results are boring and don't get your attention (a bad sign for the first song on the album!) Mad About You is a very interesting pop. The orchestration is bright, reminds me of the effect of the old movie. The singer's voice reminds us of pictures of a well-known artist in the living room. One of the few songs that comes close to being remembered, but it still ends up being a sonic wallpaper. The waves track is absolutely amazing. This is probably my favourite. It takes all the good stuff. The sound of the amazing tree makes you and great to produce a good result. The course is dreamy and wonderful. Such additional tracks can be very enjoyable in the future. Jackie Kane is my second favourite track. It won't work out in the Senate. Eighteen. It has a nice retro feel without the old sound. The chorus is beautiful and probably the most memorable of any song called \"Jackie Kane's Salt Days\". I like the title of this album. Sounds good about \"amazing trees\" and the phrase is already ready to be part of a cool song. Fortunately, Track Five is good for many accounts. We start by choosing a good guitar and good sound work from Geike. It's cute and irritating and beautiful. Vinegar and salt are almost forgotten. I have often been involved in other activities and I did not realize that I was listening. Frosted Flakewood is just as unique in its beauty. Some tell me that someone is meeting some mushrooms before writing the song that the song is talking about. The song is fun, but it's slow and does't go anywhere. I can't say much about how we die slowly when we live together. When I get to this song, I usually press the button for the next song. Outsight begins with another amazing orchestration, a remarkable hovering phonetic symbol. It has a smart hockey course and a great sound. It calls for proper attention, keeping in mind the other half of the most forgotten papalum. The pink fluffy dinosaur is a simple quantity of stern fluff. There is nothing wrong with Striny Fluff, but there is nothing you can say about it again. Conflicts with something negative about the song, as well as the assumption that no one can bother to bring something to keep the song in the air. L'odeur animal - slowly. Little by little. This is not a bad track that you can memorize. Renaissance Affair - I already have a song that serves as a sad reminder of what Hoverphonic can do when travelling. Yes. Good bonus Overall, if you've been a fan of Hoover Funk for a long time as a follower of this previous work, I suggest you take this amazing tree. It's not fun, but fans will enjoy it. If you have never heard of Hoover Phoenix, don't get this album first. Do as I did and take Blue Wonder Powder Country, then Debut, and then this.","overall":3,"summary":"Even on it's own, TMT is a dissapointment","unixReviewTime":971049600,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2000"}

This album is definitely better then what I expected. I knew it was gonna be good, but I was't expecting five star quality. Each track presents something new and unique. I can tell you, this album was definitely well worth the three years it took to complete. Most debut albums are a little scratchy and not so good but that's not the case with this. This album is very well put together. You can tell Jada put a lot of time into this album. I love almost this whole album, but if had to narrow it down and pick my favourite three tracks they would definitely be:\"knock Yourself Out\"- The Neptunes trip it up on this track. Jada's second single. This is a great club type partying song. The beat is great and Jada's flow keeps you hooked.\"We Gonna Make It\"- Wow. wow. definitely a classic song. Hope It's this next single. I love the verses and the beat will keep of movie. This is a song you'll put on repeat and listen straight through like fifteen times in a row.\"Nasty Girl\"- Another future hit for Jada. Again Jada spits hot lyrics and a great beat.

Then Angie and two others formed an R&B; trio named Vertical Hold, and put out great material such as one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three's \"Seems You're Much To Busy\" and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five's \"Now That It's Over\". With 'Mahogany Soul', Angie Stone has finally started to again the recognition she has for so long deserved. It is a shame that most of Angie Stone's previous work is now either out of print for extremely hard to find. Modern R&B; (like Stone's previous work) is often shunned and discredited and by much of the \"powers that be\" (usually non African-Americans) who control both college and noncommercial radio: I know this firsthand from an extremely disheartening personal experience. The whole 'Mahogany Soul' CD is fantastic, and you should never have to skip a track on this album. But as will all albums, there are some standouts. Here they go:Standout #one: \"Mad Issues\" is a quaint, yet poignant track that communicates in the same mellow manner as Prince's masterpiece \"Adore\" did. Except this song in't about love, it's about giving someone honest feedback. \"Mad Issues\" is my favourite song on the album, and should definitely be a single.

From writing for those who love Mary J Blige to writing for herself, this is a fun metamorphosis with great natural talent. There is no weak path in the path. this. The ability to bring to the table in a history of black soul and funk, by combining a unique style of sound, and to set the table to present a simple song with the feeling that the recording monologue should come out in the same chorus binding, doing it. winner for me. The legacy presented there is really overwhelming. Forget * Fallin * as the song of the year, fake. Listen to * I Wish You Were Not Missing *, to this haircut and beating of O\u2019Jays * Backstabbers * memory and honor awards in Philly, and tell me that this infectious hit does\u2019t deserve to be the song of the year.

Ms. Keys and Hawa who were highly praised emerged from there, really unnecessarily, Ms. Stone was alone. It seems to me that Alicia Keys is sending a request to those who have * taken * under the page of twenty -five, while Ms Stone is driving a timeless car into her own classroom. The beats are emotional and sometimes enticing, while the emotion is real and true and the effect is contagious. I was even more thrilled to see that Ms. Stone was a great writer of several songs and a cleverly put together mix that varied the space and enhanced the psychological feel of the project as a whole. That voice! Great and even adding * Anger * and * Time of the Month * won't affect this new build. While India Arie sends * Acoustic Soul * the same way Ms Stone called it in memory of Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway, who are both rich in soft fabrics. When you buy this CD you can\u2019t deny buying one of the best soul and R&B; of this year annually, and will ensure that Ms. Stone endures when many people become mere memories.

Reminiscent of just one suggestion, from the honey-sounding funk and the queen of the soul, from my favourite writing of Mary J.

Interpol somehow got lost in the mix, possibly because their style of music is different from what has been coming out of NYC lately.

The first part of the album features the latest songs, but each track has its own strengths, especially the American band \"NYC\". They are increasingly turning to British black bands to impress. First came the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, which did its best to mimic the reaction that led to Jesus and Mary China. Now New Yorkers Interpol has lifted the bar by selecting the Joy Division as its recording base. This is a particularly bold move, as there are some respectable groups in the press, such as the Joy Division, and anyone who seems to be copying them shamelessly is in immediate danger of being ridiculed. However, in a way, Interpol has released an album that blends itself to the Menconian band, but it is also a separate comedy. Turning on the flights begins with an ethereal \"themeless\", which seems to deceive the listener with a false sense of security before the release of the second song, \"Obstetric One\". A really disturbing song, it can borrow almost every aspect of the Joy Division sound: bass drums, revolving guitars, robotic drums and even sounds, like Paul Banks's icon, \"You stab yourself in the throat.\" Will. \" However, it would be wrong to suggest that Interpol has only one influence. \"Say hello to the angels\" cannot be easily recorded by The Strokes, indicating that darkness is not the only tool in their cell. Regular service is later considered a song, however, with \"Hands Away\", which includes more aggressive melodies as well as amazing synthesizers. The stand-up track, which is probably the endless \"Roland\", which from the beginning only threatens an uncontrollable hurricane but somehow keeps its mind, and reveals all the dangers and dangers of the Joy Division as it continues. Is. If the Joy Division seems serious enough, it's worth noting that a move reminiscent of Trent Reznor recorded a downward spiral in the house where Charles Manson killed Sharon Tate, Interpol said. Recorded at Lavarish Hospital. In a home with mentally disturbed children. The finished product will definitely suggest that the band respond to the environment in which it was created. It would have been much easier to remove Interpol as a copyist if the album had not been so powerful. Just as two albums of gambling have the potential for real movement, so turning on the bright flights makes the listener emotionally exhausted in places, and many records can't fit that. It will hurt others, but even a strong fan of the gambling division will not fail to recognize that these things are strong. It seems strange that borrowing from something that is widely considered to be one of the largest groups is a crime, while copying small bands is perfectly acceptable (accept the oasis for someone's excuse) ?) Interpol should be commended for connecting the moments of the Joy Division well, better than anyone else in the last two decades. Give them a chance. They really deserve one. .","overall":4,"summary":"A different New York sound","unixReviewTime":1030924800,"reviewTime":"09 2, 2002"}

Much of the \"fairy\" talk she was known for, and soft quoted in your local music mags, has disappeared - maybe replaced by marriage, motherhood, for maturity. Scarlet's Walk, her latest CD, tells the story of Scarlet traversing America to discover its lifeblood. Gone are the confessional lyrics and tales of tortured blood letting that endeared her to so many of her early fans. Though Scarlet's Walk is a more accessible album, and easily one of her largest scaled works to date, its black of emotional intimacy between listener and creator may alienate some. Scarlet begins her voyage to discover America out on the West Coast in that promise land of Laguna Beach, Calfornia. There she instantly meets \"Amber Waves,\" a porn star who's own direction got a little misguided. While in Los Angeles, Scarlet meets a man whom she loves dearly. As the two travel up the Pacific Coast Highway she realizes that their love was only \"A Sorta Fairytale,\" their fantasy romance quickly disintegrated as the dashes passed along the road. \"Amber Waves\" and \"A Sorta Fairytale\" are classic Tori focusing the melody on her piano, and consequently landed Tori her biggest American hit with \"Fairytale.\" \"Wednesday\" recalls several of Tori's earlier of-sides with its jaunty jig as Scarlet and a new beau travel through the Pacific Northwest. \"Strange\" with its contrast between the piano and the wurlitzer and string sections focuses on the reality of what Scarlet has seen so far of her land and what she believed to be true. \"Carbon,\" guided along by Tori's piano line is one of the disc's highlights and most intimate tracks. The backing vocals on the chorus sound almost heavenly as they encourage Scarlet, despite her disappointments, to continue her journey and \"keep your eyes on her horizon.\" Scarlet is questioning the nature of her trek as \"carbon-made only wants to be unmade.\" A little frustrated, Scarlet finds a fellow named \"Crazy\" and with him, one of the disc's most commercial tracks. Nobody can't help but feel sexy when they hear, \"first let's just unzip your religion down, heard that you were once temptation's girl\" with Tori's characteristic spurring-growl. As Scarlet continues travelling through Native American territory she reflects on all that has been lost in the capella \"Wampum Prayer.\" Though nowhere near as moving as her previous capella classic, Little Earthquake's \"Me and a Gun,\" its brevity gives it additional weight. \"Don't Make Me Come to Vegas\" has Scarlet confronting her past stepping into the fire and temptation of Sin City. \"Vegas,\" carried along by Matt Chamberlain's kick drum, has a similar feel to that of \"Wednesday\" and has even been remixed successfully by DJ-extraordinaire Timo Maas. \"Sweet Sangria\" is similar to \"Carbon\" and is another standout track.\"Your Cloud\" could almost be a lullaby for Tori's own daughter, floating the listener wistfully away towards the skies. \"Your Cloud\" also serves as a preparation for some of the most pointed, and political, tracks on the album as \"Pancake\" and \"I Can't See New York\" clearly focus on the attacks of September eleven. \"Pancake,\" the better of the two, has slightly more abstract lyrics as \"messiahs need people dying in their name\" and follows a pulsating bassline as Tori resorts back to her characteristic guttural vocal delivery and reverb. \"I Can't See New York\" begins simply and calmly like the morning of the eleventh did with Tori playing her sharp with slight guitar effects in the background before additional electric guitars and drums come crashing in. Personally, \"New York\" is my least favourite tune on the disc as I find its length (seven:fourteen) and aim to be overly indulgent and a distraction from the rest of the album. \"Mrs. Jesus\" again is traditional Tori questioning religion and its validity and role in your lives. \"Mrs. Jesus\" is perhaps the most underrated song on Scarlet's Walk, with its gorgeous string section and chamberlain flutes arranged by one of Tori's longtime collaborators, John Philip Shenale. \"Taxi Ride\" is another piece of potential commercial confection that did't take off as a single quite nearly as well as it should have. Referencing the death of Tori's good friend, make-up artist Kevyn Aucoin, \"Taxi Ride\" is critical of those who are too wrapped up in their own world to acknowledge the more important things, as the was \"just another dead fag to you.\"\"Another Girl's Paradise\" examines the relationship between women similar to an earlier hit from Tori's Under the Pink, \"Cornflake Girl.\" The title track is another of those epic songs as Scarlet travels through the Cherokee grounds of the country's southeastern states. \"Scarlet's Walk\" has Scarlet examining the relationship and \"deals\" that were brokered between the European settlers and the Native Americans. \"Virginia\" also looks at this part of America's history and how settlers who left Europe seeking freedom would take that away from the Native Americans, and the other injustices - political and sexual - that were inflicted upon the Native Americans. Closing out the album is the disc's most haunting track, \"Gold Dust,\" as both Scarlet and Tori, newfound mothers, reflect back on their former lives and what it now means to have a life dependant on them. The mix of Tori's piano and Shenale's orchestra and string section combine to create an effect both intimate and overwhelming, optimistic and reflective in one fell swoop. With Scarlet's Walk, Tori Amos has made a rather middling album - but a great one at that. Many of the vocal histrionics that accentuated her previous emotions have been replaced by a much more subtle vocal technique. The confessional lyrics have been replaced with that of an emotional narrative. Her frenzied piano skills have been reduced to sound more connected with the other instruments on the tracks. Everything that Tori did at the extremes has basically been pulled a little more towards the center of the scale. Though Scarlet's Walk might not be the aural journey into the undeniably enigmatic Tori Amos that her previous fans have become accustomed to, it is a trip worth taking nonetheless.","overall":5,"summary":"A Walk Worth Taking","unixReviewTime":1070928000,"reviewTime":"12 9, 2003"}

Yes, by comparison. Many of the \"mythical\" stories they are known to have, and are carefully quoted in local music magazines, have disappeared \u2014 perhaps replaced by marriage, motherhood, and maturity. Scarlet's Walk is this latest CD, telling the story of Scarlet's journey to the United States to find this own blood. The words of confession and the story of the tortured blood do not last forever, making it popular with many early fans. Although Scarlet's Walk is an easy-to-understand album and easily one of the biggest performances the has done so far, the dark relationship between the audience and the creator can keep people out of it. Scarlett began her journey to discover America on the west coast in the hopeful country of Laguna Beach, California. There, the immediately met \"Amber Waves\", a porn star who had been misled on this side. While in Los Angeles, Scarlett met a man she loved very much. As the two were driving along the Pacific Coast of the Road, the realized that their love was \"just a myth\", and their pure love quickly spread because of the passing channels. \"Amber Waves\" and \"A Sorta Fairytale\" are classic. Tori has focused on the music of her piano, so Tori won her biggest song in the United States with \"Fairytale\". \"Wednesday\" remembers Torri's previous scenes, with a red carpet as a red carpet and a new boyfriend in the Northwest Pacific. \"Strange\" makes a distinction between piano and wurlitzer and strings of string, focusing on the reality of what Scarlett has seen in this country so far and believes it to be true. \"Carbon\", led by Tori's series of piano, is one of the most important recordings and a private song. The chorus echoes sound almost heavenly because they encourage Scarlett, though disappointed, to continue her journey, \"keep your eyes on her\". Scarlet questioned the nature of this trip, because \"carbon is just made to be made.\" Scarlett was concerned and found a guy named \"Crazy\", and collectively found one of the best-selling tracks on record. No one can help you feel sexy when we hear \"Let's open up your religious beliefs first, I heard you were a popular girl\" and Tori's unmistakable roar. As Scarlet continued this journey through the Native American area, the recalled everything the had lost in the capella called \"Wampum Prayer\". While nowhere near as impressive as this previous capella song \u201cMe and Gun\u201d is a small earthquake, its simplicity gives it added weight. \"Don't Let Me Come to Vasgas\" let Scarlett deal with this past and get into the fire with the temptation of Sin City. \"Las Vegas\" (Vegas), accompanied by Matt Chamberlain's kicking drum, feels the same as \"Wednesday\", and was shown by the brilliant DJ Timo Maas. Mix successfully. \"Sweet Sangria\" is similar to \"Carbon\" and is one of the best songs. \"Your Cloud\" can almost be Tori's daughter's joke, causing the audience to float in the sky thinking. \"Your Cloud\" prepares for some of the sharpest and most politically acclaimed songs on the album, as \"Pancake\" and \"I Can't See New York\" have a clear emphasis on the September eleven attacks. \"Pancake\" is better than the two. The words are more specific because \"the Savior wants people to die in their name\", and as Tori returns to her throat bringing and repetition, next to the hot bass line. \"I Can't See New York\" was simple and calm from the start, just on the morning of the eleventh day, Tori was playing her sharp and bright guitar in the back in front of an additional electric guitar and drum. Personally, \"New York\" is my favourite disc on the disc when I discovered its length (seven:fourteen) and is aimed at squeezing and squeezing the entire disc. \"Mrs. Jesus\" is also a traditional Torrey religion that questions questions about its legitimacy and its role in your life. \"Mrs. Jesus\" is the most obscure song on Scarlet's Walk, with its beautiful string and sharp playing by John Philip Shenale, one of Tori's longtime collaborators. \"Taxi travel\" is another item that can be used for demon marketing without releasing as much as it should. Commenting on the death of Tori's best friend and makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin, \"Taxi Ride\" has criticized those who have drowned in their country to admit more important things, because this is \"one of the dead gay men for you.\" Paradise \"explores relationships between women, much like the first song\" Nachos Girl \"under Tori's pink. As Scarlet walks through the Cherokee region in the southeast of the country, the title track is another songbook.\" Scarlet's Walk \"allows Scarlet to explore relationships and\" transactions \"organized in between. \"Europe\" also looks at this part of American history and the way Europeans who left Europe demanding freedom from American Americans, as well as other political and sexual injustices caused by the American people. because Scarlet and Tori are both newlyweds, and they look back on their past lives and what it means to depend on them now. Tori's combination of Tori's piano and Shenale's orchestra and string members creates a close bond convincing, hopeful and reflective at the same time. With the departure of Scarlet, Tori Amos has produced a middle-class album - but she has done a great job in this regard. Many of the voice functions that emphasize this for her past feelings have been replaced by subtleties of voice. The words of confession have been replaced by dramatic stories. His crazy piano skills have been curtailed, and it sounds like it\u2019s related to other instruments in the song. Everything Torrey did in previous situations was pulled to the center of the scale. While \"Scarlet Road\" may not be a mysterious tour of Tori Amos and those who are already acquainted with her fans, it is still a worthwhile visit.","overall":5,"summary":"A Walk Worth Taking","unixReviewTime":1070928000,"reviewTime":"12 9, 2003"}

Scarlet's Walk, her latest CD, talks about Scarlet going through the United States to find her blood. The words of confession and the stories of painful blood are gone which allow him to fall in love with many of this earlier followers. Although Scarlet's Walk is an easily accessible album, and easily one of its greatest works never measured, its close proximity to listeners and creators sets others apart. Can Scarlett began her journey to the United States on the West Coast in the Promised Land of Laguna Beach, California. When she suddenly encountered \"amber waves\", the sex star whose face was slightly lost. While living in Los Angeles, Scarlett meets a man she loves. As the two climbed the Pacific Coast Highway, you can see that their love was just \"A Sorta Fairytale\", their love of fairy tales quickly faded as they passed by the side of the road. \"Amber Views\" and \"A Sorta Fairy Tale\" are an old Tory that focuses on her piano music, and as a result Turi became her great American song \"Fairy Tale\". \"Wednesday\" recalls a few previous episodes of Tori and a new beauty touring the Pacific Northwest, like Scarlett's Jaunty Jug. The \"weird\" way of comparing the piano and the vulture and the strings is based on what Scarlett has seen and believed in her country so far. Directed by Tory's piano line, \"Carbon\" is one of the most popular disc songs and the closest tracks. Voices in support of Choir's music sounded heavenly as the encouraged Scarlett to continue her journey despite her disappointment and to \"peek into this eyes.\" Scarlett is sceptical of her journey because \"it's just made of carbon that needs to be made.\" Slightly annoyed, Scarlett found a guy named \"Crazy\" and, with it, one of the most commercial discs on the disc. No one can stop themselves with Tory's encouraging character but when the hears, \"First open up your religion, let's hear you are an attractive girl\". As Scarlett walks through the Aboriginal area, she thinks of all the people lost in the Capilla, \"Wumpum Dua.\" Although nowhere near as moving as its previous Capella classic, the song \"Me and a Gun\" from Little World adds extra weight to it. \"Don't Make Me Come to Vegas\" is Scarlett's past when she enters the fire in the lure of San City. Sounds like \"Vegas\", \"Wednesday\" with Matt Chamberlain's kicking drums and has been successfully reunited by DJ-extraordinaire Timo Maas. \"Sweet Sangria\" is similar to \"Carbon\" and has something special. \"Your Cloud\" can almost be a cry for Tori's daughter herself, who floats impatiently in the audience looking up at the sky. \"Your Cloud\" also serves as a preparation for some of the most popular and political albums, such as \"Pancakes\" and \"I Can't See New York,\" which are clearly focused on the nine\/eleven attacks. \"Pancakes,\" the best of the two have mysterious songs, \"Christians need people who die in their name,\" and the Tories follow a warm bass line as they return to their voices and rehearsals. \"I Can't See New York\" begins as easily and calmly as it did at eleven to'clock in the morning when Tori teased him about the small effects of the guitar in the background before the electric guitar and drums collided. Personally, \"New York\" is mine. My favourite short song on the disc when I get to its length (seven: fourteen) and I intend to indulge in extravagance and distraction from the rest of the album. \"Mrs. Jesus\" is also a Tory tradition that questions religion and its legitimacy and its role in your life. \"Mrs. Jesus\" is probably the most recorded song on the Scarlet Walk, with beautiful strings and Chamberlain flutes arranged by a Tory colleague, John Philip Shenale. The \"taxi ride\" is another case of a potential trade contagion that has not gone as far as it should have. Referring to the death of Tory's best friend, make-up artist Kevin Aquin, \"Taxi Ride\" criticizes those who are too busy in their world to fail to realize the most important things, such as \"It There was another marijuana for you. Another girl's paradise. \" Tory's Under the Punk song examines the relationship between women similar to \"Corn Flake Girl\", European and Native American. \"Virginia\" also looks at this part of American history and how immigrants seeking independence from Europe would take it from Native Americans, and other injustices - politically and sexually - by Native Americans. The perpetrator. Closing the album is a popular disco song, \"Gold Dust,\" as both Scarle and Tori, a newlywed couple, look back on their past lives and what it means to live depending on them. The combination of Tori's piano and Shenale's orchestra and orchestra has produced intimate and tiring, promising and visible results in one fall. With Scarlet's Walk, Tori Amos has made an impressive album - but it's been great. Most of the soundtracks that revoke this previous feelings have been replaced with more subtle sound techniques. Verbal expressions have been replaced by emotional expressions. His reduced piano skills have been reduced to a group close to other instruments. Everything that the Tories have done so much is actually drawn a little straight in the middle of the scale. While Scarlett's Walk may not be a sensible journey through the mysterious Tory Amos familiar to her former fans, it is a journey you must make anyway.","overall":5,"summary":"A Walk Worth Taking","unixReviewTime":1070928000,"reviewTime":"12 9, 2003"}

Most of the familiar \u201cstories\u201d, and the tenderness from your local music magazines, are gone - perhaps replaced by marriage, motherhood, aging. Walking Scarlet, her latest CD, tells the story of Scarlet travelling to America to explore her blood. The confession and bloodthirsty rhetoric is gone allowing many of this former fans. While Walking Scarlet is an available album, and just one of her greatest works to weigh in to date, the dark emotional connection between the listener and the creator may be dismissed to some. Scarlet began her journey to explore America on the West Coast in the promised land of Laguna Beach, California. There she immediately met \"Amber Waves\", a porn star in her own direction is a bit confused. While in Los Angeles, Scarlet met a man she loved dearly. When the two climb the Pacific Coast Road she realizes that their romance is just \u201cA Sorta Fairytale\u201d, their imaginary love is quickly split as the dash on the road. \"Amber Waves\" and \"A Sorta Fairytale\" were a typical Tori devoted to her piano melody, so she went on Tori's biggest American hit \"Fairytale.\" \u201cWednesday\u201d is reminiscent of many old sides of Tori with charms like Scarlet and a new charm that has passed through the Pacific Northwest. \u201cAmazing\u201d in contrast to the piano and wurlitzer and the string parts focuses on the reality of what Scarlet has seen so far in her land and what she believes to be true. \u201cCarbon,\u201d in the direction of Tori\u2019s piano line is one of the tape\u2019s most important elements and its closest track. The chorus of support rang out in heaven as they encouraged Scarlet, though frustrated, to continue her journey and \"watch her appearance.\" Scarlet questions the nature of her walk with \"carbon-only that she just does't want to do.\" Somewhat disappointed, Scarlet finds a friend called \u201cCrazy\u201d and with him, one of the most popular commercial tracks on the plate. Nothing can help her be aroused when they hear, \u201clet go of your religion first, and hear that you once tempted the woman\u201d in the nature of Tori\u2019s growth. As Scarlet continues her journey through Native American lands she thinks of all that is lost in the capella \"Wampum Prayer.\" Although not as moving as the classic capella, Little Earthquake\u2019s \u201cMe and the Gun,\u201d its summary provides extra weight. \"Don't make me come to Vegas\" Scarlet said resisting the fires and temptations of Sin City. \u201cVegas,\u201d with drummer Matt Chamberlain, has the same feel as \u201cWednesday\u201d and is even remastered by DJ-extraordinaire Timo Maas. \u201cSweet Sangria\u201d is similar to \u201cCarbon\u201d and is another standing path. \u201cYour clouds\u201d almost becomes a laugh for Tori\u2019s daughter, as the listener floats in the sky in anticipation. \u201cYour Clouds\u201d is also preparing for some of the most iconic, and political, album tracks such as \u201cPancake\u201d and \u201cI Can\u2019t See New York\u201d that clearly focus on the eleventh attack of September. \u201cPancake,\u201d which is the best, has some unmistakable songs like \u201cChristians need people dying in their name\u201d and follows an enthusiastic bassline that Tori returns to her voice characters. \u201cI Can\u2019t See New York\u201d begins easily and calmly at eleven to\u2019clock in the morning as Tori plays a sharp impact guitar in the background before an electric guitar and extra drums enter. Personally, \u201cNew York\u201d was the smallest melody on the plate when I reached its length (seven: fourteen) and aimed not to be too distracted and to interfere with the rest of the album. \u201cMrs. Jesus\u201d is a Traditional Theory that questions religion and its validity and role in your life. \u201cMrs. Jesus\u201d is probably Scarlet Walk\u2019s worst song, with beautiful strings and a room balloon composed by one of Tori\u2019s longtime collaborators, John Philip Shenale. \u201cTaxi Ride\u201d is another piece of a possible commercial dessert that does\u2019t take off once. Referring to the death of Tori's best friend, artist Kevyn Aucoin, \"Taxi Ride\" criticizes the over -wrapped in their world to realize more important things, because she is \"just a corpse.\" Investigates \"Another Girl's Paradise.\" The relationship between the women is similar to Tori's Under Pink, \"The Cornflake Girl.\" The title track is another creative song as Scarlet travels through Cherokee territory in the country\u2019s southeastern state. Scarlet Walk has Scarlet examining relationships and \u201cdeals\u201d between European and Native American residents. \u201cVirginia\u201d also looks at this part of American history and how people who left Europe to seek freedom from Native Americans, and other injustices - political and sexual - committed against the Native American. Closing the album is the most thrilling way on the plate, \u201cGolden Place,\u201d as Scarlet and Tori, the new mothers, reflect on past lives and what it means now that life depends on it. The combination of Tori and Shenale\u2019s orchestral piano and the string section combine to create a close and intense effect, inspiring and simultaneously reflecting. On Scarlet\u2019s Walk, Tori Amos made the album in the middle - but very well. Many of the sound historians who adopted this former senses have been replaced by more sophisticated sound technique. The words of confession were replaced by an emotional story. His interesting piano skills have been reduced to make it sound like other instrumental songs. Everything Tori did about extremism was basically a bit of a drag in the middle of the scale. While the Scarlet Tour may not be the undeniable aural journey of Tori Amos that her former fans are accustomed to, it is a journey worth doing.","overall":5,"summary":"A Walk Worth Taking","unixReviewTime":1070928000,"reviewTime":"12 9, 2003"}

There are so many details, nuances and little secrets hidden on this disc that I'd feel rather guilty if I fail to mention them in my review; then again, I don't think it's possible to cover all its depths in a single review. This really is one of those discs you need to buy, give time, study its lyrics, pay attention to the excellent production, clever songwriting and magnificent musicianship. Some Opeth fans think that never since Steven Wilson has been producing Opeth albums they sound too much like Porcupine Tree in some aspects, especially recording techniques and stereo mixing-wise. Well, I'd like to point out that Wilson's collaboration with Opeth has certainly worked both ways; Steven Wilson has definitely absorbed some of their elements and seamlessly injected them in this own music with Porcupine Tree. This is, as many will agree, the heaviest Porcupine Tree album, and it shows right from the first track. \"Blackest Eyes\" perhaps contains the heaviest guitar riff Steven Wilson has never played; it kicks in after the moody bass line a bit like a gigantic rock piece. The heavy approach is further developed on other tracks as well; on the longest song, \"Gravity Eyelids\", which begins really slowly with minimalist songwriting and tribal rhythms, there is a sudden shift of mood as Wilson plays this shuddering guitar riff (in the vein of Opeth) over Barbieri's experimental keyboard arrangement. It's the kind of riff you might hear on a Tool album, except that I'm not a Tool fan, but it works incredibly well there. Buy the album to hear this riff. Steven Wilson's partner in Blackfield, Aviv Geffen, appears on two tracks, one of them being the highly acclaimed number, \"The Sound of Muzak\". This is one of those songs that I could identify with right away, because of its challenging bass line and despairingly intense shifts of vocal melodies. Moreover, this tune is about the current state of the music industry and its lyrics are terribly ironic, which recall Devin Townsend's \"Earth Day\" to me. John Wesley, who has toured extensively with Marillion in this career, also graces this album with additional guitars and vocals, and it's in your best interest to give this music a listen. The band's affinity to Pink Floyd is still evident on some other songs such as \"Lips of Ashes\" and \"Prodigal\". They are both outstanding works of songwriting, musicianship and vocals. There are also two instrumental pieces there. Actually \".three\" in't entirely 'instrumental' as Wilson cutters a few words, but other than that, it has no vocals. It sounds like this huge orchestra performing psychedelic prog; whilst, \"Wedding Nails\" is the band's testimony to creativity. New drummer Gavin Harrison rules this track as the song delves into stylistic changes, maintaining its moody and heavy edge throughout. I am utterly amazed at the band's musical performance; every prog band needs to listen to this track to understand it is possible to write long instrumental songs without being overtly technical. The slower songs add to the album's diversity. \"Trains\" is a wonderful song built around acoustic guitars that pick up near the send thanks to the majestic drumming, \"Heartattack in a Layby\" and \"Collapse the Light into Earth\" both start with sparse piano notes and Wilson singing the most amazing vocal melodies you could imagine. His voice makes my soul cry; it's full of passion and intensity.\"The Creator Has a Masterpiece\" and \"Strip the Soul\" see the band going back to its new-found heaviness. They are among the most progressive songs of the album full of schizophrenic melodies, frenetic interplay, some electronics and echoed vocals. Colin Edwin's bass is so integral on these tracks that it's the bass that carries the song's speed. \"Strip the Soul\" encapsulates a sense of brutal beauty (hence the Opeth element, in my opinion) and another personal favourite of mine. I own the European edition of this album with a bonus disc containing three tracks and a video. The songs are as good as anything else Steven Wilson has written, so if you're a die-hard Porcupine Tree fan, this version is highly recommended. I've been listening to this album since its release, and still give it regular spins. This is a great album that has aged well and stood the test of time for me.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant Beyond Words","unixReviewTime":1110412800,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2005"}

This is one of those discs that you need to focus on buying, spending time, reading songs, producing the best, writing smart songs and great music. Some Opheit fans believe that since Steven Wilson produced Opheit's albums that in some respects looked like a porcupine tree, especially the recording technique and stereo mixing technique. However, I would like to point out that the collaboration between Wilson and Opeth has worked both ways. Steven Wilson has grabbed some of this belongings and injected himself into the music with a porcupine tree without interruption. This is, as many would admit, the heaviest porcupine tree album, and it appears directly from the original track. \"Very Deep Eyes\" is probably the heaviest guitar piece never played by Steven Wilson. This bus line starts a bit like a big rock piece behind the emoji. Hard track is also developed on other tracks. In the longest song, \"Gravity Islands\", which begins with a small song and the rhythm of the nation, the mood suddenly changes as Wilson takes this shocking riff (Opeth's vein) to Barbary's test keyboard. Runs with Out. It's the kind of riff you can feel in a toolbar album, except I'm not a fan of the tool, but it works great there. Buy an album to hear this sound. Steven Wilson's Blackfield partner, Aviv Geffen, appears in two songs, one of which is the very popular number, \"The Sound of Muzak\". It's one of the songs I can immediately recognize, thanks to its challenging bass line and powerful variations of pitch songs. What's more, this song is about the current state of the music scene, and its lyrics are very vague, reminiscent of Devin Townsend's \"Earth Day.\" John Wesley, who has spent a lot of time with Marilyn on this project, also enjoys the album with guitar and sound, and is delighted to hear the music. The band's relationship with Pink Floyd is still evident in other songs such as \"Ashes Lips\" and \"Prodigal\". Both are great works of songwriting, music and lyrics. There are also two pieces. In fact, \".three\" is completely 'instrumental' because Wilson cuts out a few words, but other than that, the has no words. It's as if this big orchestra is doing a psychological program. However, \"Wedding Nails\" is a testament to the founding group. New drummer Gavin Harrison has mastered the song because the song changes style, keeping it flexible and rigid. I'm totally amazed by the band's music. Every prog band needs to listen to this song to understand the possibility of writing long instrumental songs without high technology. Slow songs add variety to the album. \"Trains\" is a beautiful song played with a sound guitar that sounds close to the Thanksgiving post on lavish drumming. And Wilson sings a wonderful voice. Music that you can think of. Her voice mourns my soul. It is full of enthusiasm and energy. They are one of the most progressive songs on the album, full of schizophrenic melodies, obsessive interplay, some electronics and catchy voices. Colin Edwin's bass is so important to these tracks that it's a bass that has the speed of singing. The \"strip of the soul\" includes a sense of oppression (hence the opiate element, in my opinion) and one of my favourites. I have a European version of this album which has a bonus disc with three tracks and a video. The songs are similar to anything written by Steven Wilson, so if you're a big fan of the Porcupine Tree, this version is highly recommended. I've been listening to this album never since it came out, and I'm still making it permanent. This is a beautiful album that has developed well and has represented me for a long time.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant Beyond Words","unixReviewTime":1110412800,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2005"}
{"orig_index":39744,"reviewerID":"AWVQR7YYTYJ1L","asin":"B00006JUML","reviewerName":"Brittany Rose","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"The thing that got Craig noticed with this first album was the fact it was very different yet listenable compared to most mainstream music at the time it was released. Of course releasing a similar album would't be acceptable, so Craig had to are-invent himself, and so the has with an for 'n' of lava, but the still remains true to this two-step roots. The album starts with \"Slicker Than Your Average\", a very showy piece of production that drags on a bit but really sets the stone for the album and is rather catchy. \"What's Your Flava\" is the first single and illustrates Craig's more poppy sound and is probably the biggest departure from the first cd in my opinion. \"Fast Cars\" is a hot for 'n' of track that really makes you want to dance and is packaged for club playage, for at least meant for a soundtrack to some hot new movie. The cd then takes a slight turn with \"Hidden Agenda\" the second song off the album, and has a rather unusual seaway from the previous song involving a car chase. The song itself is supposed to be \"seven Days\" from the first album are-invented, but is a lot more poppy and upbeat, with nice spanish guitar. \"Eenie Meenie\" is more of a filler track that sticks to a clean two-step sound, and really in't that stand-outish. Then we have the slow and personal set, starting with \"You Don't Miss Your Water\" a piano driven ballad that moans about the woes of being broken up, and showcases Craigs voice a bit. Then we have the Stateside smash \"Rise and Fall\" featuring Sting, the only real collar. on the whole album. Discussing the pains of fame it is similar to \"Walking Away\" in message, and is really catchy and laid-back at the same time. \"Personal\" is probably my least fave song on the whole album, as its drab, unoriginal, and it reminds me of some shorty Janet Jackson filler track. However the same could be said of one song on Craig's last album, so its really not all that bad. The final five songs on the cd are probably my favourite. \"Hands Up In The Air\" mixes ship shop with two-step for a catchy dance number that is just really fun. \"two Steps Back\" is, as the title implies, somewhat of a two-Step song, and really truly one of my faves on the whole cd. Its really really catchy and simple to learn the words to, hence the fun. Err. I don't know if this song is on the American version for if Amazon.com has just left it out, but \"Spanish\" is track eleven on my copy and really really my fave song on the whole album. It has a real club feel and is super fun to using and dance to, with spanish style instrumentals, a very unique chorus, and a wrap bit in the middle. \"Whats Changed\" is somewhat of a duet with unknown singer Katie Holmes (not the actress) about a couple on the verge of breaking up, and is really slick and good, kinda reminds me of \"Fill Me In\" during the chorus. Finally \"World Filled With Love\" is another real departure for Craig, featuring a very dreamy sense to it and a positive message behind it all, a different track indeed and a good way to send the album keeping the listeners wondering \"What'll the do next?\"While some listeners might miss the familiarity of Craig's first album, if you listen carefully you'll hear the traditional sounds of Craig David.

Of course it is not acceptable to produce the same album, so Craig has had to design it himself, so there is for'n 'lava, but it is true to the roots of these two steps. The album starts with \u201cSlicker Than Your Average\u201d This is a very good job, it delays, but it plays the foundation for the album, and it is very attractive. \"What's Your Flava\" is the first single, featuring Craig's poppy-like voice, in my opinion it might be a big difference on the first CD. \"Fast Cars\" is a popular song, makes you want to dance, and is packed with club games, at least meaning the song of hot new movies. The CD then turned the second song \"The Hidden Agenda\" into the album, and compared to the previous song, which included a car chase, it had an unusual journey. The song itself is supposed to be \"seven days\" from the debut album, but it's very popular and hopeful, with a good Spanish guitar. \"Eenie Meenie\" is like a filling song, focusing on a clean two-step sound, not the highlight. Then we can slow down with personal planning, starting with \u201cYou\u2019re Not Missing Your Water\u201d, which is a piano-driven parade that complains of a broken problem and reflects Craig\u2019s voice a little. Then we launched an American song \"Rise and Fall\" featuring Sting, the only real chorus. On the whole plate. Speaking of the spain of fame, the message is like \u201cgoing too far\u201d, but at the same time lovely and relaxed. \"Personal\" is probably my favourite song in the entire album, because it's nothing and it's not original. It reminds me of short songs filled with Janet Jackson. However, it can be said of the song on Craig's last album, so it's not that bad. The last five songs on the CD are probably my favourite jones. \"Hands up in the air\" combines a boat shop and a two-step dance to make dance music very interesting and interesting. As the title suggests, \u201cTwo Steps Back\u201d is a two-step song, actually one of my favourite songs on the entire CD. Learning vocabulary is really interesting and easy, so it's fun. Oh yeah. I don't know if this song is in the American version, because Amazon.com downloaded it, but \"Spanish\" is the eleventh song in my copy, and it's my favourite song from the whole album. It has a real club feel, very fun to use and dance to, as well as Spanish-style instruments, a special choir and a surrounding central area. \"What Has Changed\" is similar to the duet of anonymous singer Katie Holmes (not the actress) about a couple on the opposite side, and it's really good. It\u2019s like reminding me of \u201cFill Me Up\u201d when you using in a music song. chorus. In the send, the \"world full of love\" is one of Craig's true beginnings. It has a very dreamy feel with all the constructive messages behind it. It\u2019s really a different song and a great way to send a disc to the audience. to know \"What's going to happen next? What's next?\" The value of a ship shop, in the \u2018n\u2019 and two steps, Craig combines the categories and really needs to get world attention.","overall":5,"summary":"The name says it all...","unixReviewTime":1059004800,"reviewTime":"07 24, 2003"}

Of course the release of a similar album is unacceptable, so Craig has to create this own, so the has an \u201cn\u201d lava, but it\u2019s still true in two step roots. The album starts with \u201cSlicker Than Your Average\u201d, which is a very catchy production that is quite enticing but really entices the album as an attraction. \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Flava\u201d was the first to feature Craig\u2019s poppy sound which was probably the biggest departure of the first cd in my opinion. \u201cFast Cars\u201d is a hot for \u2018n\u2019 track that you really want to dance for the palm of your hand in the lottery, at least recording new hot movie songs. The CD then slightly switches to \u201cHidden Agenda\u201d which is the second song from the album, and it has an unusual excerpt from the previous song involving a car chase. The song itself is thought to be \u201cseven days\u201d from the first album created, but it\u2019s more poppy and upbeat, with better Spanish guitar. \u201cEenie Meenie\u201d is a multi-step tracker with a clean two-step soundtrack, which really in\u2019t alone. Then we have a slow personal approach, starting with the piano \u201cYou Don\u2019t Miss Your Water\u201d mourning the broken break, which somewhat reflects Craigs \u2019voice. Then we have Stateside destruction \u201cRise and Fall\u201d with Sting, which is the only real one. the whole album. Talking about the popular disease is similar to the \u201cWalk\u201d message, and it is enticing and repetitive at the same time. \u201cPersonal\u201d is probably my favourite song on the entire album, as it\u2019s catchy, not original, and reminds me of some of Janet Jackson\u2019s short songs. Yet the same can be said of a song on Craig\u2019s latest album, so it\u2019s not really that bad. The last five songs on the cd are probably my favourite. \u201cHands Up In The Air\u201d combines the ship shop and two steps for a catchy and truly fun dance number. \u201cTwo Steps Back\u201d is, as the title suggests, a small step song, and definitely one of my favourite things on the whole cd. It\u2019s really engaging and easy to learn words, so have fun. Error I don't know if this song is in the American genre without Amazon.com, but \"Spanish\" is eleven copies of my version and it's definitely my favourite song on the entire album. It has a real club feel that is very fun to use and dance to, with Spanish -style instrumental instruments, a unique chorus, and a bit of wrapping in the middle. \u201cWhat Has Changed\u201d is a small piece by anonymous artist Katie Holmes (not the actress) about a couple who are about to split up, and they\u2019re really soft and nice, kind of reminding me of \u201cFill you me \"during the chorus. . Finally \u201cThe World of Full Love\u201d is another real departure for Craig, showing a very dreamy feeling and a positive message all behind it, really different and a great way to send an album with a surprising audience \u201cWhat is it the next time you do it? What Craig saw on this first album was the fact that it was very different and still audible than most regular music at the time of its release. The album begins with \"Slicker Than Your Average\", which is part of what an intriguing production that attracts a bit but really calms the album rock. \"What is your Flava?\" the first to show Craig's poppy voice. favourite throughout the album.","overall":5,"summary":"The name says it all...","unixReviewTime":1059004800,"reviewTime":"07 24, 2003"}

Their debut was electrifying, to say the least; with the follow-up release \"Awake\" quite a bit weaker. With this, their third release, \"Faceless\" is a return to hard hitting, classic metal music. Once again, Godsmack powers their way through with another strong record. Full of crunching opening riffs, and classic style manic lead guitar work, it reminds one of \"the good role' days\". You know, the verse-chorus-verse structure, with a small bridge and a big whopping guitar solo thrown in. Amen. What never happened to the guitar solo anyway? Ever since we got Nirvana, we've been deprived of the wicked guitar soloing that was so popular in decades past. Thanks to bands like Godsmack, the drought has ended. With plenty of hot and healthy guitar clicks throughout, this record follows in the footsteps of the first record. It follows the first record so closely that, that is it's one possible fault. Diversity is somewhat of a problem with this band. Like so many other Hard Rock \/ Metal bands, they have just one speed really, and rarely divert from it. The thing that separates Godsmack from many other facts though, . they do that one speed damn good! Reminiscent of early Metallica, . you remember that, right?. before Metallica learned about the power ballad, nobody did fast and furious as well as Metallica. They had only one speed, and they obliterated your years, and the competition with it. Godsmack is on the very same track there. So, . are they as talented as a Metallica? I would say not, but they are exciting to listen to all the same. With songs such as \"Make Me Believe\" and \"Re-Align\" jumping off the disc and going straight for the throat, it is a very \"free\" sounding record. This band is hungry. They want to play everything to waste that may block their rise to metal supremacy. God bless 'em. I haven't heard hunger like this from a heavy hitter for a very long time. All of these songs seem to attack you right out of the gate. With the first single, \"Straight Out Of Line\" rising slowly, to later bludgeon your senses, it seems almost subtle in it's approach, comparatively. \"Straight Out Of Line\" is a great Metal song. This record is full of great Metal songs. If you are a fan of the heavy stuff, check this one out. Not all of these songs are well crafted, but they all have great intensity. Like the first record, this one finishes with a sleek tribal chant (\"Serenity\") that is a change of space, but still sounds edgy. It is slower than the rest, more melodic than the rest, more sensitive than the rest; but it has an \"unsafe\" feeling to it also. Like you possibly just walked into this tribe's sacred ground, and they just happen to be cannibalistic! It's nice to hear vocalist Sully Erna actually using out also. He shows throughout the record that the has great strength, but rarely shows any range for accenting style. On \"Serenity\" they slow it down a bit, and the shows some vocal poise. This is a band that could be a contender. The writing in't always great. The songs, at times, may seem to blend together due to the similar space, and the overpowering vocals on most tracks. The songs, at all times though, are not \"forced\" for premeditated, they are natural. This band is doing what comes naturally for them, and they're doing it pretty well.

They want to ruin everything that might prevent them from emerging as a metal overlord. God bless them. For a long time I have felt such hunger for heavyweight athletes. All of these songs seem to attack you from the beginning. As the first single \"Straight Out Of Line\" rises slowly and later rekindles your emotions, its path seems a bit overwhelming. \"Straight Out Of Line\" is a great metal song. This record is full of great instrumental songs. If you are a hard worker, check this out. Not all of these songs are carefully crafted, but they are all very powerful. Like the first record, this record ends with a cool international song (\"Sorry\"), which changes the scene, but still sounds savant-garde.

As you have just entered the holy land of the nation, they are likely to be the stones of others! I'm happy to hear that lead singer Sully Erna is also gone.

Again, Godsmack has the ability to go through another strong record. Full of opening cracks, and the usual style of manic lead guitar work, it reminds me of one of those \u201cgood paper days\u201d. You know, the verse-chorus-verse structure, with a little bridge and a huge guitar thrown at it. Amen. What never happened to a guitar alone? Ever since we got Nirvana, we\u2019ve been denied the single bad guitar that\u2019s been so popular for decades. Thanks to groups like Godsmack, the thirst is over. With a lot of warm and healthy guitar playing, this record follows in the footsteps of the original record. It strictly follows the first note, which is a possible mistake. Diversity is a small problem for this group. Like many other Hard Rock \/ Metal, they only have one speed really, and are rarely slippery. The item separates Godsmack and many other facts. they make a great speed! Memories of the former Metallica,. Do you remember that? Before Metallica knew the extent of the power, no one was quick and angry with Metallica. They have only one speed, and erased your years, and the competition with them. Godsmack is on the same path. Now,. are they as good as Metallica? I won\u2019t say, but they were interested in listening to each other. Songs like \u201cBelieve Me\u201d and \u201cRevival\u201d that jump off the plate and go straight down the throat, are a very \u201cfree\u201d record. This group is hungry.

All of these songs seem to attack you when you walk out the door. Like the first, \u201cOff the Line\u201d slowly rises, so that the can feel your emotion later, it seems closer to tactics, in comparison. \u201cStraight Out Of Line\u201d is a great metal song. This record is full of beautiful metal songs. If you\u2019re a fan of heavy stuff, check out this one. Not all of these songs are well made, but they all have great potential. Like the first note, this one ends with a nice tribal song (\u201cSerenity\u201d) that replaces the position, but still looks rough. It\u2019s slower than others, it\u2019s richer than others, it\u2019s more emotional than others; but it also has an \u201cunsafe\u201d feel to it. Like you, you may have just entered this sacred land, and it was beaten by the people! It\u2019s so nice to hear vocalist Sully Erna actually use it. He shows in the record that the Lord has great power, but rarely shows any kind of dialect. In \u201cSerenity\u201d they reduce the volume, and it shows a bit of noise. This is a team that can be competitive. Writing is not always good. The songs, at times, can be interrelated because of the similar space, and cloud sounds of most tracks.

Slower than others, louder than others, more sensitive than others; But it also feels \"unsafe\". As you have just entered the sanctity of this nation, and so it is that they are the price. Nice to hear that artist Sally Erna used it again. He shows throughout the record that the has great power, but rarely does the show any kind of emphasis. In \"Quiet\" they slow down a bit, and the shows are quiet. This is a potential competitor. Writing is not always good. The song, sometimes with powerful lyrics in many tracks, can be seen coming together in one place. Songs, however, are not always \"forced\" to are-arrange, they are natural. This band does what comes naturally to them, and they do it very well.

Highlights include the new-soul \"Prototype,\" the flipped on its year May-December romance of \"Pink and Blue,\" the autobiographical \"A Day in the Life of Benjamin Andre,\" and the infectious, ubiquitous `sixtys pop influenced \"Hey Ya!\"\"The Love Below\" by itself would be worth the price of admission, but Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton's \"Speakerboxxx\" sweetens the deal.

After moving to a major recording company, I think we are all worried that their style will change drastically as a result of the move; however, we have found their salt. For fans with two EPs testing over the past few years, this is an interesting version. There is no doubt that this is a very powerful total length, from a group that has consistently produced powerful records.","overall":4,"summary":"Is it better than At Dawn?","unixReviewTime":1070150400,"reviewTime":"11 30, 2003"}

I finally went to a big recording label, thinking that we were all afraid that the move would change their style. However, we find their salt. Country music is still being made using the same production methods (ie old grain remnants). The sounds of this album are as beautiful and full as their previous works. Songwriting and composition are still strong, but I still don't think the whole album is as strong as this debut album at Dawn. However, this album includes two of my favourite MMJ songs to date, so I can't complain much. That's because I don't feel as strong with Dawn as we've been through the slightest change in style over the years, and the voices that were with Dawn will probably never rise again and this new The morning jacket is there. Staying rooted in their real world and adding some of the latest EP features to their latest EPs and this album, which is probably based on current UK rock, is definitely interesting and exciting. It is undoubtedly a full-length solid by the team that has always set solid records. And an interesting release for fans who only had two EPs, which were researched a few years ago.","overall":4,"summary":"Is it better than At Dawn?","unixReviewTime":1070150400,"reviewTime":"11 30, 2003"}

No problem with songs on this CD from that CD), it's worth buying for Michael Jackson beginners. But this idea is flawed. Number one? Looking at the charts of the United States and the United Kingdom, these songs have not been #some of the two countries: Thriller, Smooth Crime, You Rock My World, Break Of Dawn. Ben's version of this CD was edited from one, nine hundred and eighty Jackson live LPs (can't authorize the first version ?, this is #one). World Song went to # one in the UK. As for the four people above, their destination is a mystery. Liner notes without chart knowledge. Surprisingly, Michael's one, zero song titled \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" and nine hundred and ninety-seven combined CDs were released at #one in the UK and has never been seen. There is no date between Say Say Say and Paul McCartney. One note: Sukuma version by DJ three: Fifty-five version - not the LP version. All of this sounds like a click. However, if you are selling a CD called Number One, be prepared to support your facts. This is a good Hits CD. If you are new to Michael Jackson and only want these things, then this is the Greatest Hits Vol. Someone will do it.","overall":5,"summary":"Ballad Friendly","unixReviewTime":1247270400,"reviewTime":"07 11, 2009"}

First off, don't listen to people who say this record sucks and don't offer any reason as to why it sucks. They probably think this most likely because they don't understand it. Also, I've never put much stock in the words of people who can't tell when to use \"their\" and when to use \"there\", that's just elementary grammar. That being said the album is greatness. I love the entire storybook concept. It's different than anything else I've bought this year. The songs follow a logical rise and fall of emotions. It's quite brilliant. Mae develop their sound more on this record and show a great deal of maturity. The keyboards are more interwoven into every song and seem to hold them together. Standout tracks include the amazing \"Painless\", which segues nicely into \"The Ocean\". \"Suspension\" and \"Anything\" are also two of the more exceptional tracks. The whole album is great and if you liked Destination:Beautiful for B-Sides, you will definitely dig this. One more thing, I love Anberlin and some reviewers were suggesting that you buy \"Never Take Friendship Personal\" instead of the \"The Everglow\". There is no reason you should not own both. I've never understood why people have to crap on one band in order to say they like another. Buy both albums. They're awesome. In fact, almost everything on Tooth & Nail Records is amazing. The bottom line is: Buy the Everglow. You will not be disappointed.","overall":5,"summary":"Knock Me Down and I'll Get Up Again","unixReviewTime":1112054400,"reviewTime":"03 29, 2005"}

First of all, do not listen to people who claim to be bad news, and do not give them any excuse. They may think that this is because they do not understand. Additionally, I do not know much about the names of people who do not know when to use their \"word\" and when to use the word \"there\". This is basic grammar. It can be said that this disc is delicious. I love every concept book story. This is different from everything I bought this year. The songs follow the sense of emotions rising and falling. It's amazing. Mae developed their voice further and showed great growth in this record. The keyboard is more integrated into each song, it seems to blend together. Outstanding songs include the amazing \"Pain\", beautifully composed \"Ocean\". \"Suspension\" and \"Anything\" are also two special songs. The whole plate is fine, if you like Landing Point: Beautiful in B-Side, you will definitely love this one. One more thing, I like Anberlin. Some critics suggest you buy \"Never Make a Friend\" instead of \"The Everglow\". You have no reason not to have both at the same time. I don't understand why people have to say stupid things to one party and say they like the other. Buy two albums. They are very beautiful. In fact, almost everything on Tooth & Nail Records is amazing. The bottom line is: buy Everglow. You will not be disappointed.","overall":5,"summary":"Knock Me Down and I'll Get Up Again","unixReviewTime":1112054400,"reviewTime":"03 29, 2005"}

First of all, don't listen to people who say the record is useless and don't give a reason why it's useless. They may think this is very likely because they do not understand it. Also, I've never stored so much in the words of people who can't tell when they should use \"their\" and when they should use \"there\", that's a basic grammar. That's what a great album is all about. I like the whole concept of a story book. This is different from anything bought this year. Songs follow sensible fluctuations of emotion. Very good. Mae has further enhanced this voice in this record and it has increased tremendously. The keyboards are very connected to all the songs and they seem to be together. The standing tracks include the amazing \"Penalis\", which blends well with the \"sea\". \"Suspension\" and \"Anything\" are also two very different tracks. The whole album is beautiful and if you like Destination: Beautiful for B-Sides you will definitely dig into it. Also, I like Enberlin and some reviewers have suggested that you buy \"NeuroTech A Personal Friendship\" instead of \"The Everglove\". There is no reason not to own both.

As James James Jones Pimp C's stories, Bun showed that they can live independently as solo artists .

Bun B has a profound insight into all of these verses, for the has learned to compose a beautiful melody, not just a three-part song. My favourite song on this album is STORY, because it details all aspects of UGK's work. Other great songs include GET PHONSWA, DRAPED UP, PUSHIN, HOLD U DOWN, IM AG, GIT IT and WHO NEEDS AB. I definitely recommend the Bun B album for UGK fans, Southern Music and Ofuna Store. This will definitely attract an audience (and Pimp C's new album Pimpalation!)

The trail reflects a specific character. Not just the trail itself Demonstrates Ben B's flexibility in performing songs and even taking different titles. Like the stories of Pimp C's Sweet James Jones, Ben shows that the can survive on this own as an artist. Everyone appears to fall in love with the Underground King, including Young Jizzi, JZ, ZRO, Lil Keke, Ludacris, Scarface, Mike Jones, TI, Juvenile, Two Short, Paul Wall, Slim Thug, Lil Philip, Baby, Tree Songs and Young Yang twins. An old friend and fellow pimp also appears. With this star full of characters, one might think that the album is full but it does't come in and flow without stitching. Production credits include Jazzy Fa, Mani Fresh, Lil June, and Kolipark, as well as other well-known small producers such as Corey Moe, Mike Dan (Rap A Loot Release, Daz Dlinger.), And -KLC (No Limits). \u06d4 However, the best contributions come from producer Mr. Lee (Sweet James Jones Stories) who collaborates with Pishin, Get Thread, and IMAG. The album does't need to explode. Ben B gets the bottom of all these verses because Jehovah has learned to make beautiful songs instead of three-song songs. My favourite song on this album is STORY because it describes all aspects of UGK's work. Some of the top songs include Get Fonsova, Rapid Up, Pishin, Hold You Hang, IMAG, GIT, and Who needs B? I definitely recommend Bun B's album to UGK fans, Southern music, and a great cruise liner. This should definitely keep listeners (and Dalal C's new album pamphlet!)

For some bands it just takes sheer boredom, boredom with their signature sound, for some it takes a spirit of creativity and experimentalism, and for some it takes tragedy. Louisville, Kentucky's Jim James, and this fellow daybreak jackets, experience a little bit of turmoil and tragedy leading up to two thousand and five's release of Z, My Morning Jacket's (as best as I can come up with) fourth studio album. Leading up to Jacket's Z, founding band member, Johnny Quaid (no relation to Dennis), and guitarist departed the band along with the keyboardist Danny Cash. The question is out there, will Quaid and Cash someday become the infamous fiveth Beatles? I'll answer that one now, nope, neither one have been associated with the Beatles, only My Morning Jacket so it's kind of an impossibility. So you did't come there to read this to listen to my random inane ramblings. You want to know the dish and dirt on Z. Is it any good? Should I bother spending time listening to it and getting to know it? Will I be considered a middle aged hipster if I start claiming allegiance to My Morning Jacket's never growing legion of loyal fans? The answers my fellow Amazonians are yes, yes, and check yeah! Some people would say that My Morning Jacket became the next Wilco with the release of Z. Well, that would be shorting MMJ methinks. They are this eclectic amalgam whose music is very hard to pigeonhole. The musicality is off the charts. The first track, Wordless Chorus, has this seventy's easy funk R&B; groove going on. Track two, Dondante, hits you with James' ghost-like high wail. There's something ethereal about this voice as it climbs into the high registers. Gideon, track four, is a little musical masterpiece including symphonic arrangements with beating on a symphonic drum I believe. Track seven, Anytime, is the radio friendly indie superhit that comes off as My Morning Jacket doing a riff on Pela riffing on Arcade Fire who in turn is really riffing on My Morning Jacket. Complicated, I know, but follow me there. My Morning Jacket is a sound all its own, in a class all its own. I don't doubt we'll be hearing much from them in the future as they forever evolve. I haven't dug into their two thousand and weight release Evil Urges, which oddly enough I could't find on Amazon just now to stick in a link for house guys.

Sure, such a potent Grammy winning number as \"Daughters\" is a song that might never be forgotten in music history, but CONTINUUM I believe maybe the truest and quite possible the first TRUE John Mayer album that we've heard. The material there as well as the overall sound and timbre easily trumps a majority of Mayer's earlier and previously best material. I am glad to see the virtuosic Mayer (where this guitar chops are concerned) actually embrace the blues-side of rock and venture out in a direction that showcases that bluesy-soulful influence. If nothing else, Mayer's CONTINUUM is easily Mayer's most soulful LP. The album opens up with the simple enough, but brilliantly simple \"Waiting For The World To Change\". Unfortunate for the PROMO single is that radio did't give it the respect that it should've. It is a very nice track and it is one that is tuneful enough that it sticks when you listen to it. What is most admirable and loveable is the soulfulness that pours from this track, almost a newfound soulfulness for a complete rejuvenation of Mayer that ditches \"Clarity\" for \"Bigger Than My Body\" for Hendrix, Buddy Guy, B. B. King influenced blues rock.\"I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You)\" is a second consistent number, keeping up the idea of minimalist soulful arrangements coupled with Mayer's awesome, virtuosic guitar playing. Something else key there is that Mayer's vocals sound as mature as never, not to say that the did't on HEAVIER THINGS (a very good album, not knocking it), but it is a new found maturity, which was foreshadowed by the TRY! which was a project featuring Mayer's newly formed trio, who are featured on CONTINUUM as well.\"Belief\" is yet another strong track. What makes it so cool besides it's driving soulful-rhythmic feel is the booming bass line that is so often \"underwhelmed\" in adult-alternative music. Here, Mayer has the bass line turned up with a \"booming\" sound that is perfect for this track. What may even make Mayer's vocal performance stronger there is this subtlety and this use of instrumental breaks in between the verse and the chorus as well as in between parts of the verse.\"Gravity\" sounds like it should be featured on say an Anthony Hamilton album for a B. B. King album. The opening guitar solo in the six feel is just immaculate. This is yet another five star number of two thousand and six, perhaps one of the most touching tracks there. The morgan is subtle in the background, but it serves its purpose ten-fold. The songwriting there is as it has been through the entirety of the album-- way above par and above the par that great songwriter Mayer has previously set for himself in the past.\"The Heart Of Life\" speeds the tempo back up again after the chilling \"Gravity\". This track spans more than adult-alternative, and is a track that would sound nearly equally at home on say a Sufjan Stevens album for a country-rock folk album. The guitar sounds great there and yet again John Mayer does't disappoint, even if you expect him to after five straight great, consistent numbers.\"Vultures\" returns a rhythmic groove back to continuum. The sound there is a mix of a classic soul groove and an overall soulful blues-rock arrangement. I personally love the sound of Mayer's vocals there as well as the semi-polytonal element of the rhythmic guitar coupled with Mayer's guitar improvisations and riffs. This track is a masterwork of \"in the pocket\" rhythm section playing and it is just another phenomenal track.\"Stop This Train\" is in the same plane as \"The Heart Of Life\", only there is a slight bit more rhythmic support on the bottom with a very supportive bass line at the bottom of the arrangement. The songwriting there is again great and the chord progression is perfect. I love and \"heart\" the folk feel and the hearkening to go back to the simpler times of acoustic music and the earthy feel of tracks such as these.\"Slow Dancing In A Burning Room\" is personally one of my very favourite tracks there. While all the tracks on this album are great, this one just has the soulfulness that I've been hoping that Mayer would always pull out. It was like I felt Mayer was so close with numbers such as \"Daughters\" and \"Come Back To Bed\", but the soulfulness that oozes there is phenomenal. The guitar sound is great and reminds me of listening to Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Eric Clapton, B. B. for any of the great Blues artists. While \"Bold As Love\" in't my favourite, it is very ambitious that Mayer did a Hendrix cover. \"Dreaming With A Broken Heart\", starts out with an incredibly tender melodic piano line as well as bomber lyrics and vocals by Mayer. This is among the tender and most plaintive sounding I've heard Mayer. another winning and enthralling vocal performance that starts out slowly and picks up more and more momentum as the song progresses. Another one of my favourites. The introductory morgan in \"In Repair\" again marks the maturity of Mayer with CONTINUUM. His sense of what \"real music\" should represent is made so clear on this album which deserves Grammy nominations! This time you just feel that Mayer got it right with the chilling melodic vocal lines, the exceptional guitar work coupled with everything else. He ends on a high note with \"I'm Gonna Gind Another You\", which begins with Mayer's soulful chops only accompanied by a bluesy electric guitar. Again, the feel is in six and gradually horns, drums, and morgan are added to the mix. It is absolutely chilling and enthralling to listen to. This is the first Mayer album for me that I am table to listen to without stopping. it is THAT GOOD. The production there is first rate as is both Mayer's songwriting and this vocals. The guitar playing was always there, but maybe because everything else is so great there it sounds that much better and that much stronger. For me, Mayer has made perhaps one of the VERY best albums of two thousand and six. I would love, as I've already said, to see Mayer snatch Grammys for this wonderful and exciting music experience. four.five stars!!!","overall":5,"summary":"The Album That I've Been Waiting for Mayer To Make","unixReviewTime":1158451200,"reviewTime":"09 17, 2006"}

Sure, a powerful Grammy-winning song like \"Girls\" will never be forgotten in the history of music, but I believe CONTINUUM could be the real album and possibly the first TRUE album by John Mayer we've never heard. The elements in it and the overall sound and timbre easily surpass many of May\u2019s original items and goodies. It gives me great pleasure to see the talented Mayer (in terms of guitar tablature) actually embracing the rock and roll blues and venture on the side to show the romantic impact of the blues. If nothing else, Mayer's CONTINUUM is undoubtedly the most popular LP by Mayer. The album starts off simple enough but is very simple \u201cWaiting for the country to change\u201d. Unfortunately, the single PROMO did not give him the respect the deserved. This is a very beautiful song, and its sound is enough to keep you listening. The most beautiful and endearing thing is the deep love that is poured out in this song. It is almost a newly discovered love that completely rejuvenates Mayer. It is cast by a green stone that was touched by Hendrix, Buddy Guy, and BB King. \"She is bigger than my body\". \"I'm Not Confident (To Love You)\" is the second unmistakable sequel to the idea of \u200b\u200ba small and loving arrangement, combined with Mayer's amazing performance and guitar excellence. Another key point is that Mayer's singing has never sounded as mature as it does now. This is a project that includes three newly formed Mayers, from CONTINUUM. \"Myth\" is another powerful track. In addition to driving the soul\u2019s sense of rhythm, the thing that makes it so cool is the growing bass line, which is always \u201clost\u201d in adult music. Here, Mayer has transformed the bass line into a \u201crumble\u201d sound, which is very good for this song. What may make Mayer's sound even more powerful is the deception and the use of the distortion of the instrument between the poem and the choir and between parts of the poem. \"Gravity\" sounds like a BB King album should appear on Anthony Hamilton's album. The opening guitar of the six ideas was flawless. This is one of the five stars in two thousand and six, probably one of the most touching songs out there. Morgan is clever at the back, but has a tenfold result. The songwriting there is like an entire album \u2014 far beyond the standards set by the great songwriter Meyer in the past. The \"heart of life\" is in the cold \"gravity\". This track not only covers alternative routes for adults, but also tracks almost the same sounds at home, such as Sufjan Stevens \u2019country album. The guitar sounds good there, and John Mayer never disappoints again, even if you expect him to be behind five consecutive big, consistent numbers. \"Ivulture\" returns the rhythm groove to the continuum. The sound is a mixture of classical soul rhythms and a perfect arrangement of blues stones. I personally love Mayer\u2019s sound and the polytone guitar rhythm and Mayer guitar enhancement and refinement. This piece is part of the \"pocket\" rhythm, just another unusual piece. \"Stop this train\" and \"Heart of Life\" are in the same plane, but the rhythm is slightly supported, and there is a very strong bass line at the bottom of the setting. The songwriting is fun there too, and the chord progression is perfect. I love and \u201clove\u201d indigenous songs and go back to the simple era of original soundtrack and listening to the earthly feeling of that song. \"A little dancing in the burning room\" is one of my favourite songs. While all the songs on this album are good, this album has a deep sense that I always hoped the Mayor would always release it. It\u2019s like I think Mayer is very close to numbers like \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and \u201cback to bed\u201d, but the love from there is amazing. The sound of the guitar is sweet and reminds me to listen to Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Eric Clapton, B. While \u201cBold As Love\u201d is not my favourite thing, Mayer is proud to cover Hendrix. \"Dreaming With a Broken Heart\" begins with a very soft piano music and Mayer's bombing vocals and lyrics. This is one of the softest and most sad words Mayer never heard. Another interesting voice performance began slowly, gaining more and more power as the song progressed. Another thing I love. Morgan's introduction to \"Repairing\" also shows Meyer's growth with CONTINUUM. His sense of what \"real music\" should be clearly expressed in this Grammy-nominated album! This time, you think Mayer did well with a line of cool music, excellent guitar work, and everything else. He concluded with \"I'll Give You Another\" and began with Meyer's love slash, accompanied only by a blues electric guitar. Also, the feeling is that at six horns and a slow movement, drums and Morgan are added to the mixture. It feels completely cool. For me, this is Mayer's first album and I can listen incessantly. Very good. The production is top notch, and Meyer's song lyrics and voice are also top notch. Playing the guitar has always been, but probably because everything else is good, it sounds better and more powerful. To me, the album produced by Mayer was probably one of the best albums of two thousand and six. Like I said, I would love to see Meyer win a Grammy for this amazing and fun music experience.

Sure, a strong Grammy winning number like \u201cGirls\u201d is a song that will never be forgotten in music history, but CONTINUE I believe this may be the most realistic and possibly the first TRUE John Mayer album we\u2019ve never heard. The outside materials as well as the overall sound and schedule can easily destroy much of Mayer\u2019s past and present. I was glad to see the perfect Mayer (where the cutter applies) actually folded into the rock and I turned in the direction that showed the psychological impact. Without it, Mayer\u2019s STOP makes Mayer the most LP. The door opens easily and enough, but it\u2019s very simple \u201cWaiting for the World to Change\u201d. Unfortunately, the invention of PROMO is that radio does not give the respect it should have. It\u2019s a great track and it\u2019s very organized and sticky when you\u2019re listening.

The lyrics are there as they read the entire album - way above and above the level of great poetry, Mayer has long established himself. -kale, and it\u2019s a trail that sounds equally at home when it comes to Sufjan Stevens \u2019folk-rock album. The guitar was very strong there but John Mayer did\u2019t fail, even if you\u2019d expect him to have five straights and a lot of numbers after a while.

The writing of the songs is again great and the development is perfect. I love and feel the \u201cheart\u201d for people and hearing so I go back to the simple moments of acoustic music and the feeling of the earth on tracks like this. While all the tracks on this album are great, this one has the mood and I hope Mayer always comes out. I seemed to feel like Mayer was very close to numbers like \u201cGirls\u201d and \u201cBack in Bed\u201d, but the frustration it caused was amazing. The guitar sounds great and reminds me to listen to Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Eric Clapton, B. B. each of the great Blues artists. Although I don\u2019t like \u201cBold As Love\u201d, it was with great ambition that Mayer did the cover for Hendrix. \u201cDreaming of a Broken Heart\u201d, begins with an amazing and very soft piano as well as drum songs and Mayer\u2019s vocals. This is one of the softest and most popular votes I\u2019ve heard about Mayer. another successful and engaging sound performance that slowly begins to rise as the song progresses. Another one I love. Morgan\u2019s introduction to \u201cReconstruction\u201d is a are -symbol of Mayer\u2019s era in SII SOCOTA. This album clearly showed this sense of what \u201creal music\u201d should represent to be worthy of a Grammy nomination! This time, you feel like Mayer is right on the lines of the sweet cooling sound, the special guitar work along with everything else. It ends with a high-profile note \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Gind another You\u201d, which begins with a Mayer-only chorus accompanied by a blue electric guitar. Again, six feel and gradually add horns, drums, and morgan to the mix. It's very cool and very interesting to listen to.

Sure, such a strong Grammy-winning number \"Daughters\" is a song that will never be forgotten in the history of music, but I'm sure it's probably John Mayer's first true album we've never heard. The stuff there and the perfect sound and most of Timbery Mayer's past and present are easily heard. I'm glad to see that the virtuosic mayer (where these guitar songs are affected) actually hugs the blue side of the rock and comes out in a way that reflects this blue effect. If nothing else, the mayor's continuity is the mayor's LP, which is very interesting. The album opens quite easily, but very easily \"Waiting for the world to change\". The sad thing about promo singles is that the radio did't give them the respect they deserved. It's a very beautiful song and sings in such a way that it sticks if you listen to it. Most admirable and captivating is the sweetness of the soul that comes out of this song, perhaps the new feeling of the are-release of Meyer's Hendrix's \"Bigger Than My Body\" \"Buddy Guy, Blues Rock Influential BB King.\" I'm not. Confidence (to love you) \"The second obscure number, which takes care of the cool programs associated with Mayer's amazing guitar playing. What's important there is that Mayer's words sound stronger than never. Needless to say, the did't perform in HEAVIER THINGS (a great album, no beat), but it's a new maturity, symbolized by TRY! Which was a project that I included three newly formed mayors, who were also in the continuum. \"Faith\" is another powerful song. What makes it cool is that it gives a sense of rhythm with a thriving bass line that Often one of the elders is \"disappointed\" in the music. Here, Mayer has a bass line with a great \"flourishing\" sound on the track. What can make Mayer's voice even stronger There is a fine use of punctuation between verses and music and between parts of the verse. For the BB King album. The opening guitar is just one of the six senses. Eid is one of the most touching tracks there. Morgan is smart in the background, but the achieves this goal ten times. The songwriting is the same as it has been throughout the album - beyond this stage and beyond. The \"heart of life\" is rapidly returning to cool \"gravity.\" This song goes beyond the adults, and is a song that can be played evenly at home when we say Sufyan Stevens' Country Rock Music Album. The guitar sounds good there and yet John Mayer is not disappointed, even if you expect him to do so after five straight, unchanged numbers. The sound is a mix of classic soul duet and spiritual blues rock arrangements in general. I personally like the sound of Mayer's voice there, as well as the semi-political part of the rhythmic guitar that accompanies Mayer's guitar development and riffs. This track is a masterpiece of \"pocket\" rhythm that runs and is just another amazing track. \"Stop the Train\" is \"The Heart of Life\" on the same plane, there is only a small rhythmic support on the ground with a bass line that supports the lower part of the seat. The songwriting is there and is great and the song development is perfect. I also like the \"heart\" of people's emotions and the return to the simple time of sound music and the worldly feeling of such tracks. \"Slow Dancing in the Hot Room\" is one of my favourite songs. Although all the tracks on this album are great, there is a spirit in it that I always hoped Mayer would always release. It was as if I could hear Mayer getting very close to numbers like \"Daughters\" and \"Back to Bed\", but the spirit that came out was amazing. The sound of the guitar is beautiful and reminds me of listening to Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Eric Clapton, B. To any great blues artist. Although \"Bold is Low\" is not my favourite thing, it is important that Mayer make Hendrix's cover. \"Dreaming with a broken heart\" begins with a beautiful piano line with beautiful tenders and songs and Mayer bombs. It's one of the softest and easiest voices I've never heard. Another winning and exciting song that starts slowly and the song picks up speed as it progresses. One of my favourites. Morgan's introduction to \"These Repairs\" also shows the mayor's maturity through CONTINUUM. His idea of \u200b\u200b\"real music\" should be featured in this Grammy nomination! It makes you feel like Mayer has corrected you with beautiful sound lines, a unique guitar function that goes with everything. It ends with a high note of \"I'm Gonna Gind Other You\", beginning with Mayer's soul-stirring chips with just a bluesy electric guitar. Also, the feeling is inside the thumb and gradually horns, drums, and Morgan are added to the mix. It's cold and fun to listen to. This is Mayer's first album on the table for me to listen to non-stop. That's good. Production there is always high, as is the case with Mayer's singing and sound. Playing the guitar has always been there, but maybe because everything else is great when it sounds so good and powerful. For me, Mayer has probably made one of the best two thousand and six albums. I would love to see Mayer snatch Grammy with this beautiful and exciting music program, as I said.

I'm thirty-eight now and grew up with this music , The Elton John album arriving on the scene when I was a year and a half old. I own just about everything the's put out and have seen him live four for five times. As with the original Captain Fantastic album, there are some AMAZINGLY great songs on this CD. Sometimes bluesy, sometimes rocking', and sometimes heartbreaking, there are a few real standouts there. The strongest track is \"Blues Never Fade Away.\" It's a bit reminiscent of some of Jackson Browne's best. Every bit as emotional as the thirty year old \"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\" sung with a more seasoned and forceful voice. This track is absolutely perfect. Another song that pulled me in was \"Ol sixty-seven\" with it's strong upbeat gospel influences. In addition, this CD has a true GREAT Elton ROCKER--\"Just Like Noah's Ark.\" This could be the perfect Jerry Lee Lewis tune. A song like this was sorely missing on this last effort, \"Peachtree Road.\"Like Captian Fantastic, however, this CD in't perfect. The title track seems self absorbed and boring. The dedication to NYC, \"I Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way (NYC),\" seemed wrought out and sappy. My other criticism with this CD is it's a bit too \"polished.\" This was also true for it's original, Captian Fantastic, in my opinion. I slightly agree with a few other writers who've said this CD has a nod toward Broadway with it's neatness. Elton's been hailed as \"back to old one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's form\" for each of this past three releases, starting with \"Songs From The West Coast\" in two thousand and one, and it's follow up, \"Peachtree Road.\" I've purchased Elton John albums on their release day since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three's \"Too Low For Zero.\" This has been claimed with almost every album since then. Still, beginning in two thousand and one, E. J. started a more stripped down, basic style. I believe despite it's few shortcomings, The Captain & The Kid can stand above those efforts and equal to any Elton John album out there--with the exception of \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\" That would be a nearly impossible feat to achieve though.

The most powerful track, \"Blues Never Fade Away\" unfortunately as Beyonc ', Justin Timberlake, and especially the sleeping Paris Hilton from above, who not only sings badly, still feels like her fifteen The fame of the minute never ends. For older artists like Elton John, Honesty is still trying to make a respectable record. It was a storm of energy in her marriage to longtime partner David Furnish last year, with the songs and style evolving in a solid way in the first game of the show in Las Vegas, and that applies to the record. Elton John's two, zero-second record for The Captain and the Kid is a thriller, followed by Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, the first American record to make it to # one on the Billboard charts. An album by someone like me, which Captain Fantastic did't hear, does't feel like it, but it does feel great. However, this is the most accepted record since the last record of Peach Tree Road in two thousand and four was unknown. Like some of these previous records, it all seems to Elton to return to the voices that mark the beginning of this era in the sixties and seventies. This is reflected not only in the song album but also in these great hits with many pictures and memories like one thousand, nine hundred and seventy one and two thousand. Each song is well-crafted with sound and emotion from Old 'Sixty Seven, dedicated to the year one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven, where Elton and singer Bernie Topin collaborated for a long time. Hugh at Anyway (NYC), which seems soulful and remembers the messages that Mona Lassas and Mad Heaters gave wholeheartedly from one, nine hundred and seventy-three that won't shoot me, I'm just a pianist. Am From Blues rock tracks such as And the House Fail Down and Bomber Blues Never Feed You to albums to the latest adult song \"The Bridge\" performed by Elton at The Tonight Show with Jay Leno recently. However, I really doubt that potential buyers will be as interested in Elton's music as they are in the likes of Usher Kelly Clarkson. Despite all this, Captain and the Kid is by far the best recorded record I've never heard this year, and it still shows that Elton John has not lost this appeal by making a self-made record. \u06d4 I totally recommend it as another classic version of your music library if you're a big fan of Elton, who is just starting to enjoy these classic sounds.

This compares with some of Johnny Cash's collaborations with Rick Rubin later, and provides sample evidence that other artists are better at using paper. Richness and depth without any more recent activities. Her partner with a new national image, Kenny Chesney, seems to be inspiring a new life for Willie. None of the plates. Bad song, but so far, my favourite is Bob's cover. Dylan's \"Gotta Serve Somebody.\" As a Dylan fan, I have to admit that Willie's version is better than Dylan's version. So you have love and affection. Willie also won a major victory with the title \"Gravedigger.\" The video for this song is simple Another important thing to consider is the song titled \"Eternal Minute\" and \"I'm Alive.\" Nelson is there now and I am alive in this series. Even Bob Song, which I hated at first, grew up with me Yes I appreciate the folly of this song, In general, I think For this, it must be combined with Nelson's old books (such as \"The Red-haired Stranger\" and \"Stages and Stages\") so far.

Mastronardi","helpful":[8,10],"reviewText":"Some might make the argument that early on, Donna Summer was a producers muse and a voice for Girgio Moroder (as well as co-wrtier\/co-producer Pete Belotte) to use in order to release eclectic and sometimes electronic based music. Prehaps that was true in the very beginning but overtime, as a co-writer and powerful vocalist, Donna certainly put a very feminine and personal stamp on all of her albums, starting most strikingly with \"Four Seasons Of Love\" and continuing on to the blockbuster \"Bad Girls\" and until their last release as a team misunderstood (excluding \"I'm A Rainbow\") but brilliant new wave effort \"The Wanderer\". Now, in two thousand and weight, Donna once again finds the right balance between working with producers with unique ideas and being her own singer-songwriter on \"Crayons\". It is hard not to take notice of the producers (and co-writers) there since more often than not, they seem to make their impression known on the tracks. The best at just making strong pop songs with Donna, though, are Greg Kurstin and Danielle Brisebois. \"Stamp Your Feet\" is a positive upbeat pop track with good hooks and is a perfect place for Donna's voice to belt out. It's anthem like feel never feels phone, either. She is really rooting for you! Nor does Donna's strange \"accent\" on \"Crayons\" with Ziggy Marley. This blasting Reagee pop track has a catchy chorus and is very danceable. Donna and Ziggy Marley make a memorable well paced piece of music that blasts with positivity and a strong message about working toward \"one love\" and letting the \"crayons\" melt into one beautiful color. The Brazilian pop of \"Drivin' Down Brazil\", with its fun story, is strong as well. It has a nice feel of the Jobim songs she references. Not such a dream team is JR Rotem (with co-writing help from Evan Borgrat. Yep, the son of Neil Bograt, who used to be the head of Donna's seventies label, Casablanca). \"Mr. Music\" is a very simple upbeat pop song and does have a memorable chorus that would suit TV commercials. but it suffers from dull ship-hop beats and is dragged down by it's simplicity and silliness and in the moment product placement (\"Got My Ipod\/Shake My Body\"). Donna does't quite wrap on \"The Queen Is Back', but it's a strange boost track (that starts in third person narration talking about \"she\" and switches to first without explanation) that once again is dragged down by dull big beats and sound effects. They are not terrible songs but feel like an attempt to be modern yet sound very dated and childish. It's not like she is trying to be Britney, even. it's more like trying to be safe and Disney! Sebastian Arocha Morton is the mastermind along with Al Kasha as a songwriter behind \"I'm A Fire\", which is Donna's sweet spot, comfort zone, whatever. It's what you want and expect from someone who stopped making albums but continued to crank out strong club singles (including remixes of pop ballads like the Pokemon based \"Power Of One\". for an upbeat makeover on the Luther original of a similar title, \"Power Of Love\"). A chanting, catchy almost minimalist dance track that allows the \"queen\" to be a force of nature. Here, we believe in her over the top claim and she truly is a fire. It's worth looking for the import for the exclusive edition (sold at another. the initials are CC) to find the similar sounding track \"It's Only Love\" (by the same team). It's not as well structured as a song and sort of just floats as a free form poem that just grants yet it's a beautiful trip! It's Donna that is probably the reason for the differences in the tracks; the music is very similar, so it is the songwriting and performance that makes them very unique. Even though \"I'm A Fire\" only takes up one track, you can understand her reasoning for not making a full album like this. Toby Gad is a good contributor, too. \"Fame (The Game)\" combines rock clicks and stomping dance beats for a song that describes the quest for fame but unlike songs by young starlets, it's not winning but wise and introspective (talking about the movies that portrayed beauty queens like Marylin). \"Science of Love\" has a bit of a rock feel, too. It's a very well paced pop track that really understands good songwriting and Donna's vocals are impressive there as she travels through melody of the track. Tony Gad also produces to the light pop ballad \"Sand On My Feet\". This track flows and is romantic (the only song from the set were get a love song form the First Lady Of Love). It has some slightly award lyrics, though. Nathan DiGreise, a producer\/co-writer from Donna's recent past, brings us the most controversial track. \"Slide Over Backwards\" seems like it would be the basic club stopper but in fact is a funky, rocky blues based character driven piece where Donna tells a story through the created \"Hattie Mae Blanche Dubios\". It sounds laughable on the surface but much like with \"Crayons\" (the title track) and her adopting of a Jamaican (?) accent there, it manages to work. What Donna blacks in authenticity in the \"character\", she makes up with sincerity. She seems to really get into it and the funky, rollicking vocals of Donna (along with sister Mary Gaines Bernard) have fun with this track. Also contributing one track is Lester Menedez (producer\/co-writer) with Wayne Hector. It's a simple but hauntingly personal ballad titled \"Be Myself Again\", which also center around fame. It's a letdown lyrically to her Donna just bemoan fame and talk about how hard it is to be herself again and not the character. While the lyrics are a bit of a drag, its her voice and how it shifts that sells the song. Jamie Houston produces\/co-writes (with co-writer Fred Kron) the world beat driven gospel infused \"Bring Down the Reign\". This song is not over the top but a subtle song about the terrors in Darfur that works with with drum beats, a children's choir and Donna's combination of strong vocals, spoken word and chanting. It's a great powerful way to send a CD that has three songs about Donna's issues (good and bad) with being famous and shows a real social conscious. While there are some questionable moments in songs, every track works in its own way with songs like \"Stamp Your Feet\", \"I'm A Fire\", \"Crayons\" and \"Science of Love\" being dance pop classics, \"Slide Over Backwards\" is a fun experiment from the usual to even \"The Queen Is Back\" as a passable attempt to be modern. \"Crayons\", for an album that tries to be made up of different styles by using different producers, never sounds desperate. Donna works with fine people but notice there karen't any million dollar names there that could garunatee a hit single. She clicks with every person in some way (I would say Greg and Danielle the best). The album altogether is a welcome return not being a queen of the clubs but to making great albums, which is something Donna did for many years, with for without hit results. Hopefully the public will pick up on \"Crayons\" and hear an album by an artist that is often fun, sometimes introspective and compassionate about the outside world that has nothing to do with fame.","overall":5,"summary":"Donna's many colors create one strong album","unixReviewTime":1211414400,"reviewTime":"05 22, 2008"}

It\u2019s hard not to notice the producers (and co-authors) where, because in general, they seem to be making an impact on the track. However, the best people to do pop songs with Donna are Greg Kurstin and Danielle Brisebois. \"Stamp On Your Feet\" is an inspiring and hopeful pop song with beautiful hooks and the perfect place to make Donna's voice shine. This is a national anthem, as if I could never hear the call. She is really happy! Donna also does't have Ziggy Marley's unusual \"crayon\". This explosive Reagee pop song has an attractive choir, ready to dance. Donna and Ziggy Marley create an unforgettable piece of music that flows smoothly, full of positive emotions and powerful messages, that is, trying to achieve \u201clove\u201d and let the \u201ccrayon\u201d blend in beautiful color. The Brazilian pop music \"Drivin 'Down Brazil\" and its fascinating story are very powerful. The song of Job that the quotes gives a wonderful feeling. JR Rotem is not such a dream team (with the help of Evan Borgrat's collaborative writing. Yes, the son of Neil Bograt, the was the head of Donna's record label for the seventys Casablanca). \"Mr. Music\" is a very simple and exciting pop song, and it has a memorable choir suitable for TV commercials. But it is influenced by the dull jump of the boat, and is dragged down by its simplicity and stupidity with the installation of the current product (\"I Got My Ipod \/ Shake My Body\"). Donna did't completely send \"The Queen is back\", but this is a strange way to move on (starting with a third-person story, talking \"about her\", and then switching to the first one without explanation), and she did it again. The rhythm pulls down, the result of sound. They\u2019re not bad songs, but they feel like they\u2019re trying to be modern, but they sound a lot older that they\u2019re kids. Even she is not trying to be Britney Spears. It's like trying to be safe with Disney! Sebastian Arocha Morton is the genius behind Al Kasha as the composer after \"I'm on Fire\", Donna's most beautiful place, comfort zone and more. This is what you want and expect you to stop making albums and continue to produce powerful club songs (including popular traditional songs, such as \"Power Of One\" based on the Pokemon. Luther's \"Power of Love\" is original. Here, we believe you are the most sought after, really hot. just but nice to go! The reason the difference in the repertoire could be Donna; the music is very similar, so the songwriting and performance make them very different. The album. Toby Gad also has a great contribution. They want fame, but it's different from the songs of the little stars, of course. Victory, but smart and sensible (talking about movies featuring beauty queens like Marilyn). The \"science of love\" also sounds powerful. It's a pop song with a very sweet rhythm, it understands very well Donna's singing voice is touching when she passes by. The song is a masterpiece. Tony Gad has also released a quick pop ballad \"Sand On My Feet\". However, it does have some songs that are a little leaky. Nathan DiGreise is the latest product of Donna People \/ co-authors, which has brought us the most controversial song. \"Slide Over Back\" seems to be the basis of the club's barrier, but it's actually a fashion driven by the characters, rock. and the work of the blues, created by Donna using \"Hattie Mae Blanche Dubios\" tells the story. Sounds ridiculous at the top, but like \"Crayon\" (title song) and this Jamaican (?) Accent there, it controls performance. Donna on \"Character\" Truth, she did it honestly. She seems to love the song very much, and Donna (and sister Mary Gaines Bernard) who is in fashion, the sweet singing voice is very interesting in this song. Wayne Hector (Wayne Hector)) Author Lester Mendez (producer \/ writer) also contributed to the song. This is a simple thing But the most memorable rumours, called \"be me again\", are also aimed at fame. For her Donna, it was embarrassing with the song, she just cried about her fame and talked about how hard it is to be her instead of the role again. Although the lyrics of the song are procrastinating, her voice and the way they change make this song the best-selling song of all time. Jamie Houston has produced \/ co-written with (and author Fred Krone) a gospel needle driven by beating the world to \"overthrow the law.\" This song is not an exaggeration, but a mysterious song about the fear of Darfur, accompanied by drums, powerful voices, spoken words and children's choir songs with Donna. This is a very powerful way to send a CD that contains three songs about Donna's famous problems (good and bad), and shows real public knowledge. Although there are some questionable moments in the song, each song has its own style, such as \"Stamp Your Feet\", \"I'm A Fire\", \"Crayons\" and \"Science of Love\" are popular dance classics. Slide Over \"Back\" is an interesting test, from the usual to the \"Queen Is Back\" try the current pass. \"Crayon\", a record that attempts to compose different styles by different producers, sounds like never There was no despair. Donna works with great people, but please note that there are no millions of dollars worth of words out there that can be single. Greet everyone in some way (I would say Greg and Danielle Best). become the queen of the club, but to make a beautiful record. That's what Donna has done for many years without success. I hope the public will take \"Crayons\" and hear the artist's album. This album is often very interesting, sometimes Understanding and empathy in an outside world that has nothing to do with fame. The main contestants for pop songs with Donna are Greg Kurstin. And Danielle Brisebois \"Stamp Your Feet\" is a hopeful and hopeful pop song with big hooks. \"is an interesting test, from the usual to\" Queen is Back \"is a current test. It was true at first, but over time, as a prolific writer and musician, Donna has undoubtedly been marked with a feminine and personal identity in all of her albums. The highlight is to start with \"Four Seasons of Love\" and then move on to the blockbuster \"Bad Girl\". Until the release of their final release as a team it was not well understood (not including \"I am a rainbow\") but a bright new attempt to get to the \"Wanderers.\" \"Fame (The Game))\" combines rock clapping and treadmill, this song describes the pursuit of fame, but unlike the young star's song, it's not a victory, but a wise and visionary (referring to movies featuring beauty queens like Marilyn). Donna never completely ended \"The Queen's Back\" \"But this is a strange way to go (starting with the story of the third person, talking about\" her \", and then switching to the first without explanation), she was dragged down again.

In my opinion, the should make a dance CD because it's this business. Both of this single songs karen't very good, they repeat a little longer.

And the blockbuster \"Bad Girls\" continued and as a band it was not well understood until its last release (except \"I'm a Rainbow\") but an attempt at a new wave of \"The Wanderer\". Now, in two and a half thousand years, Donna has found the right balance between working with a composer with unique ideas and writing the artist song for her song \"Crayons\". It's hard to ignore producers (and other writers) out there because they often don't get their point across. They're not the best at making strong pop songs with Donna, however, Greg Kirsten and Daniel Bresbois. \"Stamp Your Foot\" is a pop song with a nice beat with beautiful hooks and a good place for Donna's voice to come out. I can never hear a hymn like yours. Really focused on you! And Donna's unusual \"pronunciation\" of \"crayons\" by Ziggy Marley. This reggae pop track bursts with a charming chorus and is very danceable. Donna and Ziggy Marley create a memorable musical scene that bursts with confidence and sends a strong message about working for \"a love\" and letting \"crayons\" melt into a beautiful color. The Brazilian pop of \"Drivin 'Down Brazil\" is also powerful with its interesting story. It sounds great with the songs that Jobum is referring to. This is not JR Rotem's dream group (co-written by Avon Borgrat. Yes, Neil Bograt's son, Donna's seventy's label, former head of Casa Blanca). \"Mr. Music\" is a very simple passionate song and has a memorable course that resembles TV commercials. But it has the problem of colliding with slow shop-hop planes and has been pulled by its simplicity and gentleness and at the moment in product placement (\"My iPod \/ Shake My Body\"). Donna does't pay attention to \"The Queen Is Back\", but a strangely inspiring song (which begins with a third-person narrative called \"her\" and turns into the first without any explanation. And it's dragged through the vague beats and sound effects. It sounds too old and childish. It's not like you're trying to be Britney, even trying to be safe with Disney. But strong clubs continue to using (including remixes of pop ballads such as Pokemon based on \"Power of One\". To develop Luther's original theme song as \"Power of Love\"). Singing, almost in a small way that allows the \"Queen\" to be a force of nature. Here, we believe in the supreme claim to it and it really is fire. The same audio track \"Only Love\" (of the same group). It is a good idea to search for a specific genre (sold in another. Initials via CC). It is not organized like a song for a swim as a free form poem that gives it. But this is a very good one It's a journey! This is the dona that can cause diversification of tracks. The music is very similar, so the composition and performance of the song makes it very different. Even if \"I'm a Fire\" only takes one song, you can understand this idea of \u200b\u200bnot making such a complete album. Toby Gad is also a good defender. \"Fame (The Game)\" combines rock cliffs and hit dance hymns that describe the quest for fame but unlike the songs of young stars, they are not winners but smart and effective (about films with beauty queens like Marilyn). I am talking). \"Love Science\" also feels like a light rock. A great pop song that understands the composition of the song very well and Donna's lyrics are impressive there as she goes through the music of the song. Tony God also composed a bright pop song \"Sand on My Feet\". The track is flowing and romantic (the only song on the set to find the form of the love song First Lady of Love). Although the names of its rewards are few. Nathan DeGrass, a producer \/ co-author of Donna's past, brings us a controversial track. \"Slideback\" sounds like a basic club stop, but it's actually a blue-collar event where Donna tells a story about \"Haiti My Blanche Dubius\". This sounds ridiculous on the outside, but it seems that using \"crayons\" (title song) and its Jamaican expression (?) Can work. Donna Blake is really \"in character\", she does it honestly. Looks like the's really in it, and Donna's (and her sister Mary Guinness Bernard's) sweet, moving words are captivating. Other singers are Lester Mendes (producer \/ writer) and Van Hector. A simple but awesome personal song titled \"Be My Self Again\", which also focuses on fame. It's a shame for Donna to just scream for glory and talk about how difficult it is and not the character. When the lyrics slow down, the sound and the change in it sells the song. Jamie Houston co-author (and co-author Fred Cron) presents a world-class gospel that includes \"Bring Down the Rule\". The song is not high-class, but a subtle song about the horrors of Darfur that works with a combination of drum beats, children's songs and Donna's strong voice, spoken words and songs. This is a powerful way to send a CD of three songs about Donna's (good and bad) stories about becoming famous and showing real public awareness. Although there are dubious moments in the songs, each song works through its own songs like \"Stamp Your Foot\", \"IMA Fire\", \"Crayons\" and \"Science of Love\" which will never send, \"Slide Overback\" \"It's a fun temptation from ordinary to ordinary. Even \"The Queen's Eyesback\" tries to be modern. \"Crayons\", for an album that tries to make different styles using different producers, never seems disappointing. Donna works with the right people but be aware that there is no million dollar song where she can find the most popular song. You somehow click with each one (I would say Greg and Daniel are the best). The whole album is a welcome return, not to be the queen of clubs, but to make beautiful albums, which Donna did for many years, which did not yield good results. We hope the public will download \"Crayons\" and listen to the artist's album, which is often entertaining, sometimes visually appealing, and sympathetic to the outside world.","overall":5,"summary":"Donna's many colors create one strong album","unixReviewTime":1211414400,"reviewTime":"05 22, 2008"}

Mastronardi","helpful":[8,10],"reviewText":"Some might argue that early on, Donna Summer was a music producer and vocalist for Girgio Moroder (as well as author \/ producer Pete Belotte) who will be used to continue . release eclectic and sometimes electronic music. That may have been true in the beginning, but over time, as a writer and vocalist, Donna has certainly made a feminine and personal stamp on all of her doors, beginning with \u201cFour Seasons of Love\u201d. And continued with the blockbuster \u201cBad Girls\u201d and until the most recent release as a group they understood (except for \u201cI\u2019m Rainbow\u201d) but try the new and amazing wave \u201cThe Wanderer\u201d. Now, at two thousand and a half, Donna has once again found the right balance between working with producers with unique ideas and being her own songwriter for \u201cCrayons\u201d. It\u2019s hard not to let the producers (and co-authors) be there because often, they seem to event their feelings on the tracks. The best to talk about in Donna\u2019s hard-hitting pop songs, though, are Greg Kurstin and Danielle Brisebois. \u201cStand On Your Feet\u201d is a beautiful pop-up track with beautiful handles and the perfect place for Donna\u2019s voice to wear a belt. It\u2019s a song you don\u2019t feel on the phone. You really rose! Also Donna\u2019s amazing \u201caccent\u201d about \u201cCrayons\u201d with Ziggy Marley. Reagee pop radio has a charming chorus that is very popular. Donna and Ziggy Marley produce a well-remembered musical poem that explores the practicality and powerful message of working with \u201ca love\u201d and allows the \u201cpens\u201d to shine in a beautiful color. Brazilian pop \u201cDrivin\u2019 Down Brazil \u201dis also strong, along with its interesting story. He felt good about the Jobim songs the referred to. It\u2019s not JR Rotem\u2019s dream team (co-authored by Evan Borgrat. \u201cMr. Music\u201d is a very simple pop-up song with memorable songs suitable for TV commercials. And pulled down by this simplicity and stupidity and product placement (\u201cGot My Ipod \/ Ruck My Body\u201d). (starting with a third-person narrator talking about \u201che\u201d who first proceeded without explanation) to return the big annoying bass and sound effects. It's not a very bad song but it feels like an attempt to be modern but very historical and childish. It's not like she's trying to be Britney, though., comfort zone, everything. It's what I want and expect. you have stopped making albums but continue to make hard rock songs (including remixes of pop ballads like Pokemon based on \"Power of One\" Here, I believe him this high claim and note gang the was on fire. It\u2019s worth finding a special print download (sold to others. The first letter is CC) to get a soundtrack similar to \u201cIt\u2019s Only Love\u201d (same group). It\u2019s not structured like any other song and floating like a song in a free format it only offers but it\u2019s a beautiful journey! It was Donna who may have been due to the diversity of the streets; The music is very similar, so the songwriting and performance makes them very special. Although \u201cI\u2019m A Fire\u201d only captures one track, you can understand why it does\u2019t make an entire album like this. Toby Gad is also a great giver. \u201cFame (The Game)\u201d combines rock and roll dancers in a song that describes the search for popularity but unlike the songs of young stars, it is not winning but it is wisdom and blindness (commentary on the films shown of the queen) beauty. like Marylin). \u201cScience of Love\u201d also feels a bit rock. Very good pop song and really understands the writing of great songs and Donna\u2019s voice is very good there when it comes to the melody of the song. Tony Gad also produces the song \"Sand On My Feet\". This path flows and it is love (the only song that will come out is the love song First Lady of Love). It does have some award-winning songs, though. Nathan DiGreise, producer \/ writer from Donna recently, takes us down the most controversial path. \u201cSelf-deprecating\u201d seems to be the club\u2019s main stopper but it\u2019s really fun, rock-solid based on the character as Donna tells a story created by \u201cHattie Mae Blanche Dubios\u201d. On the surface it looks funny but identical to \u201cCrayons\u201d (track title) and with her getting a Jamaican accent (?) There, she manages to work. What obscures Donna\u2019s reality of \u201cnature\u201d, makes her honest. She seems to be really in it and Donna\u2019s interesting, quirky voices (along with her sister Mary Gaines Bernard) are fun on this path. The song also features Lester Menedez (producer \/ co-author) Wayne Hector. It\u2019s a simple but non -stop piece called \u201cBe My Own Again\u201d, which is also famous for its reputation. He enthusiastically calls Donna a bad name and talks about how hard it is to be again and not the character. Although the lyrics are quite long, this voice and how the changes that sells the song. Jamie Houston Produces \/ Writes (Written by Fred Kron) The world is beating the evangelical gospel poured out \u201cBring down the judgment\u201d. This song is not a top-down but a deceptive song about terrorists in Darfur playing drums, children\u2019s entertainment and Donna with a cloud voice, speech and songs. It\u2019s a great and powerful way to send a CD with three songs about Donna\u2019s issues (good and bad) that are popular and show real social awareness. While there are some questionable moments in the songs, each track uniquely works with songs like \u201cStamp Your Feet\u201d, \u201cI Am Naar\u201d, \u201cCrayons\u201d and \u201cScience of Love\u201d Slide Over \u201dis a fun one. experiment that comes from normal even if \"Queen is back\" in a modern attempt. \"Crayons\", for an album trying to do in different formats by different producers, never seems desperate. Donna to good people but you know there are no millions of names that can beat you.a defeat. It somehow knocked everyone out (I would say Greg and Danielle are the best) . The door is absolutely a welcome addition not to the club queen but in making great albums, which is something Donna has done for many years, without us finding effective teasers. We hope the public will pick up \u201cCrayons\u201d and hear the album artist and of often entertaining, and sometimes noticeable and sympathetic to the outside world with nothing to do with popularity.","overall":5,"summary":"Donna's many colors create one strong album","unixReviewTime":1211414400,"reviewTime":"05 22, 2008"}

Highlights include the infamous opening song \"Uprising\" and \"The United States of Eurasia\" by the queen. Episode of the Return of the War. To watch all Musa fans click on \"useless comments\" because I have hurt them. Height is a bad pop song. It tries to make its power dark by clapping its hands loudly and meaningless shouts (\"Hey\", \"Come\"). When Matt tried to annoy the audience by shouting \"we\" and \"them\", I was scared. It has no value and no soul. Dr. Who\u2019s Who\u2019s Who\u2019s an Anime Museum, and the repetition is disappointing, but what really makes this song so bad is that it\u2019s not good enough to be broadcast on the radio. In the list of popular instruments, Matt's mournful sound sounds very touching and grim. The introduction of the opposition almost surpassed the census. Reprint of old works. On the other hand, resistance is much more fun. Once you make a mistake, the choral choir confirms that you are right. There is nowhere to go. Never build, never change, never reach a climax. Since the apology, Matt has always had an unexplained desire to make traditional music. Clearly, like all new albums, it contains at least one discarded song. Get into this Timbaland jingle, and it continues to hold on to the vision, the beat and the beat. I agree that the song is actually very interesting, but very thin. I'm not entirely against this word, I just understand it, unless Moses has developed it into something different. Enter the United States of Eurasia. You know, it\u2019s cool that Musa is considered the new queen, but it\u2019s a shame to reach an agreement under clear restrictions. It stimulates lust for nature. Lyric and Failure, by any means, is absolutely true, with the restoration of the previous song. Estimated angle estimates, but this time it sounds like a novel. And come in with Lawrence of Arabic mathematics. A man with a moving camera light. Although I used to love Musa's exaggerated voice, it was played loudly there. Just like climbing on Walt Disney, you will realize that the landscape is wallpaper and the walls are made of foam. Leading Light is a slow-moving roar, similar to songs like Blackout and singing Absolution from their previous albums. As one might think of the title \"clich\u00e9\", this is a delightful European resort. Its love is as old as cardboard cut, and it will disappear after the guitar solo. The unnatural choice shows that Muse has abandoned the music in any way to a certain extent. Open with members, but why and what the purpose is. The perfect sound is just a hot breeze, and the whole song softens any real emotions. I\u2019ve heard that bands like Arcade Fire (Intervention) used Morgan, and I felt purposeful, opening up Jones \u2019taste as a good wine for a great meal. But this song is a collection of little league ideas. Matt even managed to get inside the Tang style styling process. MK Ultra is similar to Problem Map. It started with the sound of a guitar knocking, sounded cool, but it was affected by a dark change and finally swallowed it up in vain. Full content for the entire album. Of course, a solo guitar when sent is a live performance adjustment. Will these people be lazy, because they have never been seen on the radio? They do anything brave and it sounds completely normal at the same time. I'm Yours is probably the best love song in a museum to date. If they are-create the album, it could be for the entertainment industry. Bouncy bass and mat's split split. But it is an interesting track, which is table to change the sound over and over again, and always shows a place with a rich sound. Exogenousity is not a lifesaver. Although it is in another league compared to the rest of the album, it is not yet the biggest symphony I was expecting. It really is a recollection of the sounds they made earlier, including Microcuts, butterflies and hurricanes. The other parts are the usual songs from the movie. This is amazing, I appreciate it in a flo-fi way, but I\u2019m disappointed because Muse has the ability to really use it on special occasions. Butterflies and storms alone are more beautiful and bold than this fifteen-minute symphony. Although the router shell has a magic carpet that makes you feel like a gravel in history, it will never leave you overwhelmed by strange weather explosions. The third part of \"Redemption\" is a beautiful song, I can't help but understand it literally. \"Let's start again.\" But in all my criticism, it puts down the simple fact that this album in\u2019t fun. It's a wok, but the way it is in't right, I want to listen to a certain song over and over again. Muse used to talk a lot to me for a reason, but now I realize that the music they produce is not offensive, accessible at all pages, and deliberately attracting the attention of passersby (Wal-Mart, elevator, Work, on the go) will not satisfy people like me who listen to the album.

She tries to compensate for her dark powers by clapping and shouting \"Hey, come on\". I get frustrated when Matt tries to burn the audience by shouting \"about us\" and \"seeing\". Cheap and soulless. The museum's prediction of Dr. Conn's theme is over, but the fact that it sells the song risks disqualifying it from being on the radio. Within the confines of pop metal, Matt's cry sounded very admirable and bright. The introduction of resistance will likely be suggested by the elimination of civilians. Restoration of old work. On the other hand, there is very little resistance to music. And if you make a mistake, the happy course makes sure you're right. It's not going anywhere. It never happens, it never changes, it never reaches its speak. And since the abolition, Matt has had an unknown desire to make classical music. Obviously, all new albums have to include at least one secretly lost track. Enter the stumbled angle that maintains an idea, hit it and hit it. I will admit that the song is actually beautiful, but its paper is thin. I totally disagree with that sound, I only saw this point except that Meuse turned it into something unique. Enter the United States of Eurasia. You know, it was fun to be considered the new queen of the museum, but it's frustrating to close the deal at that point. They are sexually explicit in nature. With the revival of songs of the past, literally incompetent in every way. Angular change is predicted but something new seems to be happening in this case. And the came up with the figures for Lawrence of Arabia. Lights Camera Action People. While I always praised the powerful voice of Moses, which was well placed there. It's like the Walt Disney Tour where you realize the place is just a background image and the walls are made of styrofoam. Guiding Light is a slow-moving song in the form of songs from this previous album, Blackout and Sing for Absolution. And as one might think from the clutch article, Eurotrash single liners enjoy themselves. Her love is as old as a cardboard cutout that comes out of nowhere after singing a guitar alone. The unnatural choice proves that museums throw music at us in any way. Parts open, but why and for what purpose? The whole soundtrack is a breeze, and then the whole track darkens any real feeling. I've heard a group like Arcade Fire (Intervention) add Morgan and someone feels like it has a purpose, like Jones opening this mouth like a good wine does during an important meal. But this song has a lot of league ideas. Matt also managed to hide in the Swow-esque swallows system. MK Ultra follows as a problem map. It opens with a space guitar gong that sounds cool but undergoes black variations and eventually swallows empty. A common theme throughout the album. And of course the only guitar in the post is to get it back from live gigs. Are these people lazy and trying to make it difficult to be on the radio? He did anything bravely with her, always seemed perfectly normal. I'm probably your best love song never. Something that could happen in Showbiz if they remade this album. Busy bass line and Matt's broken danger. But it's an interesting track that is table to change the sounds over and over again and always paints the fullest part of the sound. Exogenosis is not a saving grace. Although it's in another league when you compare it to the whole album, it's not yet the popular symphony I've been hoping for. It's just a repetition of the sounds they've made before, including Microcuts, Butterflies and Hurricanes. Some parts are classic songs of cinema. It's amazing and I like it fluently but I'm disappointed because Moses had the power to do something special about it. Butterflies and storms feel more beautiful and bold than this fifteen minute symphony alone. And while Exogenosis gives you the impression that you're riding a magic carpet on the sands of history, it never disappoints you with exciting outdoor weather blasts. The third part of Redemption makes a great song, I can't help it but it's like that. \"Let's start again.\" But in all my criticism, the fact is that this album is not fun. Wow but not as cute as I want to hear a particular song over and over again. In the past, there was a reason for me to have so much contact with music, but now watching them has created world-class music that is accessible to all pages, and is deliberately easy to get the attention of passers-by (Walmart, cash). , Work, travel) will not satisfy someone like me who tries to listen.

Kelly fan, although I do own several of this CDs. I can honestly say that the last song that the made that I liked was \"Ignition\", and everything else was straight up crap, with Kelly trying to be a wrapper and singing about changing out in strip clubs and \"doubling up\". I mean, what the hell was that all about? Some forty-something year old guy going through a mid-life crisis for something? It was definitely a turn off to me. And Kelly using autotune?? Ugh. He can using, the did't need it! I was like, okay, that's it, this guy is done. It was nearly enough to make me forget the excellent material Kelly had turned out in previous years. No question that I gave up on this ability to produce quality music because it seemed that the was trying TOO hard to fit in with the so-called \"artists\" of today and the electronic, computerized junk they have the nerve to call \"music\"! And those allegations. well, I doubt if anyone's going to forget about that. But I've always believed that the music should speak for itself, and on Kelly's last few offerings they were't saying much, at least not anything that I wanted to hear. But on LOVE LETTER, the comes back for the fan base that the captured at the start of this career, and says, \"I haven't forgotten about myall!\" This is GROWN FOLKS MUSIC, the kind of CD that I've been waiting for YEARS for Kelly to get back to making, and the does it only as the can. I knew the had it in him, and I'm glad the got back to the kind of artistry that we expect from him. good, heartfelt R&B;, meaningful and romantic love songs, some with a cool Michael Jackson\/Marvin Gaye\/Jackie Wilson\/Sam Cooke\/Otis Redding kind of vibe to them. I could go on in naming artists, but I will just say that just about any significant R&B; male artist that has made any real impact in the industry in the past fifty years is pretty much represented there, but channelled through the genius of R. Kelly! LOVE LETTER does have an old school feel to it, so I guess that's why it appeals to me, but yet it's fresh and contemporary. Love the man for hate him, but you cannot deny this talent. This is why the IS King of R&B;, for real. Youngun's, take note, because THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE. I don't even have a favourite because all of the songs are on point. Plus there is a hidden track - Kelly's version of the hit song the wrote for MJ: \"You Are Not Alone\". It's a beautiful tribute to this \"hero\" and friend as the says in the intro of the song. For those of you who enjoyed the earlier works of Kelly, this is a CD you should definitely own. Get it, you won't be sorry! Happy New Year! P. S. - I have to add that the music for \"Music Must Be A Lady\" sounds like an EXACT duplicate of the Marvin Gaye song \"Just To Keep You Satisfied\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) from the LET'S GET IT ON album. I'm surprised that no one else noticed this, but I'm guessing that the majority of reviewers there karen't as familiar with Marvin's music as they claim to be.

I mean, what's going on there? Why is a forty-year-old going through a life crisis? This is definitely a closure for me. Kelly uses car repair? ? What. He can use it, the does't need it! I thought, well, that's it, this guy is gone. This is almost enough to make me forget about Kelly\u2019s outstanding tools over the years.

And those are the allegations. Well, I doubt anyone will never forget this. But I always believe that music should express itself. For the last few games of Kelly, they did't talk much, though it was't something I wanted to hear. But in the LOVE book, fans were caught at the beginning of the show and came back and said, \"I haven't forgotten myall!\" This is GREAT PEOPLE'S SONG, I've been waiting for Kelly to are-create the CD, and only you can do this. I know you have it, and I'm glad you brought back the kind of part we were expecting from him. Yes, R&B comes from the heart; meaningful and romantic love songs, some with the cool feel of Michael Jackson \/ Marvin Gaye \/ Jackie Wilson \/ Sam Cooke \/ Otis Redding. I would go on to call them artists, but I will only talk about all the important R&B; The male artists who have had a real impact on the industry for the past fifty years are almost represented there, but led by the expertise of R.

It's hard to handle the voice of this group, at least trying to categorize them into what they look like. It's the music that moves and flies and turns and rises over you as you listen to it over and over again, each time the Mason factors slowly enter your mind. TV on the radio does not easily penetrate into any genre of music, which makes it fun and very focused. I hope the lowest band will continue to make great albums like this and \"Dear Science.\" Some songs have a prog-rock sound that goes with the electronic. I would rate it four for five.","overall":4,"summary":"like Wire ... with a twist","unixReviewTime":1350000000,"reviewTime":"10 12, 2012"}

As you can imagine - fans that forked out over sixty-five pounds\/ninety dollars for the initial import were a tad peeved and felt taken for a ride. However (and there's no meanness intended there) - you'd have to say that their loss is very much your again - because this scaled-down reissue finally makes Mickey Newbury's extraordinary music available to us all - and at a reasonable price too - eighteen pounds\/thirty dollars for fourCDs worth. Released twenty-three August two thousand and eleven on Saint Cecelia Knows\/Mountain Retreat CEConeR - this reissue comes in a five-way foldout card-pack with cardboard-colored front artwork (instead of the black embossed original) and a curtailed booklet of twenty-four-pages (no map either). The CDs are the same as the initial issue and break down as follows:Disc one (forty-one:thirty-one minutes): Tracks one to seven are this debut album \"Looks Like Rain\" - issued in the USA on Mercury Records SR sixty-one thousand, two hundred and thirty-six in September one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nineDisc two (thirty-eight:fifty-three minutes): Tracks one to eleven are this atwood album \"'Frisco Mabel Joy\" - issued in the USA on Elektra Records EKS-seventy-four thousand, one hundred and seven in October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-oneDisc three (thirty-seven:fourteen minutes): Tracks one to weight are this threerd album \"Heaven Help The Child\" - issued in the USA on Elektra Records EKS-seventy-five thousand and fifty-five in January one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-threeDisc four (forty-four:forty-six minutes): Tracks one to fifteen are called \"Better Days (Demos, Rarities, Unreleased)\" and break down as follows:one.

Both \"Better Days\" and \"I Don't Want No Big City Woman\" are PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASEDPACKAGING:A fairly obvious and noticeable absence is 'artwork' - none of the three albums are pictured anywhere - even on the CDs themselves. There's a famous picture of Newbury in front of a plate glass Tiffany Lamp - that multi-coloured Tiffany Lamp theme is used for all four different picture CDs - but of course without the original artwork to reference it - they make no sense. His second and most famous album \"'Frisco Mabel Joy\" (the only one of this LPs to be given a UK release in late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one on Elektra K forty-two thousand, one hundred and five) even enjoyed the privilege of a boxed die-cut front with a lovely dinner sleeve behind it containing the lyrics - but none of that is reproduced there either. Perhaps there's licensing issues? But if you do want to know what the album covers look like and get a feel for this output - Saint Cecilia Knows are-issued the three records and the fourth \"Better Days\" rarities set on VINYL in two thousand and eleven - and all are pictured on Amazon (and available for sale). The shorter twenty-four-page booklet version has liner notes by the Producer and Compiler of the set - CHRIS CAMPION. It also reproduces Kris Kristofferson's original liner notes for Newbury's one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine debut album \"Looks Like Rain\" and an article that first appeared in the AllMusic catalogue of two thousand by BEN-FONG-TORRES. There's some photos of Newbury in the early years - this short stint with the Doo Wop group The Embers - a tour with the American Army in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty - and a gig poster from November one thousand, nine hundred and seventy where this West Coast debut performance is shared with David Steinberg at the newly opened 'The Bitter End' avenue in Santa Monica. The last few pages give detailed musician-credits on all albums and extras (Dennis Linde produced and played on \"'Frisco Mabel Joy\" - Charlie McCoy and Jimmie Haskell are on \"Heaven Help The Child\" etc). But the big news is the sound. SOUND:All of that slightly underwhelming packaging pales into the background once you start to 'listen' - because not only is the music gorgeous - this set has one the most BEAUTIFUL REMASTERS I've never heard. Each of the albums is shockingly clean - none-too-trebled for effect - just there in your speakers with truly STUNNING CLARITY. The transfers were done by JESSICA THOMPSON and STEVE ROSENTHAL and they're to be praised for their work with the tapes. MUSIC:The first LP famously features segues between the tracks of 'rainfall' lifted off the \"One Stormy Night\" LP by The Mystic Moods Orchestra - and the reproduction of it there is so good that you may double take on the weather outside. The remaster especially brings out the Dennis Wilson \"Pacific Ocean Blue\" girly vocals that punctuate so many of the songs with an almost churchlike weariness. I suppose you'd say that overall this musical style is country - but that's too limiting. Singing one moment then talking the next in that richly tonal Oregon drawl of this - there's a shimmering delicacy about the music that makes it both hurting and deeply beautiful at one and the same time. Girls leave, girls stay, hearts lift, hearts break. It's American country-rock music but with a Nick Drake sensibility. Another very real influence is Kris Kristofferson whose similar languid songwriting-style lingers in the background (Kristofferson championed Newbury at the time and has sung this songwriting genius never since). There's even the melodrama of The Walker Brothers in there too - but never too mawkish. Highlights include the beautiful ballad \"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye\" (lyrics from it title this review) and \"I Don't Think Much About Her No More\" (which feature those lovely background vocals I mentioned above). \"The Future's Not What It Used To Be\" was featured on the massive \"Forever Changes\" box set covering Elektra Records and it's huge history. The lyrics of \"Frisco Debut\" feel real - \"might as well be the moon when you're as broke as I. \" and \"when you're cold, there's nothing as welcome as sunshine. \"Writing something as rampantly patriotic and deeply Southern as \"An American Trilogy\" at a time when America was dying inside (Vietnam, Race Riots) might't have occurred to most songwriters of the day - but it did to Newbury - who stunned the Bitter End audience into silence and tears with it in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. Hearing it rescued from the very Vegas version Elvis Presley charted in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two (No. weight in the UK) is an unexpected and genuine pleasure. The remastered sound quality is gorgeous - the strings, vocals - fabulous. The near six-minute \"How Many Times (Must The Piper Be Paid For His Song)\" is beautifully arranged with acoustic guitars and that \"look away Dixie\" vibe to the melody. By the time the got to \"Good Morning Dear\" and \"Song For Susan\" on the threerd album \"Heaven Help The Child\" - the combo of piano, vocals and strings had become almost an artful signature style of this - and so impressive. A slight remake of \"San Francisco Mabel Joy\" finishes the album with rainfall, acoustic guitars and wailing steam trains in the distance - and you're reminded so much of England's Nick Drake and this perfect three albums on Island Records - \"Five Leaves Left\" (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine), \"Bryter Layter\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) and \"Pink Moon\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two) - Newbury's own \"American Trilogy\" should be just as revered - and is just as good. I had thought the fourth disc would be filler - but it's not. The publishing demos are mostly Newbury singing at piano with some light band accompaniment and are very pretty. \"Good Morning Dear\" alone was recorded by huge names like Ray Charles and Roy Orbison. Best of all is the Radio Session for KBHM - which is missy - but with acoustic guitar and voice to the fore - is so wonderfully intimate. And many of the songs like \"Sad Satin Rhyme\" and \"I Don't Wanna Rock\" are not on the other albums. \"Better Days\" itself is as lovely a song as any penned by more famous luminaries - and a genuine previously unreleased gem. To sum up - \"An American Trilogy\" is an embarrassment of riches - and at last its pitched at a price music-lovers can afford. Even if Newbury is an unknown to you - this is one of those times when you should take a chance - because the quality on there is a joy - and worth every penny. Properly fabulous rediscovery time. and well done to all involved.","overall":5,"summary":"\"...Just Like The Dawn...My Heart Is Silent Breaking...\"","unixReviewTime":1339027200,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2012"}

Maybe there is a licensing issue? But if you really want to know what an album cover looks like and feel the results - Saint Cecilia Knows has released three albums and a fourth album \"Best Days\" released on VINYL in two thousand and eleven - and both are on Amazon (available for sale ). The twenty-four-page booklet contains lining notes provided by CHRIS CAMPION, the producer and editor of the list. It has also released an overview of the original line-up by Kris Kristofferson of Newbury's one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine debut album \"Looks Like Rain\" and BEN-FONG-TORRES 'first appearance on AllMusic's two, zero-page album catalog. There are first photos of Newbury - a short collaboration with the Doo Wop band Embers - a tour with the US Army in nine hundred and sixty at one thousand - and a poster poster in November one hundred thousand, nine hundred and seventy. This West Coast premiere will be in Saint-Muni Share with David Steinberg at the newly opened \u201cBitter End\u201d on the boulevard. The last few pages give details of the music credits of all albums and extras (Dennis Linde produced and starred in \"'Frisco Mabel Joy\" - Charlie McCoy and Jimmie Haskell in \"Heaven Help The Child\" etc.). But the big news is the word. Sound: Once you start \"listening\", all these little packed little things will be covered in the back - because it's not just good music - this set has the best production I've never heard. Each album is very clean \u2014 with the exception of high-quality effects \u2014 right on your speakers, clearly visible. Submissions are made by JESSICA THOMPSON and STEVE ROSENTHAL, and their work on tape will be praised. Music: The first LP is famous for the transition between \"rain\" songs in Mystic Moods Orchestra's \"One Stormy Night\" LP - and it performs very well there, and you can be affected by the weather without the influence of Two. The revised version brings even more of Dennis Wilson's daughter \"Pacific Blue\", which adorns many songs with church-like annoyance. I think you could say that in general this kind of music is country style - but this is very strict. Sing for a moment, then speak for the next moment in the rich tones of Oregon - the music has a pure appeal that makes it ugly and beautiful. The girl left, stayed the girl, refreshed and broke. This is American rock music, but with the feeling of Nick Drake. Another real influence is Kris Kristofferson, who has a style of writing similar to the loneliness that lives in secrecy (Kristofferson was involved in Newbury at the time and has not sung the song of this design trick never since). There\u2019s also a Walker Brothers melodrama \u2014 but it\u2019s never too dull. Highlights include beautiful folk songs \"He Woke Me Up To Speak Good\" (words from this review) and \"I don't think much of him\" \"The future is not what it used to be\" appeared on a large scale \"Eternal Transformation\" set of Elektra records. This is a big flower. The words \"Frisco Debut\" feel real - \"When you're crazy like me, it could be a month.\" And \"When it's cold, there's nothing as popular as sunlight.\" Writing Patriotic and Popular Deep down In the South as the \"American Trilogy\" was dying inside the United States (Vietnam, ethnic turmoil), most songwriters at the time could not have imagined it - but Newbury did - it shocked the audience on Bitter End Silence and the tears were nineteen thousand. . one hundred and seventy. Hearing it delivered in Elvis Presley's Las Vegas version in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two (ranked eighth in the UK) was a real surprise. The revised sound quality has great strings, great voices. For almost six minutes \"How many times (the microphone must pay for this song)\" is carefully tuned with an acoustic guitar, and the song exudes the spirit of \"don't look at Dixie\". When \"Good Morning\" and \"Susan's Song\" from the third album \"Heaven Help a Child\" came out - a combination of piano, vocals and strings almost became this kind of brilliant technique - it was a deep and interesting look. A small portrait of \"San Francisco Mabel Joy\", complete with a raincoat, sound guitar and steam train from a distance - you'll think of England's Nick Drake and these three perfect albums on the Island Record - \"Five Leaves Remaining\" \"(one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine),\" Bright Wright \"( one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) and \"Pink Moon\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two) - -Newbury's \"American Trilogy\" should be equally respected - and equally good. I thought the fourth disk would be filled - but it was't. Most of Newbury\u2019s published demos using on the piano, and the accompanying light band, is very beautiful. Only \"Good Morning Dear\" was written by big names like Ray Charles and Roy Orbison. The best part is KBHM's Radio Session \u2014 which is a young lady - but with a cloud guitar and vocals - is very close. Many songs such as \"Sad Satin Rhyme\" and \"I Don't Want Werwala\" did not appear on other albums. The \"better days\" itself are as popular as a song written by a famous celebrity - and another real treasure that can be unleashed. All in all \u2014 the \u201cAmerican Trilogy\u201d is a shame of wealth \u2014 it was finally founded at a price that music lovers can afford. Even if Newbury is unfamiliar to you - this is one of the times you should take advantage of this opportunity - because quality is a pleasure for a penny. It is a recovery of an amazing time. Very well done for all participants.","overall":5,"summary":"\"...Just Like The Dawn...My Heart Is Silent Breaking...\"","unixReviewTime":1339027200,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2012"}

You're Not Like Me There's a version of the alternate mono in the side stereo album IB-side has no albums and HOME DEMOS - \"Flower Man\" unpublished, fifty-seven from \"The Escape Veteran Show\" on Radio KRHM-FM in Los Angeles. On the CDs themselves, the glass plate has a famous Newbury picture in front of the Tiffany Lamp - a multi-colored Tiffany Lamp theme for all four. Different picture CDs - but without the originality of the artwork to be referenced - make no sense. His second and most popular album, \"Fresco Mabel Joy\" (only one of them will be released in LPUK at the send of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine, in Electra's forty-two, zero, one hundred and five) even a dinner Enjoyed the privilege of having a Death Box with a nice dinner sleeve on the back that contains songs - but nothing is prepared there either. Maybe there are licensing issues? But if you want to know what the cover of the album looks like and feel this release - St. Cecilia Noz has released the third and fourth record of \"Best Days\" available on VINYL in two thousand and eleven - and the full picture on Amazon. On (and for sale). The twenty-four-page short version includes liner notes for the producer and the producer of the set - Chris Campion. It also reproduces Chris Christopherson's original notes on Newbury's one, zero-year-old debut album, ninety-nine percent of \"It Looks Like Rain\" and a title that debuted in Ben-FONG-TORRES 'two, zero All Music Catalog. The bar was published. Here are some pictures of Newbury in the early years - this short time with the Dow Woop band The Embers - a trip with the U. S. Army for one thousand, nine hundred and sixty - and a gigantic poster of November one thousand, nine hundred and seven when the drama hit the West Coast. David Steinberg was assigned to The Butter End, which recently opened in Santa Monica. The last few pages offer detailed music credits for all albums and more (produced and played by Dennis Linde in \"Frisco Mabel Joy\" - Charlie McCoy and Jimmie Haskell in \"Heaven Help The Child\" etc.). Voice: When you start 'listening', all those tangled little packages turn black - because it's not just good music - there are some good memories in this set that I've never heard. Surprisingly clear - no - too much - that could work - right there in your speaker with a ridiculous explanation. Music: The first LP includes popular songs from the 'Rain' tracks released on the \"One Stormy Night\" LP by The Mystic Modes Orchestra - and the remake is so good that you can enjoy the outdoor season. In particular, the reminder refers to Dennis Wilson's girl's words \"Pacific Ocean Blue\" which will almost using a week old fatigue Emphasizes I think you can say that the whole style of music is included - but it is very limited. Sing for a minute and say the next thing in this rich Oregon song - there is a bright sweetness to the music that makes it so sad and so beautiful at the same time. Girls go, girls stay, hearts rise, hearts break. It's American country music, but it has a Nick Drake feel to it. Another real influence is Chris Christopherson, whose writing style is almost identical to the background (Christopherson fought for Newbury at the time and has since sung songwriting skills). There's even a melodrama for the Walker Brothers - but it's never too funny. Highlights include the beautiful song \"He Wake Me Up to Say Goodbye\" (lyrics of the song that is the title of this review) and \"I No Longer Think About Him\" \u200b\u200b(with beautiful background lyrics) Which I have mentioned (above ). \"The future is not what it used to be\" is included in the \"ever-changing\" box of Electra records and is a great history. The names of the \"Frisco Debut\" characters feel real - \"If you break up like me, they could be a month old.\" And \"when it's cold, there's nothing more acceptable than sunlight.\" To the surprise of Butter & Audience, the fell silent and swept until one thousand nine hundred and seventy. It is an unexpected and sincere joy to hear that Elvis Presley was married to one, seventy-one (No. eight in the UK) upon hearing of its release in the Vegas version. Updated audio quality is good - strings, sounds - amazing. The next six minutes of \"Howman Times (Must the Piper Must Pay for His Song)\" are neatly arranged with sound guitar and \"Look Away from Dicky\" in the music. By the time \"Good Morning Dear\" and \"Song for Susan\" arrived on the album \"Haven Help the Child\" - a piano combo, sounds and strings had almost become an part form for him - and it was impressive. The short remake of \"San Francisco Mabel Joy\" ends with brain, sound guitars and remote locomotives - and is reminiscent of three full albums on England's Nick Drake and Island Records - \"Five Leaves Left\" (One thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight). ), \"Brighter Letter\" (one thousand, ninety-seven) and \"Pink Moon\" (one thousand, twenty-two hundred) - Newbury \"American trilogy\" should be honoured in the same way - and just beautiful. Thought the fourth disc would be filler - but it is not. Publishing demos are especially beautiful with a bright band singing Newberry piano and are very beautiful. \"Good Morning Dear\" recorded alone with big names like Ray Charles and Roy Orbison. Best of all, KBHM's radio session - which in't bad - but with a sound guitar and good sound - is incredibly close, and many songs like \"Sed Satin Rhyme\" and \"I Don't Want Rock\" Not in other albums. \"Better Day\" is as much a lovely song in itself as it is written by one of the most famous flights - and the real jewel that has never been released before. Summary - \"An American Trilogy\" give Addiction is notorious - and ultimately set for the price that music lovers can afford. Even if you don't know Newbury - it's one of those times when you should take a chance - because quality is where it's fun - and it's worth all the money. This is a good time to recover. And treat everyone involved well.","overall":5,"summary":"\"...Just Like The Dawn...My Heart Is Silent Breaking...\"","unixReviewTime":1339027200,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2012"}

Both \u201cGood Days\u201d and \u201cI Don\u2019t Want No Big City Woman\u201d: A clear fairness and a noticeable disadvantage is 'art' - none of the three albums were photographed anywhere - not even the CDs themselves.use the four CDs -the different photos - but of course without the original Art referred to - they have no meaning. His second and most popular album \"Frisco Mabel Joy \u201d(the only one of these LPs released in the UK at the send of one thousand, nine hundred and eleven on Elektra K forty two thousand, one hundred and five) even though I\u2019m satisfied with the priority of a boxing bring with a nice hand-me-down containing songs-but nothing there was made there. Could there be licensing issues? But if you want to know what the doors look and feel like about this product - Saint Cecilia Knows has released three records and the fourth \u201cGood Days\u201d is set on VNYL two thousand and eleven - all reflected in Amazon (for sale) A twenty -four page copy of this booklet with direct text produced by Production and Editor - CHRIS CAMPION. It also prints Kris Kristofferson\u2019s original lyrics of Thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine albums on Newbury\u2019s first album \u201cIt Looks Like Rain\u201d and an article that first appeared on AllMusic\u2019s list of two thousand which the wrote BEN-FONG-TORRES. There have been several photos of Newbury in recent years - this short stint with the band Doo Wop The Embers - a tour of the U. S. Army with one thousand, nine hundred and sixty - and banner gigs from November, nine hundred and seventy in this first show The West Coast is shared by David Steinberg at New Bitter End in Santa Monica. The latest pages give the musician credit in detail all the albums and extras (Dennis Linde produced and played \u201cFrisco Mabel Joy\u201d - Charlie McCoy and Jimmie Haskell were on \u201cParadise Help Baby\u201d etc. ). But the big news is the sound. Sound: All these little bad packs chase them when you start \u2018listening\u2019 - not just because the music is so good - this device has one of the best I\u2019ve heard. Each of the albums is surprisingly clean - none of them can triple in effectiveness - only the speakers are really clear. The transfer was made by JESSICA THOMPSON and STEVE ROSENTHAL and should be commended for their work on the tapes. MUSIC: The first LP to be popular that shows the difference between the \u2018rain\u2019 tracks from the \u201cOne Stormy Night\u201d LP on The Mystic Moods Orchestra - and its production is so great that you can double the outdoor season. The remake was exclusively produced by Dennis Wilson\u2019s \u201cPacific Ocean Blue\u201d vocals featuring many songs with a church -like feel. I think you would say that in general this style of music is country - but that is very limited. Sing for a minute and then talk alongside the rich beauty of Oregon about it-there\u2019s a bright sweetness to the music that makes it painful and stunning at the same time. The girls came out, the girls were there, the hearts were uplifting, the hearts were broken. He is an American rock-and-roll musician but Nick Drake has attention. Another real influence was Kris Kristofferson with a similar rhythm style in the background (Kristofferson won Newbury at the time and sang the genius of this song forever). There\u2019s also Walker Brothers melodrama - but it\u2019s not too crowded. Highlights include a beautiful ballot \u201cI\u2019m still awake to say goodbye\u201d (lyrics from the review) and \u201cI don\u2019t think about him much\u201d \u201cThe future is no longer what it used to be\u201d the box covering \u201cEternal Changes \"the Elektra Register and it has a great history. The words \"Frisco Debut\" are true - \"it could also be the month when you're as fragile as I am.\" and \"when you're cold, there's no greeting like the sun.\" Writing something patriotic and deep in the South as \u201cAn American Trilogy\u201d at a time when the United States was dying at home (Vietnam, Race Riots) may not have happened in the poems of the day - but it happened in Newbury - if which surprised a bitter listener.silence and tears. One thousand nine hundred and seventy. To hear that the was rescued from Elvis Presley\u2019s Vegas type being sealed by one thousand, nine hundred and seventy -two (No. eight in the UK) was an unexpected and real joy. The redesigned sound quality is beautiful - the strings, the sounds - amazing. The nearly six minutes of \u201cHow Much Time (Piper should pay for her song)\u201d are well-tuned to the soundtrack and the \u201clook at Dixie\u201d vibe of the melody. With the arrival of \u201cGood Morning Dear\u201d and \u201cSong For Susan\u201d on the third album \u201cHeaven Help The Child\u201d - the combination of piano, vocals and strings has become almost an artistic signature style - that\u2019s surprising. A brief review of \u201cSan Francisco Mabel Joy\u201d completes the brain album, sound guitar and steam train - and you\u2019ll remember a lot of Nick Drake in England and these three best doors on the Island Record - \u201cFive Leaves (Five Leaves) (thousand, nine hundred and sixty -nine), \"Bryter Layter\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy -two) and \"Pink Moon\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy -two) - The own \"American\" Trilogy of Newbury \"is that. Be polite - and that\u2019s the best. I thought the fourth plate would be filled - but it was\u2019t. The shows often using Newbury piano with a very simple and beautiful ensemble. \u201cGood Morning Dear\u201d was recorded by big names like Ray Charles and Roy Orbison. Best of all is the KBHM Radio Station - which is very interesting - but with acoustic guitar and front panel - it\u2019s surprising. And many of the songs like \u201cSad Satin Rhyme\u201d and \u201cI Don\u2019t Want Rock\u201d karen\u2019t on other doors. \u201cGood Days\u201d itself is a beautiful song like anything written by famous flights - and a real gem that has yet to be released. In a nutshell - \u201cAn American Trilogy\u201d is a rich disgrace - and is ultimately rated the value that loving music can afford. Although Newbury is an unknown - it\u2019s one of those times you have to take a chance - because quality is a joy - and worth every penny. A wonderful and wonderful capture time. well done to all involved.","overall":5,"summary":"\"...Just Like The Dawn...My Heart Is Silent Breaking...\"","unixReviewTime":1339027200,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2012"}
