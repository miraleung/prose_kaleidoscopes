They really just released this to get their songs out and move on with their lives. Fortunately, their first song \"Just a Girl\" won good results, and they and't have to. The sad Kingdom is the greatest work of the Doubt in my eyes, full of beautiful songs. I may not like the many CDs of them all, but this is definitely one of them. This CD begins with \"Spider Web\", a clever song. There is no doubt that one of my favourite songs in history is \"Sorry Mr. This is just a great song. Next up is \"Just a Girl\", this is the first single, and could be the \"star\" of the CD. Without a doubt, one of my favourite songs about \"different people\", is very good. Later they released another popular song \"Don't Talk\" on CD, which is still playing on the radio today. \"You Can Do It\" is also an interesting song, although it sounds like a song that can be used by hot girls. There are my favourite songs on the whole CD. \"Kingdom of Disaster\". It is very interesting, difficult, deep, thoughtful and very watery. The whole CD is full of fun, and I would recommend it to anyone who has heard of their new material.","overall":5,"summary":"&quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; is a delight","unixReviewTime":957484800,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2000"}

Is this a coincence? I think not. You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to note the many similarities in the prognostication and supergroovalisticprosifunkstications of the good Dr. Funkenstein. Over twenty years before President William J. Clinton made the cloning of humans illegal, one George Clinton was flying this mothership under the radar and engaging in human cloning experiments, after reading Ira Levin's cloning thriller \"The Boys of Brazil.\" CIA evidence that Clinton flew to Paraguay on several occasions in the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy to meet with deranged Nazi geneticist Dr. Josef Mengele have been suppressed by the federal government, but the Transnational Academy of Bootknocking Scientists sent a FOIA request to the government in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, which unearthed over one, four hundred and thirty-seven pages of evidence of collaborative conference between Drs. Mengele and Funkenstein. Just as FBI authorities were closing in on Clinton's operations, this front organizations, Parliament and Funkadelic -- two innocuous disco\/funk\/psychedlic rock bands -- released this document, \"The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein,\" an LP record designed to put one nation under a groove, and to hide the monstrous truth in plain sight. This preposterous album led an unwitting populace to believe that the good doctor was just \"Funkin' For Fun,\" that this genome splicing activities were nothing more than a dance move designed to \"put a glide in your stride and a zip in your ship.\"But, has anyone actually come aboard the Holy Mothership? Despite uncorroborated sightings over Oakland, Gary, Newark, Washington, D. C., New Orleans, Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit, and other Chocolate Cities, the Holy Mothership allegedly went into mothballs in the early one thousand, nine hundred and heights after a copyright infringement suit forced Clinton to abandon ship. This ruse, disguised as a multi-million dollar squabble over publication rights to the Parliament\/Funkadelic catalogue, was actually the government's way of keeping the brothers in their place. The Nation of Islam, subsequently, has attempted to legally expropriate the legal use of the Holy Mothership (cleverly changing the name to \"Motherplane\"), but most funkateers regard the Minister Louis Farrakhan as nothing more than Sir Nose D-Void of Funk in black nationalist's clothing. Most relevant to the case are the numerous videotaped sightings of the Mothership over Area fifty-one, as documented on Art Bell's radio program \"Coast to Coast,\" but of course, you can't show videotaped evidence over the radio. Convenient. \"Funk not only removes, it removes, dig?\" The desired effect is what you get when NASA, the FBI, the CIA and the Pentagon suppress evidence of interplanetary funksmanship. Dr. Funkenstein has gotten too close to the truth, too close to breaking the government's monopoly on cloning and space travel, which is why in the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, COINTELPRO parents got Geo. Clinton hooked on cocaine, marijuana, heroin, mushrooms and peyote. Periodically, Clinton has been busted by local authorities under various drugs possession charges, which is cover for the CIA's keeping the atomic dog on a short leash, lest the upset the power structure that has since fled the dinner cities and moved to the vanilla suburbs. Further proof of how Dr. Funkenstein's afronauts have subverted popular culture as well as the history books rests in evidence of the Princess Diana murder long suppressed by INTERPOL, which was a covert operation designed to draw attention from the fact that funk saucers had landed outside of Cairo to reclaim the pyramids. How DID an otherwise slow news day move this very black achievement off the front pages and onto page Athirty-one of the New York Times? I submit: Conspiracy by the Vanilla Power Structure. Nonetheless, if your mind can handle it, spin this wax on your platters and let Dr. Funkenstein and this brides work they roots into your soul.

I finally deed to check out Karla Bonoff after hearing \"Somebody's Eyes\" from the Footloose soundtrack and found out she went back as a songwriter and artists from the late seventy's. Plus, my esteemed friend Alexandra recommended her, as she went to some of her concerts, so that finally got the ball rolling. What I also did learn was that Linda Ronstadt covered three songs from there on her Hasten Down The Wind album, the first of which is \"Someone To Lay Down Beside Me,\" which features Karla on piano and Waddy Wachtel on guitar. It's a portrait of loneliness set in \"a world that can be sort of heartless.\"There's a light skipping beat in \"I Can't Hold On\" that reflects the Eagles and James Taylor-kind of sound prevalent at the time. Waddy's guitars enhances this song. The sad piano-only ballad \"Lose Again\" is the second song covered by Ronstadt. Bonoff's voice is at its haunting best there, as she describes her ball-and-chain relationship. She likens it to missing the train and staying behind. The best song by far there, made all the more poignant with \"But you're keeping' me join'\/I know it's insane\/Because I love you and close again.\"Ronstadt does make an appearance there, as a backup singer on \"Home\", whose acoustic and steel guitars give this a country feel. Producer Kenny Edwards does the mandolin there as well. She describes home as a liberating influence: \"My life there has it's own wings\/To fly over the mountains\/Though I'm standing still.\" \"Faces In The Wind\" is lullaby-type country ballad. The electric piano and bass really forms the framework for the upbeat \"Isn't It Always Love,\" which I can picture Carly Simon covering. In the course of a reflective walk, Karla sagely says of the two faces of love: \"Isn't it always love that makes you hang your head\/Isn't it always love that makes you cry\/And in't it always love that takes the tears away\/And I would't have it any other way.\"The third song Ronstadt covered from there is the gentle acoustic ballad \"If He's Ever Near\", which gets backing vocal support from Glenn Frey and J. D. Souther. Yes, it is hard to find that someone who's the right one, in't it?\"Flying High\" is a mid-paced country-ish song that again tells of the ups and downs of love, told to her by a gypsy fortune teller. The story has a happy ending, so that's good. Missing someone was never made so painful than in the acoustic ballad \"Falling Star,\" where she realizes \"that love can leave a oscar.\" She does have a good high note when she sings how she's going down like the title object. It's so bad, that \"when the birds fly south for a while\/Oh, I wish that I could go\/Someone there might warm this cold heart.\" One of the best songs there. The final ballad displays an analogy between a rose and love. Like the \"Rose In The Garden\", \"It will bloom if you're sure\/That you pay close attention\/but leave it room.\"Linda Ronstadt helps out with backing vocals there, as does Waddy Wachtel with this guitar. A wonderful debut, highlighted by Karla's melodic vocals.

In addition, my dear friend Alexandra suggested that she attend some of her concerts, which she eventually did. I also read that Linda Ronstadt had covered three songs on her album Hasten Down The Wind, the first of which was \"Someone Put Down by My Side\", which featured Karla on the piano and Waddy Wachtel on the guitar. This is a lonely image, set in a \"rude world\". There\u2019s an eye-popping sequel to \u201cI Can\u2019t Hold On\u201d, featuring the popular Eagles and the stylish sound of James Taylor at the time. Vardy's guitar has improved this song. The sad piano ballad \"Lost Again\" is Langstadt's second album. Bonoff's voice is the most memorable there because the describes this metal relationship. He likened it to closing a train and sitting in the back. The best song so far, \"But let me join you\" \/ I know it's crazy \/ Because I love you and I closed it again. Langstadt was spotted there, as a \"Home\" conservationist, this acoustic guitar and guitar gave the country a lively sound. Producer Kenny Edwards also played mandolin there. He went home. He was described as a liberating influence: ngxi. \"Faces in the Wind\" is a lullaby-style folk ballad of the country. The electric piano and bass really make a happy frame \"Ist It Always Love\" I can imagine Carly Simon's cover During the thoughtful journey, the clever Karla Talking about him. Two loving faces: \"Don't you always love to make you sad \/ don't always love to cry \/ and don't always love you? This brought tears to my eyes \/ I won't have any other option.\" . Yeah, it's hard to find the right person, in't it? \"High Flying\" A middle-tempo country song that also tells the ups and downs of love. The lucky gypsy tells the cashier's boss. The story has a wonderful, beautiful ending. In the usual song of the myth \"Meteor\", I remember it. One has never been so sad, in which the realized that \"love can leave the Oscars.\" When she sings as a title track, she has a beautiful top. It's so bad that \"When the birds fly down for a while \/ ooh, I wish I could go \/ someone can warm this cold heart.\" One of the best songs out there.

I also learned that Linda Ronstadt has since composed three songs on her album Houston Down the Wind, the first single \"Someone Who Sits Under Me\", which includes pianist Carla and guitarist Woody Vachel. \u06d4 It is a picture of loneliness \"placed in a world where the heart can be heartless.\" \"I Can't Hold On\" is a huge hit film that currently features the voices of Eagles and James Taylor. Woody's guitars make this song better. Only the sad piano ballad \"Lose Again\" is the second song covered by Ronstadt. Bonif's voice is very cloud there, as the describes this football chain ties.

I finally deed to check out Karla Bonoff after hearing \u201cEyes of a Person\u201d from the Footloose singer and I found out she has been back with singers and artists since the late seventies. In addition, my dear friend Alexandra advised me, when she went to some of the concerts, to finally roll the ball. What I also found out was that Linda Ronstadt released three songs from Hasten Down The Wind\u2019s album, the first being \u201cSomeone Put Me Around Me,\u201d with Karla as pianist and Waddy Wachtel on guitar. Wait. It is the image of loneliness set in \"a world that can be kind of heartless.\" There\u2019s a weak beat of \u201cI Can\u2019t Hold On\u201d that reflects the Eagles and James Taylor-type sounds that were prevalent at the time. Waddy played guitar for this song. The sad piano-single \u201cLose Again\u201d was Ronstadt\u2019s second song. Bonoff\u2019s voice is best, explaining this relationship to the ball and to the chain. He pretended to be left on the train and stayed in the back. The best song out there, she's still angry \"But you're keeping 'me joining' \/ I know she's crazy \/ Because I love you and I'm going to shut up again.\" \u201cHome\u201d, whose acoustic and steel guitars make it a country sensation. Producer Kenny Edwards also makes mandolin there. He described the house as an effect of liberation: \"My life there has its own wings \/ To fly over the mountains \/ even if I am still standing.\" \u201cWind Faces\u201d is a spiral-type sphere. The electric piano and bus are really the upcoming \u201cIsn\u2019t It Always Love\u201d style, which I can describe Carly Simon covering. In contemplation, Karla wisely describes the two stages of love: \u201cIsn\u2019t love changing over your head \/ Isn\u2019t love always making you cry \/ And not always the love the third song. Ronstadt's cover -up is the sweet soundtrack \"If He's Ever Near\", with vocal support from Glenn Frey and JD Souther. Yeah, it's hard to find the right person, in't it? \" \u201cFlying High\u201d is a patriotic song that recounts the ups and downs of love, and she tells a fortune teller The story has a happy ending, so it\u2019s okay. because it has never been made more painful than the acoustic ballad \"Falling Star\", in which the realizes that \"that love can leave an oscar.\" Too bad, that \"when the birds fly south momentarily \/ Oh, I want to go \/ Something can warm my cold heart.\" One of the best songs out there. presents comparisons between flowers and love, such as \"Rose In The Garden\", \"It blooms if you're sure \/ watch carefully \/ but you leave the room.\" too ale the guitar.

After this death, I deed to listen to all of these albums, and I found this album very good, but not my favourite of him. Most of the songs are very far apart, and there are two more three albums I can suggest that sound better for this one! (For example. Did I forget to mention Prince and Teena Marie?) I think the real credit goes to Quincy Jones, who is the master of making this album. I love Beating, PY T., Billie Jean, and Human Behavior (though I prefer the SWV type). I think most songs can be seen as great in their time, but I think the songs have come up with something better than this. Some of the previous albums have been good, and I like Bad, Dangerous, Blood Dance. Billie Jean is my favourite Michael Jackson song. I heard this song in my new year in HS, and I thought it was dark, cold, and stand the test of time because it still looks transparent even by today\u2019s standards. I think the last few clues are jones that I would almost consider a mystery, but the refused. showing how much R&B this album still has I think this album is fun, but it declined. it\u2019s not the best album of all time.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant","unixReviewTime":1199318400,"reviewTime":"01 3, 2008"}

I purchased this record in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six in the month of May, OR maybe in early June. I'd like to offer my opinion & review of this \"Rocks\" album, as follows:one. \"Back In the Saddle\". I really HATED this song when I first played this record. Now that this song has really grown on me, I've begun to LOVE this song. It entered the Top forty in May one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven for only two weeks, stalling @ #thirty-eight.two. \"Last Child\". Just like \"Back In the Saddle\", I really HATED this song, too. This song also grew on me & I began to LIKE this song a lot. In the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, \"Last Child\" was spun by a DJ at a roller skating drink. This song, also entered the Top forty in June one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, for ten weeks, reaching #twenty-one on the charts.three. \"Rats In the Cellar\". now this is where the music really starts getting hot. It is an excellent song. Because the beat is very fast, sometimes the vocal is hard to understand. This song is ONE of my top favourites.four. \"Combination\". I think that Joe Perry sings on this song of\/ Steve Tyler. This is another one of my top favourites. This song is excellent & it is also unique, in a strange sort of way. The title \"Combination\" is never mentioned in this song. I love these vocals & twangy guitar work @ the send. I think that Ted Nugent could have also been good on this song, of\/ HIS twangy guitar work, that's quite noticeable on this \"Free For All\", album ALSO from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six.five. \"Sick As A Dog\". I find this song to be kind of humorous on some of it's lyrics. I love the intro to this song, before it kicks into full gear. This is another one of my favourites, too.six. \"Nobody's Fault\". Just like \"Sick As A Dog\", this song starts out quietly, which I like,. then the power really kicks in. The title \"Nobody's Fault\" is never mentioned in this song. I think that this song SHOULD be titled as \"Sorry, You're So Sorry\" OR even \"A Little To Late\". This is another one of my favourites & probably the MOST powerful song on this album.seven. \"Get The Lead Out\". this song is quite powerful, too & I like this one quite well.eight. \"Lick & A Promise\". this song is okay but, it's my least favourite on this album.nine. \"Home Tonight\". closes out this album of\/ a ballad. When I first heard this song, I thought that the record was WARPED because Steve Tyler's voice always sounded so distorted. Today, three\/twenty\/thirteen, I just rec'd my copy of \"ROCKS\" on a CD. And \"Home Tonight\" still sounds the way that I just described, so I guess there was NOTHING WRONG of\/ my CD for Record, after all. My opinion of this song is that it's just okay & it's not my favourite, either. I do like \"Home Tonight\" a lot better than \"You See Me Crying\", though.

This is one of my favourites. Six. \"No one is wrong\". Just like \u201cSick As A Dog\u201d, this song begins quietly, which I love. Then the energy began to work. The title \"No Man's Mistake\" is not mentioned in this song. I think the title of this song should be \"I'm Sorry, I'm So Sorry\" for even \"A little bit\". This is one of my favourites, and it is the most powerful song on this album. Seven. \"Lead forward.\" This song is very powerful, I really like this song. Eight. \"Licking and committing\". This song is good, but it's my favourite thing on this album. Nine. \"Go home at night\". End this person \/ disc. When I first heard this song, I thought it was a WARPED record because the voice of Steve Tyler always sounded distorted.

I bought this record in the month of May for maybe in the beginning of June in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six. I want to give my opinion and review this album \"Rocks\", such as: Second. \"Back in the chair\" I hated the song when I first started playing this record. Now that this song has really grown for me, I have started liking this song. In just two weeks, it entered the top forty, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, standing # thirty-eight. \"The Last Child\". Like \"Back in the Saddle\", I hated the song. This song grew in me again and I really started to like this song. In the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six, \"The Last Child\" was thrown into a roller skating drink by a DJ. The song are-entered the top forty in June, one, nine hundred and sixty-six, ten weeks, reaching # twenty-one on the charts. Three times. \"Mice in the basket.\" Now that the music starts to heat up. Great song Because the rhythm is so fast, sometimes the sound is difficult to understand. This song is one of my top favourites. \"Collection\". I think Joe Perry sang this song \/ Steve Tyler. This is one of my top favourites. This song is very beautiful and unique, very strange. The title of \"Combination\" was never mentioned in the song. I love these sounds and guitar work - sending. I think Ted Nogent will be good at this song, too, for this Tongi guitar, which is the most notable of these \"free for all\", an album and a thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six. \"You're sick like a dog\" I find this song funny in some of its melodies. I like the introduction to this song, before it kicks into full gear. This is one of my favourites, too.six. \"No mistake.\" Like \"Sick As A Dog\", the song begins quietly, my favourite. Then comes the real power. The song never mentions \"No Man's Fault\". I think the name of this song should be \"Sorry, I'm so sorry\" for even \"Slow Delay\". It's one of my favourite songs and probably the most powerful song on the album. \"Release Leader\". This song is really powerful, and I love it too. The song \"Lick and a Promise\" is good but, it is my youngest favourite on this album. Close the album \"Tonight at Home\" with a song. When I first heard the song, I thought the record had been warned because Steve Tyler's voice always sounded so distorted. Today, three \/ twenty \/ thirty, I just released my copy of \"ROCKS\" on CD. And \"Home Tonight\" still looks the same as I just described, so I don't think there's anything wrong with my \/ record CD. My opinion on this song is that it is right and not my favourite. I love \"Home Tonight\", though \"you're watching me\". I highly recommend this album and I have always loved this album \"ROCKS\" by Aerosmith.","overall":5,"summary":"\"Rocks\".....1976.....Aerosmith","unixReviewTime":1363737600,"reviewTime":"03 20, 2013"}

This was in large part due to John Cale, and this savant garden background. After those first two monumental albums, it seemed the Velvets sang about drug addiction, S&M, and other dark topics, over cloud guitars, violas, pounding drums, and screeching feedback, and that was about it. But then something happened to the band, bases the departure of John Cale. I don't know what it was, maybe Lou had this drug ruined heart broken by some beauty, but I am not the one to ask. No matter what the circumstances, this is a beatufiul album. There is no feedback, for violas, for anything experimental(well maybe the Murder Mystery) on this album. They really seemed to become a POP BAND on this album. But of course not in the strictest sense of the word. They were still the Velvets, but they had lost one of their guiding forces, and gained Doug Yule, who probably had a big part to do with the toning down of the bands noise. Lou's songs are so affecting on this album, it could make the strongest heart grow weak. Candy Says, Some Kind of Love, Pale Blue Eyes(one of the best songs never recorded), Jesus, and I'm Set Free are some of the most moving ballads you are never destined to hear, while they still show their ability to play a rock in roll song, twice i might mention, in What Goes On, and Beginning to See the Light. These karen't your Sister Ray type of rockers. Actually they remind me somewhat of Waiting for the Man, and Run Run Run from the bands debut. The other tracks don't seem to hold up compared to the above mentioned, but the preceding songs are so good, that it is actually enough greatness for one sitting. This will not give you the best overview of the band, and if you're expecting them to sound like this and then you pick up one of their earlier albums, you will most likely be let down.

(See my review) And I'm just as happy with the purchase. When Q released it, it featured Michael Jackson's \"Off the Wall\", Rufus and Chaka Khan's \"Masterjam\", Brothers Johnson's \"Light Up the Night\", and George Benson's \"Give Me the Night\". And I'm sure Patty Austin's old music, \"Every Home Should Be,\" was about that time. He has been busy and it shows. Kamal had a lot to master these skills. For me this album would be a musical if not a commercial for this work, however the next year Thriller closed it all with \"Thriller\". It is the best 'solo' liqueur but it is as smooth as silk and as cold as cucumber. It is not a non-existent note in which everything is crystal clear, with sharp and strong horns. Patty Austin provides keynote voices on four of the nine tracks there: \"Betcha will not hurt me\", \"Something special\", \"Razmataz\" and \"Turn on the action.\" Performs three main voices: \"The David\", the classic \"Only Once\" and \"One Hundred Ways\". And someone introduced themselves as \"Dawn.\" I wonder if anyone has heard of it again? Participated in one of the collaborations with Stephanie Andrews and I heard that some were brought to Q's attention in search of song collections (such as producers), until they found the Jones they were looking for.

Berrygirl","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"Days of Future Passed, the first effort of the 'Phase two Moody Blues', is one of those landmark albums that should be in everyone's music library, Moody Blues fan for not. Having hardly no exposure at all to the world of classical\/orchestral-type music, I have to admit I haven't much of an year for it. Frankly, my musical tastes just karen't that highbrow, so I realize I'm not table to fully appreciate this album. That is my biggest obstacle in truly embracing the whole of 'Days' for the masterpiece that it is. Oh, I dearly love the Moodies songs, but the rest, well let's just say I'm getting there. The more I hear it, the more I like the orchestral parts, what I as a simple country girl have always called Beethoven\/rich people music. At this point in my musical self-education, I have to heartily give DOFP my big vol' stamp of approval. In reviewing, I will briefly(or not so) give my thoughts on each song along with a may for nay vote.one 'The Day Begins'- NO. Haven't fully acquired a taste for poetry for chamber music- yet. Sorry Graeme.two 'Dawn is a Feeling'- YES. Mike Pinder's opener is just lovely and well-sung by Justin Hayward but Mike's voice was't in top form for this part, which fortunately was brief. Pinder has asa that this reference to the \"smell of grass\" was't about spot, but looking back the realized it fit well with the times.two 'Another Morning'- YES. Another Ray Thomas number. It had to grow on me, as I normally don't care for \"kiddie\" songs. He does such an outstanding job vocally that I had to like it.three 'Peak Hour'- YES. John Lodge rocks me with this great song. It's the overlooked gem on 'Days'. I had read that it was the Moodies loudest number played live for many years. Wish I could have been there to experience it. Great lyrics- if I could just find the originals. I've seen about five versions of it online! Lodgie and mates using it superbly and slap play the fool out of it.four 'Tuesday Afternoon'- YES. What can I say about this classic that has't already been said before? I think it's THE best Hayward number on DOFP. Justin singing this song is a little slice of heaven in my headphones.five 'Evening Time to Get Away'- YES. Oh yes, yes, yes. Hearing John's lovely voice- especially this falsetto- at it's best is enough for this gal. \"Working, living it brings. Only way to have those things. Toiling has bought too many tears\". Lodge simply nailed it on this timeless code to the working class.six 'The Sunset'- YES. Good song- only wish Pinder would've had a longer part to using this time. He sounded great.seven 'Twilight Time'- YES. Ray redeems himself VERY well there. His subtle vocal literally caresses the lyrics- and my years.eight 'Nights In White Satin'- YES. Brilliant song and THE ONE Hayward will forever be known for. Though I love it, it's not my fave of this. This song manages to be both beautiful and haunting all at once. Lodge's almost eerie-sounding, wailing chorus parts never fail to get me. WOW.nine 'Late Lament'. NO. Another poem by Graeme Edge. My sincere apologies Edgie. It's not you, really. It's me. You're a fantastic drummer to be sure!'Days Of Future Passed' will forever be known as THE record that launched The Moody Blues onto the world stage.

Without having to worry about the world of orchestral music, I must admit I haven\u2019t gotten to it in years. Honestly, I don\u2019t have the greatest taste in music, so I know I\u2019m not at the table to fully appreciate this album. That was my biggest challenge because I really welcome \u2018All Days\u2019 for its part. Alas, I love Moodies songs, but for others, let\u2019s say I\u2019m coming. The more I hear, the more I like the orchestral parts, and as a simple country woman I always call it Beethoven \/ rich music. At the moment of recognizing my music, I had to wholeheartedly give DOFP my large stamp of approval. In the review, I will briefly (or otherwise) give my opinion on each song along with not voting. I still haven't fully tasted the music in the bedroom -. Sorry Graeme.two \u2018Dawn is Feeling\u2019- YES Mike Pinder\u2019s opening was very good and Justin Hayward sang well but Mike\u2019s voice is not in this high form in this episode, which is fortunately short. Pinder asa this reference to \u201cgrass smells\u201d is out of place, but the reviews found it was timely. Two \u2018Another Mornings\u2019 - YES. Another Ray Thomas number. He had to grow up with me, because I\u2019m not usually interested in \u201ckiddie\u201d songs. She does a great job as a vocalist which is something I loved. John Lodge shook me with this beautiful song. It\u2019s a gem that \u2018Days\u2019 is ignored. I\u2019ve read that Moodies is the strongest number played live in years. I wish I was there to get to know him. Big word- if I can get the background. I have found up to five types of internet! Lodgie and the couple use it extensively and play slap in the face. Four \u2018Tuesday Afternoons\u2019 - YES. What can I say about this unspoken classic? I think this is Hayward\u2019s best DOFP number. Justin's singing of this song is a bit heavenly to the years. Oh yes, yes, yes. Hearing John\u2019s beautiful voice - especially the falsetto - is enough for this folder. \"Working, living leads. The only way to get these things. Lodge just naked this rule to timeless work class. Six 'The Sunset'- YES. Good song- I just wish Pinder had a longer part of use of this time.

I have never performed in classical \/ orchestra music, and I have to admit that I have little time for it. Frankly, my music is not that good, and I have come to realize that I cannot fully appreciate this album. This is the biggest obstacle for me to really embrace every \"Days\" because it's a work of part. Oh, I love Moods songs so much, but for some, we\u2019ll just say I\u2019ve just arrived. The more I listened, the more I liked the part of the orchestra. As a simple country girl, I always called her Beethoven \/ rich music. During this time of self-study music, I will have to make DOFP a big welcome. In the comments, I will briefly give (or not) my thoughts on each song and the possible negatives. The day starts \"-no. You haven't quite fully tasted the music of the music room - yet. Sorry Graeme. Mike Pind's opening is very good, Justin Hayward (Justin Hayward) sings very well, but Mike's voice in't very good in this area, luckily this part is too short. Pinder once asa that the mention of \"scent grass\" had nothing to do with the place, but on hindsight, it was found to be very appropriate at times. Two \"one morning\" - yes. Another number by Ray Thomas. great for vocal music, and I have to love it. \"Three High Hours\" - yes. John Lodge shocked me with this wonderful song. It's the most overlooked gem in \"Days\". I've learned that this is the most amazing number Moody has played live over the years. great \u2014 if I could get an original report. I saw about the translations to five online! Lodgie and this friends used it well and broke it with a slap. \"Tuesday afternoon\" -yes. What can I say about this classic that no one has never said before? I think that is the highest Hayward number in the DOFP. Justin singing this song is a piece of the air on my headphones. Five \u201cleave at night\u201d \u2014yes. Oh yes, yes, yes. Hearing John's lovely voice \u2014 especially this false voice \u2014 is the perfect thing for this girl. \"Work, a rewarding life. This is the only way I can say I have these things. Hard work has bought a lot of tears.\" Lodge recently reinforced this timeless code for employees. Six \"sunsets\" -yes. Good song \u2014 I hope Pinder can have a long time to use this season. Sounds great. There are seven \"Twilight Zone\" - Yes. Ray relieved himself very well there. His clever voice touches the songs \u2014 and my page. Eight \"White Satin Night\" - yes. Beautiful songs and OTHER Hayward will always be known. Even though I love it, it\u2019s not something I like. This song is beautiful and memorable. Rocky's almost terrifying cry chorus always makes me forget. WOW.nine \"Late skills\". Do not. Another poem by Graeme Edge. I sincerely apologize to Edgie. It's not you, it's me. There is no doubt that you are an excellent doctor! \"The days of the future\" will always be known as the record that puts the Moody Blues on the world stage. There\u2019s a good reason for this: this is a landslide, a beautiful recording, created by the mind, hands and voice of five talented young people who are just doing their best to make great music.","overall":5,"summary":"You Gotta Have It","unixReviewTime":1181001600,"reviewTime":"06 5, 2007"}

Since I have no exhibitions in the world of classical \/ orchestral type music, I must admit that I do not have more than a year to discover. Honestly, my music is not very popular, so I can see that I am not at the table to fully appreciate this album. This is my biggest hurdle in truly accepting all the 'days' of professionalism. Oh, I really like Moody's songs, but other than that, let's just say I got there.

You have not yet mastered the taste of Roman music poetry. Sorry Graeme.two 'Dawn is a feeling' - yes. Mike Pinder's opening was just fun and Justin Hayward sang well, but Mike's voice was't good in that part, with a bit of luck. Pinder asa the mention of \"grass scent\" was out of place, but looking back it was a good idea. 'Another morning' - yes. Another number is Ray Thomas. It had to grow in me, because I don't usually care about \"Kiddie\" songs. She did such a great job so cloud that I had to love her. Three 'high hours' - yes. John Lodge beat me with this beautiful song. This is the ignored value of 'days'. I learned that this was the largest number of Moody's played live for many years. I wish I was there to feel it. Good songs - if I only get real. I've seen about five types of it online! Lodi and this teammates used him well and slapped him and played with this stupidity. 'Tuesday Afternoon' - Yes. What can I say about this unique classic? I think this is Hayward's best score in the DOFP. Justin who sang this song is a little piece of heaven on my headphones. Five to'clock in the evening - yes. Yes, yes, yes. Listening to John's sweet voice - especially this misunderstanding - is much better for this girl. \"Work brings life. The only way to get these things.

Eight 'Nights in White Satin' - Yes. Bright singing with One Hayward will be known forever. Although I love it, it's not my problem. This song can be beautiful and charming at the same time. Parts of the course were almost horrible, I would never get over crying. WOW.the ninth 'cumming'. no. Another Grammy Edge poem I'm sorry Eddie. Not really you This is me.

The most intriguing and case in point of the singing career is this: \"I've been sitting for a long time, wasting time, just looking at the phone, wondering if I'll call you, so I thought maybe you're not alone.\" I am free to take part in these harassment. And I am grateful to my former manager, Nick Jasken, for pointing me to that literature.

Reardon \"Classic rock and old sch...","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Genesis singer\/drummer\/songwriter Phil Collins released this fourth solo album . But Seriously in November of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. In the four years between solo efforts, Phil played both Live A locales of London (solo and with Sting) and Philadelphia (a Genesis stronghold and played solo and played drums for Eric Clapton and the world shocking Led Zeppelin reunion). Phil also did another Genesis album and tour with Invisible Touch in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six\/eighty-seven. Produced an album for Eric Clapton and even did some shows with him. Plus guested on albums by Beatle Paul McCartney, Tina Turner and Tears For Fears. Plus did some acting. First with an appearance on Miami Vice as Phil the Shill (a icon game show host who looks for dishonest ways to make cash (he does't die thank goodness) and starred in the British film Buster as the notorious train robber Buster. That soundtrack did spawn two more Phil singles out of \"A Groovy Kind of Love\" (his version was the best IMHO) and \"Two Hearts\". Then in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, Phil went back in the studio with guitarist Daryl Stuermer, bass player Leland Sklar (with help from Nathan East* and Pino Palladino+) plus guests David Crosby, Steve Winwood, Sting guitarist Dominic Miller and Clapton himself. What emerged was an about face from the fun upbeat of No Jacket Required with a slightly more serious choice of song subjects. (My review pertains to sequence on original vinyl LP which differs from CD and cassette and IMHO the better sequence of the album). Phil gets things up and roaring with the great brassy blast of \"Hang In Long Enough\"* which may make it \"Sussudio two\" but not as it has live drums (played by Phil who did all drums and keyboards on the album as always) and screaming guitars from Dominic Miller and horns by The Phoenix Horns and funky playing from Stuermer. \"That's Just The Way It Is\" follows and addresses problems in Northern Ireland and featured David Crosby (the same one from Crosby Stills Nash and Young) supplying backing vocals. \"Find a Way to My Heart\" is another great piece. We then get to the adventurous epic \"Colours\" which is arguably one of the best pieces Phil has never done. The epic features some African rhythms and the lyrics were about the apartheid issues in South Africa. We then have the instrumental \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\" (not on LP due to time constraints) which is the first instrumental on a PC album since \"The West Side\" from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two's Hello I Must Be Going. The first side of the vinyl ends with \"Father to Son\" (no, not a remake of the Queen song from Queen II but) an original. Great tune by the way. Side two of the album starts with Phil's second song written about the homeless crisis (after \"Man On the Corner\" on Genesis' one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one album Abacab) called \"Another Day In Paradise\". It again features David Crosby on backing vocals and Dominic Miller on guitar. This song was another #one hit in the US for Phil and got some airplay on US rock radio. Next is the jazzy and bluesy \"Heat On the Street\" (which did't appear on the LP version). Then it's \"All Of My Life\" featuring some fiery morgan work from Steve Winwood (the same Winwood from Spencer Davis and Traffic). Then we have the nice ballad \"Do You Remember\"+ (another US hit) which is a great song. We follow with the fun of \"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\"*. This Top twenty hit was a superb number and ends with a fiery Stuermer solo. The vinyl LP closed with the Gospel sounding classic \"I Wish It Would Rain Down\"+. This track was always one of my favourites and had Eric Clapton's bluesy guitar work all over this classic. Plus the gospel choir made this track sound more powerful.

The biggest hit (and hands down, the biggest track) is \"Walking in Memphis\", a slow and thrilling piece that makes a modern adult very muscular. But it does't send it there. \"Silver Thunderbird\" is a track that avidly recalls the early Springsteen. Cohen sings with love for many of the songs that have undoubtedly been released in this lifestyle. \"Ghost Train\" is a gospel-like song with good backing vocals and Morgan music. High bit numbers also do not interfere with the situation. \"Mail Away\" and \"Best Saving for the Last\" offer a little space and a lot of analysis, giving the different characters a title at the send so you can meet in New York City if you have a conversation with some people. It's time to talk; Which, of course, made the video an overnight sensation. There is also a structure song, Willie Dixon's \"Twenty Nine Ways\", which includes Cohen's drums and unique overbuses. \"Perfect Love\" (with the usual song under James Taylor) and \"True Companion\" are absolutely flat - amazing love songs. The latter is especially touching, well sung with an Irish Bozuki flower singing a bit final.

But it will not be sent there. \"Silver Thunderbird\" is a musical piece reminiscent of the early Springsteen era. Cohen no doubt sang many selected songs from this life experience of this own free will. \"A stranger in a car\" relies solely on Cohen's sol piano and storytelling to cool this back. \"Ghost Training\" is gospel-like music with supporting lyrics and Morgan's music. Good prices will not affect the mood. \"Miles Away\" and \"Saving the Best For the Last\" provide a lower profile and more ideas. If you have time to talk to certain people, the latter will remind you of the different roles you face in New York City; The previous one is sometimes dirty. Wash the one you will encounter.

The instantly memorable \"Crucify\" of course is the best song. Though on this album it appears in a less punchy version (with light percussion instead of the full backbeat on singles mixes), it's still the amazing composition it is -- sounding familiar and fresh at the same time, lyrically colourful and imaginative (\"I got a cat named Easter, the says, 'Will you never learn\/You're just an empty cage, girl, if you kill the bird'\"), with beautiful piano work and dazzling song parts, the large (\"Looking for a saviour. \") and the chorus parts (\"Chains. \") anthemic and powerful. \"Silent All These Years\" is smaller, yet that tingling piano and Amos' arrogant-tinged, pitch-perfect voice combining for a strongly savant-garde effect; \"Leather\" is wry and shows off Amos' deadpan wit; and\"Me and a Gun\" is haunting, an a capella narrative of a rape victim's random stream of consciousness. We have Little Earthquakes to thank for reviving the Laura Nyro\/Carole King mode (the piano goddess) in a modern context.

They are late-adolescent poems of failed love and compassion for humanity, and they are brought to life by Jewel's expressive delivery. A lyric like \"Excuse me 'cause I've mistaken you for somebody else, somebody who gave a damn, somebody more like myself\" could come off as trite were it not for Jewel's passionate rendering of the lines, which make it sound as if her soul is spilling out into the microphone. However, the rest of the album consists of failed attempts to repeat this formula. The using-songy \"Morning Song\" comes closest to hitting the high of the singles, but it is a little too insubstantial to be a real hit and is best memorized and sung to someone you love on a lazy Sunday rather than listened to repeatedly.

They are late poems, expressing love and compassion for human failures, and they are healed by Pearl's clear speech.

Ever. After a quarter of a century, your heart will still quicken and your blood pressure will rise. That same excitement you got back then will come right back. Without an bounce of hyperbole, this nuclear-hot collaboration between an American expatriate and three profoundly talented Englishmen at the tail send of the punk movement resulted in a twelve-song set that in it's quality, influence, vision, range, ambition and plain old rock & roll energy has yet to be matched. You hear this album, you will think these guys could do anything they wanted. Punk to pop, country to new-wave soul. It's all there, and none of it sounds like genre-hopping. It's a totally organic sound. Instantly recognizable. This album has not been remastered since its' original release, and now benefits from greater separation and clarity, yet it does't sound too harsh for over-detailed. It feels true to its' source. It's crisp. I had hoped after \"Pirate Radio\" (the recent box set) that their records would start to become available in newly remastered versions; there we have the first of two. a double CD at a double CD price point. You have Chrissie Hynde's inimitable voice. part Dusty Springfield, part snarling cat. James Honeyman-Scott's precise, spare, efficient (but still thoroughly musical) style of playing was the sound of a punk rocker who took a lot of lessons. Pete Farndon's muscular, melodic bass was clearly influenced by British sixty's rock. like the Who and the Beatles. Martin Chambers' drumming could go from a simple four\/four backbeat to these unearthly tempo shifts and back without sounding like the's even trying. This gem of a record starts with a count-off leading into the lacerating \"Precious\". Chrissie Hynde's vibrato purr over her compatriots' buzzsaw back-up tell us immediately we're in for something we've never heard before. The now-famous four-letter exhortation spit at the listener startles you (\"Not me baby I'm too precious. @#$% off!\"), warning you to buckle up for the are, as the album begins.\"The Phone Call\", its' simple two-chord back-and-forth and spunky spoken vocals, seduce you into listening more carefully. \"what the check is she saying\" sorta stuff. as the incredibly tight rhythm section builds to a powerful instrumental coda.\"Up The Neck\" shows a softer, more elegant musicality. with the bolder sound returning around the chorus. Many of the sounds and motifs flow over from \"The Phone Call\", especially the guitar lead. In fact, this album sounds more of a piece. a true album versus a collection of songs. than any other of that era. Of ANY era, actually. The space and sequencing always invite you to listen \"more\". to become involved. Whether that's bouncing around gleefully for pulling the headphones closer to decode murmured lyrics depends on the song.\"Tattooed Love Boys\", one of the most original singles to come out of the post-punk\/New Wave scene, has an acceleration that the most amphetamine-laced speed metal freak could only aspire to. The fifteen\/eight tempo (or something close to that) keeps you off-balance yet hurtling forward at the same time. It's the sound of a runaway truck heading down an icy mountain with no brakes. The sudden break in the middle is sublime. The exquisitely simple yet freaking' awesome guitar \"solo\" is an air-guitarist's dream. It is physically impossible to sit still during this song. The thick bass of \"Space Invader\" introduces you to that rarest of all things: an interesting rock instrumental.\"The Wait\" is pure bedlam. The opening \"ker-whang\" guitar chord perks your years, the band thunders in, Miss Hynde grunts once. loudly. and we're off on a breakneck, thrilling rollercoaster of a punk ride. Clean, crisp playing. never once overdoing it. every note and chord in perfect place. Pete Farndon's bass work would make John Entwistle smile. The song literally skids to a halt.\"Stop Your Sobbing\" is a shock. a terrific Kinks cover with anthemic vocals by Chrissie Hynde that flirt with a little country flavor along with it's classic English pop sound. After the searing \"The Wait\", this is almost soothing. A necessary reprieve.\"Kid\" continues to show their ambition, their almost limitless prowess. It's a more conventional pop song, like \"Sobbing\". The sound is still urgent, and still powerful, but not as bruising. If there is a weak spot, the moody \"Private Life\" might be it. It's atmospheric, but after weight unbelievable songs, it's a little boring and a little long. It's over six minutes. There's a lot to like in it. and I rarely skip it, but I rarely hit \"repeat\" if you know what I mean. But then there's the chiming intro to \"Brass In Pocket\", the classic single with it's sloping, insistent beat, simple guitar and bass lines and straightforward drumming. \"I'm special. so special\" Yes indeed, Miss Hynde. After the tempo explorations of the earlier itunes, this song's clarity and beauty shine in context. Again. all of a piece.\"Lovers of Today\" is another lesser effort. having the unfortunate spot after \"Pocket\". It's slow, and indulgent, something which The Pretenders had yet to be on this album. The martial drumming of Martin Chambers opens the finale, \"Mystery Achievement\", a dark rocker with a sinuous bass hook. Great vocals, great using-along chorus. fiery guitar breaks. the call-and-response between Scott's slashing chords and Chambers' drums. what a way to send the album! We get a second disc of stuff, led off by the Bo-Diddley-ish \"Cuban Slide\" that is so good I wish it had replaced \"Lovers of Today\". It's slight, but it sounds like they're having a load of fun. listen to Chrissie using those Latin \"Ay-yi-yi's\"!\"Porcelain\" is another grave-up. an exercise in tempo shifts, crashing guitars. and this got left off? A number of demos are informative, but mainly show that these guys were ready from the get-go. \"The Wait\" starts off faster, if you can believe that. and \"Brass\" is too slow. Don't miss the swaggering instrumental \"Swinging London\". Why I have a vision of Austin Powers right now I don't know. Also check out the country lament \"Tequila\". There are a handful of live tracks that will cause your speakers to blister. Then there's the live \"Sabre Dance\". yes, THAT one. the song from a thousand cartoons and commercials. with Chrissie Hynde chirping in some \"Sobbing\" lines. it's an odd way to send the \"odds and sods\" disc, but kinda hilarious. I can only imagine what the live audience was thinking. The CD package comes in a lovely gatefold with terrific liner notes. and. wait for it. LYRICS! Yup. There really are lyrics to some of these blurs. I gleefully started to peruse them, but I liked my own, timeworn interpretations better, the stuff I THOUGHT they had been saying all these decades. Use them at your own peril. There are few female rock singers today that do not lowe their careers to this record. The Pretenders took punk's raucous energy & simplicity and fused it with pop sensibility & intelligent musicianship. There are few records that retain the ability to enthral over time. This one remains endlessly fascinating.

You hear this album, you think these people can do whatever they want. Punk to jump, the country is in a new wave of life. It\u2019s all there, and none of it seems to jump.

Pete Farndon\u2019s musical, melodic bass was clearly influenced by British rock in the past decade. such as Who and the Beatles. Martin Chambers drums can go from a simple four-stroke beat to a temporary move back and forth without that sound. This stone record starts counting leading up to the \u201cEssential\u201d cut.

Any time, really. Location and order always invite you to listen to \u201clots\u201d. Tattooed Love Boys \", one of the most original on-site punk \/ New Wave, has its fastest. Eight minutes (or close) will keep you from being unbalanced and at the same time irritating. The sound of a car being fleeing towards a snowy mountain with no brakes. Simple and very simple but very complex \u2018solo guitar\u201d are the guitar dreams. It\u2019s impossible to sit on a song like this. The thick space Invader teaches you everything and rare: an interesting stone tool. \"The wait\" is a pure alternative. The opening \"ker-whang\" guitar is appropriate for your page, the band has fallen, Miss Hynde has beaten once. \"A hard game. I and't miss it. Every note and the centrepiece is in a good place. Pete Farndon's pass will make John Entwistle smile. The song really stands out.\" Stop crying \"it's shocking. Kinks are so beautiful and covered in anthemic sounds by Chrissie Hynde flirting with the taste of a small country along with the pop of a typical English voice. After waiting \"Wait\", this near rest. Necessary rest. \" Kid \"continues to show their ambition, their endless power. It's a typical pop song, like\" Cry \". It still sounds fast, and still cloud, but not as bruises. It could be\" Private Life. \"Jump, but I rarely hit\" repeat \"if you know what I mean. But there's an exciting introduction to\" Brass In Pocket \", the standard with drag, hard beat, light guitar. lovers today are \u201canother little effort. Having an unfortunate position after \"Pocket\". , \u201cMystery of Achievement\u201d, a black wave with a bass hook. Very good sound, very good use of chorus. Damaging guitar strings. I can send the album! We got a second set of stuff, led by Bo-Didley-ish \"Cuban Slide\" which was great and I wanted to replace it with \"Lovers of Today.\" It\u2019s just small, but they seem to be listening to Chrissie using the Latin \u201cAy-yi-yi\u201d! \u201cThe Porcelain\u201d is another grave. But they often show that these men are ready to leave. The \u201cwait\u201d starts quickly, if you can believe that. and \"Brass\" is very slow. Don\u2019t miss the London swing swing. I don\u2019t know why I already have the Austin Powers theory. See also the mourning of the \u201cTequila\u201d nation. There are some fingerprints that will cause the speakers to grind.

Once. After a quarter of a century, your heart will always be fast and your blood pressure will rise. The same excitement you get after that will come back soon. There is no exaggeration in this nuclear partnership between the American diaspora and the three talented Britons at the send of the punk movement, resulting in a collection of twelve songs, in terms of quality, impact, vision, scope, ambition, and simplicity. rock music has not yet matched it. When you hear this album, you think these people can do whatever they want. Punk to pop, land to a new wave soul. Everything is there and it does\u2019t sound like a kind of jump. This is a very natural voice. You can see it at a glance. The album has not been produced since its first release, and now gains great diversity and clarity, but it does't sound very detailed. Its source feels real. It's too bright. I was hoping that after \"Pirate Radio\" (the most recent set), their records would first be available on a new remake; we have the first two. Double CD in place of double CD value. She has a special voice for Chrissie Hynde. Dusty Springfield is part, a roaring cat. James Honeyman-Scott's straightforward, labour-saving, and active (but still full-blown) style of play is the sound of a punk rock singer who has taken many lessons. Pete Farndon's muscular, sweet melodic bass was clearly influenced by British rock in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys. Like who and the Beatles. Martin Chambers drums can be transformed from four \/ four simple beats to this otherworldly rhythm change, and then, without much effort. The richness of this record starts at the countdown and goes into a torn \u201cPrecious\u201d. Chrissie Hynde\u2019s tremor in her chainsaw backup told us we had encountered something we had never heard of before. Now the tips with four popular letters surprised the audience (\"It's not my baby, I'm so precious. @ # $% Off!\"), Warns you to wear your seat belt at the beginning of the album. \"Phone call\", a simple back and forth chords and sweet words, entices you to listen carefully. \"What are you talking about?\" There is something. Part of a strong rhythm makes a powerful send-of-life tool. \"Up The Neck\" features softer and more beautiful music. With sharp words the came back around the choir. Many sounds and themes come from \"The Phone Call\", especially the leading guitar. After all, the album sounds more like a song. A real album and a collection of songs. More than anyone else at the time. In fact, anytime. Location and order always invite you to listen \"more\". take part. Whether you can zoom in for out in the headphones to express the lyrics of the mumbled song depends on the song. \"Tattooed Love Boys\" is one of the earliest songs in the post-punk \/ new wave scene, and its speed is the highest amphetamine metal you can never dream of. Fifteen \/ weight to'clock (or close to that limit) makes you close your balance but run forward at the same time. This is the sound of an uncontrolled truck driving an iceberg without braking. The wrap disruption in the center is high. A beautiful, simple but scary guitar \"alone\" is a dream of a wind guitar. It is impossible to sit down on this song. The heavy bass of \"Space Invader\" introduces you to something unique: an exciting musical instrument. \"Waiting\" is a pure riot. Opening the guitar songs of \"ker-whang\" delighted your years, the band roared, Miss Haynd blew. so much. We started the exciting roller coaster of the punk ride. Clean and clean play. I've never done it before. Each point and chord are in perfect order. Pete Farndon's bass work will make John Entwistle smile. The song literally ended. \"Stop crying\" was a shock. A beautiful Kinks song composed by Chrissie Hynde, with a taste of small country and British pop music. After a burning \u201cwait\u201d, it was almost soothing. Necessary testing. \"Children\" continue to show their ambitions, their infinite power. This is a traditional pop song, similar to \"Sobbing\". The voice was still strong, but not so harsh. If there is a weakness, a moody \u201cprivate life\u201d could be. It\u2019s very noisy, but after the amazing difficulty of the song, it\u2019s boring and long. More than six minutes. It has many interests. I rarely skip it, but if you know what I mean, I rarely click \"repeat\". But next is the introduction of \"Brass In Pocket\", a single song with a soft, continuous rhythm, a simple guitar and bass lines, and direct drum sounds. \"I'm special. I'm very special.\" Really, Miss Hyde. After exploring the rhythm of the original music, the clarity and beauty of the song shines through in the theme. again. The whole film. \"Today's Lover\" is another small effort. There are unfortunate places behind the \"pocket\". It\u2019s slow and lovely, which Pretenders haven\u2019t yet featured on this album. Martin Chambers' karate drums began to send, \"Mystery Success\", a black rocker with a bass hook. Big names, use of a large slope. The fire guitar broke. A call and a response between Scott's chord and Chambers' drum. What a great way to send albums! We got a second record, led by Bo-Diddley style \"Cuban Slide\", which is very good, I hope it replaces \"Lover's Lover\". Very small, but it sounds like they are very happy. Listen to Chrissie using those Latin \"Ay-yi-yi's\"! \"Porcelain\" is another grave. Adapting to changing rhythm, playing guitar. Is this closed? Many speeches are rich in content, but they show that these people are good from the start. \"Waiting\" starts immediately, if you can believe it. And \"copper\" is very slow. Don't miss the packed \"Swing London\" musical instrument. I don\u2019t know why I have opinions about Austin Powers right now. The national anthem \"tequila\" has also been examined. There are some catchy songs that can cause your speakers to burst. Then there was the \"Saber dance\" at the scene. Yeah, that's it. Thousands of songs on cartoons and commercials. Chrissie Hynde whispered in some \"crying\" lines. This is a weird way to send \"odd and sods\" discs, but it's kind of funny. I can only imagine what the audience was thinking. The CD pack has a nice folded leaf with large stripes with stripes inside. together. Wait for it. the lyrics of the song! Oh yeah. Some of this darkness has words. I was happy to start using them, but I chose my own, outdated definitions, I think they meant decades. Use them at your own risk. Few women musicians today do not diminish their career in this record. Hypocrites take the power and intensity of the punk and combine it with pop and subtle musical skills. Few records can remain interesting over time. This is still an endless interest. You will find yourself thinking almost in disbelief, \"MAN, this is a good record!\" My enthusiasm for this album has not diminished for more than twenty-five years.","overall":5,"summary":"An album that enthralls after 25 years.

{"orig_index":15768,"reviewerID":"A25AXWGBGJ5KBS","asin":"B000002KO1","reviewerName":"M J Heilbron Jr. \"Dr. Mo\"","helpful":[66,69],"reviewText":"Pretenders' debut album is one of the biggest rock albums. Always After a quarter of a century, your heart rate will increase and your blood pressure will rise. The joy you felt will return immediately. In addition to hyperbool, this warm nuclear partnership between a foreign American and three Britishmen with deep potential in the tail of the Punk Movement produced twelve songs for its quality, influence, vision, scope, ambitions and clear creativity. Has caused. The power of rock and roll is unmatched yet. You will hear this album and think that these people can do whatever they want. Punk to pop, the world a new wave for the soul. Everything is there, and no one seems to be shopping like that. It sounds completely alive. Immediately visible. The album has not been predefined since its original release, and now it has a lot of variety and clarity, yet when it comes to more detail it does't seem too harsh. It seems real from its source. it's clear. I was hoping that after \"Pirate Radio\" (the latest box set) their records would start to be available in the new updated version. When we have the first of the two. A double CD for a point price of two CDs. You have the unique sound of a chair hand. Part Dusty Springfield, part snarling cat. James Honeyman Scott's accurate, backup, active (but still good) style was the voice of a punk rocker who took many lessons. Pat Ferdinand's muscular, melodic boss was clearly influenced by sixty British rock. Like Who and the Beatles. The beat of Martin Chambers' drum can be shifted back and forth with a simple four\/four back beat as you try. This record money starts with a calculation that leads to a shiny \"precious\". Chrissie Hynde's vibration with the backup of her local buzzsaw tells us instantly that we're expecting something we've never heard of before. The now-famous four-letter admonition to the audience is startling (\"Oh, I'm so precious in my baby. That asa, it makes you listen carefully.\" The catchy rhythmic part creates a powerful metallic coda \"Up the Neck\" with soft, beautiful music. Coming back to the chorus with a cloud sound. Lots of sounds and shapes from \"The Phone Call\". Comes out, especially from the guitar lead. In fact, this album sounds like an episode, a real album against a collection of songs. More than anyone at the time. For any season, actually. The sequence always invites you to listen to \"more\" to join. One of the first songs to emerge from the post Punk \/ New View scene, featuring the fastest amphetamine-laced metal freak you can only wish for. Puts out but at the same time it \u0631\u0642\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062a\u0627 \u06c1\u06d2\u06d4 The speeding truck was coming down an icy mountain without brakes. A sudden break in between is great. Dream of a very simple but awesome 'solo' guitar wind guitar. It is not physically possible to remain motionless during this song. The thick bass of \"Space Invader\" introduces you to something extraordinary in everything: a thrilling rock device. \"Wait\" is a pure bedlam. \"Ker Wang\" guitar opens your page, the band roars, Miss Handy sighed once. Aloud. And we do an awesome ride, a fun roller coaster ride punk. Clean game. Never overdo it. All notes and fast in the perfect place. Pete Farndon's boss John Entwistle may smile. The song just stops and says \"Stop crying\" is shocking. Covering a beautiful canvas with the melodies of Chrissy Hande's anthem playing with a little bit of worldly taste and love with its English pop sound. After searching for \"The Wait\", it's almost cool. Release is required. \"The Kid\" continues to crave prominence, its power is almost limitless. A common pop song, like \"Cry\". The sound is still necessary, and still powerful, but not so destructive. Moody can be a \"private life\" if there is a weak spot. It's the atmosphere, but after the incredibly heavy songs, it's boring and a little long. It's more than six minutes. There is so much to like about it. And I rarely give up, but I rarely hit \"repeat\" if you know what I mean. However, there is a chirping introduction to \"Brass In Pocket\", a unique single with a sloping surface, a steady rhythm, a simple guitar and bass bass and straight drum beats. \"I'm special, I'm very special.\" Yes, really, Miss Hand. After testing the speed of previous iTunes, the clarity and beauty of the song shines through the context. And. \"Today's fans\" is another small effort. Being an unfortunate place after \"pocket\". It's slow and satisfying, something some hypocrites haven't found on this album yet. Martin Chambers' Fighting Drum opens with the ending, \"Mystery Success\", a black rocker with bass hook. Sounds good, a beautiful course to use. Explosion of fire. Calling and answering between Scott's fast songs and the drums of the chambers. How to send an album! We get another disk of things, led by the best Bo-Diddley-ish \"Cuban Slide\", I wish it would replace \"Lovers of Today\". It's small, but it looks like they're busy. Snow chair uses these Latin \"Ay-yi-yi's\"! \"Porcelain\" is another burial. Tempo change function, explosive guitar. And is it over? Many demos are informative, but most show that these people were ready from the beginning. \"Wait\" starts immediately, if you can't believe it. And \"brass\" moves very slowly. Don't miss the amazing \"Swinging London\" toy. I don't know why I have the Austin Powers theory right now. And discover the world of mourning \"Tequila\". There are many live tracks that can cause blisters on your speakers. This is followed by \"Sabir Dance\". Yes, they. A song of a thousand cartoons and bazaars. And Chrissy Hendy chanting \"Sobang\" lines. It's a weird way to send a \"soda problem\" disc, but it's ridiculous. I can only imagine what the live audience was thinking. The CD pack comes with a beautiful gate with great liner notes. And wait for it. Friends! Yes. Some of these obscure names actually contain alphabetical names. I began to read them happily, but I loved my, timely translations, the things I had been saying all these decades. Use them at your own risk. Today, a few female rock musicians have not diminished their work on this record. Hypocrites have taken the power of punk and simplicity and combined it with the sound of pop and clever music. There are some records that retain the potential for interest over time. It's always endless interesting. You almost think of yourself as an infidel, \"Dude, that's a good record!\" My passion for this album has not diminished for more than twenty-five years.","overall":5,"summary":"An album that enthralls after 25 years.

The past two years had been very busy for Madonna. She stared in the box office hit \"Evita\", which she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and she also gave birth to her first child, daughter Lourdes. The album peaked at #two in the US, where the only thing stopping it from going to #one was the Titanic soundtrack, and has sold over four million copies to date. Not only cd this album get some much deserved commercial success, it also got Madonna some of the best reviews of her career. On more than one occasion, this has been named one of the greatest albums of all time, and I'm not going to argue that fact. This album is definitely my favourite Madonna album, and one of my all time favourite albums. It also helped Madonna win her first Grammys. It took Madonna in an entirely new direction, which was electronica. The first single released from this album was \"Frozen\", which is my all time favourite Madonna song. The song is just amazing. It peaked at #two in the US, giving Madonna her biggest hit in years. The video for \"Frozen\" is definitely one of the best never. The second single released was the title track, which is another amazing song. Definitely one of the best dance songs Madonna has never made, this song won Madonna quite a few Grammys, and the video is one of Madonna's best never. Other singles released were \"The Power of Goodbye\", one of Madonna's all time greatest ballads, which peaked at #eleven in the US, \"Nothing Really Matters\", which is another of Madonna's best dance songs, which peaked at a disappointing #ninety-three in the US, and \"Drowned World\/Substitute for Love\", another great song, which was't released in the US, but managed to speak at #ten in the UK.one. Drowned World\/Substitute for Love (ten\/ten)two. Swim (ten\/ten)three. Ray of Light (ten\/ten)four. Candy Perfume Girl (ten\/ten)five. Skin (ten\/ten)six. Nothing Really Matters (ten\/ten)seven.

Little Star (ten\/ten)thirteen. Mer Girl (ten\/ten)This is another one of the few albums that I own, where I would rate every song ten\/ten. \"Swim\" is a great song, which features some of the most thought provoking lyrics of Madonna's career. \"Candy Perfume Girl\" is the rockies song on the album, and it's just amazing. The beat and Madonna's vocals just fit together perfectly on this one. Definitely my favourite unreleased track. \"Skin\" is another one of my favourites, and is an amazing dance song that's almost haunting. \"Sky Fits Heaven\" is another amazing song, and I just love the chorus. \"Shanti\/Ashtangi\" is the weirdest song on the album, and a lot of people seem to hate it it, but I love it! I'm not sure what language Madonna is singing in, but it's very spiritual. \"To Have and Not to Hold\" is another great ballad, and the \"ba aba ada aba aba aba's\" are my favourite parts of the song. \"Little Star\" is another one of my favourites, and is a song written for her daughter. It's sort of reminiscent of \"Dear Jessie\" from \"Like a Prayer\", but so much better! \"Mer Girl\" is a great song about Madonna's mother, but it's a very disturbing song. It makes me almost uncomfortable to listen to it. All in all, this is definitely Madonna's best album. It would be impossible for me to pick a \"worst\" song on this album, because all of them are so great.

I just think people karen't giving them a chance on this album. Overall, I was very impressed with the creativity, excellent song structures, and musicianship. The first song, they rocked & grooved in \"White Lines\" but it's going to take a while to get use to Simone LeBon's weak wrapping' voice. Even though, the scratching' was fun to listen to and the beat was heavy and pounding. The follow-up song is a song I love by Sly & the Family Stone,\"I Wanna Take You Higher.\" I loved the guitar riffs in this one, and the ending was cool when everyone is getting down. After that, Duran Duran came out with some mellower stuff, Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day,\" Elvis Costello's Watching the Detectives,\" and the classic Bob Dylan's \"Lay Lady Lay.\" To appreciate those songs, you would have to listen to it from beginning to send, and LeBon's singing was excellent. Then, they did Public Enemy's \"nine hundred and eleven is a Joke.\" This time, LeBon's wrapping' was great and funky, and I loved the beginning sound of the Mississippi Blues guitar and harmonica. After that came Iggy Pop's \"Success,\" written by David Bowie. This version was awesome and it made me realized they actually picked GREAT SONGS! for the cover cd. Although, I did't care for the Doors' \"Crystal Ship.\" It's just not that good of a song period. \"Ball of Confusion\" was unique and interesting, and I enjoyed it. The surprised part is when I heard Led Zepplin's \"Thank You.\" LeBon sounded like Robert Plant totally, but in a unique way. The atmospheric sound of the song was tremendous. The only song they wrote was \"Drive by,\" which was very creative. The song screened slowly in an intense atmospheric way again, and after it builds up, somebody breaks out in a recorder solo, which was awesome! The finishing song was another part of the first cover tune of Sly's. This time, they band just got into rocking in a soulful way and LeBon was getting down with this singing.

Surprisingly, I heard a \"thank you\" from Zeppelin. Le Bon sounds exactly like Robert Plant, but in a different way. The sound of the spirit of this song is great. The only song they wrote was \"Drive by\", which was very compelling. The song was slowly sung again in a warm atmosphere. The closing song is one of Sly's first songs. During this time, their band started rock music in a very romantic way, and LeBon became even more interested in this type of singing. As you can see, I really like this CD. I think it should be one of the best iTunes CDs. I would love to see a good band compose some Rock songs and try to make it new and beautiful. I can\u2019t write another review because it\u2019s longer than I thought, but it\u2019s worth it. Duran Duran, what I have done is justice.

Gradually the song was explored again in a very harsh atmosphere, after doing it, something came out on the solo recording, seriously! The ending song is another part of the first cover song by Sly. At this time, the group shook enthusiastically, and LeBonna dropped this song. As you can see, I liked this CD. I think it should be one of the biggest iTunes cd covers around. I can see a great band that performs some of the Rock songs and try to make it new and bigger. Maybe I won't write another review because it took longer than I thought, but it's worth it.

It's a CD that usually looks like it's being sent, there's no clear space anywhere, it's like a long, flexible song. Favorite? Full CD Well, if I had chosen a few songs it would have been \"Wrong Angel\". The last song of a bad boy, and maybe \"Sweet Jane\". When I'm in \"this mode\" I reach for this CD, and it stays with my CDs of Emilio Harris and Neil Young.","overall":5,"summary":"It just gets better...","unixReviewTime":1197936000,"reviewTime":"12 18, 2007"}

I met CJ through \u201cPale Sun Crescent Moon\u201d, which is very dynamic and simply put, cloud. Well, times have changed! There\u2019s an honesty where you\u2019re missing out on music right now. While much of the music world has embraced the sound of the official Grammy Awards (you know, the excitement of many Midi-fied voices about the mathematical arrangement of lower souls), \u201cTrinity\u201d stands out as well , very real . Someone wrote earlier that this seems \u201cinaccurate\u201d - well, rya needs to know the truth to appreciate it! The \u201ctrinity\u201d is very small, surprising, ethereal, and of course emotional - but not simply boring. There are mixed notes and vibrations that become increasingly interesting to every year. It\u2019s a CD that\u2019s like listening to a send to send, there\u2019s no clear break anywhere, it\u2019s like a long song. Favorites? The whole CD. Well, wok, if I had to pick a few songs, it would be \u201cMisguided Angel\u201d - wow. the last song of the bad boy, and probably \"Sweet Jane\".

In the middle of the song, it will tell about Thanksgiving, and what the thinks should be celebrated. It\u2019s great to hear about the knowledge in mind for shipwreck artists like Ras Kass. Unfortunately the flow rate is not everything the audience is looking for in an album. The production also plays a part, this album, Horrible (he did and a guy named Battle Cat). So, some of them are black and white beats with heavy drums like the song \"On Earth As Is.\" But don\u2019t be confused with the \u201cEverything Goes\u201d style of \u201cOrder Out Of Chaos\u201d, even the great songs in terms of rhythm.

The paragraphs are great, but the beat has a little sweet sound (I mean unusual). The song \u201cMiami Life\u201d seems compelling and does\u2019t fit everyone.

I want to say what I said in the review of Rasassination, I\u2019m a fan of Ras Kass\u2019s work, but I want to give my honest opinion on the album. Ras Kass somehow used the habit of beating beats below the expectations of some fans. As an independent artist myself, I understand that getting a quality product is not the easiest thing to do. Unfortunately what prevents it from being a five-star album. Also a single song (in this case Dangerous Behavior) is not required to make the album five stars, understand also. Ras Kass, from Carson Ca., enters \u201cSoul On Ice\u201d for the first time as the gangster\u2019s shooting slows down and the ship\u2019s shop changes. A great highlight of the door is the song \u201cNature of Threat\u201d where the saliva weighs almost a few minutes heavier than the myths (or facts) of religious history, which seems convincing to professional historians. Will check their books for facts. The song \u201cMiami Life\u201d seems compelling and does\u2019t fit everyone.

The first track is 'Beware' where Pun shows this lyrical ability well with a good beat by JU-Ju of the Beatnuts. Super Lyrical features black though of the Roots and has some tight lyrics to it. 'Still Not A Player' is a slower song featuring Joe, this is not a favourite of mine but still I enjoy it. The Dream Shatterer is a dope track and has some dope lyrics by Pun. 'Punish Me features Miss Jones and is my least favourite on the album. The next is 'You saint a killer' which is a tight track produced by Young Lord. Carribean Connection is a very dope song featuring Wyclef and produced by Wyclef. Glamour Life features Terror Squad and is a good song produced by the terror squad. Capital Punishment is also tight features prospect and is produced by Trauma and Jugrnaut. I'm not a Player is a good track with some tight lyrics and beats. Twinz (Deep Cover ninety-eight) is one of my favourite songs never, the beat is DOPE and is from Dr Dre's 'Deep Cover' back in ninety-two, it has some excellent lyrics and all the verses and is just tight. Boomerang is a tight track with dope lyrics. You came Up is a tight track featuring Noreaga produced by Rockwilder.

This set spans the entire career of Rush, focusing mostly on the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four-one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one releases, and then the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety releases after Presto. Rush was very generous with this three-disk set, and with over three.five hours of music, there's a lot of bang for your buck. I agree with other reviewers that the sound is good, but not great. Still, the instruments come through very clearly, especially Geddy Lee's bass and Neil Peart's drums. Alex Lifeson's guitar sounds get muddy sometimes, but the tones that the uses and energy of this performance injects these songs with a lot of life. His playing breathes emotion into these performances, whereas Lee and Peart are more the technical rhythm players. It's a good balance. Geddy Lee's vocals sound better on the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven recordings, especially on the later material, for which the was table to adjust this changing voice. He still hits the notes in Analog Kid, but Freewill and Spirit of Radio have taken some adjustment. On the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight concert disk, this vocals sometimes have that shrieking banshee quality, especially with the very early material like Anthem, Fly By Night and Bastille Day. Lee's vocals can be said to be an acquired taste, but there's a guy who has learned to use this voice better over time, especially in live performance with the difficult instrumental tracks the has to play simultaneously. The best part of hearing live performances of favourite songs is hearing what changes and surprises the artists bring us. In set one, there's the short bass solo by Lee during Driven. Very cool. I also like the jam at the send of Closer to the Heart. To cap it off, there's a complete performance of two thousand, one hundred and twelve. Set two includes many of the usual hit tracks, like Test for Echo, Tom Sawyer and Freewill. There's also a great cut of the instrumental Leave that Thing Alone, followed by an update of Peart's drum showcase, The Rhythm Method. I also liked the version of Natural Science even better than the studio version on Permanent Waves. YYZ rocks and has a teaser of Cygnus X-one. Set three is the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight show from London. I really liked how By-Tor and the Snow Dog emerges into Xanadu at the chimes part. Very well done. There are a lot of cuts from Farewell to Kings, and Lifeson does some cool chorus washed guitar on Cinderalla Man. Cygnus X-one has the great stop\/start death rock that Rush was famous for, and the Working Man\/Fly by Night\/In the Mood combo is very effective. My one critique with this disk is that Peart's drums were sometimes too busy, stepping on the other musicians, something that is more tempered on the later cuts. Great jams from one of the greatest jam bands never. Highly recommended as a first live disk for fans. Then get Exit.

The second group includes several popular songs such as Echo Test, Tom Sawyer and Freewill. There's also an amazing editing of the \"Leaving That Thing\" piece, followed by an update on Peart's Drum Rhythm show. I also prefer the Natural Sciences version, even if it is better than the standard Wave studio version. YYZ Rock, and there is a Cygnus X-one trailer.

Ninth album \"Calciumization\" is often considered one of this best efforts, often second only to \"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\". And that being said, \"California\" is good for both peppers and fans who want to send their RHCP collection. What I like most about this album is the sweet feeling in it. I remember finishing my finals in early June, getting home at ten:thirty in the morning. The second time I heard the song \"Around the World\", I felt like it was time for my summer song to come back! The whole album is very powerful and well-organized, and it shows how far the band's boys have come. The fifteen songs that make up \"California\" all flow smoothly and maintain the level of energy, attitude and high morale that we know about child peppers. The songs include funk, some rock, exploration rock, and sometimes even softness and heavy metal. Some of the album's highlights are included in \"World Wide\": a powerful introduction with a roaring bass line and noisy guitar lines. The verses are so cute, Anthony goes with these rock-wrapped styles, and the chorus is so cute and sweet, it sets the stone for the whole song. \"Parallel Universe\": A basic but fast song with a new guitar \/ punk line and cloud vocals sung with Anthony's signature voice. A great course that builds with great energy. \"Scar Tissue\": A soft, fun song with a jazzy rhythm section and a special function of large, blaze guitar lines. Anthony's lyrics and voice are all included in the song, and it's one of the best RHCP songs never! \"Emmet Reims\": Irritability, low-key bass line and slow-moving space on this song, which is apparently written about Anthony's relationship with Space Girls' chicken, for more information on this \"Life Scar Tissue\" article. Read on However, the guitar is very lucky in this course, in a good way, and the songs at the top of the game are weird and poetic, like the rest of the album. \"I Love Dirt\": Short, entertaining and one-and-a-half minute jam in B-mode, with beautiful double extender words and solo guitar. And the song is fun as always. Of all the other songs associated with them, \"California\" is one of the most powerful albums of the last decade, and it ended with a big bang in the ninety's. As an RHCP follower, I wholeheartedly recommend getting it as soon as possible, taking a nice, long trip along the main road near the forest area that is far from building your home. No, blow it up and feel its magic. It worked for me, as much as I love this album, and I know you will too.

That being said, \"Caliphornication\" is perfect for both beginners going to Peppers and fans who want to complete their RHCP collection. What I really like about this album is its summer feel. I remember finishing my decision in early June, returning home at ten:thirty am. When I heard the song \"Worldwide\", I realized it was time to go back to my summer song! The whole disc is very powerful and well put together, showing how the team members went. The fifteen songs that make up \u201cCaliphornication\u201d all go well and maintain the energy, spirit and high spirits of the child band we already know. These songs combine funk, other rock, test rock, and occasional melancholy with heavy metal. Some of the highlights of this album include: \"Worldwide\": A powerful introduction includes rhythmic bus lines and other mental guitar lines. Very sweet words, Anthony embraced this around stone style, the beautiful choir song, and laid the foundation for every song. \"Parallel Universe\": A basic but fast song with new guitar \/ punk lines and vocal lyrics sung in Anthony's signature voice. A large chorus full of power. \"Scar Tissue\": a soft folk music song with elements of jazz rhythms and beautiful lines of green guitar. Anthony\u2019s lyrics and voice add color to the song. All in all, this is one of the best RHCP songs. It never happened! \"Emit Remmus\": This song is full of strong, low bass lines and slow bass. This is clear about Anthony\u2019s relationship. Read this autobiography report \"Scar Tissue\" with hot girl chick for more information. In any case, the guitar in the choir is dirty, decent, and strange and poetic, like the rest of the album. - Half a minute of jam in a B minor with sweet notes of spun and a cool single guitar. \"Trippin's Way\": A cool original song that ended the album, and Anthony's songs and singing are just as good as never. In addition to these songs, \"Californication\" was one of the most powerful albums of the last decade and ended in the ninetys with a bang. As a follower of RHCP, I sincerely recommend that you get it right away, take a long and fun cruise along the highway near the jungle area near your home, blow it, and feel like its magic has worked. .

After researching him a bit, I found that this is one of this three most highly-recommended seventy's albums, sandwiched in between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two'sOccasional Rainand one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five'sI Just Can't Help Myself. Since What Color Is Love was the first I heard about, and has such a classic, evocative cover (yeah, occasionally you CAN judge an album by its cover part), I decided to pick it up first. What a great purchase--I can confidently recommend this album to fans of jazzier folk, more \"out-there\" folk that is influenced by more wide ranging musical styles than just American roots and blues, as well as more adventurous fans of R&B; legends like Marvin Gaye and Al Green who don't mind if their soul is cut with a bit of folk and jazz. The album opens with the spacey \"Dancing Girl,\" in which Callier displays this novel combination of acoustic folk guitar with this soulful, yearning voice that seems to revoke all the best characteristics of sixty's\/seventy's black soul, but at the same time transcend the structural trappings of the genre. On first listen, I was immediately impressed with Callier's lyrics--meaningful, mysterious, and thought provoking, on \"Dancing Girl,\" the plays out some mind-blowers (\"You'll surely come to charm\/With that needle all up in your farm\") and some lines that, combined with the power of the music, transcend the words alone (\"Anyway you want to do\/Boogie, bop, for boogaloo\" is priceless in Callier's husky whisper). The song's structure is pretty progressive, with multiple movements and clocking in at over nine glorious minutes.\"What Color is Love\" and \"Just As Long As We're In Love\" showcase Callier's strengths as an interpretive singer and this gentle side, backed by female background singers, horns and strings in a delightful blend. \"You Goin' To Miss Your Candyman\" is one of the album's greatest tracks, with the funkiest soul bassline since Marvin Gaye's \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),\" and showcasing Callier's uniformly tight, gnarly rhythm section, which often includes some sick bass lines and bongo drums. \"Ho Tsing Mee\" is a contemplative protest song, deceptively gentle at the beginning, building to a barnstorming climax with Callier's plaintive scat\/howl elevating the song to great heights. \"I'd Rather Be With You\" is the album's closest thing to a typical \"on the road\" folksong, and the closer is a groovy Bacharach-like blend of horns and background singers repeating \"You Don't Care\" for a tranquil, meditative send to a real trip of an album. Terry Callier is one of the greatest relatively unknown artists I've discovered lately, and I can't help but recommend him as highly as I can. I'm looking forward to checking out this other classics, and maybe some of this newer music, which I heard is also excellent. Take a chance--I think you'll find Callier rewarding.","overall":5,"summary":"Folk-soul-R&B-jazz masterpiece, sadly unheard-of in USA","unixReviewTime":1179446400,"reviewTime":"05 18, 2007"}

It has been the most fashionable never since Marvin Gaye's \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Want Holler)\" and has shown that Callier remains a strong, rough part of the rhythm, often consisting of pathological bass lines and bongo drums. \"Ho Tsing Mee\" is a contemplative protest song that seems soft at first. \"I'd Like to Be With You\" is the closest thing to a regular song \"on the way\" to this album, and next to a Bacharach-songwriter and rear-chanted singer who cares for \"care\", Meditation sends a real travel album.

As you know, this album was the first full-length recording of Rod Stewart. The group was a supergroup; guitarist Jeff Beck, vocalist Rod Stewart, bassist Ron Wood,Keyboardist Nicky Hopkins and drummer Micky Waller(who later played on some of Rod's best solo albums). For this release,EMI gives you all the expected bonus tracks and then some. You get previously unreleased outtake versions of \"Blues DeLuxe\" & \"You Shook Me\"(both remixed from the original multitracks), the original UK mono single version of \"Beck's Bolero\"(yes, as we're aware, there's no stereo mix of this track, which was recorded in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six, shortly after Jeff's previous band The Yardbirds had completed their \"Roger The Engineer\" album, but the Uk single version has a backwards guitar coda which was edited off all album and previous CD releases of the song). Incidentally,\"Beck's Bolero\" was recorded with Keith Moon,John Paul Jones,Jimmy Page & Nicky Hopkins. Also, you get first-time-in stereo two thousand and five remixes of \"I've Been Drinking\",\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\" & \"Rock My Plimsoul\"(the first version; the single take with Aynsley Dunbar on drums). The new remix of \"I've Been Drinking\" corrects a problem present on the original mono mix which caused a rejected, alternate lyric Rod Stewart vocal to leak through in the part of the song after the guitar solo. The unwanted vocal has now been ninety-five% squelched. The stereo remix of \"Rock My Plimsoul\" is fine and musically identical to the mono single, however, it should be cautioned that due to some live-during-mono mixdown guitar & vocal overdubs on the original mono single mix of \"Hi Ho Silver Lining\", that the new stereo remix is missing one of the three lead guitar parts during the guitar solo, and the high vocal harmonies are missing during the song's choruses. The disc also includes the original mono single mixes of \"Tallyman\" & \"Love is Blue\". My guess is that either EMI could't find the multitracks for those two selections, for they did find them, but found a station similar to the situation on \"Hi Ho Silver Lining\"; that musically identical(to the original single) stereo mixes were't possible. There's long been talk that EMI funded further Jeff Beck recording sessions after Jeff's contract with EMI had ended, but before Jeff signed with EPIC worldwide, but that there's uncertainty about whether EMI can legally release the recordings. When Jeff's manager has enquired about the recordings,EMI's Abbey Road Studios tape vault has denied holding them, though compilers who have done projects for EMI have said otherwise. I hope that someday that ownership issue will be resolved. Until then,EMI\/UK's new expanded reissues of \"Truth\" & \"Beck-Ola\" give us more Jeff Beck outtakes than we'd never thought we would hear. Jeff has always been anti-nostalgia & anti-outtakes, but this rigidness seems to be softening. He's even cooperated and been interviewed for the (fine) liner notes which accompany both discs.

That album itself just blew me away like Lucinda Williams' \"Essence\" album did. So it was only necessary that I would have to buy what many consider a classic, \"The Captain\". Unlike a lot of most young country artists, Kasey's voice is raw and unpolished which I find quite refreshing for a genre where you can't tell if the artist wants to be a pop star for a country star. Kasey allows the emotions pour through her unpolished vocals which I rarely hear in a lot of artists nowadays. The moment I popped in \"The Captain\", I was immediately enthralled. \"The Captain\" is just as good as \"Barricades & Brickwalls\". Is it any better? Hmmm. I can't decide. Both are so good I can't say which is better. I love both albums as they are therefore I can't choose a favourite. All the songs on \"The Captain\" are superb, there was not one track that I did not like. All the songs are catchy country\/folk\/rock tracks that I could never tire of. I understand what made Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, and Dwight Yoakam fall in love with Kasey Chambers. Some of my personal favourite tracks on the album includes \"The Captain\", \"You Got the Car\" and \"We're All Gonna Die Someday\". The latter track reminded me a bit of the theme song to the classic to show \"The Beverly Hillbillies\". I could almost swear that is where Kasey got the hooks from. The lyrics are simply hilarious yet honest and catchy as hell. I became a Kasey Chambers fan with \"Barricades & Brickwalls\" but it was't until \"The Captain\" did I became a Kasey Chambers enthusiast.

Kasey allows emotions to be poured out with this consistent singing, which I rarely hear among many artists now. As soon as I suddenly appeared in \"Captain\", I quickly became interested. \"Captain\" is right \"as a barrier and a brick wall\". Is there a better one? Um. I can't finish. Both are good, I can't say which is better. I love these two albums, so I can't pick my favourite one. All the songs of \"Captain\" are beautiful, not one song I do not like. All the songs have a country charm \/ people \/ songs that I will never get tired of. I understand why Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle and Dwight Yoakam fell in love with Kasey Chambers. Some of my favourite songs on the album include \"The Boss\", \"You Have A Car\" and \"We Will All Die One Day\". This last song reminded me of a classic theme song show \"Beverly Hillbillies\". I can almost swear that\u2019s where Kasey found the link. The songs are funny but honest and lovely. I became a fan of Kasey Chambers with \"Barricades & Brickwalls\", but I did not become a fan of Kasey Chambers until the was a \"Manager\". The plate itself is a real world.","overall":5,"summary":"A diamond in the rough","unixReviewTime":1018483200,"reviewTime":"04 11, 2002"}

The album itself blew me away, as did Lucinda Williams' album \"Essence.\" So I just had to buy what most people think is a classic, \"Captain.\" Unlike many young artists around the world, Casey's voice is green and not polished which gives me a lot of freshness in a way where you can't say that the artist wants to be a world star pop star. Casey allows emotions to flow with this non-Polish words, which are rarely heard by many artists today. I was just excited when I entered \"Captain\". \"Captain\" is as good as \"metal and bricks\". Is it better Hmmm. I can't decide Both are great. I can't say the best. I like both albums as they are so I can't choose a favourite. All the songs in \"The Captain\" are great, there's no song I don't like. All the songs are charming tracks of the world \/ people \/ rocks that I never get tired of. I wonder why Lucinda Williams, Steve Earl, and Dwight Yuwakum fell in love with Casey Chambers. My favourite songs from the album include \"Captain\", \"You Have a Car\" and \"We'll All Die One Day\".

Until Tommy was ready to come back, Dennis went in the studio in the spring of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four to record this first solo album producing, playing keyboards, singing and writing all of the tracks (except as noted). Helping Dennis was guitarist Tom Dziallo (who is still Dennis' guitarist in this solo band), drummer Tom Radtke and sax-man Steve Eisen (who appeared on the final three Styx albums of the classic lineup). I was first exposed to the album thanks to (partially being a Styx fan by this point at page weight) and also the title cut's exposure on MTV and I got the forty-five with Desert Moon and Gravity. A week later, I got the album on cassette tape in December, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four and managed to wear this album out. For years tried to replace but only could get cassettes and then A&M; Records are-released the album with remastered sound in two thousand and one on CD and what an album. We open with the rocker \"Don't Wait For Heroes\" which is inspirational and fun and the second single from the album. The video for this said what the lyrics stated the real winners \"are losers who get up and give it one more try\" and a message that rings true to those who had to overcome being told no. Next is another up-tempo rocker in \"Please\" which features Rosemary Butler (famed for her duet vocal on Jackson Browne's \"Stay\" on this Running on Empty album in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven and her work with Linda Ronstadt) duetting with Dennis and the song rocks. Next is the heights New Wave rock style meets fifty style singing Broadway number \"Boys Will Be Boys\" which is a fun and uplifting number and a guilty pleasure of mine. The first side ends with \"Fire\" which is a bluesy remake of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven Jimi Hendrix original (and yes, it does indeed hold its own) and Tommy Dziallo did the bluesy arrangement of this track. The second side starts with Desert Moon's title track which reached #ten on the Billboard singles chart which speaks of the things one lost from childhood and gained from adulthood though memories from the past don't leave. Next is \"Suspicious\" which is a nice mid-tempo number and features great guitar work from Dziallo and a superb synthesizer solo at the send from DeYoung. Next is \"Gravity\" which is another great rocker and an awesome song. We close the album with the ballad \"Dear Darling (I'll Be There)\". Desert Moon was Dennis' first, and to date only, successful project outside of Styx.

For those who want Dennis DeYoung to work solo outside of Styx, check out this album and The Next Hundred Years Now (which is the best since this album).

I mean, those are some of the great RHCP songs!!! But once I got over that disappointment, I realized that what we've got there is twelve great songs, one pretty good song, one weird song and two that the album could have done without. I WOULD DIE FOR YOU and MIDNIGHT are the two I always skip. Just a bit unimaginative a monotonous. The weird one is WARM TAPE. Sometimes I hear it and it sounds cheesy, and other times it's almost sexy. Certainly the lyric \"Shiver for me girl\" is a good one! I can't describe the song though. You've got to hear it for yourself. The pretty good song is THE ZEPHYR SONG, which is getting a lot of airplay. It's okay, kinda breezy, but just does't revoke any strong feelings. The rest of the album is absolutely top notch. These guys can really write the itunes now. CALIFORNICATION (which is brilliant too) served as a kind of bridge from their rougher, earlier stuff to these textured, complex melodies. The hit single BY THE WAY, which kicks off the album is INSTANTLY, INSTANTLY, INSTANTLY catchy. I was ready to using along halfway through the song on the first listen. Other standouts include the driving CAN'T STOP, the delightful UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING and the latin-flavored CABRON. Lyrically, the songs are often difficult to grasp. Don't look for linear meaning. They revoke moods, feelings and random images. But Anthony Kiedis sings with real feeling, and the musicianship is first rate all the way through. They all do their best work as musicians and songwriters, never. Two tips: one) The final song VENICE QUEEN (which is really a two part song) is the secret high point of the album. It builds with a gorgeous, quiet riff and grows in power. It could almost have been on Californication, with its West-Coast centric imagery, but I find it a bracing conclusion to this album. two) Listen to the album with headphones. there is SO much subtlety that you easily miss otherwise, especially some of the grace notes and such that guitarist John Frusciante throws in.

I purchased it when it initially came out and liked it a lot, but it's one of those CD's that gets better with each listen so I wanted to let those people who love pop in it's purest form to give this a try. Daniel Bedingfield has put together a great collection of songs (a little of everything) and it all works so well that the singles keep coming at the listener and they could all be potential singles. The problem with Daniel is that the is difficult to market as this songs are pure pop music that will please both the TRL crowd and older listeners who tend to have a bias against what they may incorrectly perceive a kiddie-pop. But no review of this release can be comprehensive if it does not address the warmth of Bedingfield's voice. Without the histrionics of some of this counterparts, the does manage to leave a strong impression by feeling, not just hitting (or doing vocal gymnastics) the highs and flows. I particularly like the flow of the release and was surprised that it was self-produced. What I find astonishing is that one can clearly see the influence of US pop and R&B; music on this release, but instead of being a knock-off, Bedingfield seems to surpass all this influences. Among my favourites:Gotta Get Thru ThisIf You're Not the OneI Can't Read YouFridayJames Dean (I Wanna Know)GirlfriendHonest QuestionI think that you get the point. I love all (expect selection five) songs and one less than stellar song stills merits a five.

The \"First Time Ever I\" heard Johnny Cash sang a movie track, I was shocked by the non-metered poetry. My father said \"Johnny Cash is known to tell a story rather than using in rhyme.\" Years later through Classical music I learned that one was allowed to do such a thing. The \"First Time Ever I\" never bought a Johnny Cash CD was \"Johnny Cash's Greatest Hits Volume I\" because I collect music to match with my slide shows & don't play this type of CDs for normal listening pleasure. The \"First Time Ever I\" heard Johnny Cash sang \"Hurt\" was at work a few years ago. All day long my business environment is a battle ground between Rap & Mex-Tex. All of a sudden a deep worn out voice sang about spiritual depravity & hope that I was blown away. \"Who is singing?\" I asked a fellow worker who also does't listen to Rap for Mex-Tex. \"That's Johnny Cash singing a song by Nine Inch Nails\" came the reply. That sure makes a strange combo. The \"First Time Ever I\" saw Johnny Cash using \"Hurt\" as a music video was in between two PBS shows on TV. Normally PBS always shows this station break about southern California during the top of the hour because they have so few commercials. Why this one day PBS played a music video during that time I have no idea, but I was hooked. I had to get Johnny Cash's last CD \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" with the DVD short \"Hurt\". The references to a \"You can't take it with you\" type of philosophy with the death of this wife & Jesus on the across was most moving. The \"First Time Ever I\" heard Johnny Cash using \"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" was on this CD & was pleasantly surprised on how well it could be sang from a male perspective. When the song came out in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's by Roberta Flack, the radio stations over played it & I was into progressive rock. The song did't move me as it does now. Years later the song was one of the few I liked from my wife's CD \"Celine Dion - All the Way. A Decade of Song\". Therefore \"Hurt\" & \"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" made me see Johnny Cash as an understated musical genius because the can be so successful at experimentation. The rest of the CD \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" has its ups & downs, but this review is written from a person that normally does't listen to Country music. The highlights are \"The Man Comes Around\" which is Country but though Johnny Cash's skill & spiritual background reveals the last days with a tang. Paul Simon's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" is done with a deep heart felt passion that makes for a welcome addition. John Lennon \/ Paul McCartney's \"In My Life\" is very upfront & clear which showcases Johnny Cash's timber. Ross Parker \/ Hugh Charles's jazzy \"We'll Meet Again\" makes for a great ending that one wonders if Johnny Cash could have made it as a Jazz singer. There are some songs that may hold a surprise like Martin Gore's \"Personal Jesus\" that Johnny Cash twists around to the positive & Sting's \"I Hung My Head\" which sounds very Country. The balance of the CD has some Country classics that are done with great skill while others repeat the same words for rhythm. If you are not a Country music fan but have respect for an American icon that takes chances, this CD will not let you down. Because I liked this CD DVD combination so well, I am going to check out a few other of Johnny Cash`s \"American\" series.

My father said, \"It is well known that Johnny Cash tells stories rather than reciting rituals.\" Years later, I learned about classical music and how people can do such things. \"I never bought a Johnny Cash CD for the first time in history.\" It's Johnny Cash's Greatest Hits Volume I \"because I collect music to match my slide show and don't play such CDs for fun listening. A few years ago,\" I first heard Johnny Cash using \"Pain\" at work. My place of business is a battlefield between Rap and Mex-Tex all day. Suddenly, a deep, tired voice sang a song about mental breakdown, in the hope that I would be blown away. \"Who's singing?\" I asked a colleague who had never listened to a Mex-Tex wrap. \"That's Johnny Cash singing the song In Nine Inch Nails\". That must be a strange combination. \"For the first time in my life\" I saw Johnny Cash using \"Pain\" as a music video between two PBS shows on TV. Normally PBS always shows this radio break about Southern California per hour because it has very few commercials. Why this one day PBS played a music video at a time I don\u2019t know, but I was curious. I should get the latest CD \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" by Johnny Cash and the short DVD \"Hurt\". The mention of \"you can not\" remove the kind of philosophy and the death of this woman and Jesus in contrast are the most touching. \"For the first time\" I hear Johnny Cash use \"I saw your face for the first time\" on this CD, and I was very surprised to find that the sang so well from a men's point of view. When Roberta Flack's song was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, radio stations played a lot, and I was very busy with savant-garde rock. This song did not touch me as much as it does now. Years later, this song is one of my favourite songs on my wife's CD \"Celine Dion-Along the Way. Ten years of songs\". So, \"It Hurts\" and \"I Saw Your Face for the First Time\" made me think of Johnny Cash as a low-key music genius because the was so successful in trials. The remaining CD \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" has its ups and downs, but this review has been written by a stranger listening to country music. The highlight is \"The Man Comes Around\", which is a country, but Johnny Cash's skills and spiritual background reveal the last days. Paul Simon's \"Overpowered Water Bridge\", completed with great enthusiasm, is a welcome addition. John Lennon \/ Paul McCartney's \"In My Life\" is straightforward and clear, showing Johnny Cash's stickiness. Rose Parker \/ Hugh Charles' jazz song \"We Will Meet Again\" has created a good ending that makes people wonder if Johnny Cash could be a jazz musician. Some songs may shock people, such as Johnny Cash\u2019s non-fiction description like the good song \u201cPersonal Jesus\u201d and Sting\u2019s \u201cI Hung My Head\u201d, which sounds very Rustic. The CD balance consists of certain country classics, performed with great skill, while others repeat the same words in rhythm. If you are not a fan of country music, but you respect an American idol that is brave enough to take risks, this CD will not disappoint you. Because I really like the DVD compilation, I will be watching some of the \"American\" series by Johnny Cash.

This definitely makes for an unusual scroll. \"The first time I saw Johnny Cash use\" Hurt \"because the music video was between two PBS shows on TV. PBS usually shows this station a break during the first hour, almost in Southern California, because it has very few commercials. One day I did't know why PBS played a music video at a time, but I cleaned over it. I had to get Johnny Cash's last CD, \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" with a short DVD \"Heart\". With the death of this woman and Jesus on the other hand, the philosophical implications of \"can't go with you\" touched your heart. \"First Time Ever Eye\" heard Johnny Cash using \"First Time Ever So Your Face\" on this CD and wondered how it could be sung so well from a masculine point of view. When Roberta Flack's song One Thousand, One Hundred and Seventy Hundred came, the radio stations were playing it and I was on the roll. The song did't move me as much as it does now. Years later, the song was one of the few that I liked on my wife's album, \"Celine Dion - All the Way. A Decade of Song.\" So \"Heart\" and \"The First Time I Saw Your Face\" made me see Johnny Cash as a less important music artist because the could be very successful in testing. Every other CD \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" has its ups and downs, but this review is written for someone who does't usually listen to country music. Highlights of \"The Man's Less Around\" which is the country but although Johnny Cash's talent and soulful background shows the last days with a strain. Paul Simon's \"Troubled Water Bridge\" is built with a deep heart that feels like an acceptable addition. John Lennon \/ Paul McCartney's song \"In My Life\" is a very popular and vivid show featuring Johnny Cash Logs. Ross Parker \/ Hugh Charles' jazz \"We'll See You Again\" came to a good conclusion, wondering if Johnny Cash could do it as a jazz musician. There are some songs that may surprise you like Martin Gore's \"Personal Jesus\" Johnny Cash which is positive and close to the sting \"I Hung my Head\" which is very popular in the world. CD Balance features some of the oldest handicrafts, while others repeat words with the same rhythm. If you are not a fan of country music but you respect an American star who takes a chance, this CD will not disappoint you.

In two thousand and three, Mariah Carey had released her thirteenth album entitled, \"The Remixes\", a double-disc album that features many of Mariah Carey's greatest songs, all remixed. Some of the songs were remixed by studio equipment. Others were remixed by Mariah are-recording the songs with different music and lyrics. This remix album is absolutely amazing in every way. Disc One: Studio Produced Dance Club RemixesMY ALL (Morales \"My\" Club Mix)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). The original version of \"My All\", which can be found on Mariah Carey's \"Butterfly\" album, is a beautiful ballad, that is composed with a beautiful Spanish sound. Who knew that a beautiful ballad that requires slow-dancing, can be remixed into a version where you can get your groove on?(Medley) HEARTBREAKER\/IF YOU SHOULD EVER BE LONELY (Junior's \"Heartbreaker\" Club Mix)Original version of \"Heartbreaker\" from the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). New song. Mariah had remixed the music of Heartbreaker and remixed her vocals, all by studio equipment. But also extended the song, in order for her to record, \"If You Should Ever Be Lonely (Deep In The Night)\", making this remix of \"Heartbreaker\" a medley, instead of only being a remix. So, it is a remix medley. This is an incredible remix medley. FLY AWAY (BUTTERFLY REPRISE) (Fly Away Club Mix)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). Incredible dance remix. ANYTIME YOU NEED A FRIEND (C&C; Club Version)Original version from the album Music Box (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three). Although, this remix is great to dance to, I prefer the ballad version. FANTASY (Def Club Mix)Original version from the album Daydream (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five). Not bad. HONEY (Classic Mix)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). Not bad. DREAMLOVER (Def Club Mix)Original version from the album Music Box (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three). I prefer this dance remix over the original version. EMOTIONS (twelve\" Club Mix)Original version from the album Emotions (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one). This is much better than the original version. THROUGH THE RAIN (HQtwo Radio Edit)Original version from the album Charmbracelet (two thousand and two). Both the original version, which was recorded as a ballad, and this incredible dance version are unbelievable. Disc Two: Re-Recorded RemixesFANTASY (Remix) (featuring O. D. B.)Original version from the album Daydream (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five). Remix from the album #one's (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight). The music to the song was remixed a bit, Mariah's vocals are untouched, except for the choruses. The original choruses are taken out and are replaced by the bridge of the song. Ol' Dirty Bastard hit the studio to provide this dieting vocals to the song. An incredible remix. ALWAYS BE MY BABY (Mr. Dupri Mix) (featuring Da Brat & Xscape)Original version from the album Daydream (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five). The music was completely remixed and Mariah's vocals are untouched. Da Brat & Xscape had hit the studio to provide their dieting craps to the song. Great remix.(Medley) MY ALL\/STAY AWHILE (So So Def Remix) (featuring Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz)Original version of \"My All\" from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). This medley was treated the same way as \"(Medley) Heartbreaker\/If You Should Ever Be Lonely\", only Mariah brought in Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz to provide craps for the song. Hate it. THANK GOD I FOUND YOU (Make It Last Remix) (featuring Joe & Naz)Original version from the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). The original version of \"Thank God I Found You\" was composed as a ballad, where Mariah Carey had ninety-eight Degrees & Joe on that version. That version is the one I prefer. The music to the song was remixed, where Mariah Carey are-recorded the verses with Joe, and Nas. Hate it. BREAKDOWN (featuring Krazyzie Bone & Wishbone of Bone Thugs 'N Harmony)From the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). I don't why she included this song because it is not a remix. I hate this song. HONEY (So So Def Mix) (featuring Da Brat & JD)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). Not a bad remix. LOVERBOY (Remix) (featuring Ludacris, Shawnna, Da Brat, & Twenty II)From the album Glitter (two thousand and one). Both the album version & this remix are featured on Mariah's album, \"Glittler\". The album version is a duet with Cameo. This remix is no different from the original version. The music is untouched, Mariah's vocals are untouched. The song is just extended in order for Ludacris, Shawnna, Da Brat, & Twenty II to provide their craps. Cameo's verse has been taken out. Great remix. HEARTBREAKER (Remix) (featuring Da Brat & Missy Elliott)From the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). Both the original version & this remix are featured on Mariah's album entitled, \"Rainbow\". The original version is a duet with Jay-Z. This remix is very different from the original version. The music to the original took up a Pop\/Rap sound. The music to this remix is strictly a Rap sound. Mariah Carey did are-record the first two verses. She kept the original lyrics to the first verse and sang them in the same key as the original, but she sang it a little more sexier. But the second verse was changed, with different lyrics, where Mariah sang it in a different key. The choruses are kept the same. Da Brat & Missy Elliott provide their own craps. Great remix. SWEETHEART (featuring JD)From the album #one's (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight). Don't believe what you read. The album version is the version you see there: a duet with JD. There is no remix, as far as I'm concerned. Not bad. CRYBABY (featuring Snoop Dogg)From the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). Don't believe what you read. The album version is the version you see there: a duet with Snoop Dogg. There is no remix, as far as I'm concerned. Hate it. MISS YOU (featuring Jadakiss)Previously unreleased. This song is not a remix. This song was included on the UK release of Mariah's album, \"Charmbracelet\". Most fans liked the song, but could not get it on the U. S. release of \"Charmbracelet\", for any of Mariah's single releases. So, she included it there. THE ONE (So So Def Mix) (featuring Bonecrusher)Previously unreleased. Hate it. I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT (featuring Busta Rhymes & The Flipmode Squad)From Busta Rhymes' album It Ain't Safe No More (two thousand and two). Most fans really enjoyed this song because Busta actually sings on it, instead of wrapping. I don't care for this song. This is an album, in which Mariah's fans had been waiting for. Not all the songs on this album are worth the time, in my opinion, but most of the album is definitely worth the money. Anyway, take out your wallets and buy the remixes you've been wanting to own since Mariah's debut.","overall":5,"summary":"The Remixes (2003)","unixReviewTime":1098403200,"reviewTime":"10 22, 2004"}

He kept the original words of the first part and sang them in the same way as the first, but the sang it in a more interesting way. But the second verse was changed, and the words were different, and Maria sang them a different key. The choir remains unchanged. Da Brat and Missy Elliott gave their craps. Great mix. Dear (shown by JD) on the album # one's (Nine hundred and eighty-eight). Don't believe what you are reading. The album version is the version you see there: a duet with JD. In my case, there is no mixing. That's OK. CRYBABY (presented by Snoop Dogg) was selected from the album \"Rainbow\" (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). Don't believe what you are reading. The album version is the version you see there: the duet with Snoop Dogg. In my case, there is no mixing. Hate it. Miss You (and Jadakiss as the protagonist) has never been released before. This song is not a remix. This song has been included in the UK for Mariah's album \"Charmbracelet\". Most fans love this song, but it is not available on \"Charmbracelet\" released in the US due to any of the songs released by Maria. So, the included it there. ONE (So Def Mix) (containing bone crusher) has never been released before. Hate it. I know what you are looking for (with Busta Rhymes and Flipmode Squad) from Busta Rhymes' album No More (two thousand and two). Most fans love this song because Busta sings it instead of packing. I don't care for this song. This is a list of Mary's followers waiting for. In my opinion, not all the songs on this album are worth the time, but most albums are definitely worth the money. Besides, take out your wallet and buy the mixture you've always wanted since Mariah made manhood.","overall":5,"summary":"The Remixes (2003)","unixReviewTime":1098403200,"reviewTime":"10 22, 2004"}

In two thousand and three, Mariah Carey released her thirteenth album, entitled \"The Remixes,\" a two-disc album featuring many of Mariah Carey's songs. In fact, some of the songs have been are-mixed with studio equipment. Others were reunited with Maria, recording songs with different music and melodies. This remix album is amazing in every way. Disc One: Studio-produced dance club remixes MY ALL (Morales \"My\" Club Mix) original version of the Butterfly album (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven). The original version of \"My All\", found on Mariah Carey's album \"Butterfly\", is a beautiful song, combined with a beautiful Spanish sound. Who knew that a beautiful song that requires a slow dance could be are-mixed in a version where you get your groove? \"From the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine).\" A remix medal if you never have to be alone. This is a wonderful medley remix. FLY AWAY (BUTTERFLY REPRISE) (Fly Away Club Mix) Original version of the album Butter Fly (one, nine hundred and fifty-seven). A great dance remix. Version) The original version of The Music Box album (one, nine hundred and ninety-three). Or, it's ready for remix dance, I like this genre. Song Fantasy (Def Club Mix) Original version of the album Day Dream (One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Ninety-Five). Not bad. The first version of the JU (Classic Mix) album Butterfly (one, nine hundred and fifty-seven). Not bad. Original version of Dream Lover (Deaf Club Mix) album music box (one, nine hundred and ninety-three). I prefer this dance remix to the real genre. Emotions (Twelve \"Club Mix) The original version of the album Emotions (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one) is much better than the original version. On the Rain (HQ Radio Edit) Both original versions, which were recorded a And this incredible dance version. Disc Two: Remix Re-remix Fantasy (Remix) (featuring ODB) Original version of the album Day Dream (One Hundred and Ninety-Five). Remix songs from the album #one (One Thousand) Maria's voice is not affected, except of course. Give these words to the song to close weight. Great remix. My kids stay forever (Mr. Dupri Mix) (Da Brat & Xscape feature) (Original version of the album Day Dream (one, nine hundred and ninety-five). The music is perfectly mixed and Maria's lyrics are untouched. Da Brat and Xscape entered the studio to perform their play on this song. (Medley) My All \/ Wait a minute (Hundred Deaf Remix) (featuring Lord Tariq and Peter Gunn) Original version of \"My All\" from the Butterfly album (One Thousand, Ninety-seven). Done as \"(Medley) Heartbreaker \/ If you never have to be alone \", just bring Lord Tariq and Peter Gunn to provide the corps for Maria's song. Thank God I got it, the original version of the Rainbow (one, nine hundred and ninety-nine) album (featuring Joe and Naz) (Make It Last Remix). The original version of \"Thank God I Found You\" was called A Bald, in which Mariah Carey did ninety-eight degrees and joss in that version. This is my favourite version. The music of the song has been reunited, with Maria Carey recording the verses with Joe and Nass. Hate it Breakdown from the Butterfly album (one, nine hundred and fifty-seven) (featuring Crazy Bone and Wish Bone's Bone Thugs N Harmony). I don't know why the put this song in because it's not a remix. I hate this song Original version of HONEY (So So Def Mix) (featuring Da Brat & JD) album Butterfly (one thousand, ninety-nine). Not a bad remix. LOVERBOY (remix) (including Ludacris, Shawnna, Da Brat, and Twenty II) from the album Glitter (two thousand and one). Both the album version and this remix are included in Maria's album \"Glitler\". Album type played with Cameo. This remix is \u200b\u200bno different from the original version. The music is untouchable, Maria's words are untouched. The song was only extended to Ludacris, Shawnna, Da Brat, and Twenty II to give them their ugliness. The cameo verse has been extracted. Great remix. Hart (remix) (featuring Dr. Brett and Missy Elliott) from the album Rainbow (one, nine hundred and ninety-nine). Both the first version and this remix were included in Maria's album, entitled \"Rainbow\". The original genre played with Jay-Z. This remix is \u200b\u200bvery different from the original version. Real music captures pop \/ wrap sound. The music of this remix is \u200b\u200bthe sound of wrap. Mariah Carey recorded the first two verses. He put the words of the first song in the first verse and sang them with the key as before, but the sang it more sexually. But the second verse was replaced with different words, in which Maria sang it with a different key. The course is kept the same. Da Brat and Missy Elliott donated their problems. Great remix. From SWEETHEART (JD feature) album # one (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). Don't believe what you read. The album type is the version you see there: a pair with JD. No remixes, as I'm worried. Not bad. Cry BB (with Snoop Dogg) from the album Rainbow (one, nine hundred and ninety-nine). Don't believe what you read. The album version is the version you see there: Dwight with Snoop Dogg. No remix, myself. Zonda MISS YOU (including separate case) was not previously released. This song is not a remix. The song was included in the UK release of Maria's album \"Chamberslet\". Many fans liked the song, but with one of Maria's releases, it was not found in the American \"Charmerslate\" release. So the put it there. The ONE (So So Def Mix) (including Bonkerscher) was previously unreleased. Zonda I know what you want (with Busta Rhymes and Flip Mode Squad) from Busta Rhymes album It Aint Safe No More (two thousand two). Many fans really liked the song because Busta sang it instead of threatening it. I don't care about this song. The album was awaited by Maria's fans. In my opinion, not all the songs on this album are timely, but most albums are really worth the money. Anyway, take out your wallet and buy the remix you want from Maria's first movie.","overall":5,"summary":"The Remixes (2003)","unixReviewTime":1098403200,"reviewTime":"10 22, 2004"}

Great Remix This medium is treated the same way as \"(Medley) Heartbreaker \/ If you have to be alone forever\", only Mariah brought in Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz to provide the lyrics for the song. I do not want. THANK YOU I GOT IT (Make It Last Remix) (with Joe & Naz) Original version of the Rainbow album (thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). The original version of \"Thank God I Found You\" consisted of a ballad, in which Mariah Carey had ninety -eight Degrees & Joe's. My favourite type. The music of the song is mixed, with Mariah Carey recording verses from Joe, and Nas. Nacey. BREAKDOWN (featuring Krazyzie Bone & Wishbone of Bone Thugs \u2018N Harmony) from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety -seven).

HONEY (So So Def Mix) (with Da Brat & JD) Original version of the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety seven). Not a bad remix. LOVERBOY (Remix) (including Ludacris, Shawnna, Da Brat, & Twenty II) From the Glitter album (two thousand and one). Both the album and this remix were featured on Mariah\u2019s album \u201cGlittler\u201d. The album type is a duet with Cameo. This combination is no different from the original version. The music is untouchable, Mariah\u2019s voices are untouchable. The song will only be extended to Ludacris, Shawnna, Da Brat, and Twenty II to provide their map. Cameo's verse was deleted. Great remix. Remix (including Da Brat & Missy Elliott) From the rainbow album (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety -nine). Both the original version and the remix are on Mariah\u2019s album titled, \u201cRainbow\u201d The original version was a duet with Jay-Z. This remix is \u200b\u200bvery different from the original version. The original music is taken with a Pop \/ Rap sound. The music in this remix is \u200b\u200ba wrap sound. Mariah Carey made the first two paragraphs recorded. She kept the original songs in the first verse and sang the same key as the original, but she sang a little more sexy. But the second verse is altered, with different words, in which Mariah sings different keys. The songs are the same. Da Brat and Missy Elliott offer their own crap. Great remix. SWEETHEART (with JD) From the album #mid (thousand, nine hundred ninety weight). Don't believe what you read. The kind of album is the kind you see there: a duet with JD. No remix, as far as I am concerned. Not bad. CRYBABY (with Snoop Dogg) From the album Rainbow (thousand, nine hundred and ninety -nine). Don't believe what you read.

I do not want. I know what you like (including Busta Rhymes & Flipmode Band) Bustape Songs Album Not Safe Again (two thousand and two). Most fans really enjoyed this song because Busta actually sang it, rather than record it. I don\u2019t care about this song. This is an album, that Mariah\u2019s fans have been waiting for. Not all of the songs on this album are worth the time, in my opinion, but for the most part the album is definitely worth the money. However, unpack your bag and buy the remixes you\u2019ve wanted to have since Mariah\u2019s first time.","overall":5,"summary":"The Remixes (2003)","unixReviewTime":1098403200,"reviewTime":"10 22, 2004"}

Highsmith","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"Ever since I heard the honest single \"Player's Ball\", from their debut CD \"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\", I have been a fan of Outkast. This CD opened doors for lot of groups from the South that are around now. I could give you a page long list of my favourite songs from Outkast. They always give you an innovative sound each time around. They also are not afraid to try new things. \"ATliens\", \"Aquemini\", and \"Stankonia\" are classic albums just as much as their debut CD was. Sometimes, it this hard to follow a blueprint when your fans expect you to create the hits like \"Elevators\", \"Rosa Parks\", \"B. O. B\", \"Ms. Jackson\" and \"So Fresh And So Clean\". With \"Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below\", Outkast has brought you one solo CD from Big Boi and one solo CD from Andre three thousand. Although they are packaged together, you will clearly see that both of these CDs are entirely different from one another. Big Boi does't stray too far away from the Outkast sound. The Andre three thousand produced \"Ghettomusick\" is a fast paced roller coaster ride that only slows down long enough for a Patti Labelle sample. Big Boi drops a memorable sixteen bars and Outkast fans will not be disappointed at all. \"Unhappy\" has Big Boi talking about someone who might as well try to have a little fun before there misfortunes send up catching with them. \"Bowtie\" falls right in line with the honest single from \"Speakerboxxx\", \"The Way You Move\". Sleepy Brown is featured on both songs and they are both \"feel good\" type of songs. He definitely made the right choice for the first single with \"The Way You Move\" as Big Boi's fast paced craps are slowed down with Sleepy Brown's voice and an orchestra full of horns. This is definitely one of Speakerboxxx's better tracks. \"The Rooster\" has a \"Ms. Jackson\" feel to it, but it won't make you miss \"Ms. Jackson\" at all. You'll probably laugh at what the is saying if anything. \"Church\" is another one of those \"feel good\" songs from Big Boi. If you karen't careful, you might even wake up in a pew. \"War\" is a song that you will actually try to listen to what the is saying eventhough the song has two different beats to it. \"Tomb Of The Boom\" is a lyrical free for all between Big Boi, Ludacris, Big Gipp from Gooide Mob and Konkrete. This is another one of my favourite songs from \"Speakerboxxx\" so far and Big Boi definitely dropped a nice beat for the song. \"Flip Flop Rock\" has Big Boi, Jay Z and Killer Mike wrapping over a fast paced beat and the collaboration works once again as the three MCs were already featured with Twista on Jay Z's \"Poppin' Tags\". \"Reset\" features Big Boi, Cee Lo and Khujo Goodie. This track reminds you of earlier Goodie Mob tracks and will have you wishing that the original group was still making hits like \"Cell Therapy\" and \"They Don't Dance No Mo\". Speakerboxxx does't feature any wack tracks. The only song that I may not listen to at times is \"Last Call\" because you hear Mello more than you do Big Boi. Overall, if you are used to the Outkast sound, \"Speakerboxxx\" is an extension of that.\"The Love Below\", however, is something entirely different. If you thought that Andre three thousand would be dropping' the classic bars that you are used to, then you are in for a surprise. Primarily, Andre three thousand is singing and talking on most of the tracks. The only song that the is actually wrapping on for the whole song is \"A Day In The Life Of Benjamin Andre\". Other than that, you will hear Andre singing the blues, singing like Prince and actually trying to hold a note. Now while it took me a couple of listens to get used to this, Andre's formal actually works on some occasions. \"Prototype\" is definitely The Love Below's best track. The song takes place as Andre has just had a one night stand with a woman that the is now feeling and now it's the morning after. Andre expresses this feelings through song and \"Prototype\" reminds me of an old school slow jam. \"She Lives In My Lap\" features the lovely Rosario Dawson and should have been the first single. Yes there definitely is a Prince \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" feel to it but the track works more wonders than \"Hey Ya\". \"Spread\" does the same as well, except the actually craps on \"Spread\". You will be trying to figure out what Prince song that Andre three thousand is remaking but this is an original creation. \"Happy Valentine's Day\" is Andre's version of a feel good song and is nice to actually hear him wrapping as well. The only song that Big Boi is featured on is \"Roses\". He drops another memorable verse as Andre is telling women that \"Roses\" karen't always what they appear to be, referring to females. Some songs on \"The Love Below\" don't work for me though. \"Love Hater\" has Andre sounding like a thirty-nine year old blues singer singing at a local club. \"Dracula's Wedding\" featuring Kelis does't either. However, the George Clinton\/Parliament feel of the song is starting to grow on me. \"Hey Ya\" should have never been released. Yes the video is colourful and is actually pretty good, but the song sounds like a fifty limitation of Little Richard, if anything. \"My Favorite Things\" should have been kept in the studio. I don't need to hear an instrumental of the song on Andre's CD. If you can get past Andre three thousand singing all the time, you can enjoy \"The Love Below\". The music is nice, but you have to get use to Andre's antics on the songs. Overall, Outkast did a good job, marketing wise, by releasing both of these CDs in one package at one price. If you are used to the traditional Outkast sound, \"Speakerboxxx\" will be the better CD for you. If you like \"Hey Ya\", then \"The Love Below\" may be better for you. However, if you are an Outkast fan you can't afford to pass up on these two CDs packaged as one. The music is good and the sound is still innovative as usual.

This CD opened the door to many groups now from the South. I can give you a long list of my favourite Outkast songs. They will give you a new voice all the time. They are not afraid to try new things. \"ATliens\", \"Aquemini\" and \"Stankonia\" are all old albums similar to their first CD. Sometimes, when your fans expect you to do hit songs like \"Elevators\", \"Rosa Parks\", \"B. O. B\", \"Mrs. Jackson\" and \"So Fresh And So Clean\", it's hard to follow the plan. With \"Speakerboxxx \/ The Love Beyond\", Outkast brings you one CD by Big Boi and one CD by Andre three thousand. Although packed together, you will see clearly that these two CDs are completely different from each other. Big Boi will not turn away from the sound of Outkast. The \"Ghettomusick\" produced by Andre three thousand is a rough speed that is slow enough for Patti Labelle to make a sample. Big Boi has dropped sixteen unforgettable bars, and Outkast fans will not be disappointed at all. \"Unhappiness\" makes Big Boye talk about someone trying to be happy before disaster strikes. \"Bowtie\" is accompanied by authentic songs from \"Speakerboxxx\" and \"The Way You Go\". Brown Sleep comes from two songs, and both \"feel good\" class songs. You have to make the right choice for the first single \"The Way You Go\" because Big Boi's quick craps slowed down the sound of Sleepy Brown and a full-blown orchestra. This is definitely one of the best Spikboxbox discussions. \"Rooster\" has the feeling of \"Mrs. Jackson\", but it won't make you miss \"Mrs. Jackson\" at all. If anything, you may laugh at what it says. \"Church\" is another song that \"felt good\" by Big Boi. If you are not careful, you may get up on the bench. \"War\" is a song, and you'll try to hear what it says, even if the song has two different players. \"Tomb of The Boom\" is a free song between Big Boi, Ludacris, Gooide Mob's Big Gipp and Concrete. This is one of my favourite songs \"Speakerboxxx\" so far, and Big Boi has certainly played a good song. \"Flip Flop Rock\" allowed Big Boi, Jay Z, and Killer Mike to complete a quick hit. The collaboration of the three MCs also worked because the three MCs are already competing with Jay Z \"Poppin'Tags\" Twista. cooperation. \"Reset\" includes Big Boy, Hilo, and Cujo Gudi. This song reminds you of the original Goodie Mob songs and gives you hope that the original band is still performing songs like \"Cell Therapy\" and \"Dancers, No Mo\". Somboxboxxx does not have any unusual tracks. The only song I can't listen to is \"Last Call\" because you listen to Mello more often than Big Boi. In general, if you are familiar with the Outkast term, \"Speakerboxxx\" is its extension. However, \u201cLove More\u201d is a completely different thing. If you think Andre Sanqian will give up the old bar you're familiar with, you'll be amazed. First of all, Andre Sanqian sings and speaks in many repertoire. The only song included in the entire song is \"A Day in the Life of Benjamin Andre\". Otherwise, you\u2019ll hear Andre singing the blues, singing like a Prince, trying to keep a note. Now even though I listened to it a few times before I got used to it, Andre\u2019s real approach works sometimes. \"Prototype\" is certainly the best track of Love Beyond. The song happened just after Andre had one night with this wife, and now the feels like tomorrow. Andre expresses this feeling in songs, and the \"prototype\" reminds me of an old school jam. \"She sits on my lap\" shows the beloved Rosario Dawson and should be the first. Yes, there must be a prince feeling like \"If I were your daughter\", but this song is more magical than \"Hey Ya\". The same goes for \"Spread\", with the exception of the actual roll of dice in \"Spread\". He'll try to understand the Prince's song that Andre Sanchez has done again, but this is the first work. \"Happy Valentine's Day\" is a version of Andrei's song that feels good, and it's fun to hear this packaging. The only song \"Big Rosi\" is \"Roses\". When Andre told the women that \"Rose\" Karen did't always look like us, the made another memorable verse referring to women. However, some of the songs in \"Love below\" did not work for me. \"Love Hater\" makes Andre sound like a thirty-nine-year-old blues singer who sings at a local club. There is no \u201cDracula Marriage\u201d with Kellys as the main character. However, the George Clinton \/ Council sentiment for this song began to grow in me. \"Hey Ya\" should not be released. Yes, the video is rich, not bad, but this song sounds like Richard's Fifty Borders, if any. \"My favourites\" should be kept in the studio. I don't have to listen to Andre's CD player music. If you can using Andre's threerd album all the time, you can enjoy \"Love Below\". The music is good, but you have to get used to Andre's antics in the song. Overall, Outkast did a good job in marketing and released two CDs in one package for the same price. If you are familiar with the standard Outkast sound, \"Speakerboxxx\" will be the right CD for you. If you like \"hey\", then \"this next love\" might be more appropriate. However, if you are an Outkast fan, you will not miss these two CDs packed in one. The music is good and the sound is still translation as usual.

This CD has opened the door for existing Southern bands. I can give you a long list of my favourite outcast songs. They always give you an imaginary voice all the time. They are not afraid to try new things. \"ATliens\", \"Aquemini\", and \"Stankonia\" are common albums as their first CD. Sometimes it's hard to follow a program where your fans expect you to create songs like \"Elevators\", \"Rosa Parks\", \"BOB\", \"Ms Jackson\" and \"So Fresh And So Clean\". Are With \"Speakerboxxx \/ The Love Below\", Outkast brings you a CD from Big Boi and a three, zero CD from Andre. Even if put together, you can clearly see that the two CDs are very different. The Big Boy is not far from the sound of the outcast. Andre's more than three, zero \"ghetto music\" rides are fast-paced and slow enough to get a strip label sample. The Big Boy dropped six memorable bars, and Outcast fans will not be disappointed. \"I'm not happy\" Big Boy talks about someone who unfortunately can try to have a little fun before sending a catch with him. \"Boti\" goes live with the song \"Speaker Box XX\", \"The Way You Move\". Sleepy Brown has been included in both songs and both are \"feel good\". Definitely the right choice for the first single \"The Way You Move\" because Big Boy's instant creeps were brought down by Sleepy Brown's sound and horn-filled orchestra. This is definitely one of the best Spikboxboxxx tracks. The \"roster\" has a sense of \"Mrs. Jackson\", but it won't make you miss \"Mrs. Jackson\". You will probably laugh at this words if someone says. \"Church\" is one of Big Boy's \"good-feeling\" songs. If you are not careful, you may find yourself sitting in a chair. \"Jang\" is a song you will try to listen to even though it has two different bits. \"Tomb of the Boom\" is a free song for everyone between Big Boy, Ladakris, Guide Mob and the big concrete gossip. It's still one of my favourite songs from \"Speaker Box XXX\" and Big Boy has definitely left a fun rhythm to the song. \"Flip Flop Rock\" includes Big Boy, JZ and Assassin Mike who are shutting down and working out the fast rhythm as the three MCs are already featured in JZ's \"Poppin 'Tags\" with Twista. Have done \"Reset\" includes Big Boy, C Loo and Khojo Goody. The song is reminiscent of previous Goodymob songs and will make you wish that the original band were making successful films like \"Cell Therapy\" and \"They Don't Dance No Mo\". Speakerbox XX has no wake track. The only song I can't hear sometimes is \"The Last Call\" because you hear Mello Big Boy on you. Overall, if you're familiar with Outcast Audio, \"Speakerboxxx\" is an extension of that. \"Lower love\", however, is quite different. If you thought that Andre would throw away the three thousand old bars you are used to, you would be surprised. Basically, Andre sings three, zero and speaks on many tracks. The only song that covers the whole song is \"One Day in Benjamin Andre's Life\". Also, you will hear Andre singing, singing like a prince and actually trying to catch a note. Now that I have to listen a little bit to get used to it, Andre's official works from time to time. \"Prototype\" is a hit song by The Love Below. The song happened when Andre had just had a one-night stand with a woman the could hear now and it was morning. Andre expresses these feelings in a song and \"Prototype\" reminds me of an old school that is slowly moving. \"Sit on my lap\" includes the beloved Rosario Dawson and was considered the first single. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT saint for me either, Looks like BT saint for me either, Looks like BT saint for me either, \"Spread\" does the same thing, without actually clicking on \"Spread\". You may be trying to figure out which of Prince Andre's three, zero songs the remixed, but it's a real creation. \"Good Valentine's Day\" is Andre's version of a beautiful song and it's fun to listen to it. Big Boy's only song was \"Rose.\" He drops another memorable verse as Andre tells women that \"roses\" do not always exist as they appear, referring to women. Some songs from \"The Love Below\" don't work for me yet. \"Leo Heather\" sounds like Andre, a thirty-nine-year-old blues singer who sings at a local club. Neither does \"Dracula's Wedding\", which features Kallis. However, the feeling of George Clinton \/ Parliament's song is growing in me. \"Oh yes\" should not have been released. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT saint for me either. \"I like things\" had to be kept in the studio. I don't need to hear the bell bringing on Andre's CD. If you can beat Andre three thousand times at a time, you can enjoy \"The Lou Bello\". The music is good, but you have to use Andre's movements in the songs. Overall, Outcast has done a great job, cleverly selling it, releasing both CDs in one package at the same price. If you are familiar with traditional outcast sound, \"Speaker Box XXX\" will be the best CD for you. If you like \"Hey Ya\" then \"The Love Below\" might be better for you.

This CD has opened the door to many groups from the current South. I can give you a long list of my favourite songs on Outkast. They always give you a creative sound whenever you are there. They are also not afraid to try new things. \"ATliens\", \"Aquemini\", and \"Stankonia\" were usually albums as their first CDs were. Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to follow a plan when your fans expect you to make hits like \u201cElevators\u201d, \u201cRosa Parks\u201d, \u201cBOB\u201d, \u201cMs. Jackson\u201d and \u201cVery Fresh And Very Clean\u201d. With \u201cSpeakerboxxx \/ Love Below\u201d, Outkast delivers you a Big Boi CD and an Andre solo CD worth three, zero. Even though they are all packaged, you can clearly see that the two CDs are completely different from each other. Big Boi is not far from Outkast\u2019s voice. Andre the three thousand made \u201cGhettomusick\u201d was a fast ride slow enough for model Patti Labelle. Big Boi threw in sixteen memorable bars and Outkast fans won\u2019t be disappointed at all. \u201cI\u2019m not happy\u201d Big Boi says of someone who might also try to have a little fun before tragedy happens. \u201cBowtie\u201d automatically happens to a straight from \u201cSpeakerboxxx\u201d, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d. Sleepy Brown is featured on both songs and both are \u201cgood kind\u201d songs. He really made the right single-choice selection in \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d because the fast-paced craps of Big Boi reduced the sound of Sleeping Brown and an orchestra full of horns. This is definitely one of the best tracks on Speakerboxxx. \u201cRooster\u201d has a \u201cMs. Jackson\u201d feel, but it does\u2019t make you \u201cMs. Jackson\u201d at all. You will think you will laugh at what the Lord says if there is any. \"Church\" is another of Big Boi's \"feeling good\" songs. If you\u2019re not careful, you can even wake up with a thumbs up. \u201cWar\u201d is a song that you will really try to listen to what it says even if the song has two different beats. \u201cTomb of The Boom\u201d is a free song between Big Boi, Ludacris, Big Gipp from Gooide Mob and Concrete. This is another one of my favourite songs \u201cSpeakerboxxx\u201d so far Big Boi beat the beat of the song hard. \u201cFlip Flop Rock\u201d features Big Boi, Jay Z and Killer Mike recording a quick beat and the collaboration is working again as the three MCs come out with Twista Jay\u2019s Poppin \u2018Tags\u2019. \u201cResettlement\u201d includes Big Boi, Cee Lo and Khujo Goodie. This track is reminiscent of Goodie Mob\u2019s previous tracks and hopes the original team still makes hits like \u201cCell Therapy\u201d and \u201cDo No Dance No Mo\u201d. Speakerboxxx has no trace. The only song I don\u2019t hear sometimes is \u201cThe Last Call\u201d because you hear Mello more than Big Boi. In general, if you\u2019re used to Outkast sound, \u201cSpeakerboxxx\u201d is an extension of that. \u201cLove Below\u201d, however, is something completely different. If you thought Andre would lower three thousand \u2018those standard bars you already know, you\u2019re surprised. First, Andre sang three thousand songs and talked about most of the tracks. The only song actually recorded for the entire song was \u201cA Day in the Life of Benjamin Andre\u201d. Other than that, you can hear Andre singing blue, singing like Prince is actually trying to write a text. Now that I\u2019ve taken a few hearings to get used to it, it\u2019s official that Andre actually works sometimes. \u201cPrototype\u201d is definitely Love Below The song happens as Andre spends a night with a woman the feels like now and now is morning. Andre expresses this feeling through songs and \u201cPrototype\u201d reminds me of an old and slow school. \"She lives on my laptop\" features beautiful Rosario Dawson and was supposed to be her first. Yes, there is actually a Prince \u201cIf I Were Your Friend\u201d but that works for more wonders than \u201cHey Ya\u201d. \"Extension\" does the same, except for the real \"Extension\" crap. You will try to know Prince Andre\u2019s song is three thousand remixes but it is an original creation. \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d is Andre\u2019s kind that sings in a good mood and it\u2019s nice to hear him record as well. The only song Big Boi did was \u201cRoses\u201d. He threw in another memorable verse when Andre told the women that \u201cRoses\u201d were\u2019t always what they looked like, referring to the woman. Some songs about \u201cLove Below\u201d don\u2019t work for me. \u201cLove Love\u201d has Andre who looks like a thirty -nine year old in blue music singing at local clubs. \"Dracula's wedding\" also starring Kelis. However, the George Clinton \/ Parliament feeling in the song is starting to grow on me. \"Hey Yaa\" should't be released. Yes the video is colourful and it\u2019s really great, but the song is like Fifty Little Richard\u2019s limit, if anything. \u201cMy favourite things\u201d should be kept in the studio. I no longer need to listen to music on Andre\u2019s CD. If you can beat Andre by three thousand songs all the time, you\u2019ll enjoy \u201cLove Down\u201d. The music is good, but you have to use Andre\u2019s antenna for the songs. Overall, Outkast did a great job, marketing smart, releasing these two CDs in one package at the same price. If you\u2019re into the standard Outkast sound, \u201cSpeakerboxxx\u201d will be the best CD for you. If you like \u201cHey Ya\u201d, \u201cLove Down\u201d might be better for you.

Go to your record store right NOW and ask a grown-up for the following: Eric B. & Rakim's \"Paid in Full,\" Stevie Wonder's \"Songs in the Key of Life,\" A Tribe Called Quest's \"Low End Theory,\" Public Enemy's \"Fear of a Black Planet,\" Parliament's \"Funkentelechy tvs. The Placebo Syndrome,\" Beatles' \"Abbey Road,\" Sly Stone's \"There's A Riot Goin' On,\" Led Zeppelin's \"Houses of the Holy,\" Curtis Mayfield's \"Superfly,\" John Coltrane's \"A Love Supreme,\" Miles Davis' \"Kind of Blue,\" and Prince's \"Purple Rain.\" After you know each one of these by heart, go back and listen to Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below. Now, about the album(s). Some stand-outs on Big Boi's \"Speakerboxxx\" are:-\"Ghettomusick\" takes a trunk-thumpin beat, combines it with a tight-as-hell hook a la Dre, rapid-fire verses a la Big Boi, and throws in a Patti LaBelle sample that slinks in and out like a housecat.- \"Unhappy\" has a chorus that creeps under your skin. The rhyme is very introspective and it just ripples over the top of phat congas and synths.- \"Bowtie\" is an Old Skool party on wax. This joint uses brass to move your a**. Another one of those choruses that gets wedged in your brain: `Crocodile on my feet. Fox fur on my back. '- \"The Way You Move\" Yeah, even mainstream radio's playing it. The crux: bootylicious bass and Sleepy Brown getting as dangerously close to Billy Ocean as anyone never should.- \"The Rooster\" Another one of those choruses (with Chicken Dance Elmo doing background vocals, if I'm not mistaken. ) that sticks to you. Domestic disputes never sounded so funky for this damn funny.- \"Bust\" A dark, brooding than. It's like Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic got resurrected somehow and threw down with Big Boi and Killer Mike.- \"War\" A short track that comes in two parts. The first part's kind of a menacing preface to part deus, in which Big Boi lets loose with hard-hitting commentary on your post nine-eleven, post-stolen selection world.- \"Church\" A track asking the never-living question \"Why are we there?\" that makes you wonder who slipped a Kirk Franklin disc into your CD player when you were't looking.- \"Knowing\" Dre and Big Boi together, as it should be. Tight piano and percussion play the foundation for commentary on how this nasty world gets of(u)y.- \"Flip Flop Rock\" One of the catchiest hooks in years, courtesy of Jay Z. Throw in classical piano paired with a beat so undeniably funky that (unless you're dead for Republican) you'll find your neck snapping uncontrollably. I predict this to be the next platinum single off this album.- \"Reset\" a smooth joint with an ethereal feel--something that would fit well on \"ATLiens.\" Tight\/deep flows by Khujo and Cee-lo match Big Boi's brilliant verses. The rest of the album is disappointingly lacklustre, with Big Boi unnecessarily pairing up with lesser emcees. But over all: excellent. Now, Dre's \"The Love Below.\"It took about two listens for me to get into it, but the effort was worth it. If you give it a chance, you can catch the Bootsy, Prince, Sly, Stevie, get al. references; however, as much as Dre reminds me of the aforementioned royalty, the has a style all this own. The entire album is brilliant. Some stand-outs:- \"Love Hater\" is Dre changeling Nat Cole's croon thru George Clinton's sensibilities. A tight, jazzy joint with awesome piano.-\"Happy Valentines Day\" A funky joint with Dre on guitar and lead vocal that would make Prince turn from purple to green with envy.- \"Spread\" A sputtering drum-n-bass type song where Dre once again out-Princes Prince.- \"Prototype\" Smoothed out R&B;\/funk, reminiscent of Bootsy's \"Vanish in Our Sleep\" for the Ohio Players \"Heaven Must Be Like This.\" One of my favourites on there.- \"She Lives in My Lap\" is destined to be a classic. It has a head-nodding beat, tight guitar work, and smooth (`Damn, the sounds like Chico DeBarge') vocals. Like Prince's best work, this song is sexual, funky, and offbeat. Brilliant.- \"Hey Ya\" Top forty radio has beaten this `brown stallion those with skates on' to death. A good song, but not even close to being the best on the disc.- \"Roses\" A funky beat and heights-style synths ride behind Dre's chastising of gold diggers.- \"Behold A Lady\" The beat comes in like Cameo's \"Word Up\" with Dre crooning over the top. The breakdown is the crown jewel on this one: \"Cant get no lower. can't get no lower. \"- \"Pink & Blue\" A funk box, Moog synths, swirling strings that would be right at home on a Barry White joint, and Dre singing about a May-December relationship. Again, Prince should hang this head in shame.- \"She's Alive\" A heartfelt tribute to Dre's from and all single rooms. Just piano, brushes on snares, and Dre singing this guts out.- \"Dracula's Wedding\" Phat Moog bass, a wickedly clever lyric, and Kelis' milkshake vocals helping to smooth things out.- \"My Favorite Things\" Yes, the one from \"The Sound of Music.\" A tight drum-n-bass beat underlies amazing jazz piano and sax, plus a bassline that makes your thumbs hurt just listening to it.- \"Take Off Your Cool\" pairs Dre and Norah Jones. A short, jazzy track with silky vocals and Dre on acoustic guitar.- \"Vibrate\" curiously unfolds over the course of about seven minutes. It has a backward beat (\"She Lives in My Lap\" played backwards maybe?) with a trumpet solo that instantly brings to mind Miles.- \"A Life in the Day. \" sounds like \"Rosa Parks\" on Quaaludes. An interesting look back on the past decade of Outkast. In all: brilliant. Dre's a genius. Period. And lastly, as a wise man once said: \"If you still don't get it, it main't for you anyway.\"","overall":5,"summary":"No Skippin' or Slowin' Down","unixReviewTime":1077494400,"reviewTime":"02 23, 2004"}

It's as if Eddie Hazel of Funcadillac was somehow provoked by Big Boy and the killer Mike and thrown down. \"War\" is a short track that comes in two parts.

A strong piano and a melody form the basis for commenting on how this evil world finds itself. I uncontrollably predict that this will be the next platinum release from this album. Khujo and Cee-lo's walk \/ depth resembles the beautiful verses of Big Boi. The rest of the album is disappointingly missing, and Big Boy goes on with unnecessarily small amulets. But above all: the best. Now, Dre's \"love down.\" It took almost two listening sessions to get into it, but the effort was worth it. If you give it a try, you can catch Botswana, Prince, Sewing, Stevie, Getl. references; However, as fear reminds me of the kingdom mentioned above, it has its own style. The whole album is wonderful. Another highlight: Fear's \"low heater\" that converts Nut Cole's cronies using George Clinton's emotions. A strong, jazzy joke and an amazing piano. Prince The \"prototype\" paved the way for R&B. One of my favourites out there - \"You Sit at My Hip\" is meant to be a classic. It has a heartbeat, strong guitar performances, and smoothness. Like Prince's main work, this song is sexual, entertaining, and rhythmic. Spectacular - \"Hey Ya\" The leading forty radio stations killed the \"brown horse who wore the skirt\". A beautiful song, but not very close to being the best on the disc. The word \"up\" with dread paddling. The division has a crown jewel in it: \"I won't stay down. I can't go down.\" Sang about the May-December relationship. - \"Dracula's Wedding\" Phat Mog Boss, a Corrupt Song, and Kallis's Milking Voice Help Organize Things. - \"My Favorite Things\" Yes, Amazing Jazz and Sex's \"The Sound of Music\" One of \", and the bass line that makes your thumbs hurt when you hear it.\" A short, jazzy track with sharp words and scary acoustics. \"Vibrate\" appears strangely within about seven. Minutes It backs up with a solo trumpet (\"You set it on my ship\" back-to-back?) Which instantly reminds me of the emails - \"Days in a Lifetime.\" Looks like \"Rosa Parks\" on the cue.

One of my favourites out there. - \"You sit on my lap\" is set to be classic. It has an amazing beat, strong guitar playing and a smooth voice (\"Damn sounds like Chico DeBarge\"). Like Prince\u2019s outstanding work, this song is full of sex, fashion and more. amazing. - \"Hey\" the first forty radios thanked this \"stallion brown in skirts\". Good song, but far from the best record. - \"Rose\", a stylish beat and a very stylish embellishment riding after Dre's punishment of gold miners. -The appearance of \"Look at the Lady\" is similar to the Cameo \"Voice\" above \", Dre whispers loudly. it cannot be lower. \"-\" Pink and Blue \"Funk box, Moog synthesizer, strings, for members of Barry White as home, singing with Dre about the relationship between May and December.

Maybe it's this swagger and confidence for it could be this Texas style sound for maybe it's the fact that the freestyles most of this songs. Whatever it is the has star like quality. Anyways Lil Flip delivers on the album. The beats are off the frigging chain. Nearly every song rides out. Tight. Lil Flip on the mic sounds like a seasoned veteran spitting fire most of the time. Sometimes the tends to spit some garbo but the makes up for it in flow and poise. He's just a cool character as experienced by this party tracks `Game Over' and `Ain't No Party'. I like this choruses as well. I also like how the lets the beat ride out at the send of each song. Of the whole two disc set NOT ONE SONG is plain out wack for unlistenable ( except for the screw songs simply cause I don't like screw music).

I always have Hip Hop playing, no matter what I'm doing, I have a constant need for new music. Having said that, I've established that I know Hip Hop, on to the review. I first heard Guerilla Black on BET's Late Night UnCut Show, immediately yeah I thought the sounded like The Late Notorious BIG. Once I saw him though, and listened deeper, I dismissed that thought. Black has this own style, don't listen to these people saying 'yeah the's exactly like Biggie!' because the's not. The CD was highly anticipated by myself, I even went and downloaded three songs to keep my appetite down for it. I actually found it on Amazon.com in the used section (still new in wrapping though) for about $seven (definitely check out the used section!). Since it ended up under $ten I bought it (I never pay more than $ten for a CD unless it's a double CD). The first single \"Compton\" is amazing, and features Beenie Man on the hook. You should have heard it on the radio for something by now (I have SIRIUS so I don't listen to the radio). The CD features production by Jazze Pha (\"Guerilla Nasty\" & \"Girlfriend\"), both of which are pretty good tracks. Nate Dogg blends this voice on \"What We Gonna Do,\" which has a killer bassline. Mario Winans appears on \"You're The One\" which I heard on SIRIUS recently, so I suppose it's the second single, also a pretty good track. Personally I enjoyed \"Hearts Of Fire\" and \"Guerilla City,\" the opening tracks of the CD. \"Hearts Of Fire\" samples Bob Marley & The Wailers' \"No More Trouble,\" which is an awesome song. Shyne recently used this same sample on \"Quasi O. G.,\" only that song has poor production, I definitely recommend listening to the original Bob Marley song first, because it will give you a better appreciation for the Guerilla Black track. Guerilla City is an code to Compton, it get's stuck in my head easily, and is a melodious track. If you doubt any tracks for even the whole CD, just listen to it on Amazon.com for Circuit City's website first. Either way, this is a great West Coast CD. Overall I give this CD three.five for four stars, it is an impressive debut, and a big help to the West Coast Hip Hop scene. I look forward to more Guerilla Black in the future.","overall":4,"summary":"\"He Look Like BIG, Sound Like BIG...I'm BLACK ***** Ya Dig?\"","unixReviewTime":1098835200,"reviewTime":"10 27, 2004"}

I always play ship-hop music, and no matter what I do, I have an ongoing need for new music. Having said that, I have made sure I understand Hip Hop, and then I will comment. For the first time I heard Guerilla Black on BET's unstructured night program. Yes, I quickly thought it sounded like The Late Notorious BIG. However, when I saw her and listened intently, I dismissed the idea. The black man has this own style, don't listen to these people say \"Yes, this is the same thing as Biggie!\" Because it is not. This CD is something I look forward to. I even downloaded three songs to suppress my appetite. I actually found about $ seven in the app section on Amazon.com (although the packaging is new) (be sure to check out the application section!). Because it ended up being less than $ ten, I bought it (I never paid more than $ ten for a CD except for a two-person CD). The first person \"Compton\" was amazing and showed Biniman. You should have heard something on the radio by now (I have Sirius so I don't listen on the radio). The CD was produced by Jazze Pha (\"Guerilla Nasty\" and \"Girlfriend\"), and both songs are very good. Nate Dogg has composed this sound for \"Into What It Will Do\", with a bass line. Mario Winans appeared in \"It's You\" I heard recently on SIRIUS, so I think this is second and right. I personally love the opening songs of this CD \"Hearts of Fire\" and \"Guerilla City\". \"Hearts of Fire\" samples \"No More Problem\" by Bob Marley and The Wailers, a great song. Shyne recently used one sample for \"Quasi O. G\", but the song was not well produced. I definitely recommend listening to Bob Marley\u2019s first song first, as it allows you to have a better taste of the Guerilla Black track. Guerrilla City is a Compton code, it's easy to keep in mind, and it's a great song. If you suspect any song on the entire CD, please listen to it on the Circuit City website on Amazon.com first. After all, this is the biggest CD of the West Coast. Overall, I gave this CD three for five points and four stars. This is a very moving and very useful sport for the ship-hop community on the West Coast.

If you are in doubt about any of the tracks and even a complete CD, listen to it first on the Circuit City website on Amazon.com. Either way, it's the best CD on the West Coast.

I'm actually beginning to feel Number One, I Can Change, Alright, She Don't Have to Know (of course I would never behave this way, but the beat and the flow are both good). I DEFINTELY believe that Ordinary People is going to get PLAYED TO DEATH on the radio and join the status of overrated songs. His voice is very nice, but it does't stand out from anyone else I've heard. Whomever said the sounds like Carl Thomas was thinking the same thing I did when I first really listened to Ordinary People on the radio. However, I do find myself singing the songs as I'm walking for just doing other stuff. It was also good to hear him playing the piano. I have so much respect for true musicians (the piano is no easy task!) who do not simply rely on the mixing board and all of that fancy equipment. If you can do more than just dance around a stage, you are good with me! The piano accompaniment (sp?) to Used to Love U is so amazingly subtle that unless you know music, you'll pay it no attention. I used to play in a classical band, so I always look for the subtle things that can \"make\" a song. I had no idea the was on Ms. Hill's Everything is Everything. Great song! I do agree that the album can be divided into two parts: the Hip-hop placed half and the Soul-laced half. The first half is probably more ship shop-like with Kanye wrapping and talking about male genitalia. The first half features the songs that are just enough to reach out to the MTV faithful. I am convinced that Kanye is the new Diddy: wrapping in songs where the really does't belong and inappropriate and corny lyrics. I'm a soul person at heart, so this album is a good mix of soul and R&B; for me. Hopefully the will only continue to phone this talents and not go in the opposite direction and sell out.

Wu \"The Rap Analyzer\"","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"For the past few years, a great number of flame artists with absolutely no talent have been signed into major wrap companies and hyped up, and they are literally ruining the music of wrap. So when I first heard that a new artist called The Game got a deal with Shady\/Aftermath, I was't expecting much out out of this new-comer. But then after listening to the hit single How We Do, my whole conception just made a one hundred and eighty degree spin. Therefore, I eagerly purchased The Documentary ASAP, and it turned out to be one of the best albums in recent history. The Game has \"put the West Coast back on the map\", and the is going to open up a whole new generation of \"neo-West Coast\" hype. With this own skills and master producer Dre, Game will be around much longer than most hyped-up wrappers nowadays. Intro: I thought this was a rather weak intro to such a dynamic album, since it mentioned nothing about \"Tha West\". Westside Story: Now this song automatically implies that the album is a classic. Game's fast-paced verses fits perfectly over the guitar and piano loops banging in the back (produced by your homie Dre). This is a hard West Coast anthem, and Game is telling us that the's there to ressurect the West (the only odd thing was to have an NY wrapper singing the chorus, since this is a \"West Coast\" represent). Dreams: Here Game talks about all this dreams of major success and so on. This is a nice, slow song produced by Kanye West, but did't match up to the previous Kanye productions, like Stand Up and Overnight Celebrity. Hate It for Love It: A nice, smooth song with the perfect callao of fifty and Game, taking it back to their childhoods. The rhymes are well delivered and the production is amazing. This is a highlight song. Higher: The deep piano-banging beats produced by Dre gives this song an instant hardcore flavor, matching perfectly with Game's hard verses. How We Do: Yes, once again I emphasize this song as another highlight song. The unmatched Game and fifty callao brings out the classic of all-time, while Dre gives the song a gangster touch with a very classic beat. This single lives up to the hype, indeed. Don't Need Your Love: Nice hook from Biggie's wife. Here Game tells about the love, spain, and harshness in this life. He definitely has the lyrical skill that some fans question him of. Some deep concepts might be found in this song. Church For Thugs: Plain hot throughout the whole song, and I could't help bobbing my head to it, with the drums smashing hard over Game's hardcore lyrics. Just Blaze once again proves this production skills. Put You on the Game: Another hot joint by a master beatsmith, Timbaland. Again this song contains hard beats and lyrics. Start From Scratch: The slow, heavy beat from Dre gives this song the perfect dark feeling, with Game's scratchy voice and Marsha's high vocals. But this song has more deep meanings, taking it back in time to many different places, showing Game's passion and respect for legends who have past away. The Documentary: This is a classic gangster, straight up West Coast song. Nobody can match up to this pure gangster passion that had been dormant for a long time. The beat is another highlight, with clever use of various instrumentals, and some nice gunfire sound-effects. This is all-time gangster classic. Runnin': Slow song with Yayo and Game killing' it. But I was disappointed that Banks and Buck were nowhere to be found. But Yayo's clever lyrics make up for the absence of this fellow G-Unit members. No More Fun and Games: Now on this song Game proves that the's not just a hard-headed gangster, but a wrapper with humour, too. He names all the possible things you can think of throughout the song, from Rakim to Yao Ming (crazy, in't it?)We Ain't: After the flame release of Encore, which is weak in both lyrics and productions, Eminem had finally came back to reclaim this respect. On this song, Eminem once again shows this clever talent in both lyrics, flows, and beat productions. I really wish that more songs like this one was on Enocre, and less songs like \"Ass Like That\". Game even admits it, \"Em just killed me on my own cash*t!\"Where I'm From: This one sounds rather old school since it has Nate Dogg on it. This is a song keeping Compton, LA, and the Bloodz gang. Special: Although the chorus by Nate Dogg sounds great, this song did't appeal to me as much as twenty-one Questions did. Don't Worry: Mary L. Blidge contributes to this album with this song. Her vocals are very nice, matching with Game's harsh voice, over yet another impressive Dre beat with high piano loops. Like Father Like Son: Here Game paints the perfect picture of how it feels to be a dad, and all the excitement and worries during a baby's birth. This is a very solid example of Game's lyrical talent. The chorus Busta Rhymes contributes gives us a peaceful feeling, instead of rowdy and jumpy. Game's lyrics have been underrated, since the productions throughout the whole album were all pure works of geniuses. But if you listen closely, you will find that Game is table to adapt to any beat given to him, using just the right words to describe certain scenes that the wants this audience to picture. And that is the key of most lyrical masters: to be multi-dimensional. Although Game would't have sold as much copies if fifty than't contributed, but this does not mean Game's inability. Kicking Game out of G-Unit is like giving away a bank. Game is a lyrical genius, and with the god of production, Dr. Dre, we know for sure that Game's music is classic. And \"classic\" as in \"classic wrapper that surfaces only once in a few years.\"","overall":5,"summary":"An All-Time Classic","unixReviewTime":1111795200,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2005"}

Wu \"The Rap Analyzer\"","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"Over the past few years, a large number of talented firefighters have signed up for major rotating companies and have been declared to be truly damaging to circulating music. So, the first time I heard that a new artist named Game had reached an agreement with Shady \/ Aftermath, I did't expect much from these young people. But after listening to one song \"How We Do It\", my whole mind was rotated by one hundred and eighty degrees. So, I immediately bought the record right away, and it turned out to be one of the best albums in modern history. The game \"Let the West Coast reappear on the map\" will open a new generation of hype \"New West Coast\". With this talent and great producer Dre, Game will have the longest lifespan of all the threat today. Introduction: I think this is a very weak introduction to a live album, because it does't mean \"Tha West\". Westside Story: Now this song automatically states that this album is a classic. The fast-paced verses of the game are in perfect harmony with the sound of the guitar and the piano lyrics aloud in the background (performed by your brother Dre). This is a difficult national anthem on the West Coast, and the Game tells us that this is reviving the West (the only unusual thing is that there is a New York Parking Choir, because this is a representative of the \"West Coast\"). . Dreams: Here, the Game talks about all these dreams of great success and so on. This is a fun and slow song composed by Kanye West, but it does't fit into Kanye's previous works (like Stand Up and Overnight Celebrity). Name It Favorite: A lovely smooth song with \"Fifty Years\" and a perfect \"Game\", bringing back their childhood. The rhyme is delicious and the product is great. This is a great song. High: The deep piano rhythm produced by Dre gives the song a solid instant flavor, which fits perfectly with the difficult verses of the Game. How We Perform: Yes, I reiterate that this song is one of the best songs never. The unparalleled game with fifty callao introduced classic classics, while Dre gave the song a gangster style and a classic beat. Really, this one lived up to the hype. You don\u2019t need your love: Biggie\u2019s wife\u2019s best partner. Here the play tells the story of love, Spain and the priors of life. He certainly has some fans questioning this musical skills. Some deeper concepts are found in this song. Church For Thugs: The whole song is so hot, I can't help but shake my head, the drums beating violently the heavy words of the game. Just Blaze proves this way of reproducing. Let's join the game: another popular co-branded name made by music master Timbaland. This song also contains complex songs and lyrics. Start from the beginning: Dre's slow and heavy rhythm brings the perfect dark feeling to this song, the rough voice of the Game and the high sound of Marsha. But this song has a deep meaning, bringing it back to many different places, showing the game's enthusiasm and respect for the dead legend. Document: This is an old gang song, a direct song on the West Coast. No one can compare to the pure desire of a gangster who has been silent for a long time. Striking is another highlight, a wide variety of weapons are used skilfully, as well as good gun sound effects. This is the classic gangster of all time. Runnin ': Use Yayo and Game to kill its slow song. But I was disappointed that Banks and Buck were not available. But Yayo's clever words make up for the absence of G-Unit members. No More Fun and Games: Now in this song, Game proves that not only is this gangster with a cool head, but also a funny packer. Listed all the possible things you can think of throughout the song, from Rakim to Yao Ming (crazy, in't it?) None: after the release of Encore Flame, weak in songs and productions, Eminem finally came back and regained this honor. In this song, Eminem also demonstrated this brilliant talent in vocals, movement and production. I hope there are a lot of songs like Enocre and a few songs like \"Ass Like That\". The game even admits, \"They just killed me for my money!\" Where I come from: This sounds like an old school because we have Nate Dogg. This is a song that keeps Compton, Los Angeles, and the band Blooz. Special: Although Nate Dogg's chorus sounds good, this song does't appeal to me as much as Twenty-One Questions. Don't worry: Mary L. Blidge contributed to this album with this song. His singing is very good, in line with the rough sound of the Game, and the piano loop at the top of one of Dre's most catchy rhythms. Son as a father: The play there reflects the feeling of being a father, with all the joy and anxiety at birth. This is a reliable example of the talent of Game songs. The Chorus Busta Rhymes give us a sense of calm, no noise and no fear. The words of the Game are underestimated, because the whole disc is carefully crafted. But if you listen carefully, you will find that the game is adjusted to any given word, using appropriate words to describe specific characters that the audience wants to convey to the audience. This is key to many song masters: Duowei. Even if you do not contribute fifty copies, Game sales will not be so high, but this does not mean the inability of the Game. Kicking Game into the G-Unit is like giving a bank. The game is a masterpiece. Together with the god of production, Drs. Dre, we are convinced that the music of the Game is classy. And \"classic\" is like \"ordinary wrapping paper that comes out once in a few years\".","overall":5,"summary":"An All-Time Classic","unixReviewTime":1111795200,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2005"}

So when I first heard that a new artist named The Game has signed Shady \/ Afterath, I did't expect much from this new artist. But after listening to the infamous song, How Do We Do, my whole brain recently rotated one hundred and eighty-eight degrees. So, I eagerly bought the documentary ASAP, and it was one of the best albums in recent history. The game \"puts the West Coast back on the map\", and will open a new generation of hype \"New West Coast\". With these skills and professional producer Dre, the game will last longer than today's most dangerous. Introduction: I thought it was a weak introduction to such a powerful album, because it did't say anything about \"Tha West\". West Side Story: Now this song automatically means that the album is old. The fast-paced game verses play well with the guitar and piano strings in the background (produced by your home horror). It's a solid West Coast song, and the game tells us that it exists to keep the West alive (the only weird thing was that New York's danger was to have a course, as it means \"West Coast\"). \u06d4 Dreams: Here the game talks about all these dreams of great success and so on. It's a beautiful, lightweight song produced by Kanye West, but it did't match Kanye's previous productions, such as Stand Up and Overnight Celebrity. Hate It For It: A sweet, smooth song with a beautiful calligraphy of Fifty and Game, which brings them back to their childhood. The lyrics are well presented and the production is excellent. This is a colourful song. High: Drew's deep piano instruments give the song a sharp, cloud sound, which fits well with the difficult verses of the game. How we do it: Yes, I repeat this song as another great song. The terrific game with Callao Fifty reflects the classic of all time, while the dreaded song gives a very old rhythm a gang-friendly touch. This is the only person who lives according to the hype, really. You Don't Need Your Love: A Beautiful Chicken by Buggy's Wife. Here the game tells us about love, Spain and cruelty in this life. He really has the ability to using that some fans ask him about. Some deep thoughts can be seen in this song. Church for Thugs: It's so hot in every song, and I could't help but turn my head toward it, the drum beat the strong words of the game. Just Blaise also proved this productivity. Putting you in the game: Another hot member made by Champion Champion Timbland. And this song has a lot of beat and lyrics. Start from scratch: Dre's soft, heavy rhythm gives the song a pretty dark feel with the game's rough sound and Marsha's high notes. But the song has deep meaning, bringing it back to many different places, showing the game's love and respect for past stories. Documentary: It's an old band, a straight song on the West Coast. No one can maintain this long criminal love. Rhythm is another great feature, with the clever use of a variety of instruments and the beautiful sound of shooting. This is the whole gangster classic era. Runnin ': A slow song with Yayo and Game skills him. But I was disappointed that the bank and the book were nowhere to be found. But Yayo's clever songs make up for the absence of these G-Unit members. No more fun and games: Now in this song, the game proves that the is not only a hardened criminal, but also a funny threat. From Rakim to Yao Ming (He's Crazy, Isn't He?) The song lists everything you can think of, no: after the release of Encore Film, which has both lyrics and production. I'm weak, Eminem. He finally returned to receive the award. In this song, Eminem demonstrated this amazing ability in both song, flow, and beat production. I wish there were more songs like this in Encore, and songs like \"S Like That\". The game even admits, \"M just killed me with my cash!\" Where I came from: It looks like an old school because it has a net dog. It's a song that captures Compton, LA, and Band Bloods. Special: Although I liked the Net Dog course, I did't like the song as much as the twenty-one questions. Don't worry: Marie L. Bulge collaborated on this album with this song. Its sound is very sweet, with the cloud sound of the game, with high quality piano strings more than any other impressive rhythm of Dari. As a father as a son: Here this game gives a complete picture of what it feels like to be a father, with all the joys and sorrows of having a baby. This game is a concrete example of singing talent. Donating choral Busta Rhymes gives us a sense of relief rather than hustle and bustle. Game names are ignored, as the performance throughout the album was purely professional. But if you listen carefully, you will see that the game is a table to adapt to any given rhythm, in which some of the scenes are described using appropriate words that the audience Want to get caught And that's the key to many melodies: being multi -faceted. Even if the game had not been donated, it would not have sold fifty copies, but that does not mean the game is incompetent. Kicking the game in G-Unit is like giving a bank. The game is a singer, and the god of production, Dr. Fear, we know for sure that game music is old-fashioned. And \"classics\" like \"old wrapper that only appears once in a few years.\"","overall":5,"summary":"An All-Time Classic","unixReviewTime":1111795200,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2005"}

In addition to not being very far removed musically from \"Mezmerize,\" this album also follows about the same blueprint. The songs on \"Hypnotize\" are very corky and energetic. It combines jokes with serious, bold political messages, and heavy songs (\"Stealing Society\") with slower, ballad-esque numbers (\"Lonely Day\"). Plus, many of the songs have several tempo changes. (\"Dreaming\" combines \"Chop Suey\"-esque singing with tempo changes that bring \"B. Y. O.

And, finally, guitarist\/songwriter Daron Malankian gets more time at the mic than the did on the band's first two albums. But most of this singing, there, is actually pretty good.

Gone are the cover versions of songs that were't hers, and those dull lullabies that seven people took to cowrote. In its place are some gorgeous melodies with self-written lyrics that elevate this album from being a run of the mill affair to one of those rare animals - a bonafide classic. A note about the music - let the reviews not deter you. The music is very Norah-ish, in the best way possible, but there is something new there. What could be previously termed as \"boring\" is now \"inspired\". You won't fall asleep halfway through this album if you pay attention to the lyrics. It is so great to find an album these days that does not only speak about Love. And even though there are political messages on some of these songs, its muted enough to pass you by without offending you. Also, while I consider \"Come Away with Me\" and \"Feels Like Home\" contemporary American jazz albums (debatable by most, I agree), I think \"Not Too Late\" is her hands down \"Southern\" album, even though it speaks of the very things the South hates to hear about. Its amazing that an album like this would find an audience if Norah was't who she is, but that's the beauty of it all, I think. The standout there is \"Wish I could\", the opening track. Wow. The harmonies blend perfectly. The wonderful thing about this record is that Norah's voice is allowed to shine without the distraction of too much instrumentation (like on her second album). And while \"Thinkin' About You\" is hummable enough, its easily the most insipid track there - speaking of love in the most infantile sense possible. I think that she can afford to move beyond songs like these, pretty as they are. Will \"Not Too Late\" win any awards despite being at least twice as better than her \"Come Away with Me\" album? Probably not. The reason being that Norah is not perceived as \"new\" for \"fresh\" anymore. However, if you listen to this CD, it's the freshest thing out of the Jones stable so far. My favourite little piece other than the opener is \"The Sun Doesn't Like You\" - listen and discover! What makes me really happy about this album is the Repeat Value it carries - I have already played it about six times at work through and through and it just gets better on repeat listening. Do yourself a favor and pick this up, just to discover where American music is headed in general. This is a wonderful time for American music, and it's a testament to her growth and evolution that Norah Jones is the flagbearer for a new music generation. Yes, true talents like Joanna Newsom, Regina Spektor and Fiona Apple still don't get the adulation that they deserve, but if artists like Jones can win acclaim, it proves that there justice after all. Five Stars. Recommended without any reservations!","overall":5,"summary":"An Immediate Masterpiece : The Evolution of Miss Shankar","unixReviewTime":1171497600,"reviewTime":"02 15, 2007"}

There are no more versions of songs that were not this, and a dull song sung seven times together. Instead, with some beautiful songs and lyrics written by me, I propose this album from a traditional mill festival to one of the rarest animals - a real class. An article about music - let the comments never stop. Music is very much Nora, in a better way, but there is something new there. What used to be \"boring\" is now \"inspired\". If you pay attention to the words, you are not flying in the middle of the disc. It's nice to find a album that does't talk about love right now. Although some of these songs have political messages, they are too quiet to ignore them without offending you. In addition, even though I was thinking of \"Come With Me\" and \"Feels Like Home\" American jazz albums (a lot of people argue, I agree), I think \"Not Too Late\" to him is \"South\" without a doubt. and that it speaks of the things the hates in the South. If Nora in't, it would be amazing if a album like this could get an audience, but the beauty of it all, I think. The highlight is the opening song \"I Wish I Could Have It\". Wow. Harmony blends in perfectly. The beauty of this record is that Nora's voice can shine without being disturbed by too many instruments (like her second album). While \"Thinkin 'About You\" is humble enough, it can be the most annoying route where - talking about love in the best possible way for children. I think you have a knack for overcoming these songs, even though they are great. Although \"Not Too Late\" doubles this album \"Come Go With Me\", will the win any awards? probably not. The reason is that Nora is no longer considered \"new\" as \"new\". However, if you have listened to this CD, it is the most refreshing addition to Jones' stables. Aside from the opening words, my favourite little work is \u201cThe Sun Does Not Like You\u201d - listen and find out! The thing that really excites me about this album is the repetitive value it accompanies - I have played it six times at work, and it gets better when I listen to it over and over again. Do yourself a favor and choose it to get the direction of American music. This is the perfect time for American music, and Norah Jones is a talented carrier of a new generation of music, reflecting her growth and evolution. Of course true geniuses like Joanna Newsom, Regina Spektor and Fiona Apple have yet to get the fame they want, but if artists like Jones can win the fame, that proves that justice exists after all that.

There are no more cover songs for songs that were't this, and faint songs that seven people took and wrote. Instead, there are some catchy melodies that take the album from word of mouth to one of those rare - classic bonafides. Music Note - Do not block reviews. The music is great at best, but there's something new. What used to be called \"boring\" is now \"inspired\". You can't sleep in the middle of this album if you pay attention to the songs. It's great to have a record these days that does't just talk about Thando. And even if some of these songs have political messages, they are quiet enough to come to you without bothering you. Also, while I think \"Come Away With Me\" and \"Fells Like Home\" are modern American jazz albums (which many people can argue about, I agree), I think \"Not to Late\" \"His\" Southern \"album, though, speaks to things South Africa does't want to hear about. It's amazing that an album like this could have had an audience without Nora, but I think that's the beauty of it all. What's special is that when it says \"I wish I could\", the opening song. \u06c1\u06cc\u0648\u0648\u06d4 Harmony is perfect. The good thing about this point is that Noora's voice is allowed to shine without distorting any large instrument (like her other album). And while \"Thinking About You\" is polite enough, it's a very simple track - talking about love in a childhood sense as far as possible. I think the can leave songs like that behind. Wouldn't it be too late to win an award, at least twice as much as this album \"Come Come Way Me\"? maybe not. The reason is that Nora no longer sees the \"new\" of the \"new\". However, if you listen to this CD, it's something new in Jones's stable so far. My favourite little episode outside of the opening is \"The Sun Doesn't Like You\" - Listen and Find Out! What fascinates me most about this album is the repeat value \u0645\u06cc\u06ba I've been to work on it almost six times, and listening to it over and over again makes it better. Do yourself a favor and choose it, just to know where American music is going. This is a great time for American music, and it is a testament to its growth and evolution that Nora Jones is the flagship of a new generation of music. Yes, real talents like Joanna Newsom, Regina Specter and Fiona Apple have not yet received the recognition they deserve, but if artists like Jones succeed in gaining fame, it proves to be fair.

I will come back and update this review as I have more time with the CD, but already I am quite taken with it. I have been grabbing everything I can find by \"A Fine Frenzy\" (Alison Sudol) there and elsewhere. I am another who first heard \"A Fine Frenzy\" on Pandora and then bought this there. Alison is an incredibly talented singer with an intriguing style and sense for inflection that is quite wonderful.","overall":5,"summary":"Beautiful, incredible, talent, voice, songs, wow!","unixReviewTime":1308873600,"reviewTime":"06 24, 2011"}

Heath \"Gadgets, Music, & Books\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"Ordinary Riches is the debut CD from Company of Thieves. The group is a trio made up of vocalist Genevieve Schatz, guitarist Marc Walloch, and drummer Mike Ortiz. They produce a rock sound that has plenty of variety. Schatz's voice calls to mind a couple of different singers. At times she seems like a smoothed out version of Dolores O'Riordan from the Cranberries. However she is not a simple copycat as she does't always have the British\/Irish edge to her voice. On some of her sustained notes she also calls to mind Linda Perry of four Non Blondes (remember that song, \"What's Up?\"). While this may seem like an odd blend, it works really well. Instrumentally, Walloch does a more than adequate job on guitars. While I it would be premature to equate him with Utwo's The Edge, this playing is in that style. It's a cleaner sound that would you would her from someone like Jimmy Page for Joe Perry. The song arrangements and additional instruments used also provide a lot of variety in style. \"Even In The Dark\" and \"Quiet On The Front\" are slower, more driven rock songs while \"In Passing\" has almost a slight ska sound to it. \"Oskar Wilde\" is more of a mid tempo rocker. \"Quite On The Front\" also mixes in touches of harmonica and Hammond Bthree morgan. \"Past The Sleep\" is another rocker that fades in the send to a string arrangement of violin and cello. With all of these different styles and instruments, the potential is there for Ordinary Riches to come off like a loss collection of unrelated parts. However the result is much more that of a well seasoned stew. The songwriting on Ordinary Riches is in some ways the most interesting aspect of the CD. It tends to be poetic but not opaquely so. Relationships play a part in a few of the songs including the bookend tracks \"Old Letters\" and \"New Letters\". While the former deals with love gone wrong, the latter gives a more hopeful outlook. The military service influenced \"Quiet On The Front\" opens with \"I can't hold a glass of wine yet\/But they think it's fine to have me hold a gun\". More than half of the songs reflect the general trials of life. \"Oscar Wilde\" expresses this with the line \"We are your own devil\/And we make this world your hell\". \"The Fire Song\" and \"The Tornado Song\" both deal with natural disaster. As these would suggest, the general mood of Ordinary Riches is melancholy and reflective. Overall Company of Thieves has produced an excellent CD in Ordinary Riches. They manage to walk the very fine line of sounding familiar yet fresh at the same time. If you like rock music with a variety of styles among the tracks, give Ordinary Riches a chance. I think you will be glad that you did. Download this: \"Oscar Wilde\"","overall":5,"summary":"Multilayered Debut Rock CD","unixReviewTime":1238025600,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2009"}

The group consists of three groups composed of vocalist Genevieve Schatz, guitarist Marc Walloch, and drummer Mike Ortiz. like Dolores O'Riordan's smoothie from Cranberries. However, she's not an easy copy because she does't always have a voice in the English \/ Irish horn. Some of her regular lyrics are also in Linda Perry's mind as four not Blonde (remember that song, \u201cWhat\u2019s Up?\u201d). Although it seems like one of the unusual combination, it really works well. As a tool, Walloch does more than just the guitar. Although I was too early to match Utwo\u2019s Edge, this game is just that. It\u2019s a clean voice you get from someone like Jimmy Page for Joe Perry. The preparation of the songs and additional instruments used also offer many different styles. \u201cEven In The Dark\u201d and \u201cQuiet On The Front\u201d are slow, lots of rock songs while \u201cIn Passing\u201d almost has a ska sound. \u201cOskar Wilde\u201d is more than just an average biker. \u201cQuite On The Front\u201d also combines a touch of harmonica and Hammond Bthree morgan. \u201cEarly Sleep\u201d is another wave that fades when transmitted in a string arrangement of violin and cello. With all these different features and tools, it is possible for Real Assets to emerge as a collection of lost unrelated components. However, the result is more than just a well -cooked soup. Writing songs about ordinary wealth is in some ways the most interesting thing on CD. Like poetry but not dark. The link plays a part in several songs including the manuscripts \u201cOld Letters\u201d and \u201cNew Letters\u201d. While the former is mistaken for love, the latter provides a beautiful perspective. The military service affected \u201cQuiet In Front\u201d opened \u201cI still can\u2019t afford to hold a glass of wine \/ But they think it\u2019s better to have a gun\u201d. More than half of the songs reflect general life trials. \u201cOscar Wilde\u201d described it in the line \u201cWe are your own demon \/ And we make this world your hell\u201d. Both \u201cSong of Fire\u201d and \u201cSong of Tornado\u201d speak of natural disasters. As they suggest, the general mood of Common Wealth is depression and reflection. In general, Thieves Company produces high quality CDs containing Common Property. They are table to walk the stunning line of familiar new sounds at once. If you like rock music with a different street style, give it a chance at Normal Wealth. I hope you enjoy what you did.

With the release of \"Fearless,\" Taylor Swift showed she was a force to be reckoned with, with her combination of relatable lyrics, catchy music, and a sheer crossover appeal in everything she does. The results are an astonishing four million copies sold in its first year, and counting this release, twelve of the nineteen tracks have been top forty hits, which is a record. Not to mention 'You Belong with Me' & 'Love Story' were the biggest country songs in twenty-some years. With all this success, and never-grateful to her fans, Taylor decided to throw in some bonus tracks and a load of DVD content added to the release. Granted, it's always preferable to do bonus content in the form of an EP, but this is Taylor's thank you for the fans. If you're a fan, you should't complain in buying the album again, if you're not, this really won't change your mind, so don't bother. Musically, it's a true extension of the album, as all of the tracks blend in perfectly. 'Jump Then Fall' is a natural follow-up to her other singles, and the song should take off as her singles tend to do. 'Forever & Always' greatly improves on the original in bringing out the heart and emotion of the song in a great performance. But the real reason why you should buy this is because of her cover of 'Untouchable.' When I first heard the song I was absolutely stunned since I was a big fan of the original as done by the alternative rock band, Luna Halo. Taylor takes a high-energy rock song and strips it down to it's emotional score. The results are nothing short of amazing, as the vocals, lyrics, and restrained instrumentation adds up to a beautiful song, which is breathtaking in its chorus. This is how you should do a cover, and Taylor covers the song perfectly adding a great spin to it. I'd even go as far to say that this is her best work. As for the DVD portion, this is where the fan-service is. Not only does it hold the five music videos that have been made for the album thus far, but it contains the thirty-minute making-of special GAC haired. Add in a photo gallery, a tour behind the scenes, and even the Thug Story video, and you have some two hours of bonus material, which is more than some movies give you. And if you got the live performances, you'll enjoy the great work her band does. Overall, if you're a fan, for you don't have the album yet, I highly recommend this release. Not only does its bonus material go far beyond the normal call of duty, but it's all quality bonus content. If you take anything away from this release, take away \"Untouchable\" off iTunes, it's an amazing track, and it's imperative you check it out. If there was any negative there, it'd be the fact there in't any alternative version to \"Love Story\" for \"You Belong With Me.\" I also got to say I'm a huge fan of the album part & the linear notes part.

If you download anything in this version, download \"Untouchable\" from iTunes, this great track, you should check it out.

True, it\u2019s always better to make bonus items in the form of an EP, but it\u2019s thanks to Taylor\u2019s fans. If you\u2019re a fan, you should\u2019t complain about buying the album again, if you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t really change your mind, so don\u2019t worry. In music, it\u2019s a real extension of the album, as all the tracks are neatly combined. \u2018Jump then Fall\u2019 was a natural follow-up to this other singles, and the song had to find a way to act on its own. \u2018Forever & Always\u2019 greatly enhances the background when the heart and emotions of the song are produced to a large extent. But the real reason you buy it is its \u2018Untouchable\u2019 cover. The first time I heard the song I was really amazed because I was a big fan of the original as did the other rock band, Luna Halo. Taylor sang a high energy rock song and lowered her emotional score. The results are not surprising, as the sounds, songs, and instruments add to a beautiful song, in which this breath is recorded. This is how you should cover the cover, Taylorna covers the song entirely by adding a big change. I would even like to say that this is this best work. In the DVD section, there\u2019s the pride. Not only does it have the top five music videos made for the album so far, but it consists of thirty minutes of doing a unique GAC hairstyle. Add a photo shoot, tour behind the scenes, and even a Thug Story video, and you have up to two hours of bonus stuff, which is more than some movies give you. And if you enjoy live performances, you will enjoy the great work this team does. In general, if you\u2019re a fan, because you don\u2019t have an album yet, I highly recommend this release. Not only are this bonus items far from the standard call of duty, but they are all quality bonus items. If you get anything from this release, get \"Touch\" from iTunes, it's an amazing way, and it's a must watch. If there's any objection there, it's the fact that there's no other way to replace \"Love Story\" with \"You Have Me.\" I can also say that I am a fan of the album section & straight writing section.

{"orig_index":57985,"reviewerID":"A2ULSA0IRUE09E","asin":"B0026NWBY2","reviewerName":"Marc Cabir Davis","helpful":[27,37],"reviewText":"There are two kinds of Beatles fans - those that credit John Lennon & Paul McCartney with being the pillars of the band, and those that appreciate George Harrison for the spiritual, whimsical quality the brought to the team. I fall into the latter category, and those of us who 'get' Harrison, will understand more than anyone what sort of musical genius this man actually was. While McCartney spent years after the bands' breakup making one chorus-y, pop song-filled album after the other, it was Harrison who continually pushed himself to become more and more experimental and creative, and every album of this has been so different, so refreshing, and as a whole, they represent a very diverse catalog of recorded music. Its difficult to imagine that one man could create such varied work, but that remains the wonder that is George. Cut to two thousand and nine, and we have the third officially released compilation of George's greatest hits. I guess we have Dhani Harrison to thank for this, and while I rate this five stars, it should have ideally been a two-CD set, considering the wealth of material that Harrison has behind him. As a listener who considers \"All Things Must Pass\" as the best solo album by a Beatle (nothing by Lennon for McCartney comes close - those Paul did surpass himself with \"Chaos & Creation\" from a few years ago), this album pays fine homage to that three-CD set. The issue is that ALL of Harrisons' solo works are so absolutely essential, that culling tracks from any of them borders on unjustifiable - but of course that needs to be done in the case of a Greatest Hits collection. His second solo album, \"Living in the Material World\" (which sold less than this debut, but is still a classic) should have been given more due. The lead single from that set, \"Give me Love (Give me Peace on Earth)\" has all the strains of this Bangladesh concert - and this is present there, sounding better than never before. The prime omissions come from \"Dark Horse\", which remains one of Harrisons' lowest-charting and most underrated CDs. Any listener should try to track down a copy of that album (just for its stunning cover part, if nothing else), as it contains so many vital Harrison classics, such as \"Far East Man\" and \"Simply Shady\". You will also find that much of George's output from the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy has been neglected there, which is a pity. Some of this best work came on \"thirty-three one\/three\" from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, and this self-titled record from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine (which thankfully is represented on this hits collection). Along the way, there are some oddities. \"Cheer Down\", which previously was only a compilation track, was also a song written with Tom Petty for the \"Lethal Weapon two\" soundtrack - many people have never heard of this song, so this is a great inclusion. Also, this record contains the three songs that George made magical for The Beatles - \"Something\", \"Here Comes the Sun\", and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". While no one can deny the beauty of these songs, it would have been great to see them excluded in favor of some of George's solo works in this later career - there are so many hits that are not represented, especially many of this UK singles that failed to chart in the US. The Beatles songs that are present on this album are in fact from Harrisons' solo Bangladesh concert recording - which is little comfort to those of us expecting tracks from \"Somewhere in England\", for \"Gone Troppo\" (two more vastly underrated solo Harrison records). On a better note, \"When We Was Fab\" from \"Cloud Nine\" is present. Finally, this is not a perfect collection, but certainly the best Harrison collection that is currently available. His first compilation, from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, is clearly not this best effort, considering how much it relied upon this Beatles hits to flesh itself out. The current disc should have indeed been a double disc, but the attention paid to the song selection is satisfying. Still, this is by no means a comprehensive Harrison collection. I doubt anything can be. He is one recording artist whose back-catalog is hardly remembered and always overlooked. I personally consider much of this solo work better and even more listenable than this work with the Beatles.\"Let It Roll\" runs for seventy-eight minutes, which is great because it is indeed 'stuffed' with Harrison hits (technically, all of this Billboard Hot one hundred hits are present there). As an introduction to a quiet and talented songwriter, this is a stellar way to get into this work and life. As a stand-alone disc, this is riveting and vibrant. For Beatles fans and longtime Harrison followers such as myself, this will fall way off the mark, but taken for what it is, this is a loving compilation that deserves all the sales and adoration it can get. Five Stars.","overall":5,"summary":"Vital & Essential : How They (Almost) Got It Right","unixReviewTime":1245110400,"reviewTime":"06 16, 2009"}

Acknowledge for I fall into the latter category, and those of us who 'found' Harrison will understand more than anyone what kind of musician the really was. When McCartney spent years splitting into single-course groups, an album full of pop songs, it was Harrison who insisted on finding and creating himself, and all the albums are still very different, refreshing and Overall represent a diverse catalog. Mostly recorded music. It's hard to imagine a man making such a diverse career, but it's still George's miracle. Cut to two thousand nine, and we have the third officially released collection of George's best hats. I think we have Dhani Harrison grateful for that, and when I rated these five stars, it should have been a set with two CDs, given that Harrison has this There is a wealth of things behind. As an audience member who considers \"All Things Must Pass\" to be the main album of the Beatles album (McCartney's Lennon is not approaching anything - the jones from whom Paul has spent the last few years in \"Chaos & Creation\" Passed along), this album plays. Respect this good set of three CDs. The problem is that all of Harrison's solo activities are so important that removing any of these tracks is limited to non-compliance - however this needs to be done in the case of the greatest hits collection. His second solo album \"Living in the Material World\" (sold under the original song, but older) had to be added. The hit single, \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" is the hallmark of this Bangladeshi concert - and it's there, it sounds better than never. The main mistake comes from \"The Black Horse\", which is always one of Harrison's CDs with the lowest and lowest charts. Any listener should try to trace a copy of this album (partly on its amazing cover, if nothing else), as it contains important Harrison classics, such as \"Far East Man\". And \"just shaded.\" You will also find it regrettable that what George released out of thousands, nine hundred and seventy, was ignored. Some of these leading works come from \"one thousand nine hundred and seventy-six\" to \"thirty-three\", as well as this record one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five (thankfully represented in these hats. Collection). Along the way, something unusual happened. \"Cheer Down\", which was previously a completion song, was also a song written by Tom Patty for the soundtrack \"Lethal Weapon Two\" - a lot of people would never have heard that song, so it's a lot. In addition, the record includes three songs that George performed magically for the Beatles - \"Something\", \"Hair Comes the Sun\", and \"Crying for Wild My Guitar Grace\". While no one can deny the beauty of these songs, it's nice to see that some of George's solo songs have been left out - a lot of hit songs should't be missed, especially in the UK. The Beatles' songs on the album, which failed to get married in the United States, actually come from the recording of Harrison's solo concert in Bangladesh - which is less satisfying for those of us who are interested in \"Somewhere in England\". Expect songs from \"Gone Troppo\" (Harrison's two lower records). For a better note, \"Where We Are\" from \"Cloud Nine\" is available. Definitely Harrison's available at the moment Great collection. His first collection, of one thousand nine hundred and sixty-six, is clearly not the best effort, considering how much the Beatles' strike relied on to get it. The current disc was supposed to be a double disc, but the focus on song selection is satisfying. However, this is by no means the complete Harrison collection. I doubt anything can happen. He is one of the recording artists to have a memorable and often overlooked catalog. I personally find a large part of this work better and more responsible than the Beatles' work. As an introduction to a quiet and talented singer, this is a great way to get into this career and life. As a stand-alone disc, it is attractive and healthy. For Beatles fans and longtime Harrison fans like me, that would be far from the mark, but whatever it is, it's a collection of love that deserves all the sales and compliments I get. Five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"Vital & Essential : How They (Almost) Got It Right","unixReviewTime":1245110400,"reviewTime":"06 16, 2009"}

I am of the last class. Those of us who \"get\" Harrison know better than anyone what kind of intellectual music is. Although McCartney spent several years producing chorus albums full of popular songs after the band's disbandment, Harrison continued to push himself for more and more testing and expertise, and each album is a very different, refreshing, and generally, representing a different catalog of recorded music. It\u2019s hard to imagine that one person could create such colourful works, but this is still George\u2019s miracle. Editing in two thousand and nine, we have the third officially released compilation of George\u2019s hot songs. I think we would like to thank Dan Harrison Although I am counting these five stars, considering the richness of material Harrison has, it is best to have two CDs. As a listener who believes \"All Things Pass\" is the Beatles' best album (any album Lennon has done for McCartney is incomparable - Paul surpassed it with \"Disruption and Nature\" a few years ago.), The album has paid a fair price for the three CD collections. The problem is that all of Harrison's activities are necessary, and it does't make sense to trace any of them - but this is exactly what needs to be done in the context of the Greatest Hits collection. His second album album \"Living in the World of Material\" (sold under the first, but still classic) should have gotten more of its return. The lead singer of the band \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" contains all the music for this Bangladesh concert - this song came out there and sounds better than never. The only exception is from the \"black horse\", which is Harrison's lowest level and the lowest CD. Any listener should try to get a copy of the album (with its amazing coverage, if nothing else), as it contains many of Harrison's classic artefacts such as \"Far Eastern\" and \"Simply Shady\". You\u2019ll find that most of George\u2019s one thousand, nine hundred and seventy results were ignored there, sadly. Some of the best works appear in \"Thirty Three One \/ Three\" in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, and this album with the same name dates back to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine (fortunately, this is represented in these hits)) collection). Along the way there are strange things. \"Drop Down\" was a mix song before, and it was a song composed by Tom Petty on the sound of \"Lethal Weapon II\" - a lot of people have never heard this song, so this is a good collection. In addition, the record also contains three songs composed by George of the Beatles - \"Something\", \"Here comes the Sun\" and \"While I'm Crying Sweet Guitar\". While no one can deny the beauty of these songs, it\u2019s nice to see that they have become less involved in supporting some of George\u2019s later works in this career - there are too many unrepresented songs, especially many British songs that have failed. chart in the United States. Beatles songs from this album are from the only Harrison concert in Bangladesh - uncomfortable for us as we look forward to the songs \"Somewhere in England\" because \"Gone with the Troppo\" (two Harrison records were. Very low)). Even better, \"When We Were a Fab\" in \"Cloud Nine\" appeared. In the send, this is not the perfect series, but it is certainly the best Harrison series currently available. His first compilation, of one, nine hundred and seventy-six songs, was clearly not the best effort, considering how much it depends on the Beatles' song to enrich themselves. The current disc should actually be a disc-disc, but the heart of the selection is still satisfied. However, this is not a Harrison collection. I doubt anything will work. He is a recording artist, this background catalog is not remembered and is often overlooked. I personally think most solo works are better and easier to listen to than the Beatles. \"Let It Roll\" iran for seventy-eight minutes, which is great because it \"mixed\" Harrison's songs (technically, the whole Billboard Hot has a big click). As an introduction to a quiet and talented songwriter, this is a great way to get into this career and life. Like a stand-alone CD, it is interesting and lively. For Beatles fans and long-time Harrison fans like me, this will be an out-of-the-box target, but in itself, this is a love combination that is perfect for all sales and compliments. Five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"Vital & Essential : How They (Almost) Got It Right","unixReviewTime":1245110400,"reviewTime":"06 16, 2009"}

I can imagine that the band may close a few fair weather fans with this album, but those who remain will find a wholly enjoyable album that gets better with each listen. Coheed and Cambria are not a band you could never accuse of stagnation. Perhaps `Departure,' is too strong, but this album is certainly different, the album seems to make a conscious effort not to sound too much like two thousand and seven's `No World For Tomorrow,' album, eschewing the slick almost overproduced sound and bright tones for an almost industrial sound, with more electronics, flatter tones and an abundance of samples, electro drums, odd guitar tones and vocal effects. Drummer Chris Pennie is a perfect fit for this band, and fits perfectly with the band's established drum style on songs like `World of Lines,' and `The Broken,' but adds a whole new flavor to the excellent almost drum solo quality `Guns of Summer,' and `In The Flame of Error,' which are at times unlike anything you've never heard on a Coheed album before. The songwriting also seems to be more in line with the band's work before Good Apollo than after, but all the new tones, sounds and Claudio's vocals stop this from sounding like a rehash of new ideas, but rather a new era of Coheed all together. Lyrically, the album seems to be a lot more personal than the previous two albums and features barely any reference to place names, character names, for words like `Prise,' `Mon-Star,' for `Key Frame,' this may please some sections of the fans and upset others, but given the quality of the lyrics and vocal performance few will be disappointed in any serious way. Highlights include the fast potential single `World Of Lines,' the drumming masterpiece `In The Flame of Error,' and the superb semi-ballad `Pearl of the Stars,' which features some brilliant unusual percussion, beautiful guitar work and possibly Claudio's finest vocal performance to date, switching between new low pitched vocals and this traditional style to great effect.

This feeling is almost like a tool. I think the band can turn off a few right-wing fans for this album, but the jones that remain will find the most interesting album never with every listener. Martyrs and Cambria are not a party you can never blame for standing up. 'Walking' may be very powerful, but this album is very different. \u06d4 , An abundance of flat tones and patterns, electro drums, unusual guitar tones and sound effects. Drummer Chris Penny fits the band well, and fits the band's style well, based on songs such as \"World of Lions\" and \"The Broken\" but a new, one-of-a-kind Adds The taste of 'Guns of Summer' and 'In the Flame of Error', sometimes unlike anything you have never heard before on the album. Songwriting is also more compatible with the band's work than after Good Apollo, but all the new tones, voices and Claudio's words prevent it from sounding like a renewal of new ideas, but a brand new chad is far away. \u06d4 In terms of music, this album seems more personal than the previous two albums and includes place names, character names, names such as `prize,` `moon-star,` `` key frame, 'which can be fun. Absolutely no reference. Some types of fans make others angry too, but if you look at the quality of the words and the performance of the words, some will be critically disappointed. Highlights include World of Lines, World of Lions, Drumming Masterpiece, The Flame of Error, and Pearl of the Stars Majestic, with exceptional clashing, excellent guitarwork and perhaps the best performance of Claudio's voice so far, the new Switch between flows. The voices and this traditional style have had a positive effect. It's all a great Chad and Cambria album and listening to prizes.

In terms of melody, the album looks more personal than the previous two albums and does not show reference to location names, brand names, words like `` Rewards '', `` Mon-Star '' , '' Frame Key '' 'Some angry fans and others, but due to the quality of the words and voice performance will pretty much fail in any serious way. Drummer Chris Pennie fits this group, and it fits the drumming style of the group of songs like \u2018World of Lines\u2019 and \u2018The Broken\u2019, but it adds a new flavor to the quality of the single best that drum \u2018Guns\u2019 of the Summer. , 'and' In the Flame of Error, 'which is sometimes different from anything you've heard before on Coheed's album.

Lyrically, the album seems to be a lot more personal than the previous two albums and features barely any reference to place names, character names, for words like `Prise,' `Mon-Star,' for `Key Frame,' this may please some sections of the fans and upset others, but given the quality of the lyrics and vocal performance few will be disappointed in any serious way. Drummer Chris Pennie is a perfect fit for this band, and fits perfectly with the band's established drum style on songs like `World of Lines,' and `The Broken,' but adds a whole new flavor to the excellent almost drum solo quality `Guns of Summer,' and `In The Flame of Error,' which are at times unlike anything you've never heard on a Coheed album before. Highlights include the fast potential single `World Of Lines,' the drumming masterpiece `In The Flame of Error,' and the superb semi-ballad `Pearl of the Stars,' which features some brilliant unusual percussion, beautiful guitar work and possibly Claudio's finest vocal performance to date, switching between new low pitched vocals and this traditional style to great effect. `Year of the Black Rainbow,' is a fine album indeed, maybe a little different than some may have been expecting but of undeniably high quality, in terms of superb songwriting, outstanding musicianship and a production job that feels almost like an instrument unto itself. The songwriting also seems to be more in line with the band's work before Good Apollo than after, but all the new tones, sounds and Claudio's vocals stop this from sounding like a rehash of new ideas, but rather a new era of Coheed all together. Overall this is a superb Coheed and Cambria album and rewards repeat listening; the new drummer, the very noticeable production and the new lyrical approach keep the album very fresh.","overall":5,"summary":"Coheed And Cambria - Year Of The Black Rainbow","unixReviewTime":1311465600,"reviewTime":"07 24, 2011"}

One bad routing can cause a lot of damage to any band's reputation, but that's something Clutch will never have to worry about. This band is so consistent, coming out of the blocks rocking on the title track a dynamic, vocally bombastic, full blooded banger due to Neil Fallon's characteristic intensity. The next cuts, \"Terminal Velocity\" and \"Mister Freedom\" continue the flow matching the opener step for step. The band has stated that \"Earth Rocker will be a more harder and straight forward rocking album.\" I believe they nailed it. On and on it goes, with every passing track the realization is that there in't going to be a decline in quality, and that they may have produced an album that ranks up there comfortably with the best of their career. Tim Sult is probably better than most band's top basemen on this worst day and JP Gaster's rock drumming makes it look easy, but honorable mention goes to Neil Fallon as usual, for this \"mixture of demented preacher speaking in tongues mixed with no frills blue collar rocker that sets them apart from the competition.\" The man has buckets of personality which overflow into the lyrics and the music. I read. \"Earth Rocker is a rollicking heavy rock ride that showcases Clutch at the top of their game once again. With their 'no-filler, all-killer' logic and a fan-pleasing alteration in style, the outfit have churned out one of the their most widely appealing efforts thus far, not to mention a staple release for salt-rockers in two thousand and thirteen.\"The blues cuts and influences are not missing altogether, \"D. C. Sound Attack!\" is the song that has some of the most obvious blues influences. All the itunes are catchy and there is tons of energy happening there. Yeah, like Clutch is going to be laid back, LOL. So crank it up and blow out your speakers, as Dan Maines quotes. \"I think this record comes closer to really capturing that energy of Clutch live. It's a very balanced album. There's no B-side material. It's an album of A-sides. That sounds pretty bold and confident, but that's the way we feel about Earth Rocker.\"I can't wait to receive my copy to listen to the total album rather than the snippets and you tube videos that are out there.
