257,"This movie takes the plot behind the sci-fi flick ""Doppelganger"" (an astronaut from your Earth crashing on a 'counter-Earth' on the opposite side of the Sun, and the Cold War totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and TV is probably better off for it. Everyone there is perfectly adequate in a 'made for TV' way. Cameron Mitchell turns in this usual solid performance. So does Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man's John Saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the 'World Order' on counter Earth. But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the black of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this Sci-Fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad. I'll give one example: in the original template for this pilot, (""Doppleganger""), the astronauts close control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence (it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling trains and winds, only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers. In ""Stranded in Space"", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound, things start shaking, and the camera blurs into a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was pretty obvious that the factors were simply shaking themselves on their seats, the director was't even shaking the camera for the set). I've seen episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"" that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made-for-TV mediocrity. And that, in essence, is what's wrong with ""Stranded In Space"". No budget, no time, no imagination. just making the token gestures and hoping the sci-fi Fan Boys' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. Sorry, guys, it did't work. I'm sure that everyone there just finished their work on this one and walked away, and never thought of it again, except as a listing on their C. V. And that's what you, the viewer will do. You'll remember, if pressed, that you once watched a TV movie called ""Stranded In Space"", but it made no lasting impression on you, and you can't recall too much about it.",negative
257,"""Stuck in Space"" is trying to turn the part of ""doppelganger"" into a TV series. But the trick has subsided, and the TV could have been better. The low budget and low energy and inconsistent text tie it tightly to the sci-fi adventure for beginners.",negative
257,"The film tells the story behind the science fiction movie ""Doppelganger"" (the astronauts of the world crashed into ""anti-earth"" against the sun, and the dictatorial spirit of war in that world)) and tried to put it in Become a television pilot episode. However, everything went awry, and the TV could have gotten better. Everyone is there enough to ""make TV"". Cameron Mitchell (Cameron Mitchell) demonstrated this consistent work. The same is true of Glenn Corbett (who appears to be poor John Saxon), who plays an independent man, and whose presence threatens the very foundations of the ""world order"" of the world. But low budget, low power, incompatible scripts, and any real darkness in set design and cinematography make this science fiction adventure film film firmly tied to the launch pad. Let me give you an example. Then, the two astronauts staggered helplessly into the crash of their car on a roaring train and a gust of wind, but were knocked down by an unknown man shouting through a loudspeaker. In ""Stand at a distance"", when the sound was bringing, the astronauts were sitting in their seats, things began to shake and the camera turned off the controller did not move the camera). I have watched episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Out Limits"", and compared to the lengths produced on television, they require more effort to establish the situation and the situation. At the heart of it is the problem of ""stranded in space"". No budget, no time, no imagination. Just make a symbolic gesture, hoping that the imagination and enthusiasm of science fiction fans will fill the rest. Sorry guys, it does't work. I’m sure everyone there completed this project and left, never thinking about it again, except for a list of their progress. This is what you are going to do, audience. If you click it, you'll remember watching a movie on TV called ""Space Stranded"", but it has no effect on you, and you can't remember much.",negative

257,"The film takes a plot behind the sci-fi sky ""Doppel Ginger"" (a space shuttle on your side of 'Counter Earth' on the other side of the sun, and the dictatorial Cold War on this planet). And try to make him the pilot of the series for TV. However, everything sank without a trace, and TV is probably the best of them all. Everyone there is satisfied with the way it was made for TV. Cameron Mitchell turned to this solid routine. Similarly, Glenn Corbett (who looks like poor man John Saxon) plays the role of a strong man whose current existence is a threat to the earth counter based on the 'World Order'. But low budgets and low power and conflicting scripts and set designs and the blackness of any real thinking in cinema keeps this sci-fi adventure firmly entrenched in the launch pad. I'll give an example: In this pilot's original template, (""Doppel Ginger""), the astronauts control their vehicle when it thunders, and then crash their plane in a horrible order (it was clear that their plane Never flies again) Then the two astronauts staggered between the smoky trains of their vehicle and the strong winds, causing only the desperate people to scream and kill through the loudspeaker. In ""Trapped Space"", the astronauts are sitting on their seats when it resonates, things start to move, and the camera goes dark (and as a friend pointed out, it was very clear that things were just shaking the seats). The director did not do this. He even moved the camera to the seat. I've seen episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Outer Boundaries"" that have worked harder than emotionally and setup for TV. And what is wrong with, in fact, ""trapped in space""? No budget, no time, no thought. Just to touch the token and hopefully science will fill the rest of the fan boys' imagination and enthusiasm. Sorry, logo, it did't work. I'm sure everyone out there just finished their work on it and left, and the never thought about it again, except for C's list. V.

575,"The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of this girlfriend. Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) did't like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to. The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and the was made king. So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime. I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the one thousand, nine hundred and forty. I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been table to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother's film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but this jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, the just seemed to prattle pointlessly. His only funny quality was that the looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as ""who's on first"" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit for timing. In fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. I knew that ""who's on first"" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist. Once again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave six's to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey. Where was all the humour?!",negative

575,"The film begins with Wheeler entering the girl's room. Her aunt (Edna May Oliver — the most talented person in the movie) did not like Wheeler — I understand this feeling easily. My aunt decided to take this wonderful lady abroad to keep her away from Wheeler. They left, and Wheeler invested in the revolution in a beautiful little kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At the same time, Woolsey belonged to that amazing little kingdom and was made king. So when Wheeler came, the boys would fight, but they refused because they were already friends - which disappointed the people because killing and taking the place of the chief was a national pastime. I’m a big fan of Hollywood’s golden page comedy — since the silent era of the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys. I have watched and reviewed hundreds for thousands of movies. Although I am full of love and appreciation for these movies, I did not realize the attraction of Wheeler and Woolsey - this is the only possibility and the Ritz is as bad as a comedy. ask brother! Although they were very successful in their short career in Hollywood (short because of the earlier death of Robert Woolsey), I did not see that almost all the other successful teams made the same basic idea, but much better. For example, this movie has many reminiscences of Marx's brothers' movie ""Duck Soup"", but ""Broken Nuts"" did't make me laugh. ""Duck soup"" is a silly and very interesting game. Sometimes, Woolsey speaks a little like Groucho, but these jokes don’t make a difference, even remotely funny! After all, the conversation seems pointless. His only interesting quality is that the looks stupid — certainly there is not enough reason for him to be in the movie. In addition, the Wheeler has a comic charm of a piece of cheese - a piece of cheese that sings badly! Another missed opportunity was an old Vudeville exhibition that was later promoted by Abbott and Costello as “who will go first.” This was done in the movie, but it was not wise at the time. After all, soon after they started talking, they stopped doing their own thing — making you anxious ahead of time. I know ""who's going first"" has been around for years and has been used by many teams, but I want to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair go and give it their own. I also found another great quality movie duo. While I have to admit that I love some of their films (such as SILLY BILLIES and RAINMAKERS — actually I scored six points on IMDb), but this is a great endurance test that needs to be completed — I find that everything will happen. I always watch Wheeler and Woolsey movies. Where does humour come from? !",negative

I’m a big fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood - the era of silence up to a thousand, nine hundred and forty. I’ve seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of films even though I love and appreciate these films, I can’t sit at the table to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey-the only comedy group that could be bad for the Ritz Brothers and sisters! Although I’ve been successful in their short career in Hollywood (abbreviated as the late Robert Woolsey), I can’t help but learn that almost every successful team has come up with the same basic ideas but better. For example, there are a lot of things in this movie that remind me of the Marx Brother movie, DUCK SOUP, but CRUCED NUTS did’t make me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a fool and very enjoyable. Sometimes, Woolsey speaks a bit like Groucho, but this joke never has punch lines and even laughs from afar! In fact, it was as if the had just scratched it in vain. His only ridiculous quality is the goofy look - certainly not good enough reason to put it in the film. Plus, Wheeler had the comedy appeal of a very hard piece of cottage cheese! A missed opportunity was the former Vaudeville tradition that was later recognized by Abbott and Costello as the “first” to be made in this film but it made no justification for the time. In fact, shortly after they started flirting, they finished the task - quickly and frustrated. I know “first” has been used for years by many groups, but I really want to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist. Again, I saw another movie below this one. While I must admit that I liked some of their films slightly (like SILLY BILLIES and RAINMAKERS - which I actually gave six months to IMDb), it was a great test of endurance to complete - something which I often see when I watch Wheeler and Woolsey movies.

4336,"Norman, Is That You? was (this is all third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) adapted to an African American family from a Jewish one, when it made the transition off stage and onto screen. Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theatre can't have been that great. Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. What I wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a PERIOD PIECE: it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early seventy about finding out you have a gay son for daughter in your family. For that reason alone, it's pretty interesting- if not a little ""hollywood"". Don't believe me? Check out lines about curtains, etc. Very stereotypical. Not too deep.

Additionally, it is one of the first videos filmed, so the production of the platform is not ideal. However, Redd Foxx and others performed well. What I want to tell you is this movie of the movie era: it reflects the attitude from the middle to the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys to discover that there is a gay son in your family who wants to raise a girl. For this reason alone, it is very interesting - if not the ""Hollywood"" little thing. don't you trust me See lines about curtains, etc. Very stereotyped. Not too deep. but. This movie really shines in many ways. When Redd Foxx tried to find a wife, there was a split case in which the and this brother (!) Fled to Ensenada, carrying an extended Pinto. A across-country telephone conversation will never be forgotten. but. The highlight of the movie is when Wayland Flowers and this wife do this / their gay style, which they did in gay bars and nightclubs before. To my knowledge, this is the only way to shoot.

8405,"When I was sixteen I saw the documentary: ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"". I actually liked, and believed in it for a couple of years. But then I grew up, and began to think, and when I had sought more information. This is: more info from reel sources, and non-biased sources. When I started at university, not so long ago, i asked an assistant-professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories. What the said shocked me: He said that all those theories where lies. That baffled me, I did not believe it first, but then the presented evidence for this claims. He quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject: ""humans did not go to the moon"". The most outrages claim was that the Apollo-craft could not travel through the Van-Allen-radiation-Belt, without the crew perishing from radiation. The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminium-anti-radiation-alloy. It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well, why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians, then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation. And then there is the biggest evidence of all: The Moon Stones. When the Apollo-missions DID go to the moon, they brought back many rocks from the moon, to give to geologists and similar scientists, who are documenting all things about the moon. These rocks and stones are IN FACT FROM THE MOON. Because: the internal basic elements, which all matter consist of, are also made of special isotopes, that are different from quarry to quarry, land to land, and especially planet from planet. The isotopes of these rocks and stones have been Proved, that they do not come from earth. The astronauts brought home HUNDREDS of Kilogram's of these rocks, all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth, and from the same planet. Ergo: The moon-landings where not fake. NASA did go to another planet: the moon, though it is not a planet, but a satellite to a planet, a moon (duuh). These rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world. It has been proved: Humans did go to the moon - it is a fact, pronto. But I do not worry: most conspiracy-theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated, that is mostly why they do not know for lie about these facts. The fact remains: Humans did walk on the moon.",negative

Shortly after starting college, I asked my assistant professor of astronomy for the conspiracy theories. This sentence shocked me: He said all those theories exist. This confused me, I did not believe at first, but then I gave evidence of this claim. He quickly disputed many theories on the subject: ""People who do not live on the moon."" The worst part is that the Apollo spacecraft will not pass through the Van Allen meter belt, and the crew will not be killed by the light. The fact is that Americans use aluminium alloy which is not mixed with radiation. It is not very popular. Direct speculation is confidential. Why this is a secret: Yes, why did they reveal it then? ? If they were in a space race with the Russians, it would be foolish to reveal that they have new technologies that could protect workers from radiation. Then there is the greatest proof: the gems of the moon. When the Apollo mission landed on the moon, they retrieved several gems from the moon and gave them to geologists and scientists alike who were recording everything about the moon. These rocks and boulders came from the moon. This is because: the basic elements of the universe that make up everything are made of special toxins, which differ from the mines, the earth and the earth, especially the planets and planets. The isotopes of these rocks and rocks have been proven to have not originated in the earth. Astronauts have returned hundreds of kilograms of these rocks, all of which appear to have come from a single planet except Earth. Ergo: The position of the moon is not real. NASA has gone to another planet: the moon. The stones are distributed in laboratories and universities around the world. The facts are clear: people came to earth on the moon — this is true, soon. But I'm not worried: most conspirators in general are unemployed and illiterate, which is why they don't know how to lie about these facts. The fact remains: humans have gone to the moon.",negative
8405,"When I was sixteen, I saw a documentary: ""Funny things happened on the way to the moon."" I actually loved it, and I believed in it for a few years. But then as I got older, I started thinking, and when I wanted more details. These are: Rail sources, and more information from neutral sources. When I started studying at university, I recently asked an assistant professor of astronomy about conspiracy theories. Jehovah surprised me: the said that all these visions were false. It shocked me, I did't believe it at first, but then the evidence for these claims was presented. He soon dispelled most of this thoughts on the subject: ""People have never been to the moon."" Even more disturbing is the fact that the Apollo craft van Allen could not fly in the radiation belt, without the death of workers in the rays. The fact is that the Americans secretly use aluminium anti-radiation devices. Very little is known. And the exact details are confidential. And why is it a secret: well, why should they expose you again? If you are in a space race with the Russians, it would be foolish to say that they have new technology that can protect workers from radiation. Then there is the greatest proof: the rocks of the moon. When Apollo DID emissions go to the moon, they bring back many rocks from the moon, giving them to geologists and the same scientists who write everything about the moon. These rocks and stones are true of medicine. Because: The basic internal elements, which contain all the essentials, are also made up of special isotopes, which vary from year to year, from earth to earth and especially from planet to planet. The isotopes of these rocks and rocks have proven that they do not come from the earth. Astronauts are bringing home the color of these rocks, all shown outside the Earth and from the same planet. Therefore: the arrival of the moon when it is not true. NASA has visited another planet: the moon, although not a planet, but a satellite of the planet, the moon (Doha). The stones have been distributed to laboratories and universities around the world. Proven: People go to the moon - it's true, it's a protocol. But I'm not worried: most white ideologues are usually unemployed and uneducated, which is why they don't lie about these facts. The fact is: humans walk on the moon.",negative
8405,"When I was sixteen I saw the document: ""Something funny happened on Moon Road"". I loved it dearly, and believed it for several years. But then I grew up, and I started to think, and as I searched for more information. These include: more information from recall sources, and non -partisan sources. When I started college, not too long ago, I asked the assistant professor of astronomy about conspiracy theories. He said the was shocked: He said all those views were untrue. I was confused, I did not believe at first, but then the evidence presented in this claim. He was quick to refute most theories on the subject: “People don’t go to the moon”. The most annoying claim is that the Apollo-craft cannot walk the Van-Allen-radiation-Belt, without staff dying from radiation. The truth is that the United States uses aluminium for radiation protection. Less well known. Exact instructions are confidential. And why is it secret: Why did they return it? If they are competing in space with Russia, then it is very foolish to show that they have new technology that can protect the ship’s crew. Then there is the greatest proof of all: the Stone of the Moon. When the Apollo-mission DID went to the moon, they brought a lot of rocks from the moon, to give them to geologists and similar scientists, who recorded everything about the moon. These rocks and stones are what the Moon really has. Because: The basic internal elements, which make up all the elements, are also composed of special isotopes, which vary from rock to rock, earth to earth, and especially planet Earth. The impurities of these rocks and stones have been proven not to originate from the earth. Astronomers have taken home hundreds of kilograms of these rocks, all of which have been confirmed to have come from the shore, and a planet. Radio Ergo: Non-fake landing. NASA went to another planet: the moon, though not a planet, but a satellite orbiting the planet, the moon (duh). These stones have been distributed to laboratories and universities around the world. It’s clear: People went to the moon - it’s a fact, pronto. But I’m not worried: most conspiracy theorists are generally unemployed and ignorant, which they often don’t acknowledge the lies about these facts. The truth is: People walk on the moon.",negative

13393,"Secret Sunshine marks the return of director Lee Changdong to the film-making world after a multi-year absence. Having three critically acclaimed films already under this belt, the recruits now veteran thespian Jeon Doyeon and her considerable (Cannes-winning) talents for the primary role of Lee Shinae. What follows is a journey through one woman's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms. One of the things that becomes apparent while watching Secret Sunshine is that it does't really care to follow any specific genre, but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it's trying to convey. The story itself follows Lee Shinae as she moves with her son to the city of Milyang (whose Sino-Corean translates to Secret Sunshine). She moves to Milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was this hometown, so the film is born from tragedy. And you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice-guy mechanic Jongchan (played by Song Kangho). But this in't a romantic comedy. As we (and Jongchan, doggedly) follow Shinae as she encounters Milyang and the fate that it has in store for her, the cracks in her farmer quickly become apparent. She is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it's not enough. Secret Sunshine still manages to follow a mostly Aristotelian dramatic marc, but pulls back on the catharsis, which might confound some viewers, especially the ending, but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of Milyang, the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied, once I started to think over the film some more. Ms. Jeon is rather impressive throughout, especially considering that if the role were any less well played, it would've quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama, but she captures the nuances of Shinae's attempts to deal with her losses with a player of subtlety. Mr. Song has a much smaller role in this film than other films, but the performs adequately, appropriately giving stage to Ms. Jeon. Technically, the film is well done in a classical sense. No flashy aesthetics are employed there--the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself. I think my only real complaint, and one that might not be table to be fixed, is that despite all the time we spend with Shinae, there is a bit of distance between Shinae and the audience (or at least, me). I think some of this stems from the nature of the work, because if total empathy were pushed, then we would't be table to see the problems that Shinae has objectively. On the other hand, I never felt moved along with Shinae's plight, despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior. All the same, the film still stands quite impressive, especially in that it stimulated me to think about it, the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy, coping, self-deception, isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running.

With three critically acclaimed films, the employer now has experience with factor Jon Do-yeon and this talent (Cannes award) in the lead role of Lee Sinai. What follows is a woman's traumatic journey and a review of her approach to the situation. The only thing that is noticeable when you look at Secret Sunshine is that you don’t care about following any style, but you choose the type of characters to convey something that you want to convey when needed. The story itself tells the story of Li Shina and her son moving to Miryang City (Korean ""secret sunlight""). After the death of her husband, she moved to Miryang, because this is her hometown, so the movie was born out of tragedy. He thinks things could be better because the opened a piano shop and met Zhong Can (played by Kanghao Song). But it’s not romantic comedy. When we (and Zhongcan, resolutely) followed Shinae and met Milyang and the fate we had prepared for her, the cracks of her farmers soon became apparent. She is a troubled woman, trying to take her strength to overcome this tragedy, we looked at her and found that this was not enough. The Secret Sunshine is still table to follow in the footsteps of the Aristotelian drama, but it has dispelled catharsis, which may confuse some viewers, especially the ending, but the symbol of the novel depicted in Millian's name, the Sunshine dialogue and the film of the image used. in a very good movie and I am very satisfied, when I start thinking about this movie more. Ms. Quan is amazing from start to finish, especially when you consider that the role is not well-played, it will soon be a breaking piece of music, but the team Shinae is trying to deal with a clever factor Lost. The role of Song in this movie is much smaller than in other films, but it performs well and provides a good platform for Ms. Quan. Technically speaking, this movie does a great job in the usual way. There is no splendour - the director clearly wants the story to be told. I think it is my real complaint, and perhaps the most unresolved issue, is that although we have spent all your time with Shinae, there is still a small distance between Shinae and the audience (or at least me). I think some of it comes from the kind of work, because if we were completely sympathetic, we would’t be focusing directly on the problems Shinae is experiencing. On the other hand, other than Shinae's tears and morals will get worse, I've never been impressed with Shinae's condition. Apart from this, the film has left a profound impact on people, especially because it inspires the way I think, the deeper meaning it expresses and its manifestation in tragedy, resistance to self-deception, self-doubt and faith at the send of the film. , they bothered me and I iran away.

Already with three acclaimed films, current great Thespian veterans John Dwayne and Lee Sheen have their great talents in the first role (who won the year). The following is a test of a woman's journey through grief and strategies for dealing with it. One of the things that becomes clear when you watch The Secret Sunshine is that it does't really care about following a particular gender, but picks up the characteristics of that gender where necessary so that it To show what it is trying to convey. The story follows Lee Sheen himself as the travels to the town of Malinga with this son (whose name is Sino-Korean, which translates as Secret Sunshine). She moved to Malang after her husband's death, as happened in the city, so the film is born of tragedy. And the thinks things can get better when the opens a piano shop and meets a handsome young mechanic named Jongchan (played by Song Kangho). But this is not a romantic joke. As we (and Jongchen) follow Shinai when she meets Milliang and the fate she has set aside for him, her farmer's violation soon becomes apparent. She is an anxious woman who is trying her best to control her grief and we see that she finds that it is not enough. The Secret Sun is still table to follow the mark of Aristotle the Great, but it goes back to Catharsis, which may confuse some viewers, especially the send, but the symbol of the novel is present in the name of Milling, the Sun. The dialogues and the pictures used in the film left me well satisfied, when I started thinking more about this film. MS. Jeevan looks very impressive, especially considering that if this role was played less, it would soon turn into a sad song, but it would be great to deal with this loss with a great factor. He grasps the nuances of Sheena's efforts. . Mr. Song has a much smaller role in this film than any other, but the does it in moderation, appropriately giving Ms. Jeon a category. Technically, the film is well made in the ancient sense. No bright aesthetics are used there - the director is obviously trying to tell the story himself. I think the send of my real complaint, and probably no table, is that although there is a distance between Sheena and the audience (or at least, this is me) as much as we spend time with Sheena. I think some of it is because of the nature of the work, because if all the empathy is carried forward, we are not at the table to look at Shine's problems. On the other hand, I never felt the sting of Shaina's grief, even though she was crying a lot and behaving carelessly. Still, the film is still fascinating, especially since it made me think about it, with additional explanations and its talk about tragedy, competition, self-deception, loneliness and faith.

It's a show about racial diversity and gender that was bitter and It can be ridiculous where the United States has accepted racism, sexism, religion, etc. What's up? This show seems to contradict this development. It is one step behind American evolution. For example, one of the jokes in this program is that a white girl is meeting a black boy at school. It's interesting to see how you can't see this kind of relationship in any small thing in America. I've lived in both small towns and big cities, so don't give me any red, blue excuses. Not only is this a joke, but the father, who is called non-racial, finds it disturbing and repeatedly instructs the girl to send the relationship with her boyfriend, who says, ""This is racism."" Sounds like, but just a dumb character. "" If that's not enough, the other joke is that having a son, and soon to have metrosex, in't clear on this sexual orientation. The audience often knows that the is not gay, but the father does not believe, so the always avoids the son, for fear that the son will kill him, because all gay men are wild. They cannot control their will. The father always comes to accept this son's offer once for each program, but usually postpones it to the next instalment. The only way to fix my eyesight from this show is to keep my dad's eyes open a bit from the constant exposure to these ""unnatural events in life"", but it can be too much to ask - and moreover With such jokes, I will definitely be interested in future episodes such as - Episode thirteen, ""Father Votes for Family Voters"", and Episode fourteen, ""My Muslim Neighbor is a Terrorist"".

18204,"I had the pleasure of screening ""The Big Bad Swim"" at the two thousand and six New London Film Festival last week. The festival highlights some of the best independent and non-mainstream films from the past year. It was my assumption that ""The Big Bad Swim"" was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot locally in and around Eastern Connecticut. However, as the credits began to roll I could only think about how well ""The Big Bad Swim"" compared to the others featured during the festival. By far it stopped my list, followed by ""The Puffy Chair"", ""Who Killed The Electric Car"" and ""Transamerica"". The ""The Big Bad Swim"" is an engaging, truthful and often-humorous look at several adult education swim class pupils and their likable yet troubled instructor that has a depth that I've not seen on screen in quite a while. The interweaving character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adult-swimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which I found refreshing. The plot does't beat you over the head with a direction; rather it builds and grows organically with a space that was spot on. I was never bored. I never cringed. I never stepped out of the story on the screen. The humour of the film is something like ""Napoleon Dynamite"" meets ""Old School"". The acting from a group of relatively unknown factors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward for contrived. Obviously not being a multi-million production the camera shot were't all awe-inspiring and clear, but adequate and well done for the budget. The lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in ""Closer"". I also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could be. I sure it's said over and over from many in the independent film industry, but I have to say it: If ""The Big Bad Swim"" in't picked up for some kind of distribution I would extremely disappointed.

However, as the credits began to accumulate, I just wondered how ""The Big Bad Third"" could be compared to the others involved during the festival.

However, as the credits began to roll, I could only imagine how beautiful the “Big Bad Swim” was compared to other characters during the festival. So far, it's on my list, followed by ""Puffy Chair"", ""Who Killed the Electric Car"" and ""Transamerica"". ""Big Bad Swim"" is an interesting, realistic and always funny joke about many adult swimming class education students and their good but troubled coaches, and its depth is something I haven't seen on screen in a long time. The character enhancement and story line from the adult swimming class are intertwined and work in a subtle and lovely way, which I find refreshing. The conspiracy will not prevail over the direction, the contrary, built and grown in accordance with the right place. I never get bored. I did not clap. I never got out of the story on the screen. The humour of this movie is similar to ""Napoleon Dynamite"" meets ""old school"". The performance of the anonymous group is trustworthy, and their conversation has never been embarrassing. Obviously, it is not a multi-million dollar job. The content captured by the camera is not surprising and clear, but it fits into the budget and is well done. The technology of lighting and shooting of the shows shot in the strip club attracts more attention because it is more realistic than the shows with the same themes in ""Closer"". I also found that the class shot from below the waist in the underwater class seems to be a character shot from shoulder to top. I believe a lot of people in the independent film industry have spoken out over and over again, but I must say: If ""Big Badass"" was not chosen for some kind of distribution, I would be very disappointed. ""Bad Evil Swimming"" is a must see. If you have a chance to watch this movie, you will have to go to it! Disappointment is impossible!",positive

However, when the scores started to roll I just wondered how good “Great Swim” was compared to the others presented during the ceremony.

The development of mixed behavior and intriguing lines drawn from something as irrational as long-distance swim lessons works in gentle and loving ways that I find refreshing. The plan won’t hit you in the head; instead it forms and grows naturally with space in it. I'm not bored. I was not scared. I did’t leave the screen story. The joke of the film is similar to that of “Napoleon Dynamite” who met “Old School”. Acting on a group of unknown issues is trustworthy, and their conversations never seem frustrating. It’s clearly not surprising and clear making millions of camera shots, but adequate and well on a budget. The method of lighting and recording the images recorded on the line club site is particularly enticing because it is a more realistic scenario than a similar theme site found on “Nearby”. I also saw underwater streams in the classroom from the middle to the bottom that looked like a character drawing like a shot from the shoulder. I’m sure many of the independent film industries have said more and more, but I have to say: If “The Big Bad Swim” were to take some kind of distribution I would be devastated.

18440,"I of you thought Sam Mendes' first film, the much heralded American BEAUTY was a movie with style to spare, wait until you see this highly anticipated second effort, the unrelentingly grim thirty's gangster melodrama ROAD TO PERDITION. Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER, a crash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes' extraordinary technical prowess. If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great, then yes, ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography, editing, music scoring and sound. What it does't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading for seeing it is over. As with American BEAUTY, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie, despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love, loyalty and betrayal. This story of a hit man (Tom Hanks) and this relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also this boss, an elderly Irish mob leader (Paul Newman) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past. The father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humour to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom. That being said , I have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have never seen. Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for this work there . The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel. Mr. Mendes continues to astonish with this vivid use of color, and the and Mr. Hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale coloured walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks, blues and gray that dominate the movie's color scheme. If I have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the factors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch, with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : Daniel Craig is the classic ""man you love to hate"", the spoiled, impulsive son of Newman's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and this son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half.

Some critics have called the new film the true their to The Godfather, an accidental decision made by several critics based on Mr. Mendes' general part. If movie production is what makes a picture beautiful, then yes, the last resort is Godfather's longtime cousin in terms of what the has in cinematography, editing, scoring music and sound. What it blacks is the sound of all the good news and other rare films that stay with the audience even after the viewer's learning experience is over. As in American Beauty, the film has cold, divisive emotions, although there are some tense situations, including father's love, loyalty, and betrayal. The story of the severely beaten man (Tom Hanks) and this relationship with the non-father - who is also the boss - the old Irish club leader (Paul Newman) feels that the has been removed from many criminal films over the years. . The father / son's father hangs on the image that the has been treated so severely that there is not much room for self-healing. The whole business is done very carefully, and almost every conversation is presented with a spirit of admiration: this is a gangster film, so the amount of violence and bloodshed is necessary, but there is almost no humour in the film. Scenes in which a young boy rides in a cleverly arranged car on the runway where there is a sense of softness to revoke a widespread sense of destruction. That being said, I have nothing but compliments for the amazing look of this film. Of course, it is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the best and most watched movies I have never seen. Veteran photographer Conrad Hall will probably win another Oscar for this work there. Product sets and clothing items are similar examples. In fact, every movie is a miracle of technology. Mr. Mendes is amazed at this clear use of color, and the red blood sprinkled on the yellow walls in Hall and Mr. Hall was also used, with very dark, blue and gray color making the walls very efficient and opaque. Control the movie color scheme. If I have failed to recognize limitation, it is not because the attributes do not mean that they are appropriate. Everyone in the film is at a high level, and two bad boys are especially mentioned: Daniel Craig is a man who ""likes to hate"" the old man, the corrupt and passionate son of the father of the Newman gang; And Jude Law, who almost does't look like a villain, keeps looking for Hanks with this son and other important characters in the second part of the movie.

If filmmaking techniques make the big picture, then yes, THE WAY OF VALUE is a distant cousin of GOD in terms of what the has achieved in films, editing, scoring music and sound. . What none of them have is the consensus that all the big stories and some very rare movies are with viewers long after the visual experience is read. Similar to American BEAUTY, there is a cold and a sense of separation from this film, although the more intense scenes involve fatherly love, loyalty and infidelity. The story of a beaten man (Tom Hanks) and this relationship with a surrogate father - who is also the director, an old Irish gang leader (Paul Newman), seems to come from a pirate film that does’t count of many years. previously The intent of the father / son attached to this picture is that the has been given too much treatment and there is not much room for self -defense; In general the business was done carefully, almost all the conversation was presented in very good air: it was a gangster film, so the required number of violence and bloodshed, but the film was almost devoid of any joke to talk about. see; the only scenes involving a little boy driving a carefully crafted escape car have no heartbreaking feeling to kill the widespread sense of destruction. That being said, I have nothing else but the highest praise for the amazing look of this film; actually, it’s not too much to say that this is one of the most beautiful and well -designed films I’ve seen. Veteran photographer Conrad Hall will soon win another Oscar for this work. Production and dressing styles are examples as well; in fact, the whole film is a technical surprise. Lord. Mendes continues to marvel at the clear use of this color, and Mr. Hall are-used the extensive use of red blood that spreads on coloured walls, all of which are more effective and confusing than the high-priority black, blue and gray that dominate the film’s color scheme. If I fail to properly consider the interim, it’s not because the points seem invalid; everyone in the film is high -ranking, with a special mention of two bad guys: Daniel Craig the typical “man you love that you hate”, the spoiled boy, the ruthless father of the Newman gang; and an unknown Jude Law who is particularly evil and evil chases Hanks and this boy who is very important in the film in the second half of the game.

As in American Beauty, the film has a cold, far-fetched feel, despite the tense scenes that combine father's love, loyalty, and betrayal. I thought Sam Mendes' first film, American Beauty, which was widely publicized, was an inappropriate one. Watch the drama. Mr. Mendes is amazed by this clear use of color, and Mr. The shall makes extensive use of the red blood sprinkled on the yellow walls, all of which are effective and disruptive due to the instability of the black, green and gray people who manage the film's color scheme.

Once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught, there they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who's leader would rather be back home tending this livestock. We never learn the character's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary. As well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day Iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the ""disguise"" one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer. The girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the send the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that Iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in Germany.

27953,"This is a cheap-o movie made by Al Adamson--a man who was perhaps the worst film maker never--even possibly worse than Ed Wood, Jr. Adamson specialized in extremely low budget horror and skin films during the sixty, seventy and heights and with such titles as FIVE BLOODY GRAVES, HELL'S BLOODY DEVILS, SATAN'S SADISTS and LASH OF LUST it's obvious the was't making Shakespeare!! Here in BRAIN OF BLOOD, several stock Adamson factors (such as this wife, Regina Carrol, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto are along for the ride and had appeared in Adamson's previous film, Dracula VERSUS FRANKENSTEIN. Sure, the makeup is laughable, the plot dumb (it involves the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme) and acting is level Z, but it's STILL better than their last film! However, it's bad enough that it makes for good watching by bad movie fans--you've just gotta see makeup on the guy with acid burns as well as the ray gun that appears to be made out of an old tail light! About the only positive things about this film are that aging supporting factor, midget Angelo Rossitto actually had a better than usual part--with more dialog and a more important role in the plot--and there is actually some sense of danger and tension at times. His movies all had rotten production values, sensations, gore and amateur acting. As for Ms. Carrol, she STILL looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limp through this silly flick.",negative

28833,"OK, I love bad horror. I especially love horror bad enough to make fun of. Demonicus, for House of the Dead - those were bad enough to make fun of. Severed was not. It was worse.(spoilers - who cares?)My friend and I sat through the entire film, and I have a number of comments, both in the ""this sucks"" style and in the realm of actual critiques. Plot (sort of) - There's a guy in this city (which is possibly Seattle, see comment below) who is running around and cutting off heads. He's been doing this for over a year (I'm not going back to get exact numbers - thank you VERY much), possibly two for three years. One head a week. And the police are JUST NOW calling in a ""specialist"" (who ONCE refers to himself as a psychic, but that never comes up again). Schya right! Feds take over after, what, THREE connected homicides? After NEARLY A HUNDRED SIMILAR KILLINGS we'd be under freaking martial law!!!!! Anyway, this ""specialist"" consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it's Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit, who is cutting off heads to again enough power to make himself a body (and then presumably take over the world - for possibly just go to Disneyland). Um. Setting - where IS this happening? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you might not realize that at the bar/rave (occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members), there's a poster for a local radio station, and that in the highly-entertaining, ""Pulp Fiction""esqe dialog (as IF) between the two cops (yes, the jones who get their heads cut off about fifteen minutes into the flick) they discuss ""the new stadium"" which may still have been an issue when this movie was made. Being from Seattle, I apologize on the movie's behalf and hang my head in shame. OK, there's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer (not published, don't go looking for my name in the IMDb), I do research. Lots of research. And unlike the writers of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with ""Satan"" - is actually a ""Loki""-like trickster god. In other words, the does't cut off heads. Besides, a major part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever the wants. Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the low. Not to mention, if the's already possessed someone, why make a NEW body? Also, if Baron Samedi GOT a body, the would't go around cutting off heads, the'd get some good drum and cigars and par-TAY!!!

Also if Baron Smydy gets a body the does't go and cut off this head, you will get a good drum and cigarette and pay !!!

29161,"Sammo Hung's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine film Pedicab Driver is considered by many to be this masterpiece. I have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any Hong Kong film never has. It is a combination of pretty good and well written drama, interesting and sympathetic (and also non-sympathetic) characters, some genuinely funny humour and truly over-the-top hyper young of that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with Hong Kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry. Sammo and Max Mok Siu Chung play two pedicab drivers who live in Hong Kong in the middle part of the last century, I think. They drive their cabs and are also desperate for love. Sammo is interested in local baker girl Ping (Nina Li Chi) while Max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying the falls madly in love with. Many other characters get introduced, too, and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so I cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in Hong Kong! Soon we get to know, for instance, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighbourhood and of course their violent facts affect your protagonists, too, and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed young of fight sequences has been created. As well as some nice drama. The film has a great cast. The leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and ""humor"" as in Sammo's otherwise great Eastern Condors (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with. The cast includes many familiar HK cinema faces and directors in small roles like Corey Yuen Kwai (the legendary action director and director of films like Saviour of the Soul one and two, Ninja in the Dragon's Den and Fong Sai Yuk one and two), the masterful composer Lowell Lo Koon-Ting (John Woo's The Killer and Ringo Lam's School on Fire and Prison on Fire among many others, Pedicab Driver included!), the Shaw veteran Liu Chia Liang (whom with Sammo has a furious fight with sticks), Alfred Cheung Kin-Ting (the director of dark HK nor classic On the Run from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight), the late great Lam Ching Ying (best known for this friendly face in various HK vampire horror/kung of/comedies) to name just a few. In fact, the cast in Pedicab Driver is one of the most interesting I've seen in any other HK production. The film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between Max Mok and Fennie Yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to Lowell Lo's character. They really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love, no matter what's your past for what you've done for living, get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than your average young of spectacle vacationer. Also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship, and of course love. Still I think what Fennie says to Max (about the future ""bad cooking"") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively, unfortunately. But then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in. Which is the action, the outrageous and over-the-top action. The fight scenes include traditional young of, some sticks, meat cleavers and the like and they're used there as hysterically as in the most mind blowing young of scene I've seen in any film never, Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four), they really are that great! There are wires and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked for punched. Simply amazing and again something ONLY Hong Kong cinema can deliver. Also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold this/her breath as the film has one fast car tvs. pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination. Still the film makers seem not to ""accept"" the violence of the film as Sammo is, like the late Bruce Lee, willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa, and I think this kind of morale, no matter how obvious for shallow it may be, is a good thing even in a harmless film like this, as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment. The film has also some very witty bits of humour that I'm not sure everyone in Hollywood for America (for example) would understand for like at all. The hilarious Star Wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when I realized what I was seeing. Also some funny scenes are created out of Sammo's passion for Ping. Still, the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former paragraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls for furniture is simply INSANE and so breathtaking I just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these Eastern film makers when I witness something like this, and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction, of course. Pedicab Driver is among the most incredible Hong Kong action films that I have never seen and easily among Sammo's greatest achievements. If the few minor flaws were not there, this could rate even brighter and higher. weight/ten",positive

29161,"Sammo Hung's one, nine hundred and eighty-nine film ""Triycle Driver"" is considered by many to be a masterpiece. I will have to admit to some extent, because the biggest part of this movie is as amazing and entertaining as any Hong Kong movie. This is a fun and well-written, funny and sympathetic drama (and no sympathy), funny characters, funny humour and a very small group of people, when one does not know, it is sure to shock many people to watch this. Movie and Hong Kong movies, as experienced fans of this unique industry. I think Sammo and Max Mok Siu Chung played two cyclists who lived in Hong Kong in the middle of the last century. They drive a taxi and yearn for love. Sammo is intrigued by the home baking girl Ping (Nina Li Chi), and Max meets the mysterious and beautiful Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying one day and falls in love with her. Many other characters have been introduced. If the audience is really focused on the movie and its strategy, they will always be clear, so I can't say the movie is confusing because it could be even worse, especially in Hong Kong! We will soon learn that, for example, a cruel gang with gangs will scare the neighbours, and the reality of the violence will affect your protagonist, so the foundation for one of the biggest successive youth attacks has been established. There are also beautiful plans. This movie has a great game. The protagonists are very nice and imported (unlike other great Sammo Oriental objects (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), which work hard and ""funny"", for example) and also, thanks to a well-written script, are appealing and easy to see. The cast includes many of Hong Kong's most popular movies and sub-directors, such as Ruan Kwai (famous factor and director, such as ""One Savior Two"", ""Cave Ninja Ninja"" and ""Fang Shiyu One Two""), a masterful composer Luo Guanting ( Wu Yusen ""Hitman"" and Ringo Lin ""Fire School"" and ""Fire Prison"", including tricycle driver!), Run Run Shaw starring Liu Jialiang (fighting Jinbao), Zhang Jianting (black Hong Kong director, nine hundred and eighty-eight ""The Escape"" director ), the late and the great Lin Zhengying (most famous for the friendly face / young eye / comedy in various Hong Kong vampire films), to name a few. After all, the cement of a three-wheeled cyclist is one of the most exciting riders I've never seen in any other Hong Kong activity. The film has an exciting and peaceful time, the most important of which is the relationship between Max Mok and Fennie Yuen and the challenges they face because of Lowell Lo's role. If they want to discuss the value of a person and the meaning of love, they can take the issue seriously, no matter what they have done in the past, it becomes very big and really works in the middle. sooner than usual The tourist wonders deserve attention. In addition, the efforts of other characters to heal things are also very touching, and they happily talk about positive relationships and friendships, and so is love. Unfortunately, I still think that what Fennie said to Max (about ""bad cooking"" in the future) is unnecessary and very effective in reducing the presence of the entire marketing sector and its titles. But then we will talk about things that are very interesting to filmmakers. That act, that is, a terrible and extreme act. Fighting shows include traditional youth, some sticks, pieces of meat, etc. etc., where used in a fun way, just like the most exciting young people I have never seen in any movie, Jackie Chan’s Drunken Master II (One Thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four), they are so great! There are wires, used subtly, and when people are kicked, they fly to the other side of the room. It's awesome, and it's something that only Hong Kong movies can provide. In addition, the dangerous stunt caused the audience to hold their breath because the movie has a fast car TV. The Tricycle chases the sequence with various dangerous jumps and twisted bodies flying through the air and hitting to a difficult spot. Filmmakers are not yet seen as ""recipients"" of violent films, like the late Bruce Lee, as the late Bruce Lee, determined to give up after the last murder of a gang villa, and I think this kind of behavior, and how you can appear in a harmless movie is also good, because a movie . This movie also has a sense of humour, I'm not sure everyone in Hollywood (for example) will fully understand it. The funny Star Wars at first was one of them, and when I realized what I was seeing, it forced me to laugh. There are also interesting shows made for Campbell's love of Ping. Despite this, a shocking laugh came from the scene shown in the previous paragraph. A tall man flew across the screen with great force and flew to the furniture wall. He was insane and breathing. I could not hide. my feelings and thoughts are these filmmakers when I see things like that, yes, this is just a good and valuable way. The Tricycle driver is one of the best Hong Kong movies I have never seen, and it is one of Kampala's greatest achievements. If there are no small bumps, this can be bright and high. Weight / ten The biggest part of this movie is as amazing and interesting as any Hong Kong movie. The movie has strong characters, and the main characters are very good and restrained.",positive
29161,"Sumo Hung's thousand-year-old padcab driver movie is considered by many to be an part form. I have to admit to some extent that for the most part the film is really incredible and beautiful as no other film in Hong Kong has never done. It's a combination of beautiful and well-written drama, entertaining and sympathetic (and incomprehensible) characters, some humour and a highly guaranteed high hyper-over while watching a movie while unfamiliar with Hong Kong. That's what it does for experienced fans. Simo and Max Mook Seo Chung played two pedicab drivers living in Hong Kong in the middle of the last century. They run their canoes and yearn for love. Samo is dating local baker Ping (Nina Li Chi) while Max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful Fanny Yuen Kit Young who is in love. Many other factors have also been introduced, and they are always clear when the audience really focuses on the film and its plot so I can't say that the film is vague because it's so bad especially in Hong Kong. May be! We soon learn, for example, that the brutal gang family threatens the people and their violent reality affects your characters as well, so it forms the basis of some of the very few people selected in the military setting. ۔ And some good drama. He has a great role in the film. All the instructions are very good and binding (not as pleasurable and painful as ""humorous"" as in another great way (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), for example, in Samoa's eastern condors) and of course, Thanks for the carefully written screenplay, we like it and it's easy to see. The cast includes several HK cinema directors and small character directors such as Corey Ewen Kai (famous factor and film director such as Soul Savior and Two, Ninja at Drag Dan and Fong Sai Yuk One and Two), a talented musician Lowell Lowe. Con-ting (John Wu's assassin and Ringo Lam's school of fire and prison arsonists include a pedicab driver) for the oldest race after a thousand years, nine hundred and eighty-eight), the late Lam Chung Ying (HK Vampire is best known for this friendly face in Horror) / Various Kings / Comedy) Just to name a few. In fact, the Pedicab driver role is one of the most exciting things I've never seen in any HK production. There are exciting moments of peace in the film, especially the love between Max Mock and Fanny Ewen and another issue they face due to their role as Lovello. They really do it as a very sensitive part if they want it as a discussion of human values ​​and the meaning of love, whatever your past is about what you have done to live, be heavy and moderate Act honestly in part because the movie gets faster than your teens during the holiday show. And the other characters' efforts to fix things are very touching and tell us a wonderful story about good human relationships and friendships as well as love. However, I think that what Fanny Max says (about the upcoming ""bad cooking"") is not very relevant and unfortunately shows the strength of the whole body and its body. But then we come to the part where we talk about the middle ground. What an action, disgusting and high action. Combat scenes include traditional youth, some sticks, meat masks and much more and are used there in a weird way, as in many scenes from Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II (One Thousand) that I never saw in a movie. I did't see Nine hundred and ninety-four), really great! There are ropes and they are used with great care and people fly to the opposite corner of the room where they are kicked. The only thing that can bring Hong Kong cinema. And because of the dangerous lumps, the viewer holds this breath because the movie has a fast car TV. A pedicab track in which all sorts of dangerous looking chase and twisted corpses fly through the air and collide violently in a difficult area. Yet filmmakers seem to reject the film's violence, like Bruce Lee, a gangster willing to sacrifice himself after the last murder in Villa, and I think that kind of attitude, no matter how much. Well, at least I did't go down without explaining myself first. The scenes in the back made me laugh because the picture of old and tall men flying with great force on the screen on the walls of furniture is boring and amazing. When I see something like this, I express my feelings and thoughts about these Eastern filmmakers. Can't hide, and it's certainly nothing more than a positive response and compliment. Pedicab Driver is an amazing action movie from Hong Kong that I have never seen and easily watched in the midst of Samu's great success. If there are no small flaws, it will be as light as possible. Weight Ten In its biggest parts, the film is as incredible and beautiful as any Hong Kong film never made. There are very good characters in the film, and all the tracks are very good and restrained.",positive
29161,"Still the film makers seem not to ""accept"" the violence of the film as Sammo is, like the late Bruce Lee, willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa, and I think this kind of morale, no matter how obvious for shallow it may be, is a good thing even in a harmless film like this, as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment. The fight scenes include traditional young of, some sticks, meat cleavers and the like and they're used there as hysterically as in the most mind blowing young of scene I've seen in any film never, Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four), they really are that great! ), the Shaw veteran Liu Chia Liang (whom with Sammo has a furious fight with sticks), Alfred Cheung Kin-Ting (the director of dark HK nor classic On the Run from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight), the late great Lam Ching Ying (best known for this friendly face in various HK vampire horror/kung of/comedies) to name just a few. The leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and ""humor"" as in Sammo's otherwise great Eastern Condors (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with. The cast includes many familiar HK cinema faces and directors in small roles like Corey Yuen Kwai (the legendary action director and director of films like Saviour of the Soul one and two, Ninja in the Dragon's Den and Fong Sai Yuk one and two), the masterful composer Lowell Lo Koon-Ting (John Woo's The Killer and Ringo Lam's School on Fire and Prison on Fire among many others, Pedicab Driver included! Soon we get to know, for instance, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighbourhood and of course their violent facts affect your protagonists, too, and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed young of fight sequences has been created. Still, the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former paragraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls for furniture is simply INSANE and so breathtaking I just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these Eastern film makers when I witness something like this, and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction, of course.",positive

The protagonists are very good and well-mannered (unlike some of the great Sammo East (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), which are awkward and “funny”, for example) and also, thanks to a well-written script, are appealing and easy to understand.

Still, there was one bright, shining aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named way down the credit list, just absolutely stole everything. Liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling. I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theatre. For some strange reason, my friend LOVED it.

Anyway, I thought even then, after this first scene, that Ray Liotta would become a major star, for at least a major, highly-respected factor.

I mean, for one thing, the word is already written in the vicinity of God. Even there, even in the rubbish cheap, Ray Leota shone like a diamond. Well, when you see this whip, be prepared to catch your nose. There is immorality in every major character. Scary movie. Great movie scene.

For a director known for this narratives and keen observation of humans, especially children, this excursion into minimalist cinematography begs for questions: Why did the do it? Was it to keep him busy during a vacation at the shore? ""Five, five Long Takes"" consists of, you guessed it, five long takes.

The camera stands nearly still looking at a small piece of driftwood as it gets moved around by small waves splashing on a beach. Ten minutes.""Watching people on the boardwalk"".

Eleven minutes.""Six dogs at the water's edge"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon with a sandy stretch of beach nearby. Far away at the water's edge, six dogs not doing much, just relaxing. Sixteen minutes.""Ducks in line, gaggle of ducks"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon near the water's edge. Dozen and dozen of ducks stream in single file from left to right. I assume that Kiarostami released them gradually. The last two ducks stop dead on their track and suddenly a gaggle of ducks rolls quietly from right to left. I assume Kiarostami collected the ducks and are-released all at the same time. It is not the first time that the deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes.""Frog symphony, oops, I mean cacophony, for a stormy night"". The camera stands over a pond at night. It's pitch black except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon on the undulating water. It is a stormy night and clouds race to cover the moon. The screen goes dark. What remains for us is the cacophony of frogs, howling dogs and, eventually, morning roosters. Hit me on the head if this was done in a single take. I saw this segment as a sound composition put together in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. Twenty seven minutes!

I think Kiarostami collected the ducks and released them at that time. This is not the first time the difference between formal and informal practices has been discussed.

Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt willard, granted most people probably either think the's too caffeine happy for just plain sucks but we're both the same page and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that the's one of my favourites now. This is one of the few movies where the is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film. Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great factor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she in't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)It's a game of jack tvs jill tvs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows this true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of part thieves who are in need of money due to a black of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skit's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film. The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.",positive

While the movie itself seems interesting, the real thing that struck me about it was Matt Willard, most people think that caffeine is so much fun to clearly suck, but we’re both in the same page and in the same generation and I watched it. man many times one of my favourites today. It’s one of the few films where it’s the biggest shot and the biggest genre like SLC Punk, another Lillard film. It’s usually the story of your routine heist movies but with more twists than anything, starting on an insane level. This film is also very reminiscent of another great thing called vincent D’onofrio, who is highly valued in the film industry. The girl in this movie is new and she is not too bad even though you know they rented most of her dialect and her naked body =) This is a game of jack tvs jill tvs bob and everyone wants to get their reward but share. no one. They were all trying to kill each other, and it was a time bomb waiting to explode. Matt demonstrates this true power as a cunning JAck who first starts the whole process. Vincent and a woman play two part thieves who need money because of the darkness of the business.

39341,"L'OSSESSA, also known as THE TORMENTED for THE SEXORCIST, for the ridiculously titled THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCIST trip-off which contains one of the best horror moments I've never seen. The scene is when the crucifix comes alive. This great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective (great FXs). It's a shame the rest of the movie does't maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scene. This is one of the most frustrating movies never. Imagine the producers deciding to to make an EXORCIST copy but while making it, they actually succeed in creating something truly original (a possessed sculpture of crucified man, which is shocking when you think about it) but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired EXORCIST trip-off. Had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc), this film would have rocked. But once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone from where the demon came from. She, and the script, completely forgets the haunted crucifix, which is STUPID!!! If you like so-called ""Euro-cult"" movies, the first forty-five minutes deliver unlike any other Euro-cult movies. But after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets stigmata, the remaining forty-five minutes SUCK. Boring.

39875,"Having majored in Western History when I was a student in college seeing the views on World War II are quite discomforting and in a whole completely wrong. World War II was the most graphic and bloody affairs to never occur in world history. While the Axis Powers conducted many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every German soldier was out to exterminate the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier swung a samurai sword around and flew kamikaze emissions, and not every Italian soldier was a Fascist. Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you and I caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved. The Battle of Stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over one, five hundred, zero casualties sustained over the course of the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader Lieutenant avon Witzland as they are reassigned to the Eastern Front to battle the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland facts as sort of the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in Germany and Poland. The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle. We are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles (including a firing squad sequence). Overall the battles are the earliest examples that I know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film. The film does not aim to make the German's completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to, evil. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. The film makes it clear quite quickly that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the Germany Army was simply fighting for a cause they really did't understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in Russia. The film really shows how hellish war is, especially World War II. The battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it. It will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the Eastern Front faced. Not recommended for children. four/five stars",positive

39875,"I graduated from Western history when I was in college, and it was very disturbing and completely wrong to see the vision of World War II. World War II is by far the most vivid and bloodiest in human history. Although Axis has committed many crimes against humanity, this is still the case today, but many people have forgotten that not all German soldiers want to exterminate Jews, and not all Japanese soldiers with a samurai sword. not every Italian soldier is a fascist. The soldiers of these Axis tribes are usually just ordinary people like you and me. The battle of Stalingrad can be described as one of the deadliest wars in the history of the world. The film ""Stalingrad"" tells the story of a German group and its leader, Lieutenant Evan Witzland, who were assigned to the Eastern Front to fight the Soviet Union in Stalingrad. Von Witzland becomes the lead factor along with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They are all ordinary people and seem to have no idea what happened in Germany and Poland. The film describes a battlefield. The film seems too dark to depict the lives of soldiers in a beast and a fight. We’ve seen a lot of bad battles and horrific violence other than battles (including a series of shooting groups). Overall, these battles are ancient examples I know of. Show the sequence of deaths and violence in the loss of body parts and your face. Much of the impact of the war events that rescued Ryan's privacy seems to have come from this movie. The purpose of this film is not to make the Germans innocent of everything in the movies. Several senior military officers are portrayed as a common perception that many people are familiar with, evil. Most soldiers are just ordinary people who are always talking about homes. The motion picture quickly made it clear that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, and many nations and the military were unaware that genocide was taking place. The film clearly shows that the German army soldiers fought only for reasons they did not fully understand. Most of them just want to go home and not freeze to the extreme heat of Russia. This movie certainly illustrates the gravity of war, especially the second world war. The battlefield will amaze you with its reality, and the story is easy to understand because you are just following a platoon in battle. As with most war films, don't expect too much fun after watching them. Just seeing the lives of so many soldiers in the Eastern Front will make you feel depressed. Not recommended by children.

39875,"When I was a college student, after graduating from Western history, I had unhealthy and completely wrong ideas about World War II. World War II was the bloodiest war in human history. While the Axis powers have committed many crimes against humanity that are still prevalent today and many good people forget that not all German soldiers went out to wipe out the Jewish population, all Japanese soldiers wielded the samurai sword. Kamikaz was not thrown out. All of Italy was fascist. Most of these Axis fighters were ordinary people like you and I got caught up in a heated debate and I was only fighting for the country they love. The Battle of Stalingrad was apparently the deadliest battle in the history of the world, with more than one hundred people killed, five hundred wounded and no casualties. The film follows Stalingrad's German delegation and its leader, Lieutenant Avon Witzland, as they were assigned to the Eastern Front to fight the Soviets in Stalingrad. Van Witzland's Facts with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi, as the main characters. They are all ordinary people and seem to be completely unaware of what is happening in Germany and Poland. The film is on its way to war. When war and military life are depicted during the war, the film is very dark. We have been shown many horrific battles and fierce violence without a fight (including a series of shooting groups). They are the first examples in all wars that I know of showing climb damage and a continuation of death and violence on your face. Much of Ryan's protection against private war seems to have come from this film. The purpose of the film is not to make the German completely innocent of everything in the film. Some senior military officers have been portrayed in such a way that most people are not accustomed to evil. Most soldiers are just ordinary people who often talk about domestic issues. The film makes it clear that what happened during the Holocaust was not under the control of all Germans, most of the country and the army were completely unaware that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the German soldiers were fighting for something they did not really understand and most of them wanted to return home instead of experiencing severe cold in Russia. The film manages to capture the essence of the war in Hell, especially World War II. The battle scenes will amaze you with their clever facts and the story is easy to follow as you only follow the team during the battle.

The reality of Von Witzland as a kind of main character of two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They were all ordinary men and seemed completely unaware of what was happening in Germany and Poland. The film follows the war. The film is generally very difficult in terms of its depiction of the war and the lives of the soldiers during the war. We were exposed to horrific wars and violent violence outside of the war (including the group shooting series). General wars are the first examples I know of that show the loss of extremities and your overall face in a series of deaths and violence. Much of Saving Private Ryan’s inspiration for the war series came from this film. The film does not aim to make Germany innocent of all films. Many high -ranking military officials have been described as the common view used by most people, evil. Most soldiers are ordinary people who often talk at home. The film quickly proves that all Germans are not responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, and most of the country and military are completely unaware of the fact that genocide is taking place. The film clearly states that German soldiers are only fighting for a reason they don’t really understand and are more inclined to return to their homes than to freeze in the harsh temperatures of Russia. The film really shows how it was in hell war, especially in World War II. The battle scenes will surprise you with their reality and the story is very easy to follow because you only follow one group during the battle.

I looks like a scary villain, but like the old saying ""never judge a book by it's cover"", the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out.

I took this movie as a spoof, which I think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects.

Taking the opportunity to make Fulci a man this fall, the flop nut doctor hypnotist over -assumed that the was responsible for a series of recent murders. On the surface, Cat in the Mind seems like a very good treat from spaghetti-splater god Lucio Fulci. With a chock full of chain breaks, tax attacks and various other bloody murders, the film is sure to pour enough white for even the toughest gore-hounds. But as one approaches, it turns out that many of the horror scenes were shot in previous films (mostly Fulci’s own masterpieces); remove these equations and one is left with a completely missing main idea, some embracing nudity, and the frightening presentations of Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as mentally handicapped. As the film progresses, it grows into an incomprehensible mess, with the ‘borrowed’ image of the gore being inserted indiscriminately, without trying to work satisfactorily on the story. If you’ve seen Fulci handling Death and the Spirit of Sodom, for Mario Bianchi in The Secret of Murder, then you’ve seen the best Cat In The Brain episodes never. After a lot of bloodshed, the film ended quickly, leaving viewers confused and somewhat deceptive. Watch the movie if you’re a Fulci completist, but I recommend you look for movies from the ‘good bits’.",negative

I saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theatre manager afterwards and told him ""That was possibly the worst movie I have never seen."" I have seen a LOT of movies with this person, and the's pretty forgiving, so I was actually shocked. (The manager gave him a free pass!)I was offended by much of the humour in the film (yes, the baked potato scene was on the top of the list!). My friend and I are white and saw the film with a primarily black audience. For awhile I thought, maybe I just don't get this movie because I'm white. Then I realized NO ONE was laughing. The writing was bad; the direction was bad; the timing was almost non-existent. There were a few funny moments, there was just WAY too much time between them. Even Airplane Two was funnier than this, and that's saying a lot. I was so dazzled by Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hutch (as Huggy Bear) that I felt I was sure to enjoy this movie. Nope. DL Hughley was funny, as usual, but this role was rather small. Tom Arnold had a few funny moments as ""the white guy"", but most other attempts at humour fell far short of the mark. Sadly, I was not table to award this film a rating with negative stars.",negative
41112,"Tom Charity can.com: ""Ontario"" is one of the worst movies I've never seen. He says it's ridiculous, it's ridiculous, but many humorous attempts came and failed miserably. He says the film is entertaining, but not fun for black audiences. Charity: ""Ontario"" is a good movie, but not suitable for white audiences. . He's an old man who lives in the fall at the send of this life, but about a happy schoolboy who has just entered the spring pasture. The weakness of the old page and the warning signs of death are all deceptions for him. His wife endorses the idea when she sees ""Fanda laughs at funerals and death."" In other words, death is not something that Fanda takes very seriously. He has more important things than worrying about the inevitable. Life, however, as well as the pursuit of a full life, is a philosophy that governs Fanda's existence. He is not just a being, but has to live every passing day and every moment, because the future is uncertain. The movie seems so far from life that it has no future, let alone death. Many people consider life very important and as a result close the real part of life. For example WifeFanda; You are so busy preparing for death, not in a religious way, but in a very realistic way, even in a lifeless way that you forget to smile, laugh and just have fun. His personality seems to have changed to zombie autopilot pilot mode. Fanda, on the other hand, is probably too shy and unreasonable to pursue it. You need someone like her, Emily, to help her balance. It is as if there is an invincible soul of a child in the fund, as if a child is trapped in the body of an old man. It has been introduced as a new species; Making excuses for people who don't want to take it back, waste money, lie and always want to laugh. Deep down, however, the kind and gentle old man is willing to submit to the will of this materialistic wife. The two communicate well, although neither of them appreciates the secondary quality of their relationship unless they have the opportunity to die symbolically: that is, their divorce. It is in this courtroom that Funda realizes the reality of death, and what it means when Jehovah is separated from this love alone. His wife remembers these mistakes emotionally, but the is attracted to her and continues to love her despite her crazy behavior. In the moment of forgiveness, Funda realizes this selfish attitude of driving a woman crazy and intimidates herself in order to please her. Oddly enough, after fulfilling this responsibility, Jehovah becomes what a woman calls a ""living corpse."" The blood of life in him is gone as the is - a zombie who is going through everyday emotions. Looks like the's not alive anymore, but the is. For example, Jehovah gives up this adulterous ability, wastes this money, smokes for this wife (this is not life), and above all, whatever the tasks of her Gives. In short, change is due to the desire to please him. Thus, the binary quality of their relationship is slowly disappearing. Seeing that her husband is no longer like that, there is a part of Emily who remembers old Fenda. She remembers her husband's indifference and the wars the often fought, because that was when the was really alive, not just there. I'm sure the filmmakers were trying to get a particular message out there. That a true and loving relationship is not always easy, but it often takes self-sacrifice and perseverance beyond seemingly bad times. The possibility of death at any moment is a reminder that people live every moment. Life is often considered trivial, but when death threats are made - whether literal for symbolic - people wake up from their ungrateful sleep and wake up for life. As if they are afraid that they will never live again, so it is better to use them to the fullest as long as they are alive. Fanda and Emily had been married on the street for forty-eight years, but until they were threatened with death, they began to show their true color. As the old saying goes, ""Love cannot sink into hell until the hour of separation."" They both begin to see the most important things in life and the people they meet along the way. More importantly, their close relationship with each other is important.",negative

He says that if you work for the mafia, do yourself a favor and go to hell in the world. salon: If you work for the mafia, do yourself a favor and get grid of the world. Seeing this I agreed - - I was expecting the matrix and was a little disappointed. But after watching it many times, my respect for this film increased. The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is ​​a very good film with some Mambo jumbo philosophy. Thirteenth Floor is a passing action film with some very interesting Mambo jumbo philosophy. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and it's not about ""truth"" in any sense (as many believe). It is about the human tendency in a hypocritical world to deliberately distort the truth (both from its origin and from its behavior). The saddest moment of the film was when Olegra Geller repeated her ""written"" line. Only then do you realize that the people in the game voluntarily give up their freedom to participate in the story. This was made even more frightening when DRC Nader (or rather the player) commented on the possibility of wasting human lives in the game. I totally agree with the ""true"" philosophy, that providing a world of happiness where finding the right path to the goal of sending people is ultimately a lifeless way of life. Life in the ""game"" is not permanent, but it is an attractive way to spend your time on earth. As Aligra commented on the real world, ""Nothing is happening there."" You might even think of someone else, under the pretext of doing something interesting (although I have to ask if Kronenberg sees it as a personal commitment, given that the himself is donating to such countries). There are those who will get a ninety minute caption. It was just to see how it ended. You only saw it once, it deserves another. Look. Imagine. Repeats its ""written"" line. Believing in the ""truth"" of any ""deep"" concept Life in ""Sport"" is not permanent, but it is an attractive way to spend your time on Earth. As Aligra comments on the real world, ""Nothing is happening there."" When I left the theatre after watching it, I thought it was one of those movies that was only seen to see how it ended.

But after watching it over and over again, my respect for this movie has increased dramatically. What needs to be remembered is that ""The Matrix"" is a great action film with a certain philosophy of King colossus. ""Thirteenth Floor"" is a welcome action movie, which adds to the interest in the philosophical Mambo colossus element. The existence is not that action films do not (and many people seem to believe) the ""truth"" of any ""serious"" assumptions. It is about human tendency to deliberately change what is real in a myth (in terms of its origin and morality) in the world. The most difficult moment in the movie is Allegra Geller repeating this ""script"" lines. At that point you will realize that the people in the game voluntarily give of themselves to take part in the story. This is even more frightening when D'Arcy Nader (or factor) comments about spending this life on the game. I totally agree with the ""true"" philosophy, which is to provide a fascinating world in which people need to find only the preconceived notion of access to the sending point, which will ultimately lead to the existence of the soul.

Let’s put other people’s idea in and pretend they’re doing something interesting.

When I leave the theatre after watching this movie for the first time, I think this is just another movie to see how it ends.

A Bulgarian-Italian co-production set in a version of Berlin where all Germans speak English with a German accent and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words in between, is hardly credible.

47425,"Since I'd bought the DVD, I watched as much of this as I did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet. The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. Complications ensue. Douglas is usually thought of as an intense factor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. He's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. The problem is that the part in't particularly comic and neither is anything else. The plot rambles on. A dozen ""quirky"" characters come and go -- most prominently Keenan Wynn as Douglas's friend who does nothing but make wry comments. Thelma Ritter was better at this sort of thing. Well, if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of. Some gags are silly. Others don't clear that bar. Here's what I thought of as an amusing line. Douglas has just hired Day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her. Day is disturbed and remarks that she's never heard of a writer working in a beach house. Wynn tasks if she liked Douglas's previous book, ""Last Year's Love."" Yes, of course she did. ""Well, most of 'Last Year's Love' was done in the beach house."" Ha cha. Nice cast, including support, but a failed comedy. There have been better sitcoms on television.",negative

He hired Laraine Day as this secretary, fell in love, and married her. Problems followed. Douglas is often regarded as a strong man, giving a great role, sometimes a hero, sometimes a mouse. He was very good at this comedy section. The problem is that this part is not a funny game, and nothing else. The plot has stoves. More than a dozen “strange” characters come and go — the most outstanding being Keenan Wayne, who, like a friend of Douglas, does nothing but make funny comments. Thelma Ritter is better at this kind of thing. Yes, if the plan is weak, it may be saved by some flights in the conversation, but there is nothing to say. Some gimmicks are stupid. Some do not remove the bar. This is what I think the lines are interesting. Douglas has just hired Dai and wants to take him to the beach house and lure him. Dai felt uncomfortable and said the had never heard of a writer working on a beach house. If Wynn likes Douglas' previous book ""Love of the Past Year"", the'll do the job. Yeah, you certainly know.

It must have been fun for Dafoe and the woman to work together for the first time in a movie, regardless of whether people can see it. I felt like ninety minutes had passed when I waited anxiously until the conspiracy unfolded, until it started. Try to style this movie and you won't, because it's as dark as the beginning, in the middle of the send. I've seen 'art' movies before and they don't even come close to having a party, it does't look like the first movie, it sounds ridiculous to me. I think it speaks for itself when only those who rated the film for ten were less than eighteen pages. Undoubtedly, because of the endless sex scenes, the film insisted on throwing us away. That is, you can call it erotic. It really had no taste.",negative
49342,"I'm at a loss. This entire movie made absolutely no sense. It was like watching a Soderburg film for football. The camera cutting, the space, all so copied. I thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was. Yes, we all know Southerners like football and beauty pageants. Must we be inundated with it as an audience? I watched because of Lee and Jay. I was expecting young talent assembled in the style of Dead Poet's Society for similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely put off by the film. You did't get the characters. It was character driven, but you did't understand anyone's motivations for their actions for the most part. The one kid who's from is obsessed with him being a football player. Why is the so silent? What's this deal? Did we really need the scene with him ""proving"" this heterosexuality? Why should we care? The movie gave us insights into these kids lives, and offered no pay-off for caring. It just made no sense. And why show a movie about a team that lost? I know it's real life, but who makes movies about losers? Give us some pay-off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their ""conceivable"" problems, darnit. We got nothing. We got a little blip at the send of the film telling us that Mojo won the next year with the threerd stringer (Lee). Why did't you follow that story? What were we to get out of this one? The movie led you along, but did't lead you anywhere. I just felt like something was missing. It felt like a bad genetic across between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least those two movies led you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a closer team that lost their star player early in the movie. The factor who played him was great. You were completely annoyed by him, which was the point, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood him, but the could't play, so why make sure we get this issues? And the other team in the play-offs. are we to believe those are high school teens? Those men looked like college seniors for professional player in their thirty. Who were they trying to kid? I know the other team was to look intimidating, but that was crossing the line a little. I liked the gritty element of them negotiating with the black team, but again, how did this fit into the overall theme of the film. Nothing pieced together. The characters knew more about each other than we did, and that settles weird with me. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but the was showcased. It was all just a mess. Not worth a movie ticket for a rental fee.",negative
49342,"The whole movie did't make sense. It was like watching a Soderbergh football movie. Why show a movie about a closing team? I know it's real life, but who made movies about losers? Give us the salary of these hardworking boys as they do with all their ""incomprehensible"" problems.",negative
49342,"I'm lost. The whole film is meaningless. It's like watching a Soderberg soccer movie. The camera is cropped and the space is copied. I think this topic is too important for them to treat us as it is now. Yes, we all know that South Africans love football and beauty. As spectators, should we be dominated by it? I think it's because of Li Hejie. I look forward to the little talents embedded in the style of the Society of Dead Poets, such as the memory of the Titans. I was completely overwhelmed by this movie. You haven't found any characters. It is driven by humanity, but in most cases, you do not understand the intentions of the person. The child who emerges is interested in becoming a soccer player. Why the silence? What kind of transaction is this? Are we forced to “affirm” this sexual image with him? Why should we care? The movie gave us a deep understanding of the lives of these children, and did not provide any treatment. It does't make sense. Why are you showing a movie about closing a team? I know this is real life, but who's going to make a movie about the losers? Give us something in return, and these people should try to solve all the “imaginary” problems like them, throw it away. We found nothing. We got a tip when posting the movie, telling us that Mojo will win by the third column (Lee) next year. Why not ignore that? What do we want from it? The movie is leading you forward, but it is not leading you anywhere. I feel like something is missing. Sounds like bad jeans between the Varsity Blues and the Titans. At least these two movies have taken you somewhere. Friday Night Lights is about a closely related team that lost their star players at the start of the film. The issue you are playing with is huge. He is utterly upset with her, for this point, but at least the understands why. They make sure you understand, but you can't play, so why make sure we get this problem? With other teams in the game. Can we believe they are high school students? The men in their thirtys look like college adults to professional athletes. Who is trying to lie? I know the other group looks awesome, but it’s very small. I love the severity of their conversations with the black group, but again, how does this relate to the content of the film. Nothing connected. The characters know each other better than we do, which is unusual for me. Nothing to add to Jay's role, but it has been shown. Everything is just chaos. Not worth a movie ticket rental.",negative
49342,"I'm lost. The whole movie was completely funny. It was like watching a Soderbergh football movie. Camera kit, location, everything was copied. I did't think they were serious enough to take it as it was. Yes, we all know the people of the South by the name of football and beauty. Should we as an audience be filled with it? I looked because of Lee and Jay. I was expecting to gather a small amount of talent in the form of the Dead Points Society as the Times remembers. I was completely blown away by the movie. You did not find any characters. It was driven by a character, but you mostly did't understand the purpose of anyone's actions. This is a kid who seems to be worried about being a soccer player. Why are you so quiet What's the deal? Did we really need this incident with him to ""prove"" this homosexual relationship? Why should we worry? The movie has given us an understanding of the lives of these children, and it has not paid us carefully. It did't make sense. And why are you showing a movie about a lost band? I know it's real life, but who made movies about losers? Give us the same pay for these hardworking boys as they did for all their ""unimaginable"" problems, Darnett. We did't find anything. We had doubts about posting the film, which said that Mojo won the next year with a third artist (Lee). Why not follow this story? What should we get out of it? The movie guided you, but it did't take you anywhere. I felt like something was missing. University seems like a bad gene between remembering the Blues and the Titans. At least those two movies have taken you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a close-knit team that lost its star player early in the film. The feature that played it was great. He was completely disturbed by her, which was the point, but at least the understood why. They made sure you understood it, but they could't play, so why do we make sure we have these problems? With another team in the playoffs. Should we trust these high school youth? Those men look like adults in a professional athletic college in their thirties. Who tested the baby? I know the other team had to look terrible, but it was a line that crossed a line. I liked their delicate element of interacting with a black group, but again, how it fit into the whole body of the film. Nothing included. The characters knew more about each other than we did, and that surprised me. There was nothing to add to Jay's character, but Jehovah was shown. It was all just a ploy. You are not eligible for a movie ticket for a rental fee.",negative
49342,"I lost. This whole movie is pointless. It’s like watching a Soderburg movie on football. Camera cutting, space, everything is copied. I thought the subject was’t too heavy to deal with like this. Yes, we all know southwesterners like football and beauty competitions. Should we be influenced as an audience? I watched it because of Lee and Jay. I look forward to a young talent gathered in the form of a Dead Poetry Society similar to Titans Memory. I was completely removed from the film. You could not find the characters. It’s a moving character, but you don’t understand who motivates them in their actions most of the time. A kid from there was mad at being a football player. Why is the silent? What is this agreement? Do we really need the site to “prove” this heterosexuality? Why are we interested? The film gave us insights into the lives of these children, and did not pay for any care. It just does’t make sense. And why show a movie about a lost team? I know it’s real life, but who makes movies about losers? Give us a little wage for these men who work hard like they did with all their “maybe” problems, darnit. We got nothing. We were quite excited about the release of the film which tells us that Mojo won next year for the third year (Lee). Why did’t you follow that story? Why are we leaving it? The film led you, but you led nothing. I felt something was missing. It felt like a bad genetic link between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least those two films took you somewhere. Friday night is about a close -knit group who lost a star earlier in the film. The point the played was overwhelming. You were so mad at him, which was the intention, but at least you understood why. They make sure you understand him, but the does’t play, so why do we make sure we get these things? And the other team in the Play-offs. Do we believe they are high school teenagers? The boys look like college veterans and professional players in their thirties. Who tried to have children? I know the other team must look scary, but that goes beyond the line a bit. I would have liked to negotiate with the black team, but again, how does it fit into the overall theme of the film. Nothing happened. The artists have known each other a lot since we met, and it calmed me down surprisingly. Jay’s characters have absolutely nothing to add, but it’s introduced. Everything is just chaos. He is not entitled to a movie ticket for rent.",negative
49604,"I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. In fact I could not even finish it. I want my money back. One more of Hollywood's feeble attempts to come up with a new idea. Good thing I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. They should of gave Nic Cage a that and a bull-whip. Swashbucklin'. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona for Leaving Las Vegas beats this ""lemon"". People who are completely and totally marketed(and most of them are) should love this movie. If this film had been animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I would of rather paid to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it.

49604,"john salon: another of Hollywood's weakest attempts to come up with a new idea. salon: must like people are totally shopping for this movie.avlon: Gust for I pay to watch a stupid movie and not try to hide it. salon: seems like a whole sheep. The story follows a formula that is common especially in Western and artistic films - the hero finds out that family/friends have been killed, so the hero wants real revenge, thwart the useless lawyer, save the female companion nina. loved and kidnapped, and killed the march-nemesis expert in a brutal battle. This formula is often successful - otherwise, it would’t be the formula - but the Gunfighter is the highest performance you’ll find. The writing is very ugly and somewhat insulting; like a high schooner wrote the talk because it was dark in depth, maturity, and reality. Sounds bad; sometimes it looks baked. Cinematography is a bonfire, and the center are sometimes facade. The acting is annoying; Sure, some factors might blame the text, but others can’t use that reason. Hopefully I will never see Chris Lybbert speak a role again; whenever the Lord says that a line should be angry at its meaning, it does nothing but lower the schedule of this voice and it is just like a child trying to act macho. Speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out this duds (if you dare to watch this movie): He wears this brand new outfit that makes him look more like Roy Rogers than hard-working shoes. If you’re satisfied with the price of a movie theatre that does’t serve to worship the imaginary grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then pick it up, but if you have more than two nerves, look no further.",negative

The story follows a pattern that is particularly familiar to Western and karate films - the hero finds out that family / friends have been killed, then the hero takes revenge, overthrows the inactive legislature, a cute kidnapped girl Is determined to save and kill an expert. March-nemesis in a vicious war. This formula is usually successful - otherwise it is not - but Gun Fighter has its unique sophomore action. The text is simple and demeaning. It sounds like a high school student who wrote a dialogue because it is dark in depth, maturity and truth. Bad sound Sometimes it is called. Cinematography is on fire, and the sets are sometimes just concerts. Sorry to hear that Sure, some players may be sceptical of the script, but others can't use these excuses. Hopefully I'll never see Chris Libert in a recurring role. Whenever the cutters a line that should make him angry, the does nothing but muffle this voice and tries to be masculine like a child. And if we talk about Chris Libert, who plays Hopalong, look at these dads (if you dare to watch this movie): the wears these brand new clothes that make him a hard worker, filthy and dirty. Sounds more like Rogers than Roy. Shepherd . If you like a cinematic ride that only adores the imaginary beauty of Hopalong Cassidy, get it, but if you have more than two neurons, look no further.",negative
