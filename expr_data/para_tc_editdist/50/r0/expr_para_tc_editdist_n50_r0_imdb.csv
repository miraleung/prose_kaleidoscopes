149,"The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Sadly, they stopped there.

You know, the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (IR glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. What is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie.

Had there been any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the send, it would have been a much better movie. All in all, it stunk. I would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie, but I don't want to do any spoilers.

If there was a desire to save Kevin Bacon by sending him, this would be a great movie. > They all work well, naturally, but before anyone is involved chew properly. Errol Flynn’s late Humphrey Bogart look at “Casablanca” is just as valuable, as are the various postings of this swashbuckling image (violent scenes of Forrest Tucker’s “jumping” kitchen). However, Tucker, who “puts” the film at the bottom of this garden, has these flowers on the head and barrels at the goal line. It features comedy comics that are fully developed after two decades in “F-Troop” and gives life and energy to Flynn to continue to play to enhance this performance. Eleanor Parker did a great job as the woman chased, and Patti Brady was pretty charming as Tucker’s true open friend. Funny, comedy “easy to go home” comedy in a fun setting where kids should have fun and love all the pages.",negative

If Kevin Bacon wanted to be in office, this would be the best film. Overall, it smells good. I can say some weird things about the send of the movie, but I don't want to do anything.

Some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, Eg. The part were Geller falls off the building had me in stitches. My girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next, and more times than less i was right. Why does going into the house make her come after you, it does't make sense. It was a poor excuse for a lot of killings, and no really depth was seen at all.

Some clips make the whole audience wet, for example. Part of Geller's collapse in the building caused me to get circumcised. My girlfriend has to keep quiet about me all the time, I always comment on what's going to happen next, and most of the time I'm honest. What you said came in and chased you, it did't make sense.

1377,". . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called African jungle. So no problems there for most males out there. I watched it as one of those bundled together package. Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get your heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. Just to give you a sense, your heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles. Again, no complaints. The ""fight scenes"" are laughable and borderline on the pornographic. Our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie. On occasions when she has to fight, the ""fighting"" involves rolling around in the dirt, grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. I am surprised no hair pulling is involved. It get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the ""combatants"" that ""I said, the one that draw first blood wins!"" in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting. The switch doctor Kuku was a bloody blast. From being a big, cuddly bear in the beginning, the became manic depressive when captured and then, outright psycho. He spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance. Beside Liana (our heroine)bouncing around topless, you also get to see plenty of other Amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons.

Sadly, the big bad man had to remind the ""soldiers"", ""I said, whoever fights first will win!"" Changing a doctor's library is a bloodbath. From the start, it was a big, beautiful bear.

For the life of me, I cannot remember what it was up against, but one thing I can say: It was one of the best movies I have never seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit. Essentially, it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with. Along the way, we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance never in this movie. Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for this role in this film.

In fact, the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter, most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered minorly overweight.

Her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time, all in the first half. The other supporting characters were merely props, decorations to further the story. Given the right dialogue, this would have been a very intricate mind study of a psychological problem. As it is, it turns into a one woman show, and Kimberly McCullough does't have the chutzpah to pull it off.

This, but when Mike, in the first and only collaboration of this screen, proves that the can deliver the latest soup of legendary deals, as well as CGI, the goods with the creatures. From the Lord of the Rings. Comparisons can be made from afar, of course, and the most obvious leap will be Miyazaki, thanks to the seemingly unique combination of children such as superheroes, power-hungry sparrows who use global power as the main source, machines As the greatest evil. , and many strange, artificially created creatures (or -ukai titles). But comparisons can also be made in Star Wars, especially in the tangled battle on TPM, with all the power play between good and bad with the same power. Or in anime like Seven Samurai. Or, in Hansen's films. And in all these comparisons, even the most timely mistakes, it is Miike in every way with the results and the emotions of the characters. Here, Ryunosuke plays Kamiki Tadashi, an ideal child who creates a kind of deception and sensitivity to the things of the world, but who will become a hero in the dark world. Darkness comes from an evil sorcerer, who derives this power from all the miserable and destructive vibrations of the human world, and who begins to kill spirits and other creatures in the fire that sent Yokhai into the fire. The giant temple robots have only one mission - to destroy and destroy anything in their path. Tadashi is dragged to fight Sato as a sorcerer who was Yukai, and Sato's main group, the Agi (Chiaki Koriyama's Kaki Bill, a prominent settler), become Tadashi's dear little friend, the Sanikosori. All of a sudden, things come to a head, a climax that reminds us of other movies and stories that karen't true, but only to a limited extent, can be added by Mike and the group. I would recommend The Great Yukai War for Kids, but the important thing is that it is not a dream that has been watered down in American circles. These include hostile creatures, including the one-eyed tent, and the moving, talking wall, the tortoise, a fiery serpent, and not to mention the woman cursed by Sato. So there are more variations on this post, and one can feel like creatures and effects - it grows to an incomprehensible altitude when the ""Festival"" comes with Yukai, which is hundreds of miles wide. But there is also a sense of supremacy in both light and darkness, and Sunekosuri is probably the biggest emotional touch on Miike (not just because it's a double-edged beauty); Where can the audience be attacked more than a terrifying little ball, ending in a devastating battle with the robot Tadashi? Yet in all of them, there is a sense of chaos that can be found in the most prominent areas of Mike's work, which sets him apart from this cartoon counterparts, MAPAT and Sci-Fi. As always, there are some unusual jokes, including a song dedicated to Akozy Bean at a critical moment, and a few fun planes with creatures and battle scenes (I liked, for example But, a big blue-headed boy to make a small, annoying turtle - Yukai). With great special effects and Mike's access to computer technology, the big threat the's tampering with has gone beyond this post. He's put it all down, I'm sure, on the newsboards, and it makes an unforgettable impression on some of the songs (one of which is when everything is said and done, and Tadashi and another 'middle man' from Tokyo in the middle of the shootout), but CGI sometimes gets a little dissatisfied with the robot, and the matching skirts become very prominent, and other scenes, such as the Yukai crowd that maps Spreads the word about the big festival, just look weak and sleek. I almost wondered if Mike Spy could enter the children's area. But beyond that bond, Great Yukai War offers more than half the fun, thrilling fun, and innocent melodrama that comes with the best children's dreams. It's indebted to cinema as well as to Japan's traditional history, but the patches always make its beats ridiculous and confusing. He's not a great filmmaker, but working on testing in a commercial environment makes him stop working for a profit. It has a clear message, and a good long journey. seven.five / ten",negative

8349,"I have seen many movies over the years and I am a big fan of comedies. But this so-called comedy almost reduced me to tears. It is without a doubt the WORST movie I have never witnessed, the worst. I remember hearing about this movie from a friend, and decided to view it. If I could I could turn back time, I would. I will regret for as long as I live, the time I wasted watching this rubbish. The storyline is so insane; it just makes no-sense at all and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish mob and a German headhunter who are after Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish mob after $fifty, zero dollars and the Germans after this head. In trying to escape The Pest, takes the form of many disguises. But in doing this we witness some of the most annoying, worst, mind numbing acting, dialogue and sounds in cinema history. This movie annoyed me so much; by the send I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I had wasted so much time watching a movie that would surely drive depressed people to almost certain suicide. I mean how can there be hope when a movie like this can be given permission to be made? I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people actually like it. Why? What is funny about a man that is annoying from the very first second to the last? A man who cannot act? Who has an annoying voice and confusing face? I sat through it thinking the movie would get better, surely it would. It did not. Usually, you want the good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans for the Scottish mob to find and kill The Pest, anything to put me out of my misery. There is nothing funny, interesting for normal that happens in this movie, its just plain annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead even before they are told. I feel sorry for the cameramen who have no say in how the movie is made, but actually have to film this drivel. I would't be surprised if they are receiving counselling. If you want to remain sane and part of society, my advice is to never watch this movie. I'd rather block myself in my room for five weeks and go without food and water than watch this movie again!

I was so angry that I spent a lot of time watching a movie that was sure to convince depressed people that they were going to kill themselves.

It never was. Normally, you want good people to live, but I want the Germans of the Scottish team to find and kill insects, anything that can get me out of spain.

11822,"I thought the movie (especially the plot) needs a lot of work. The elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. I'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:First, when Shen told Wendy that the would help her study the history of China, I was really happy that the audience would receive some information about Chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show Wendy actually studying Chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows Wendy practising the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay. Second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes -- moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. Yet they did't really mention the real significance of it. The only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the Autumn Festival, which they did not explain for go in depth. They could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake -- the Moon Lady. The myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the Divine Archer, Hou Yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun (there are different versions where the Hou Yi shot the weight out of nine suns). Because of this heroic contribution, the was given the pill of immortality so the could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again, but this wife, Chang-O stole it. After stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a share. She then came upon an idea and told the share to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. (There are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, I, most of the time, heard about this version). I thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally Chinese oriented. The last thing I would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. The teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the Terra-cotta Warriors (the life-like statues of the soldiers) went against the idea of how important Chinese history is to the Chinese. The Terra-cotta Warrors serves as a connection of China's past and it was very westernized (where evil must be killed in anyway possible) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. It would be understandable if Wendy, considering she is Chinese-American and does't have full Chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artefacts. The whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and Shen want to do is fight. I mean, it's rated TVPG due to violence, which goes against the Confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. It would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence. All in all, all of for either of the producer, writer, for director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead.

But when the main character is in partnership with someone who has a lot of fish at the moment, especially by having sex with them and playing the role of an ongoing victim, my risk suddenly reaches a whole new level.

Take two boys (male and female), put a clean woman between them, there is an abandoned island, get grid of all its moral problems, men have a lot of moral problems and they have arguments, Mix the fish and the hippopotamus in a large bowl and you will get a piece of junk film. Imitation, I would say, is a good thing. There are bulldozers but not much in my opinion. The main female character makes me sick. This is because of its dark moral character. A man who has a lot of fish pays attention to it. Even if one of them is her husband, she sees no problem in (Manuel's) infidelity with another man because ""I have to do this to survive."" How can you give an excuse to have sex with another man to get fish when your husband is thirty meters away? And will they not benefit from it?

My two year old was asking me if all cows have rudders and trying to explain to her that this is simply not true and seeing the movie only confused her more! In addition, the violent theme scared my two year old. They made the coyotes ferocious looking and this has instilled a fear of coyotes into my daughter. I know coyotes for a fact are not ferocious and are natural predators. The mother and son who were sitting in front of us were shouting, ""Kill him, Kill him, yea"" in a particular scene in the movie where good tvs evil per sayIt is a Lion King trip off and they should stop using big name factors for a flame movie.

Some species also leave most of the opening sequence and other bites there and there. The cut I saw had the screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by the Shriek Show, which holds the original US title WITCHERY released for the DVD release. It's a very good print and seems to have all the features, but it has production / visual issues. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA four (WITCHCRAFT). The first two releases of LA CASA were actually the two worst films of DEEQA (re -execution) and the third LA CASA was another film from the same production company (Filmirage), also known in America GHOSTHOUSE. To make things more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE two. Except in Germany, where the real GHOSTHOUSE is OGRE: three demons. Well, I'm fine now. I'm starting to get confused! Whatever the title, it’s a scary one and totally beaten up. Some are good, some are not. I actually went into this film in the first half so, but in terms of posting it became a chaotic mess. A large open-air hotel on an island about fifty miles from Boston is the avenue, with different people individually from the German-speaking alternative (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to catch the “Witch Light,” and this virgin writer (Leslie Cumming), who studies magic, are rocking the hotel without permission. Accompanied by real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), the property is shown to buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Their children are also marked; Pregnant daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - wife of Hasselhoff). When everyone was inside, their boat driver was killed (hanged) and the boat disappeared, so they found themselves trapped and originally pitied by the ""Black Lady."" So what can you expect to get there? Lots of great stuff! One of the artists sewed their tapes and then hung them in a fireplace and suddenly baked while throwing. There is also crucifixion, altering the diet of a dead child, fish with a sword, a man burned, genitals, a Sesame Street tape, the virgin being raped by some demons, boys rooting and exploding thanks to the mouth - babysitter and other things. From a technical point of view, this is a good visual film with great cinema, sharp points and great effects. The hotel / island accommodation is also great. Both Blair (especially the sender) and Ross are happy - and Knef is a big bad replacement. While people like to make fun of Hasselhoff these days, this role is no exception. In frustration, despite the complexity, the film looks boring and becomes uncommon after an hour. The topics above are muddy and confusing as well. When factors are thrown into the fire to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers inadvertently decide to put to scream some of the stupidity of traces of violent change that appear to be stunning. The replacement expansion itself is spacious and inexpensive designed for endless wood. While most of the cast is at least transparent, some shows (especially the “actor” who plays Hasselhoff’s girlfriend and son) are horrible and constantly distracting. > Trembling and exploding thanks to voodoo doll speakers and other things.

20583,"I just saw ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from South Korea. There karen't many jump out at you scares as in the usual American horror film, but the director does maintain the off-kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. Most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's ""there's something under the bed"" fears from when they were a child, but in this case, it's the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director was table to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. He's also good at revealing people's dinner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make-up in the mirror for her sitting in front of the flickering TV. I think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt changing over you. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD (DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE TWISTS OF THE MOVIE REVEALED) I was following the story pretty well, but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. However, I think the flashback at the send definitely tied everything together. The film is very much like ""The Machinist"" in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions. Here's my interpretation of the film. The Su-Yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of Su-Mi for the actual ghost of Su-Yeon that only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of Su-Mi. There is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. I believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she does't appear until the pick her up and brings her to the house. The stepmother before that point is imagined by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) That explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and does't remember anything that she recounts. I think it was Su-Mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality. The film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make-up in the mirror, which is revealed later to actually be Su-Mi wiping her make-up in the mirror. I think the ghosts in the house karen't entirely imagined by Su-Mi, and are either of Su-Yeon for the mother for both. In the final flashback, it is revealed the Su-Yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. Also, it's the hairpin that Su-Yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink. The real stepmother, in the send, gets punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while Su-Mi unintentionally played a supporting role. I wonder if the ""mother"" that Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, is a ghost already. Perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet. That's left ambiguous. Other things that are suggested, but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too. It's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself. It's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too, requiring a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi, you're beginning to take after your mother. I don't think she meant just physically. Also, if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually Su-Mi, then there's the suggestion of incest too, since the father sleeps with her. Is that why Su-Mi freaks out and shouts, ""Don't touch me"" each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes? Is that the ""filthy things that you've done"" that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? This film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. A few of the scenes, however, were kind of derivative, such as the woman in the black crawling around scene, which reminded me of the cherry-jerky movements of Kayako in the Ju-On/The Grudge films. Also, the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of The Ring. Furthermore, just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from ""The Sixth Sense"" for ""The Others"". Overall, I enjoyed it, however, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (that's already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. One remake that I'm really excited about is ""Dark Water"" coming out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my to-see list.",positive

20583,"I just watched the ""Two Sisters Story"" last night and loved it. I’ve been a huge fan of horror Asian movies lately, and I think this is a powerful work from Korea. There karen’t a lot of people who make you scared like the usual American movies, but the director keeps the inequalities and horrible feelings, especially in the characters ’communication. Many fears are more logical and are associated with the fear of all children “under the bed”, but in this case, the closet and the sink. I also like the way the director handles family dysfunction with shows, such as the first dinner the characters have together. She’s good at revealing a life of dinner and being as strong as light spots like her second mother sitting in front of a flashing TV and wiping the mirrors on her. I think this movie is primarily about exploring guilt and the consequences of living this case to change you. The main spoiler (if you don't want to see the twist and turn of the movie, please don't read it again) I followed the story well, but it started to get confused during the pull bag. However, I think the flashback when you post will definitely tie everything together. This movie is very similar to ""Mechanic"", because the normal case of the two characters ultimately leads to mental development and deception. The above is my interpretation of this movie. Su Yan we see after the girls have to go back to the house and it is Su Mei's deception that only Su Mei can see and communicate with the real ghost of Su Yan. The first mother we saw was Sumi's deception in my opinion. However, there is a second real mother who first appeared in a movie when she was wearing gray pants. I believe that in the first part of the movie, my dad talked to my real from on the phone, and she did't come until the took her home. The second mother had previously thought of Su Mei (perhaps part of her different personality?) This describes the unusual sequence of dinner when her stepmother's brother looked at her like crazy and did't remember anything she said. I think Su Mei played the role of a second mother in her different personalities. This moving image later showed this in shows such as dragging a bag with a second mother wiping makeup in front of a mirror. It was later discovered that Sumi was going to wipe cosmetics in front of a mirror. I think the ghost in the house is not Su Mei's imagination at all, because they are both Su Yan's mother. In the last flashback, Soo-yeon wore a green dress when the died with a hairpin in this hair. This was the green dress they had shown to the ghost sitting at the table for dinner, while the second mother looked down at the sink. And, as the second mother looked down at the sink, Su Yan was wearing a hairpin in a flashback from the floor. The second real mother was punished by Su Yan's spirit during the delivery, and she came to a place that looked like a bring. After that, the flashback show combines all of this together, the second mother is responsible for her death, and Suomi accidentally plays a supporting role. I want to know what ""mother"" Su Yan saw when she went to her room to cry was already a ghost. Perhaps the mother had already committed suicide to the authorities by then. This leaves ambiguity. Some of the things that are suggested but not explicitly mentioned in the film are that the second mother appears to be a nurse at some point, perhaps caring for the mother, and in some way may even cause her death. It is unclear when this relationship with this father began and caused this mother to commit suicide. Some people think that this woman has a mental illness and needs a nurse. The second mother showed you this when you told Su Mei, and then you started following your mother. I don't think the was talking only physically. In addition, if we accept the fact that the first second mother we actually saw was Su-Mi, there is also talk of sex because my father had sex with her. It is for this reason that Sumi is scared and shouts ""Don't touch me"" every time her father stretches out for her. Is this the “unclean thing that you have done” mentioned in a recent conversation with this father? The interesting thing about this movie is the ability to interpret it differently. However, other scenes have been taken, such as the case of a black woman crawling around, reminiscent of Kayako's cherry act in the Ju-On / The Grudge movie. Additionally, the last place where the second from finally gets her dessert is reminiscent of ""Lord of the Rings."" In addition, the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from the ""Sixth Sense"" of ""Others"". Overall, I really like it, but it would be great to see the results of the Hollywood remake (already in production). Honestly, I love “The Ring” and “The Grudge”, so I’m not one of those arrogant genres who insists on being redone. Another thing that makes me happy is that “Black Water” has been released this summer. I haven't watched the original Japanese version, but these two movies are definitely on my watch list.",positive
20583,"I saw ""Tale of Sisters Two"" last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror movies lately and I think this is a great entry from South Korea. Many suspicions are not as frightening as in the classic American horror film, but the director has an unusual attitude and a very bad look, especially in the interaction of negative characters with each other. There is a lot of fear and it plays on everyone that the fear of ""there is something under the bed"" has been there since they were children, but in this case, it is a closet and a sink. I also liked the way the director was placed on the table to capture how the family did't do well with scenes like the first dinner with the factors. She is also good at photographing people's lives at dinner and simple scenes like stepmother cleaning her make-up in the mirror as she sits in front of a blazing TV. I think this film is a test of crime and the consequences of living with this case are a change for you. One of the greatest hired forwards (don't read if you don't want an intermediate expression) was following the story well, but as I pulled the bag I began to get confused. However, I think the flashback to the posting definitely connected everyone. The film is very similar to ""The Machinist"" in that the two-dimensional nature of the character leads to dementia and deception. Here is the description of my film. The Su-Yeon we see after the girls return home is probably Su-Mi's real-life Su-Yeon ghost that only Su-Mi can see and share with her. She's the first from we've seen, Su-Mi's disappearance in my opinion. There is also a real mother, however, who first appears in the film wearing gray pants. I'm sure she's the real stepmother that Dad talked to on the phone in the first part of the movie and she does't show up until you pick her up and bring her home. Before this point the adopted mother is thought of as Su-Mi (perhaps part of her separated personality?) Who explains the strange sequence of a dinner party when her stepmother Her brother looks at her like crazy and does't remember anything she says. I think it was Su-Mi who imitated her stepmother as part of a different personality. The film later shows her dragging the bag and the scene as Saas wipes her make-up on the mirror, which later reveals that Su-Mi is actually wiping her make-up on the screen. I don't think the ghosts in the house were completely thought of as Soo-M, and they are Soo Yun for both mothers. In the last flashback, it was revealed that Su-Yeon was wearing a green dress and had a hairpin in this hair when the died. This is the green dress the had earlier shown sitting on the dining room table on the railway while the stepmother looked down at the sink. Also, the hairdresser Su-Yeon was wearing a flashback from the floor when the stepmother looked under the sink. The real mother, on the mission, is punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who appears on the scene like a color. Subsequently, the flashback incident covered the fact that both stepmothers were responsible for her death, while SUMI played the role of unintentional help. I wonder if Suu Kyi saw ""Mom"" when she went to her room crying in flashback, she is already a ghost. Maybe by then my mother had committed suicide in the closet. It remains unclear. Another suggestion, but not well explained in the film, is that it appears that the foster mother, at one time, was a nurse, perhaps caring for the mother and somehow dying. I was this character. It is not clear when the relationship with her father began and whether it was the cause of her mother's suicide. It was also suggested that mothers have mental health problems, which require a nurse. The stepmother refers to it when she tells Su-Mi, and you start following your mother. I don't think that meant it physically. Also, if we accept that the first stepmother we actually see is Su-Mi, then sleeping with a relative is suggested, as my father is sleeping with her. That's why whenever my dad approaches him in the latest scenes, Su-Mi shouts and yells, ""Don't touch me""? Are they referring to the ""dirty things you've done"" in a recent conversation with Dad? The film manages to entertain as well as inform. However, some scenes came from something else, such as a black woman crawling around the scene, which reminded me of Kayako's horrific actions in the Ju-On / The Grudge movies. Also, the last place where the adoptive mother finally finds only one dessert is reminiscent of color. Also, the mere idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from ""The Sixth Sense"" in ""The Other"". Overall, I enjoyed it, though, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake unfolds. I have to be honest, I like both ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", so I'm not one of those snatching genres that insists it would't be good to reproduce. Another version I really enjoyed was ""Dark Water"" coming out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but I can see it in both movies on my list.",positive
20583,"Last night I just watched ""The Story of Two Sisters"" and I liked it. I’ve recently become a big fan of horror films in Asia and I think it’s a strong influx from South Korea. There karen’t many people jumping on you and scaring you like a typical American horror film, but the director is well guarded against the killer and the good will, especially the bad character interaction. Most of the fear is a lot of ideas and they play with everything '' there under the bed '' the fear when they were young, but in this case, it was the cupboard and the plate. I also liked how the director was at the table to catch up on how this family is not working on scenes like the first dinner the factors had together. She is also good at exposing people’s dinners and festivities through simple scenes including the mother decorating herself in the mirror while sitting in front of the hot TV. I think this film is almost about discovering sin and the consequences of living with that sin that will change you. GOOD THING (IF YOU DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TWIST THE MOVIE) I already knew the story, but I started to get confused while pulling the bag. However, I think the return of the post has definitely tied everyone together. The film is so similar to “Machinist” that two of the crimes of the nature of behavior lead to insanity and illusion. Here is my interpretation of the film. The Su-Yeon we see after the women come home is either Su-Mi’s illusion that only Su-Yeon’s true soul Su-Mi can see and interact. For the first from we saw, my view was Su-Mi’s illusion. There is a real mother, however, and she first appeared in the film when she was wearing a gray pantsuit. I believe she was the real mother that dad was talking to on the phone early in the film and it did’t show up until the picked it up and took it home. The father-in-law who preceded that point had guessed Su-Mi (perhaps part of her destructive personality?) That explains the sequence of the amazing dinner when her father’s brother saw her mad and did’t remember anything the said. . I think Su-Mi has a role to play on her mother’s part in her split personality. The film shows the latter of the bag pulling the scene and scenes as the wife’s mother wipes her makeup on the glass, which is later discovered that Su-Mi is actually the one wiping her makeup on the glass. I think the demons in the house don’t quite know Su-Mi, and they’re both Su-Yeon’s mother. On a final examination, it was revealed that Su-Yeon was wearing a green dress and had her hair cut when she died. This is the green dress already shown by the spirit sitting at the dining table while this mother is looking under the dish. Also, it was the hair that Su-Yeon wore in the enamel that appeared on the floor when the mother-in-law looked under the plate. The real father-in-law, when sent, is punished by Su-Yeon's spirit who goes to a place somewhat similar to the Ring. After all, the reunion scene is intertwined in terms of how both mother and father are responsible for her death, while Su-Mi inadvertently plays a supporting role. I wonder if “mom” sees Su-Yeon when she goes up to her room to cry, retaliate, if she’s already a ghost. It is possible that by this time the mother had committed suicide in the closet. That is vague. Another suggestion, but not explicitly described in the film, appears that the father-in-law, at one time, was a nurse, probably caring for the mother and may have also contributed to her death. It is not clear when the had a relationship with the father and whether this caused the mother’s suicide. It has also been suggested that the mother also has mental health issues, requiring a nurse. The mother talks about it and when she tells Su-Mi, you start following your mother. I don’t think the meant that physically. Also, if we accept that the first mother we see is actually Su-Mi, then there is a sexual suggestion as well, while the father is sleeping with her. Is that why Su-Mi is shocked and shouts, ""Don't touch me"" every time my dad comes in for later? Is that the “dirty things you did” that refers to this subsequent conversation with the father? This film is interesting in its ability to have different interpretations. Some of the scenes, however, are kind of evocative, like the black woman crawling into the scene, reminding me of Kayako’s winter motion in the Ju-On / The Grudge movies. Also, the last place from finally finds her dessert just reminds her of the Ring. Furthermore, only the idea that some characters can be demons came from the “Sixth Sense” of “Others”. Overall, I enjoyed it, however, and it would be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (which was a production) went. I have to be honest, I loved both “Ring” and “Grudge”, so I’m not one of those poor guys who insists that remodelling also can’t be good. One of the remixes that I’m really excited about is “Black Water” which will be coming out this summer. I haven’t seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my visual list.",positive

22231,"Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter that started the trend, but as is the case with many of the genre's clickés - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a couple of American are-Halloween slashers that warrant a mention. Classroom Massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly are-date one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, whilst The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies. Carpenter's seminal flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare, but it certainly started the competitive race between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen. Over the years we've seen some memorable contenders, but my favourites would have to be: My Bloody Valentine's maniacal miner, The Prowler's sadistic soldier and Wicked Games' copper-faced assassin. I'm also keen on many of the killer clowns that have made an appearance throughout the category. The final scene in The House on Sorority Row has to be listed as one of the best and The Clown of Midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest madmen's costumes. A leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie, probably because they are widely linked with sexual perversion, which of course does't exactly make for a scary disguise. But in later years both Blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit. Here's how the later of the two fared The screen flights up with the rush of blue sirens, as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation. It seems that a stressed-out gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in cruddy low-brow turkeys, so the's decided to hold this wife and kid at gunpoint. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to wrestle with the gunman, but unluckily for him the looses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like it's the send of the road for the grey haired officer. Fortunately the is saved in the nick of time by some precision marksmanship from Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the California Police Department's hottest female law-enforcer. Her heroic encounter learns the brunette a promotion to Detective first class, and its a feat that is heavily envied by her male counterparts. Meanwhile a leather-clad maniac is jollying around town slaughtering hookers and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners. Ryder and Shine are put on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal Police regulation does't seem to apply to her, so before long she's dating the cameraman even though the's suspect numero juno. When the bodies continue to pile up around the city, she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the S & M madman If anything, Zipperface effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the send of its rein. What started as a great stepping-stone for up and coming filmmakers and thespians had been reduced to a sewer of cinema faeces by movies with flat direction, zero suspense for shocks and talentless mediocre factors. The boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to conceal their black of strong dramatic line-ups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial flourishes. Unfortunately, by this point in the cycle titles like Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned feature's characters ended up. In an early grave. Donna Adams does't even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour - which includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation - is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might never expect it to be. Mansour Pourmand could't direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial. I searched and searched, but found nothing there of merit for note. On the plus side, if you manage to keep the TV turned on until the send then you may be fairly surprised by the killer's identity. To be honest though, I doubt that by that time you'll even care. And another plus point? Well, term. the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon?? Aside from that there's really no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface.

22231,"Stunning face masks and slasher movies go hand in hand with cheese and cheese during the long life of a bicycle. People often think it was John Carpenter who started the exercise, but as with most clicks of this genre - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the founders of a madman with a mad murder hood. There were some American Halloween slashers who confirmed this claim. Classic Mesker, Cape My Grave Open and Savage Weekend are clearly one thousand nine hundred and eighty-eight and Dreaded Sun Down City is considered one of the most murderous films of its kind. Carpenter's flickering seminal may not have been the girl's self-defense issue, but it certainly started a competitive race among the directors, which shows the awful hiding of their boogie menus. Over the years we've seen rivals that I remember, but should be my favourites: My Bloody Valentine's Crazy Minor, Devil's Proletarian Soldier, and Weed Games' Copper Assassin. I would also like to see a lot of murdered killers who have never come in every category. The last scene of The House on Sorority Row should be listed as one of the best and The Clown of Midnight has also been rated as one of the biggest crazy costumes. The leather mask was probably the last resort used in cheap movies, perhaps because it has a deep connection to sexual perversion, which does not cause horrible concealment. But in the years that followed, both the blackout and the blur, it was decided that fear could be combined with a jump suit. This is how they both went later. The screen flew high and the sound of a blue siren, as soon as the police reached the place of abduction. It seems that the depressed gentleman may be enough to identify the man as a green turkey, so the decided to grab the woman and the child with a gun.

Fortunately, it is updated with the exact artwork of Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the most famous female law enforcement officer in the California Police Department. Her encounter with the heroine reveals that the blonde has been promoted to the first class of detective, and this is her most enviable achievement for her male counterparts. Meanwhile, a thin lunatic wanders around the city, killing hunters and dumping their bloodied corpses on street corners. Ryder and Shine have been charged with criminal mischief for firing on a statue with criminal misconduct. Lisa is such a high profile inspector that she does't seem to be subject to ordinary police law, so soon she's dating a photographer for is suspected of being number one. As the city piles up corpses, the decides to hide this attempt to get grid of the S&M craze. What started out as a good stepping stone for emerging filmmakers and Spaniards was limited to a large number of cinemas with flat-bottom guides, startling scepticism and talented middle-class films. Has gone The brilliant years of the early years managed to hide their strong black lines with special predictable effects and a pleasant lineup. Unfortunately, at the moment, bicycle themes such as Rushweek, Deadly Dreams, and Majorities seem to have conspired to set the stage where many of the aforementioned features disappeared. In the first tomb. Donna Adams' vague mistrust as a law enforcement officer and her unprecedented attitude - including her involvement in a high-level suspect's nationwide genocide investigation - have a sudden sense of humour rather than unexpectedness. Keeps Mansoor Purmand was unable to direct the traffic and most of this members were struggling to read the second of the radio commercials. I looked and researched, but found nothing to join. On the plus side, if you're table to keep the TV on until you post, you'll be wondering who the killer is. Truth be told, I doubt you'll be interested at this point. And another point of integration? Well, term. The disc is completely symmetrical, which means you can use it as a mat to put a cup of tea on it. There is no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface.

22231,"Interesting faces and film cuts come out together like cheese and winter in the long life cycle. People often think that John Carpenter started the change, but if the case could be a lot of push -ups - Italy did it first. Movies like Eyes, Body and Blood and Black Lace were originally from the lurking of a deadly mystery. There are also some American Halloween-slashers that are guaranteed to be remembered. Class Massacre, My Grave Open and Simplified Death Week are clearly a history of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy -eight, while the dreaded City of Sundown is widely considered one of the first films to kill in young people. The part of lowering carpentry may not dream of a hidden face, but it really started a competitive battle between directors to reveal the perfect privacy on their blog. Over the years, we’ve seen some of the most memorable competitors, but my favourites must be: the Valentine’s Blood Mine in my blood, the lonely Prowler soldier and the face-off killer in Bad Games. I was also very interested in many of the killer shows that made the show throughout the stage. The latest feature of The House on Sorority Row will be listed as one of the best and the Clown of Midnight is also very high in big crazy costume. Leather masks may be the latest type used for film cutting, perhaps because they are heavily associated with sexual distortions, which of course does’t exactly produce scary hiding. But in later years both Blackout and Blacks decided that fear could be added to a gimp suit. This is how it happened later. It seemed enough that a worried and anxious man was thrown like a turkey with a soft lower leaf, so the decided to keep this wife and this child focused on the gun. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to fight the gun, but unfortunately the breaks the fight to pick up a loose pistol and it seems to send this way to the gray officer. Fortunately the was saved with at least some proper marking in the time of Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), a California law enforcement officer. In her brave encounter, she learns of the moreno’s promotion to the first stage of Criminal Investigation, and the preaching that she is jealous of her male counterparts. Meanwhile a madman is busy around the city killing hooks and throwing their bloody corpses on the sidewalks. Ryder and Shine are charged in the case of the deadly pimp and their first call for questioning is a tragedy to a street photographer named Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa was a great supervisor and the standard police code did’t seem to apply to her, so she had known the photographer for a long time even though the suspect was number one juno. As corpses continue to gather around the city, the decides to hide it in an attempt to get grid of the S&M madness If anything, Zipperface randomly sums up everything that went wrong with the thin type sent to its dispatcher. It started with a boulder for filmmakers and the next jones removed the sewage of movie heaters in the right direction, zero suspicious shock and neutral quality issues. The roaring years of the early eighties were scattered in scatterplots and managed to hide their blacks in a strong queue for special effects and interesting directors. Unfortunately, at this time circular titles like Rush Week, The Dreams of Death and The Majorettes appear to have been made in a conspiracy to make the split where many of the aforementioned characters ended up. Early burial. Donna Adams did’t even convince a law enforcement officer and her irrational behavior - including committing a crime for the nation’s top murder investigation suspect - was more of a shocking brain than you expect. Mansour Pourmand could not direct traffic and most cast members would have a hard time getting a second reading of the radio had. I searched and searched, but I did’t find anything worthy of mention there. On the positive side, if you were table to turn on the TV until it was sent, you might be surprised at the identity of the killer. Honestly, I doubt you’ll even care. And another point added? Well, the word. the tape is very smooth, which means you can use matte to put on a cup of tea ?? Other than that there is really no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface. Unfortunate and bad way, this is the ninety minutes of my life that I will effectively spend on my chest. Surprisingly",negative

The film is neither interesting, like some of Fulci's more tame Giallo's, for gory like the majority of this cult classics; thus leaving it lacking in both major areas, and ultimately ensuring that the film in't very good. The film works from a plot that has been used many times previously, but still it's an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife, which is the ultimate unknown.

This means that this ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife, and so the decides to try and get to the bottom of this death, and this only rally in this endeavour is this daughter. The video that I saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is ""in the style of HP Lovecraft"", and that's one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film I've never seen. There is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale, and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the Stuart Gordon/Lovecraft film, 'From Beyond' - which is a lot better. The film does benefit from a distinctly Italian style, and the score is rather good. Unfortunately, however, Fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it - and so the theme quickly becomes annoying. The plot plays out in a really boring way, and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost 'desperately' trying to find things out, for the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members. This movie was made for Italian TV, and so it's not surprising that it's all rather tame. There's a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies; but this in't the Fulci we all know and love.

The film is not as humorous as the upright Giallo of Fulci, and is as bloody as most ancient religions; thus making it poor in two main ways, and ultimately ensuring that the movie is not too bad.

This means that this spirit is trapped between life and the afterlife, and so the decided to try to understand this death more deeply, and the only connection in this endeavour is this girl. I saw a video of this movie proudly announcing that the movie has a “HP Lovecraft style” style, one of the most open-ended movie marketing trials I have never seen. Nothing in this story is reminiscent of one of the most terrifying writers, and the reason the tag line seems to be the same as the Stewart Gordon / Lovecraft movie ""From Another Beach"" - the best. This movie is a staple of the authentic Italian style, and the scenes are well documented. Unfortunately, Fulci believes that everything in it needs to be compared, so this article is quick to annoy. The plot is made in a very disgusting way, most of the shows include just a ghost ""urgently"" trying to find the truth, because the girl puts suspicion on her family. The film is designed for Italian TV, so it is not surprising that it is clear. There is a bit of blood and a zombie in the sequence of nightmares; but this is not the Fulci we all know and love.

This is one of the few movies where the is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film. Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great factor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she in't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)It's a game of jack tvs jill tvs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows this true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of part thieves who are in need of money due to a black of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skit's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film. The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like.

I found this movie interesting, although boring, but I think it does't have much of an impact on the subject. Certainly it cannot be considered a decision, it must have an tax to grind. ‘Like the Kingdom,’ touches on a complex subject. The film strives to give us an interpretive view, but it can only be conveyed by a bad “warning story”. The full point of deportation is not “torture”, but rather allowing “terrorist suspects” to provide intelligence by avoiding legal barriers (and consequently).

29250,"This this coming of page dramedy set in Chicago in the early sixty's, we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives. The two central characters are Leroy ""Preach"" Jackson (Turman) and this best friend Richard ""Cochise"" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both of these boys have promising futures. Preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and Cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. When they're not changing out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends, for changing out at a friends house for chasing girls, they're skipping school, riding the trains through Chicago for going to quarter parties on the weekends. Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car. The police pursue them and they are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (SNL's Garrett Morris) they are released. But the two hoods are not, and vow to get revenge on Preach and Cochise, thinking they blamed the whole thing on them. This movie is very episodic, but it still works because that what life is, a series of episodes. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all believable and relatable. Like Preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl, for a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, for dealing with a bratty younger sibling. But even when a situation in't personally relatable, like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to icon a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie, the sequence is still hilarious.'Cooley High' was the basis for the classic seventy's sitcom 'What's Happenin!' which haired on ABC from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine. Even though the show is most famous for the character Rerun, the is not in this film, nor is there any character remotely like him. The humour of that show was very broad, but still funny. The humour of 'Cooley High' is truer to life, and thus more entertaining. Additionally, the soundtrack is wonderful.

Preach is an excellent writer, but the is a lazy student, and Cochise has just graduated from college. When they do not go to a local restaurant to play dice with their friends, for when they do not go to a friend's house to change clothes and chase after the girls, they play casually and take the Chicago train on weekends to the quarterback party. When Ecclesiastes and Cochise made a mistake, they got involved in two hoods and got into a stolen car, things got worse. The police chased them and arrested them. But thanks to the efforts of the teacher involved (Garrett Morris of SNL) they were released. But the two hoods did not exist, and the vowed to avenge himself on preaching with Cochise, thinking that they were to blame for all of that.

This movie will never be boring, because all the characters are well-played, realistic, and the atmosphere is honest and appropriate. Like preaching with love to a beautiful girl, because when the bastard decides to start a fight, the party becomes violent because of the face of the annoying brother. But even though the situation has nothing to do with anyone, such as a man pretending to be a secret police officer who spends some money to imitate a prostitute so that they can allow all their friends to take part in a movie, the sequel is still very interesting. .

32344,"When THE PUFFY CHAIR beckons, beware of its soft, colourful upholstery. The movie starts out quite well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a boyfriend-girlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship. An argument occurs one night and in order to make up, Josh tasks Emily to come along on a roadtrip to this father's house where Josh plans to deliver a purplish LazyBoy recliner for this dad's birthday. Emily accepts and along the way they pick up Josh's flighty brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish-looking fellow more in touch with other peoples' lives than this own. The roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (it is initially very grubby and falling apart until Josh ""convinces"" the original owner to refurbish it). Rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of Emily and Josh's problems is the LazyBoy and sets it to the torch one night . And that's the last we hear of the chair, even though there are many minutes left in the film. The big issue is that the title of the film is The Puffy Chair, when it in't the chair at all that takes center-stage. It is Josh and Emily's doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another. Once the chair is destroyed, there's never another mention of it, even though they arrive at Josh's parents place on this father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentions the chair, nor does this father. There's no connection between it and the lives of these people. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why in't there a tie-in with it at the send? Bad script. The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass' brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director but also the cameraman (and not a very good). Nearly every scene has a rapid zoom-in on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus catches up and rights itself. Initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel, but rapidly became unbearable. The acting in the film is accessible and entertaining. All of the factors/actresses did fine jobs.

Josh (Mark Duplas) and Emily (Catherine Asselton) are both boys and girls, and their relationship is strained. One night there was an argument, and to do this, Josh asked Emily to take a trip to my dad's house, where Josh had planned to send a LazyBoy lounge chair for Dad's birthday. Emily adopted Josh's brother Reid (played by Reid Wilkins). The trip soon became more and more controversial between Josh and Emily, with a bitter feeling about the cushioned chair (it was so dirty and we parted at first, until Josh “convinced” the first owner to renovate it). Rhett quickly decided that all of Emily and Josh's problems were caused by LazyBoy and burned him overnight. This is the last time you hear about the chair, even though there are still many minutes in the film. The big problem is that the title of the movie is Puffy Chair, who sits in the center of the room when she is not in the chair at all. This is an endless relationship between Josh and Emily, and how the journey made them feel in love. After the chair was destroyed, there was no further mention, although they arrived at Josh's parents' house without presents on Josh's father's birthday. Josh did not mention the chair, nor did the father. It has nothing to do with the lives of these people. So why a film called Puffy Chair and why not join it when it is released? Bad script.

38766,"SPOILERS AHEAD fifteen PARK AVENUE: My Humble take on this film Now, for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine, niche films like fifteen Park Avenue bought to be palatable to my sensibilities. With this thought, and a mild sense of embarrassment that I than't watched the complete film earlier, I watched this film last Saturday. There are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch) from which, this film borrows at least three concepts:- a) That (at least some) truths are relative of) The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll, is uncannily similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita undertook in Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film pc) The incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole 'occurence behind Winkies' involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per Se is seamlessly linked to other works of Lynch (notice carefully the dishevelled long hair), the effect of the beggar woman in fifteen PA appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message The other films from which fifteen PA also borrows is Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth Vs. perceived truth poser presented towards the send of Antonioni's masterpiece). Of course, the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind, ""A Beautiful mind"". Although, admittedly the subject there is high brow physics and Shabana, who professes it, inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of Konkona's character through those very prophecies. In an outstanding scene in the movie, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of Shabana, where Quantum Physics and the Theory of Relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, to the artificial edifice of the 'make believe' world of Mithi But for all their differences, the sisters are alike too. Both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships- one out of choice and the other out of nature. So, Mithi's spain at being rejected in love by Joydeep is in harmony with the inability of Shaban to form a special bond with either Kunal(Dhritiman) for Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm getting ahead of myself. Viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways:- Hypothesis one: ""It was Shabana all along"" There is a certain section of the audience who think so. But that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too (i.e. all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing Mithi along with her) Hypothesis two: ""There WAS a REAL Mithi and the ending is a metaphor"" This POV says that the film's essence is summarized in one dialog in the film, when in response to a statement by Joy (Rahul Bose), that Mithi is looking for something that she will never find, this wife Laxmi (Shefali Shah) philosophies that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia, the send of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment There are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by your knowledgeable audience like:- Hypothesis three:"" Shabana and Konkona are walter egos of the same person"" Hypothesis four: ""Shabana too is a figment of Mithi's imagination"" Hypothesis five: ""The old, haggard, perhaps mad, beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story"" Are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested? Well, your guess is as good as mine ""Why fifteen Park Avenue?"" Contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the Park Avenue in NY, I believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap. Remember, her stating Jo Jo's profession as ""Prime minister of Shikakai"", which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing Shampoos. The prefix 'fifteen' is used as it was on fifteenth December that Mithi got engaged to Joydeep and after this walkout, she remains forever in a time warp. The film has its fair share of flaws- black of use of a strong background score, which in films like these can really augment the narrative, some sloppy dialog unabated by some forced dialog delivery. Inconsistent performances (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent though IMO) by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot. I give it seven/ten as it made me think but not any higher than that because I can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced (and for the most part, thoroughly enjoyed) those previously, I have already thought on similar lines earlier. So, the experience post fifteen PA is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty. Where am I coming from? I gave nine.five/ten to 'thirty-six Chowringhee Lane' (though rumours still persist that one Satyajit Ray ghost directed it), seven.five to 'Paromiter Ek Din', seven to 'Mr and Mrs Iyer' and five to 'Paroma'.

In both cases, the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film pc) The incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole 'occurence behind Winkies' involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per Se is seamlessly linked to other works of Lynch (notice carefully the dishevelled long hair), the effect of the beggar woman in fifteen PA appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message The other films from which fifteen PA also borrows is Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth Vs. perceived truth poser presented towards the send of Antonioni's masterpiece). There are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch) from which, this film borrows at least three concepts:- a) That (at least some) truths are relative of) The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll, is uncannily similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita undertook in Mulholland Drive. In an outstanding scene in the movie, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of Shabana, where Quantum Physics and the Theory of Relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, to the artificial edifice of the 'make believe' world of Mithi But for all their differences, the sisters are alike too. I gave nine.five/ten to 'thirty-six Chowringhee Lane' (though rumours still persist that one Satyajit Ray ghost directed it), seven.five to 'Paromiter Ek Din', seven to 'Mr and Mrs Iyer' and five to 'Paroma'.

With the thought and a little embarrassment that I than't seen the whole movie before, I watched this movie last week. There are some similarities with other works, such as the legendary Mulland Drive (David Lynch) in which the film blends itself to at least three concepts: Riding daughter and Rita occupied Mulholland Drive. In either case, the object under investigation is likely to be a myth in both cases, and perhaps a clear sign in the PC film Aparna.

Medicine 'assures' but sisters are the same in all their diversity. The two cannot form a lasting relationship - one by choice and the other by nature. Therefore, Mathi's Spanish love affair with Judeip is related to Shaban's failure to establish a special relationship with Sanjeev (Kanoljit) 's Kanal (Dhartiman). But I move on for myself. Viewers typically watch a movie in one of the following two ways: - The first theory: ""It was always night."" A certain segment of the audience thinks so. But this explanation is not only far-fetched but also worrying because it would mean that the was dreaming of many other characters (all the characters who had imagined Madison with him). : ""Once again there was a real tree. In an interview in the film, in response to the statement of Joy (Rahul Bose), that Mithi wants something that she will never get, this is the philosophy of Khatun Lakshmi (Shefali Shah) that We all really want that landmark, a rainbow princess that looks soft.

The film has its share of flaws - in the darkness of using strong backlinks, which has enhanced the narrative in such films, another cruel dialogue that does not prevent forced dialogue delivery. Asymmetrical dramas for a few characters (Shabana and Dhartiman are great though IMO) although many members of the cast have been eliminated. Shefali Chaya's sudden self-doubt about her husband seems like an unimaginable idea presented in the program. I give him seven / ten as the made me think but not more because I can easily understand this source of inspiration and knowledge (and for the most part, I really enjoyed it). Picked up) that before, I thought in the same letters. . . Therefore, the experience after fifteenth PA should definitely not be for a certain level of youth.

Of course, the opinion of professors with schizophrenia is also reminiscent of ""Good Mind."" Although, it is true that the matter of the venerable physics, and Shabana, who claims to be, unknowingly ultimately formulate a sharp antithesis of the deceptive views of the Konkona character of these prophecies. In the best movie scenes, some of these things are put together, and the story is reversed back and forth with Shana's ""real"" world, where quantum physics and relationships show that the boundary and structure of the universe makes sense, to Trees of man-made ""artificial"" houses, but despite the differences, the sisters are also very similar. Nor can the form a lasting relationship — one because of choice, the other because of nature. Therefore, the Spanish Tree’s refusal to date Joydeep is in line with Shaban’s inability to form a special connection with Kunar (Dhritiman) for Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I will pass. Viewers usually watch the movie in one of two ways: -Think one: ""Always Shabane"" Some listeners think so. But this explanation is not only a narrative, but also a demonstration, because it means that you are dreaming with other characters (that is, all the characters that the thought were trees with him) Hypothesis two: Trees and the ending are metaphors. ” The POV stated that the main idea of ​​the movie was summarized in the dialogue in the movie.

Well, your guess is the same as mine. ""Why is fifteen Park Avenue?"" Contrary to popular belief, the thinks of Park Avenue in New York. I believe this name comes from a very popular soap. Remember, the says Jo Jo's job is ""Prime Minister of Shikakai"", who you can say is a popular ingredient used in shampoos. The prefix ""fifteen"" was used because Tree was engaged to Joydeep on December fifteen. After this protest, the remained in the warp of time forever. The film has a few flaws — black using strong background sound. The performance of some players is inconsistent (Shabana and Dhritimaan excel in IMO), but most of the music members have played. Shefali Chaya's sudden black of confidence in her husband seems unthinkable in this conspiracy. I give it a seven / ten because it makes me think, but it's not higher than that because I easily understand the origin of its inspiration and I have experienced (and in many cases, really enjoyed it) those, I the same Way Therefore, experiences after fifteenPA should not be new.

39216,"I read Tom Robbins' EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under ""GAY PRIDE -- WOMEN -- LESBIANS."" (That's the Library of Congress subject heading.) Now anyone over twelve who reads the book will know it has NOTHING TO DO with real lesbians, any more than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was obviously -- and I do mean OBVIOUSLY --written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians (in the nude, all the time)but has never really met one. Still, someone in Hollywood said, ""uh pooh, better give this to a Gay director for Gay People will make trouble."" So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but -- however Gay the may really be -- the has not a clue as to how to make a funny film. Gus Van Sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl/girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull, literal-minded Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not pretty. The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. His clout allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the novel's real subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster)caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre. Let's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. PAT MORITA as ""THE CHINK"" Okay, there are few name-recognition Asian factors. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was fairly funny. But casting him as THE CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man. (Gus did't tell him.) Pat also does't seem to know that the Chink is . . . well, SEXY!!! In the book the's not wise old Mr. Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! He's a randy old goat and the knows A LOT about pleasing the nubile and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they karen't REALLY lesbians. Do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet?) JOHN HURT as ""THE COUNTESS."" Okay, the's a gay friendly man. But the is a SERIOUS, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR!!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept expecting Paul Scofield to wander in all dressed up as Thomas More, and sadly shake this head. ""Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul entirely. For shame, my former student!"" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and pretty gay) as Caligula. But that was BLACK humour, not playful and breezy humour like the book. RAIN PHOENIX as ""Bonanza Jellybean."" No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving. In the movie she's sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it like this. ""God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits."" Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? UMA THURMAN as ""Sissy Hankshaw."" This is a tough role. In the book Sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. Still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, for a sway in her walk, to simply some sort of hidden strength for hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma does't pull it off, probably because Gus never told her Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma plays it more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukaemia. This movie is sour and dull. And I accuse YOU, Gus Van Sant!",negative

39216,"When I was a teenager, I read Tom Robbins' book ""Even Cowgirls Can Get Blue"". I like all the words. Fascinating, interesting, full of charm and beautiful text. But when I saw the movie, I could't believe how dull, sour, and uninteresting it was. How did this happen? I think someone from Hollywood read this book and described it as ""Gay Pride-Women-Lesbians"". (That is the subject of a Congress Library theme.) Anyone who is over twelve years old reading this book now knows that it has nothing to do with real homosexuality, just as Star Wars is about real travel in space. This book is clearly — I mean clearly — written by a man of the opposite sex (who is always naked) who loves the view of lesbians, but has never met him. However, a Hollywood man said, ""Oh, ooh, it's better to give this to the gay authorities, because gay people will get in trouble."" So they gave him Gus Van Sant. There’s nothing against this man, but — even if the’s really gay — the has no idea how to make an interesting movie. Gus Van Sant transformed the straightforward ideas of playful male / female virtuous girls and men's voyeurism into dull, straightforward posters demanding homosexuality. It’s like turning Oscar Wilde’s comedy into Arthur Miller’s tragedy. It's not good. The main guide that Gus Van Sant does not know how to deal with the source of material is a very bad throw. His influence enabled him to hire the best men. His ignorance of the true theme of the novel (a fantasy of the opposite sex, not a poster for homosexuals) led to this choice not only bad but strange. Let's get acquainted with the guards of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. PAT MORITA as ""CHINK"" Yes, Asians are not very popular. And Pat Morita, on HAPPY DAYS, is very interested. But it's not right, it's not right, to show him as CHINK. Pat Morita had no idea that Chink was a very interesting person. (Gus did't tell her.) Pat does't seem to know that it's Chink. . Yes, sexy! ! ! Miyagi old unwise in the book. You look like Hugh Hefner! He’s an old ripped goat who knows exactly how to please a teenager with a responsive sister and Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they are not real lesbians. Do you realize that this is a fantasy of straight men?) John Hurt plays ""Countess"". Well, this is gay friendly. But this is a serious Shakespearean player! ! ! ! You need someone who is interested in completing this role. It is sad and tragic that John Hurt is portrayed as a fool like a fugitive. I was expecting Paul Scofield to walk around in it, dressed like Thomas More, and then the shook this head sadly. ""Now, Richard, you know you've completely lost your soul. It's a shame, my former student!"" Yes, John Hurt who plays Caligula is funny (and very gay). But that’s a dark joke, not a playful and lively joke like in a book. RAIN PHOENIX as ""Bonanza Jellybean"". No talent, no training, no problem. Apart from the book Bonanza, it is funny, playful, fun, (mostly) the opposite sex and love. In this movie, she is depressed, speechless, speechless, and depressed. As for this taste for women, Robbins in the book said so. ""God knows I love women, but nothing can replace a good man."" Uh, Gus? Have you read this book? If Thurman plays ""Hankshaw Sissy"". This is a difficult role. In the book, Cici is really an inactive and shy hero. Still, an accomplished factor can blink this eyes, move this movement, and hide some hidden power just to hide what is happening. Uma did't succeed, probably because Gus did't tell her that Sissy should enjoy being a good-looking rider with big thumbs. Uma is like a role in a TV movie about a girl who died of leukaemia. This movie is sour and crowded. I criticize you, Gus Van Sant!",negative

In an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, the writer and director of Sakura Killers did another ninja film under the Bonaire movie flag called ""White Phantom"" I have no idea if this was meant to be a sequel to Sakura Killers"" but the Sakura clan is once again a main feature, including the same logo and similar story only this time including a White Ninja. This too, while being mostly dire, had a small sense of atmosphere but the fight scenes are even more space and to be frank, are pretty awful. What is important are the fight scenes, while a 'little' space, are really good. I saw this film back in about one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight/eighty-nine for so when I was a boy and I'm sorry to say it started a life long fascination with ninjas.

It's no Mamet script, that's for sure; but COME ON!!! with all the HORRIBLE garbage out there, ESPECIALLY in Horror, I thought this one was WAY closer to the top of the pile than most. The director used a lot of neat, clever camera angles; the soundtrack was excellent and moody, perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film. The editing and timing were very good.

She feels beaten by her brothers. In fact, the whole idea of ​​women in the film, which looks like miserable and helpless creatures, is utterly despicable. However, there is a group responsible for nudity, this time involving a young woman swimming in a pool bra under a very small T-shirt. Who cares about the consistency of a building when it has small stars ready to destroy its cones? Okay fine ?!

40796,"A friend of mine asked: ""Doesn't one have to be pro-euthanasia in order to like this movie? Is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to send their lives?"" Interesting questions. As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to send this life in The Sea Inside. Think Ramón Sampedro addressed this in the movie as well. It is the who wants to die. It is the who is fighting for this right to decide this death. He is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics. Though this pioneering work, depending on one's perspective, may prove beneficial for damaging to quadriplegics down the road, this primary objective is a personal one. But one thing this movie does (my opinion anyway), is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forth. After my first viewing of The Sea Inside, I walked home in a conflicted blur. I struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion; why would Ramón want to die? Given the love, care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on Ramón by the people surrounding him, why would the doggedly cling on to this hurtful decision? Then, on my second viewing, a shared thought between Ramón and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness. It threw up a telling observation: "". total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy."" Most human beings crave for such an intimacy. Of course, how much we value such ""needs"", depends largely on the individual. As a person with a familial-biased sensibility, I empathise strongly with the caregivers in this movie. Why can't Javier consider the sacrifice and the love from this family and friends? Is the blind to it all? I would think not. The miracle of The Sea Inside therefore, is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war. When we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one, whom has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intent to die, what then is the right thing to do? Is caring for and keeping this loved one alive, against this for her will, a pious gesture? Does it show up the worth of your love? Or does it merely soothe your ""selfish"" fears of irreplaceable loss? With so much understanding accorded to caregivers, would't their invalid charges, by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival, also be an overlooked act of sacrifice? Rhetorical for not, how much is ""dignity"" worth to an individual? Is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege for a right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their eventual decisions in life (as in death)? A torrent of questions the movie might have asked, answers to which, I'm in no position to provide. In your eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro-life for pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's engulfing the people most intimately affected, the caregivers and the jones they care for. The Sea Inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them. Intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the nature of ""sacrifice"" is never one-sided. In this tug of war, we should endeavour not to win arguments, but to intently observe and hopefully determine, who is the ""stronger"" party to make that sacrifice. The Sea Inside is a sobering film. It opened my eyes to things I don't wanna see. And for that, I am grateful.",positive
40796,"A friend of mine asked: ""Shouldn't someone be used to kill people to like this movie? But one thing this movie does (in my opinion anyway) is that it It forces us to ask the audience questions.",positive
40796,"A friend of mine asked: ""You don't have to support euthanasia to love this movie? Is it a movie error to show that most quadriplegics want to give their lives?"" An interesting question. To the best of my knowledge (correct me if I am wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wants to send this life ""Hainai"". Consider Ramon San Pedro, who also solved the problem in the movie. People who want to die. Those who decide this kind of death are the jones who fight for this right. He was speaking for himself, not for other quadriplegics. While this basic function may prove useful in future quadriplegia from a human point of view, this primary objective is a personal one. But one thing that this movie does (whatever my opinion) is that it forces us viewers to ask themselves the trivial questions my friend briefly asked. After watching the Inland Sea for the first time, I walked home in a mysterious way. I tried to accept this annoying idea. Why does Ramon want to die? Considering the unwavering love, concern, and self-sacrifice of the people around Ramon, why did the insist on this dangerous decision? Then, when I watched it for the second time, the familiar thoughts between Ramon and the lady lawyer came to my mind. It offers this assurance: “Complete dependence is a result of intimacy.” Most people desire such intimacy. Of course, the extent to which we attach the importance of this ""need"" depends largely on the individual. As a family racist, I sympathize with the caregiver in this movie. Why can't Havel consider the sacrifice and love that comes from this family and friend? Is the blind? I do not think so. So, the wonder of the Inland Sea lies in the deep picture of human war-torn competition. When we are under surveillance by a relative who is mentally retarded but unable to do so, we are announcing this calm, reasonable, and reasonable intent to die. Is it a divine act to care for and maintain a loved one who lives contrary to this for her will? Does it reflect the value of your love? Or is it simply a matter of justifying your “selfish” fear of an irreversible loss? Given so much understanding by caregivers, their unjustified accusations, and complete reliance on others for survival, is it not an act of disregard for sacrifice? Rhetoric does not exist, how much ""dignity"" does a person value? Is it a right to live (or die) with dignity? If we truly care and love the person, should we respect this for her final decision in life (such as death)? There are so many questions that a movie can ask, and I can't answer them. Because you are interested in distinguishing between life-sustaining resources and psychosocial support options, we run the risk of ignoring the gray sea that covers the most affected, caring, and Jones caregivers. The Inner Sea, therefore, attempts to demonstrate the intricacies and complexity of the relationship between them. Intuitively, this movie understands one thing; the ""offering"" type is not one-sided. In this war-torn game, we should not try to win the debate, but focus on who is the ""strongest"" organization to make this sacrifice. ""Inner Sea"" is a thought-provoking movie. It allows me to see things I don't want to see. For this, I am very grateful.",positive
40796,"My friend asked me: ""Shouldn't someone be pro-euthanasia to love this movie? Interesting questions. As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), Ramón is there Sampedro also spoke about the film. He wants to die. He is fighting for this right to decide on this death.talking about it not like a square. While this work of pioneering, it depends on a person's point view, can be useful to the detriment of a square, the main purpose of which is personal. But one thing this film does (in my opinion)), however, is forcing viewers to ask themselves of a series of frequently asked questions by my friend. When I first looked at the Sea, I walked towards my house and collided. I struggled in. I agree with this angry idea; Why does Ramón want to die? Because there is no up the love, care and sacrifice that Ramón poured out for the people around him, why was the so attached to this painful decision? Then, when I watched it again, a thought I had shared between Ramón and the lawyer’s wife came to my mind. He advocated the effective observation: ""The general expectation comes at the cost of connectivity."" Most people love this kind of closeness. Of course, as we assess such “needs”, it is often up to the person. As someone who is committed to the family, I closely follow the guardians of this film. Why can’t Javier consider the sacrifice and love of these family and friends? Is it all blind? I do not think so. The Miracle of the Sea, then, is a painting depicting a humanitarian war. When we are faced with the responsibility of a loved one who is aware, but weak, who has shown calm, gentleness and a reasonable intention to die, then what is to be done? Is caring for and protecting a loved one’s life against this for her will, is it a divine guide? Does it show the value of your love? Or does it just fix your fear of “yourself” for irreversible loss? With so much understanding given to caregivers, in’t their accusation valid, surrender to the general dependence of others on safety, nor is an act of self-sacrifice noticed? Rhetorically for no, how much “dignity” does a person have? Do you have the right to live (or die) with dignity? If we truly care and love someone, do we also respect their decisions in the afterlife (such as death)? There are many questions that the film can ask, the answers to them, I am not in a position to give. In your quest to intelligently visualize life’s priorities in choices, we manage the risk of ignoring the gray ocean of people particularly affected, caregivers and caregivers. Inside the sea the tried to show the soft but still intimate connection between them. Emotionally, this film understands one thing; that the nature of “sacrifice” is not habits on one side. In this struggle, we must strive to win the debate, but we must think carefully and hopefully decide who is “stronger” and who is making that sacrifice. Sea Inside is a sensational film. It opened my eyes to things I did’t want to see. And for that, I appreciate it.",positive
40796,"A friend of mine asked: ""Isn't it necessary to be a supporter of euthanasia to like this movie? Is it a movie mistake that most people with quadriplegics want to post their lives? "" Interesting questions. In my opinion (correct me if I'm wrong), only one square wanted to send this life to DC Inside. Imagine Ramón Sampedro talking about it in a movie. He is the one who wants to die. They are the jones who fight for this right to decide this death. He speaks for himself and not for the other square. While this initiative's work may, from a human point of view, be beneficial in damaging the square under the road, its primary purpose is personal. But one thing that makes this film (my opinion anyway) is that it forces us viewers to ask ourselves some vague questions that my friend has asked briefly. After my first look inside DC, I went home with the opposite direction. I struggled to reconcile this disturbing ideology. Why does Ramon want to die? In view of the extraordinary love, care and devotion that Ramon unconditionally bestowed on the people around him, why did those in power cling to this painful decision? Then, in my second look, an idea came to my mind between Ramon and the lawyer. He made an important point: ""Complete dependence comes at the cost of proximity."" Many people long for such closeness. Of course, how much we value such ""needs"" depends on the individual. As a bigoted family man, I have a lot of sympathy for the caregivers in this film. Why does't Xavier think about this sacrifices and the love the shows for this family and friends? Can't see everything? I don't think so. So the miracle under the sea, its clever picture of human war. What to do when faced with the care of a mentally healthy but disabled loved one who has expressed a calm, reasonable and reasonable purpose for death? Is taking care of this loved one and keeping him alive, against this will, a sacred act? Does it show the importance of your love? Or does the just not pay attention when you tell him to do something? Would it be a selfless act of self-sacrifice for the caregivers, with such understanding, to surrender to their unreasonable charge, to be completely dependent on others for survival? Rhetoric for no, how important is ""dignity"" for a person? Is it right to live (or die) with dignity? If we really care and love this person, should't we finally respect this decisions (as in the case of death)? Lots of questions that the film may have asked, answers that I am not in a position to give. In your determination to psychologically separate the virtues of a supportive life in terms of choice, we take the risk of overlooking the gray sea that affects the most affected people, caregivers and their caregivers. The performer wraps up Jones. Sea Inside therefore sought to establish a soft but complex relationship between them. Obviously, this film understands one thing. That the ""sacrifice"" oath is not one-sided. In this conflict, we must not try to win the conflict, but look carefully and hopefully this is the ""strong"" party that made the sacrifice. C Inside is an interesting film. It opened my eyes to things I did't want to see. And for that, thanks.",positive

42588,"Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The thirteenth Floor, and when I first saw it I would have agreed -- I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed. But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely. The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mambo-jumbo thrown in. The thirteenth Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mambo-jumbo thrown in. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about ""reality"" for any such ""deep"" concept. It's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe. The most chilling moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats her ""scripted"" line. It's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story. This is made even more frightening at the send when D'Arcy Nader (or rather this player) comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game. I sympathize completely with the ""realist"" philosophy, that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the send goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence. Living ""in the game"" is not living at all, but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth. As Allegra comments about the real world, ""there's nothing going on there."" Might as well jack into someone else's imagination, and pretend to be doing something interesting. (Although I have to ask whether Cronenberg considers this a self-indictment, considering that the himself offers up worlds to be experienced in ninety minute snippets.)Upon leaving the theatre after first watching this movie, I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended. But having seen it a couple more times (thank you SciFi Channel) I've realized how much deeper it goes. Seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves another viewing.",positive

They are so forced in their intention of simply grossing people out, that they have nothing else to say. The gibberish of the off-narrator is simply boring, the visuals are cheap. OK, the effects are good, but if that´s the only thing, why care? Husseins film wants to be shocking and thought-provoking - instead it is boring and annoying in its non-creativity. Note: Not every movie without a story is part and there is absolutely no creativity in breaking taboos anymore - especially not if everything is executed as bad as in ""S. C."".

Bad speech, bad habits, bad direction, unexpected and well-planned skills, the music was disturbing, the camera work was depressing, and the dress was not good. I was disgusted by the features they were trying to convey, but they had to deal with ugly, structured dialogue and a clear dark side. I doubt they exercise too. It's a shame to see it, so it's boring instead of leading you to a ""surprise"" that requires a lot of perseverance. This is one of the worst movies I've never seen. I rarely wrote reviews, but it was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. Don't miss the ""Performance"" feature if you want to see this movie.

Overall, the film is a pleasure. as one of the most possible war films never, nothing, famous for its emphasis on poetic poetry, but I believe it obscures the complexity of the larger dinner of this Russian film, which looks not only horror graphic router, but gets really encouraging pictures. focuses on individuals in small groups of characters that reflect the complete madness within this year, and the ending is downright frightening. Bullets are flying and bodies are dying in a shootout at the opening points, where the power of the film never stops all the time, with the focus on sad faces, elderly soldiers with no heat , people were terrified of hungry children with terrified mothers, they were all thrown into a massive, endless stream of white snow. Like the CRANES FLYING (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty -seven), it consisted of Russian troops retreating, terrified of the start of the war when they were about to be exterminated. The Russian countryside was occupied by Nazi Germany who intimidated its citizens, stole what they date, forced them to turn a blind eye and years of information. For the rest of the Russian soldiers they hid in the jungle, but were forced to send supplies to nearby farms. The film follows two soldiers who are initially on an impossible mission, as they have little food left over during the winter. One was healthy and fit, Vladimir Gostyukhin of Rybak, while the other, Boris Plotnikov of Sotnikov, coughed up a tubercular sound and eventually a bullet wound to the leg nearly killed him, but this couple the bravely saved. When they across knee -deep and deep snow, crawling in some places with insufficient protection against hard objects, like many other Russian films, nature itself becomes their bitterest enemy. Spoilers !! Everything is summed up in a matter of safety. When they reached their destination, the farm was demolished and left in a state of ruin, pushed forward into German -occupied territory where the next farm was managed by an old Soviet rally who feared revenge from the Nazis. The party soldiers thought the was a coward but they persisted, where the was captured and taken to a Nazi camp near a captive town, along with a noble mother (Lyudmila Polyakova) who helped him hide. Tarkovsky’s stalwart Anatoli Solonitsyn seems to be Portnov in question, a Russian teacher from a nearby academy turned Nazi supporter. The Russians who tortured and killed other Russians were deep in the corruption of war Solonitsyn was good at the derogatory role in the most appropriate way. As we can see, while the Nazi officers were jokingly chatting with each other, the was a stranger even to this group, and was instead seen as a kind of black operative who kept sending people in their graves. The audience is not ashamed to witness the facts of Sotnikov’s torture, which offers nothing but contempt, while Rybak speaks freely, hoping to save this life, but both are sentenced to death, although Rybak is given the opportunity serve in the German Reich as a police agent. This group included mother, elderly coworker, and son, an evening together where they discussed the merits of a soldier’s mission, being patriotic, motherly, cowardly, and coworker. Each seems to drive in particular a desperate need to survive, but Sotnikov presents himself as an example of self -sacrifice, trying to admit this crime in order to forgive others, for which the title appropriately chosen is reflects this spiritual redemption. The next morning, Portnov seems ridiculously mocked, mocking their unexpected desire to speak, but has no sympathy for anyone except Rybak, who has turned away to keep this life alive, contemplating this idea. that if the was alive, at least the had a chance to escape. But there is no escape from this misery. What was happening was announced in a very sweet and friendly way, as we witnessed the deception of the war without even a single gun being fired, as the execution of the conversion was made a public demonstration, to which the villagers who pointed the gun were compelled to witness . The scope and intensity of this film is unstoppable, as there is no moment without danger, beautifully shot by Vladimir Chukhnov (who died in a car accident similar to Shepitko), with a visual appearance of the composition and lots of movement. camera, often close by using a picture, especially of a very hot boy who ignores the convicted men, who has a real relationship with the next generation without words, which reinforces the strange and bizarre soundtrack of Alfred Shnittke’s music in Kubrick’s two and-a-half-single singles: A Space ODYSSEY (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight). The sound design of this film is very advanced and strangely modern, where the use of screen sound constantly exposes the raw nerves of every moment, dogs barking, wind blowing, bullets, tremors. Nazi conversation. in Germany it is not defined as sad laughing, which only increases the ugly tension in insane places. In many ways resembling Dreyer THE JOAN OF ARC (one thousand, nine hundred and twenty -eight), there appears there is insane fat, the relentless realization that you have no choice, but you are still forced to make one . The idea of ​​a dinner banquet is said to be silent, where the majesty of the dead speaks aloud, where voices continue to roar at the heads of living things like an explosion of endless sound, but silence. cold, rough air with sad appreciation. and a deep sense of loss.",positive

As one of the real war movies never, never failed, not marked by the intensity of the poems, but I'm sure the black color of an even bigger Russian movie, not only discovers the horror of the graphic router. , But also finds really impressive images. Focusing on the individual with small groups of characters reflects the complete madness that goes on inside them, with amazing results. The bullets fly and the bodies die from the bullets on the initial credit, where the power of the film does not always send, the focus on the ugly face, the tired soldiers who have nothing to burn, the frightened people starving children. Work with frustrated mothers, all in a wide white color. Blizzard-like cranes are flying (one thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven), including the retreat of the Russian army, a tragic shock at the beginning of the war when they were almost exhausted. Russian suburbs are full of Nazi Germans who intimidate citizens, steal their food and force them to be vigilant with their years of experience. Russian troops hid in the jungle, but were forced to send food to neighbouring fields. The film follows two soldiers who are initially on an impossible mission, as there is very little food left anywhere during the dead winter. One is alive and well, Vladimir Gostyukhen as a rabbi, and the other, as Boris Plutankov Sutnikov, slowed down due to a sympathetic saliva in this chest and eventually died of a gunshot wound to the leg. The companion bravely saved him. Going through knee-deep nice cages, crawling in places without proper protection from hard objects, nature itself, like many other Russian films, becomes their strongest enemy. Spoiler !!

The group's soldiers thought the was a coward but persevered, when the was eventually captured and taken to a Nazi camp in a nearby town and held captive with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polikova) who Helped hide them. Tarkovsky's hero, Anatoly Solonitsen, is seen as an interrogator of Portnov, a Russian teacher at a nearby school who became a pro-Nazi. The Russian people are torturing and killing other Russians in the depths of the war, and Solonitson is prominent in an abominable role that is totally inappropriate. What we can see, as the Nazis chuckle happily around each other, is an outsider even within the group, rather than being seen as a horrible black-clad funeral that often befell men. Sends them to their graves. The audience could not escape witnessing the facts of Sutnikov's violence, which gave nothing but insults, while Rebekah spoke freely in the hope of saving her life, but both were sentenced to death, although Rebekah Germans were given the opportunity to work. Reich as a police agent. A mother, an elderly companion and a child were added to the group, who spent the night together and talked about the legitimacy of a soldier's purpose, a patriot, a mother, a coward, a participant. ۔ It seems that each of them desperately needs life, but Sutnikov presents himself as an example of sacrifice, trying to confess guilt to save others, when one is well The chosen theme reflects this spiritual freedom.

44984,"I think the cards were stacked against Webmaster, because right from the start there was this itchy feeling, like something was wrong but I could't quite put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Dubbed. For a little while, they managed most of the lines either as voice over for off screen, with just a little hint there and there, until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves, with nothing even remotely funny about it. I hate dubbing, but at least, however misplaced, martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it. What I wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that. Maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie Hackers (being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in). What I got was some poorly written, nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without this little lego, and a director who obviously did't know how to handle a camera. I just wanted to reach in there, grab the camera from the guy, and shoot the dang thing myself. The editing was't much better. The acting? Well, I guess if the lead guy did't have such a bad script to work from, the'd be at least watchable. The main bad guy was OK, too, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. Dubbing did't help, but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration. Before I get into more bad, let's perk up to a few good things. Well, one for two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I rather enjoyed the cyberworld stuff, what little there was of it, and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about, in, and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the 'real world'. The falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kind of cool, but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things. The heart gadget, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of Escape from New York, it was horribly conceived in the long run. There's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and your hero is right there. Why did't the try the bad guy's thumb print then (since the heart device was thumb activated)? Nonetheless, some interesting gadgets and khyber stuff, if only they could have been utilized better. Now, who there dares compare this movie to Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off kilter type of romance in it, sort of, in both films. There's the investigation of a murder, but I've seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either Blade Runner for Webmaster. Identity, for instance. That's about where the similarities send. Period. There is no comparison, just as there would't be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for part direction and knows some fundamentals of film-making, like where to put the camera. Webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than not takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the send to get her to Point B by herself without the Hero, so that the could do this thing. Very convenient. Or, the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for. Or, inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get away.). It tries to be ship, it tries to be exploitive, it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising, and it tries to be thrilling. But a bunch of near identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly shot, bad acting, etc. does not a thrilling movie make.",negative

This type of trade makes people nervous, not funny at all. I hate copying, but at least, no matter how lost it is, martial arts movies and inappropriate writing are always funny. What I really want is a movie about real attackers. Maybe it’s like the opposite of a movie hacker table (about people trying to keep them out, not about people trying to get in). What I found was poorly written and sometimes ridiculous murder mysteries with incorrect sequence, a mysterious giant cast outside this little Lego, and a boss who apparently did’t know how to use the camera. I just want to get inside, take the camera from that guy, and shoot myself. Editing is not much better. Are you kidding? Yeah, I think the player does't have that bad script, you can watch it. The worst people are also good, but almost everyone jokes. Copying did not help, but even in this case, the drama was much worse. Before I get into a bad situation, let's celebrate and do good things. Well, the other two. Apart from the basic graphics, I prefer something in the online world, which has very little content, and I would love to watch a movie about it outside of the subtle world outside of the ""real world"". Fake fingers seem cool, but in the send they don’t matter in the planning process. The heart gadget that reminds me of ""Cronos"" by Guillermo Del Toro is interesting, though as a direct tear to the page ""Escape from New York"" At some point, the bad guys close their minds, and your hero is there. So why not try a bad person's thumb (because the heart device is made with a thumb)? However, some interesting tools and Khyber items, it would be nice if they could be used better. Now, who would dare to compare this movie with Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future, and there is some kind of incompatible love in both films. There is a murder investigation, but I have seen many murder movies, completely different from the web host Blade Runner. Take ID as an example. This is the same. time. There is no comparison, as there is no comparison between Blade Runner and the attackers. Ridley Scott is a talented director who has a good sense of humour about certain directors and understands some of the basics of making a film, such as a camera stand. Webmasters are cheaper, not just because of budget. Because it is not well written, it is not expensive, and because it always takes simple steps (such as writing a character that seems to save a girl) It can be done, very good. The character has no reason to care, for something as stupid as a car makes them stop just in time for someone to run away.

Dry for a while, they lined up on the screen as many lines for sounds, a bit there and there, until it became very clear. It's a kind of emotional touch, there's nothing funny about it. I hate copying, but at least, so-called karate movies often have a sense of humour. All I wanted was a movie about a criminal who committed real crimes and things like that. Maybe movie hackers like the opposite side of the table (it's about people trying to keep them out instead of people trying to get in). What I found was poorly written, sometimes irrational and mysterious chords of a pursuer, a so-called ignorant criminal who was chased away from this little Lego, and a director who apparently had no idea Was how to handle the camera. I just wanted to get there, grab the camera from the boy, and shoot something. The edit was not perfect. Imitation? Well, I think if the person in charge did't have such a bad script to work with, it would at least look like that. The main villain was good too, but almost everyone was joking. There was no point in copying, but it was too bad to consider. Before I get into the worst, let's put some good things together. Well, one of the two. Despite the popular artwork, I enjoyed the things of the khyber world, a little bit of it was there, and I would see a lot of movies that were mostly about it, from the inside, and where from the 'real world' There is a siege outside. The deception of the six seals seemed cool, but it was useless in the system of life. The Hart gadget, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was fascinating, although it appeared live on the pages of Escape from New York as an editing tool, it became terribly pregnant over time. There is a point where the bad guy is unconscious and your hero is there. Why not try to print a bad person's thumb at this point (since the heart device was active with the thumb)? However, some interesting gadgets and Khyber things, if they can be used better. Now who would dare to compare this movie with Blade Runner? Both films are being made in the future and there is a kind of love between these two films. Murder is under investigation, but I've seen a lot of murderous films at the center of it that are very different from Webmaster's Blade Runner. For example, an identity document. This is where the parallel sends. Time is of the essence, as there will be no blade runners and no hackers. Ridley Scott is a smart director with a good sense of direction and knows the basics of filmmaking, like where the camera is. Website hosting is affordable, not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it often takes the easy way out (like writing about a character who looks at the first place to prevent a girl from posting to point B alone without a hero.) Didn't come. She can do it. It's so easy. But the same series of chases, bad writing, editing, bad shooting, rudeness, etc. They don't make an entertaining movie.

He hooks up in Seattle with this partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) that the has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip, north. But first, the has to put up with insubordinate trail hands, cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy, manipulative Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) who believes Jeff could be a valuable rally in the future. That's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier (and justifiable) killing of a trail hand. Jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy Judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the town of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon blocks Jeff up for disrupting this public changing by running this cattle through town. He fines Jeff the ownership of this cattle and Jeff just has to heat crow for the time being. In the meantime, Jeff agrees to ride point for Ronda up to Dawson in order to deliver supplies. But this is just a ruse so Jeff, Ben and Rube can slip back into Skagway and steal this cattle back. Of course Judge Gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by Jeff with a rifle while Ben races the cattle over the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach. After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other Skagway men, they finally reach Dawson where Jeff sells this cattle to the highest bidder, which just happens to be Ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff then takes this money and buys himself a claim and starts spanning for gold. But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get in on the gold action up there, and tells Jeff that the was getting a little bored with Skagway and wants to try this luck up in the Klondike, himself. That involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims. Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good, leaving Rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and this gang. They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening this big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is severely wounded but that does't save Judge Gannon from this just due. The ending shootout at night on the muddy Dawson street pretty much takes care of that. First Jeff skills two of Gannon's best gunman (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then as Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip around behind him, Gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in Jeff's arms.

I have considered burning my copy but I have every intentions on writing the producers and sending them the scripture references that they SHOULD HAVE read before making this movie!!!,negative

49000,"I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. I got to go to an advance screening, and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie. The audience all shared my laughter, and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie. Kudos to Steve Carrell(who I had already been a fan of). He proves in this movie this tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there was't a cameo from Will Ferrell(love him, but saw him too much this summer). There were parts of comedic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing(also Carrell). The waxing scene and the speed dater with the ""obvious problem"" were absolutely hysterical. I will definitely go see 'forty Year Old Virgin' when it's released. My advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it.",positive

Most of this movie, I cried because of the laughter. The audience laughed just as much as I did, clapping and shouting loudly for the whole movie. Thanks to Steve Karel (I am already a fan of him). He has shown this great talent in the comedy show in this movie. You have a style I have never seen. Catherine Keener is as good as never. Thankfully, Will Ferrell did’t have a cameo (he loves her, but the saw her a lot this summer). There is a section on humour in this movie. Partly thank you to Carrell and partly thank you for writing (and Carrell). Shocking scenes and fast-paced “obviously troubled” comrades are noisy. I will definitely be watching “The Forty Virgin” after the show. My advice: Go watch it and have a great laugh with an incredibly entertaining film.",positive

49460,"I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It's one of my all time favourites because my father, Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer. I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we were living at the time to make April Love. My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man. I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered, and flo and behold the came home of/the script. How exciting is that! Also, a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the jones shown at the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again, and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today of/all the sex, foul language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus.",positive

I vividly remember when Hollywood came to Lexington, Kentucky, where we lived and made the film ""Love in April."" Dad has played many games and is a very talented person. I begged him to try the given section, and then I saw the return of the script. How exciting that is! In addition, many of my classmates were visible to the public — especially Jones in the clubroom. Every April, when I see this movie again, it’s nothing, and Pat Boone’s song “April’s Love” is still playing on the radio.
