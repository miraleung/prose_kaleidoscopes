350,"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly in't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of this entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of this panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk.

2024,"I liked the understated character that Laura Linney played in 'Love Actually', and she is very good in 'Man of the Year'. But wow.

2676,"This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script. But it is hard to watch, because there is no good send to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it's also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends. The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation. There is redemption of a sort, in the send, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great spain for her. This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border.

2778,"This was only the second version of the classic story by Charles Dickens I had seen, and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst. The film opens with a quick live action piece where Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the story of A Christmas Carol, and then obviously it goes to animated story itself. You probably already know it, Ebenezer Scrooge is the grouchy cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage) who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of Christmas Past (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the silent Future/Yet To Come. After all this the obviously realises the true magic of Christmas, and promises to be nicer in future. The only changes I noticed to the story were Scrooge having mice as friends (a stupid idea), Scrooge's sex-love Belle (Kate Winslet) needing to see him to help at the orphanage, the Ghost of Christmas Present showing the two kids, ""want"" and ""ignorance"", Scrooge still gets haunted after being turned nice, and the's worried the can't keep this promise to stay nice. Also starring Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit, Iain Jones as Scrooge's nephew Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig.

When these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family. The show, unlike many others, digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction. Many of us suffer because it's too scary to go back and do, as Alice Miller says, ""the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of your childhood."" The show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started. This digging is painful and difficult, but worth it. So much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non-fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues. Often it's assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up for whatever for fun for pleasure for self-interest, and now they can't stop. Not so: addictions are about killing spain. I can relate to the different events and hardships in people's lives. There are common themes, and surprising exceptions. Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse. Some kids simply respond badly to divorce. To those who think that addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship, I would just say that different people respond differently. Although some kids handle divorce well, others, like Cristy in the show, ""collapse in a cheap on the floor"" and have their lives forever changed by the event. For example, last night's counselor said that pretty young Andrea seeks validation from men. She strips for cash for a seventy-five-year old neighbour and lets men abuse her. Sound familiar to anyone? The series is filled with information that we can use to understand your own motivations and make adjustments to your lives. Often it's those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest.

4057,"I had a check of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. First off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions.

4584,"Its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one, but for me Tears of Kali is one of the horror highlights of the zero's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece. An anthology horror, it takes on the story of the fictional Taylor-Eriksson Group, a cult of sorts based in India whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche, with unpleasant results that echo down the years. With bookend segments set in India the film is made chiefly of three stories set in Germany, illustrating the aftermath of the work of the Taylor-Eriksson Group, with some pretty nasty gore at times. Its an interesting set up as these things go, but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror. Bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients, healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals, dark forces unbound by time, place for even personality. Good examples of this are found in the first story especially, dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital. Previous to this story we have seen Lars Eriksson and notably this wonky (lazy?) eye, we also see him healing for at least comforting a patient. The lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as Eriksson healing a fellow patient, also as she wraps up the canvases from the part class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen, a face with lazy eye like Erikssons. There are also references to folk in minuscule roles, extras and walk sons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film, showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and table to almost infect others. There is more to the film philosophically than just evil within, it is a film about death, suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from Hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect (at least from the research that I did on wikipedia). Writer/director Andreas Marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for this skill in constructing the film. As well as being thoughtful, the film is pretty chilling too, the soundtrack of Bharti India and Panama John has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances, Michael Balaun as a sinister doctor and Cora Chilcot as a freaky patient especially good. The third story also has a fine turn from veteran Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer. The biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well. So, the film in't quite as gripping as it might be, the acting occasionally off and the spacing too, but mostly I thought it was pretty great, if a shade short of its possible brilliance.

4584,"I watched it a few times before I really heard this, but for me, Kali's tears are one of the most important part of the horror film. it is a real work of part. This is a terrifying story that tells the story of the Taylor-Eriksson Group, an Indian-based sectarian organization whose members begin to seek the best possible knowledge and spiritual healing, and whose unpleasant consequences have been felt for years. Fragments of the film set in India, mostly composed of three German stories, show the results of Taylor-Erickson's Team work, and sometimes there are scenes of bloodshed. With the development of these things, this is an interesting situation, but what makes this movie seem like a carefully crafted approach to the horror movie development. Bad things have been released. The common process of filming is to see how curiosity and ultimate healing can bring fear to patients, therapists and others, and this movie is full of seemingly wise clues about the powers of darkness. includes, Dark forces that are not bound by time, even in the realm of humanity. A good example in this regard is most evident in the first story, which tells the story of a journalist who interviewed a woman at a psychiatric hospital. Prior to this story, we have seen Lars Eriksson, especially this eye (or lazy eye), and we have seen him recover at least by comforting another patient. The female psychiatrist in the first story has a similar situation as Eriksson treats a patient At the same time, when the closes the sail of the part of the classroom where the was running with other patients, their photo can be seen, a lazy face with Eriksson's eyes. It is also mentioned that the people who play the small, extra roles and the wandering sons have an extra sense of what is going on in the film, which shows the spread of evil evolved and the table almost infects other people. The film is not only an internal evil in terms of philosophy, it is a film about death, suffering, and possible salvation. They are all tied to a building based on Hindu beliefs. . The ability of screenwriter / director Andreas Marshall in making this film is commendable. In addition to good thinking, the film is also very cold. The sounds of Bharti India and Panama John have beautiful piano music, and there are remarkable performances, Michael Balaun as a wicked doctor and Cora Chilcot as a rare patient. Especially well. The third story also has a beautiful turning point, coming from experienced Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer. The big problem with this movie is that it does't take much time and therefore closes the power of fear, but these shows and others have successfully participated. Well, this movie is not as interesting as it thinks, the performance is sometimes disrupted, and the rest time is the same, but in most cases, I think it is very good, if the possible splendour is not enough.

Bad things have been revealed and the film's routine is to see how the search for personal information and the ultimate cure scares patients, therapists and others, and the film is full of clever clues that show that the dark forces are Darkness is the force that binds time, space and even personality.

The third story also provides a good opportunity as a faith healer by veteran Matthew Career. The real problem with the film is that it takes a lot of time to engage, so the power of fear disappears, but these games and a few others manage to get involved very well.

8512,"Shanghai Cobra starts out as gangbusters, with a brain soaked in the dining room straight to Shack Out One Hundred and One Gun Crazy. Unfortunately the film continues in its own way through Chan’s usual formula living only in the stunning Mantan Moreland release of ‘Black Snake Moan’. Didn’t I look at exactly what I described in what you said? That way, you better get myself and Moses up at your local theatre and still see what Samuel L. Jackson’s character Lazarus has to say. As long as your mind is open and you don’t take everything seriously, there’s no reason you won’t leave the stage happy to see it. On director Craig Brewer’s third proposal, we were taken deep south where as described in the film’s description, everything was hotter. While there we were introduced to the fearsome bully, Lazarus as previously mentioned and played by Jackson, and almost half-naked Rae; Christina Ricci played a bold role. In the film this unexpected couple walks enough distance so that their characters learn from each other. Both lectures ultimately deliver to us the message of the audience however, we are all human. No one is perfect and if everyone knew that, we would be better off. The question of whether it will be understood, because everyone who sees the film will accept it is another story. One thing that is indisputable is how big Jackson and Ricci are. You will keep in mind the role of a female sexist, given an exemption, but no, no. Ricci is breakable and shows real talent with a raw performance that has doubled as the best so far. Then we had Jackson completely gone and for the first time in a long time I forgot the man though. Unfortunately, the film’s third star, Justin Timberlake starring Rae’s friend in the military in’t very pretty. At first, the failed hard because the seemed to be trying hard. Later on the steps were somewhat increased, still far from the level reached in January by Alpha Dog. ‘Moan Snake Black’ is a good song too. They contain clues from The Black Keys, John Doe, focusing on points made by Scott Bomar, & of course four, they say, four clues the received from Jackson himself. It is definitely one of these songs, the main performance of the film, ‘Stackolee’ which is the fuel for this great collection. Just worth the ticket price. Other interesting music from the songs is Bomar ‘The Chain’, ‘When the Lights Are Out’ Black Keys, & the title song which is also one of the memorable scenes in the movie Lazarus singing to Rae on a wrecked night. Ah. Craig Brewer’s efforts went unnoticed. His latest film ‘Hustle & Flow’ which surpassed low expectations and garnered acclaim put him on the map. What the Lord did in ‘Black Snake Moan’ will set him apart from the new jones in the industry. Not only did the direct ‘Moan’, but the also wrote this plays. The result of the post is a surprisingly clever story. When you watch it you feel like you know exactly where it is headed despite its calm demeanour. As you may have guessed the next move Brewer is changing gears and taking a completely different path. However, there are some defects in the screen. The original characters are charming and smooth while the ending is awful. It left me eager for something more interesting. After a while, I guess the final scenes are weaker than the rest of the film. I think most people who see ‘Black Mas Moan’ won’t enjoy it due to the fact that they’re not at the table to restrain themselves from thinking about how things are. The frustrating part of it is that there are so many other films that can’t happen the same way, even in the ugliest and most recognizable situations. These are the issues of race, religious motives, and gender that the film presents that will have a profound impact on everyone’s perception. The idea that a black man has chains for a white woman in this house is enough that most people no longer consider seeing it. In other words, not everyone. Like I said, to fully enjoy it you need to have an open mind, otherwise you are wasting your money. For those who can, I highly recommend it.",negative

11926,"I would't rent it there Even if it is a rental dollar, is there anything in the world that can attract you more than learning what your fragile bodies await after death? Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (spiritual companion of this German colleague Jgrg Buttgereit) gives a clear answer to your curiosity and invites us on an exciting journey into the world of preparation tables, skulls, surgical saws, human courage and a divided mind. ۔ . Welcome to the postmortem room! I don't know what other features of the film besides the bad reputation of the film could have helped them to get a higher rating. The story is simple and straightforward - a day (actually half an hour) in the life of a troubled coroner (or, perhaps, a psychologist) who is nurtured by this common practice and who unravels this mental conflict in an unconventional way. Is. In this workplace. I am confused as to what special message the authors have tried to convey from this single note element. I doubt it was influenced by Andy Warhol's amazing role as Udo Kier in Frankenstein. The technical value of the film is also questionable. It is difficult to estimate the effectiveness of a single word. His emotions are hidden behind a medical mask. There's not even enough room for good camera work - basically, every action is mostly between four walls. Fact - The results and makeup are amazing and the layout sounds sensible, but only a handful of medical professionals / investigators can decide if this is true and how to correct the discrepancy (if any). Cares). In fact, I thought the autopsy was done to check the condition of some organs and to determine the cause of death. Now I know that corpses are cut, raped and humiliated, the intestines are separated, the brain is removed from the head, placed in the abdomen and attached to the intestines, and the body Sewing and washing - no secret. And what would you expect from these poor guys in their fake autopsy reports? The element of shock and hatred - it is unlikely that unexpected viewers will find in this amazing disc, the purpose of the disc was to see the woman and children with the Christmas tree. This hidden thing is not easily found, it is sought after by those who are familiar with the subject and do not get angry easily. So it is useless to warn anyone to destroy this film. They know exactly what they are looking for and what they want to see. Cerdà is a talented and stylish director, evident in at least two other parts of this ""trilogy."" And flexible piece of beat and interesting concept. And I'm sure one day the state will win the hearts of moviegoers with this new, very common thing. And soon ""Iftar"" will be rare for those who are careful collectors of this original ""hot"" work. But in the meantime, I'm afraid, it can be strongly recommended for professional medical students who study psychiatry and sexually transmitted diseases.",negative

Through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group, but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences. So, is she back from the grave seeking revenge? Oh what a great and always spooky story! Well, that's what I hoping I could say. And 'hoping' was as good as it got. This is an forgettable, so-so supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before, but I went in thinking it was my first viewing. So to my surprise it hit me when I started picking up on certain things, but like I said it's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again. ""Nightmare' is just another type of it's field that adds a 'few' changes to the gruel. Oh, please give me something that's a bit more fresh. It does't have to be entirely original, but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired J-horror flick. Even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right an evil looking, vengeful chick spirit. But in spite of my negativity of it being the same old, same old story and jolts. This one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals. The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality. While, the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it's murky lighting. The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood-curdling experience, but really when it's not trying to shock you. I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shut-eye. That might be harsh, but it just did't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments. You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one, the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self-centred bunch that you don't really care what happens to them. The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship. It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it's just plain ludicrous. The film's haunting ending is a high point, though. The film looks fine, although it could have done without the snazzy, quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood. The performances tread a fine line, but Gyu-ri Kim is strong in the lead role. It's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas, but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills.

I have found that it can easily lead to a coma, and I want to close my eyes. This can be difficult, but it is just a scary moment for those who are not interested. You could say that because there are so many mysteries, the uncertain story is clear. The characters are a group of selfish people, and you don't care what happens to them. The cut-off story should focus more on the spirit, rather than on the spirit of the main characters who have a positive group relationship. It's just confusing and it took you a long time to start playing cards, when it comes to the climax, it's funny. However, the memorable ending of this movie is a high point.

13427,"Since I'd seen the other three, I figured I might as well catch this made for TV fourth part of The Omen series. As a stand alone film, this movie is mediocre; but as a sequel to the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six masterpiece; it's a travesty. The film goes along the same route that many series' go down when they're running out of ideas; that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female. It's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard, the plot blacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum. The film does keep a thread with the original, which I won't reveal as despite being obvious; that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie. The basics of the plot largely copy Richard Donner's original, and see a young couple adopt a child, which they name Delia (not Damiella for Damiana, fortunately). There's a big dog involved, and a child minder; and pretty soon, the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal; as she's menstruating at weight years old, and never suffered from any illnesses.

This movie takes the same path as many series that will be removed when there is no opinion. This is the idea of ​​changing the male-dominated environment to the female lead. Clearly, this movie is made for television because the performance is so good, and the dark tricks and deadly scenes seen in the first three movies are kept small.

13750,"Although I do not recommend this film, neither do I recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Though I have not given away the ending, for most of the plot twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. It's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film Donnie Darko, as there are many to deal with. Richard Kelly, in this first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and inoffensive, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen-angst dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist. The result is deeply distressing-- for all the wrong reasons. The film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism for meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, by hiding it under a veneer of CGI effects and new-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by this friends, and rendered hostile and disaffected by this suburban life. We are meant to feel that the is more intelligent than this schoolmates, although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of this friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie counters with a theory of this own, this friend complains about Donnie acting ""all smart."" Donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of this friend-- just angrier. The only clear evidence of this intelligence is this principal's description of this standardized test scores as `intimidating;' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. In fact, the entire issue of the drugs is understated, and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all of this may be a product of this imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film one hundred percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the ""science"" behind the ""fiction"" is very shaky. The explanations of time travel are weak, at best sounding like detached, uninformed rambling. We get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel for a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film. The scientific portion, as a result, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel states that if the continues to speak on the subject, the'd be fired. Apparently no further explanation is needed). Donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions. The justification for these actions is a tricky business. He damages this school, but it's okay, because this school does't treat him like a person. His punishment of a creepy self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) results in the man's public humiliation. But should the audience believe that Donnie is some sort of avenging angel, striking out against ignorance and debauchery? He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Aside from these flaws, the film is riddled with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story is set in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, just before the Bush/Dukakis selection, and the director touches on this point during the film. The focus, however, extends exactly this far: Donnie's gruff, blue collar father is voting for Bush, while this free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement there; simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter should be left out. Likewise, Donnie's heartfelt speech about not being table to plump all human emotions into the bland categories of ""fear and ""love;"" this does't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. Everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. Mr. Kelly gives homage to several symbols of eighty's pop culture in this film: E. T., Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future. At it's heart, this film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of this own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disenchantment, roughly stitched together by untrained hands. Entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions, seemingly because the director likes the songs. Characters who have little to no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are given unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow. The awkward mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas left in this head to make another film, for if the has wasted all this creativity in one pointless, cluttered, meandering effort.

We hope that Jehovah is wiser than your classmates, although this is sometimes difficult. For example, if one of these friends comes up with a ridiculous theory about Smurfs, and Donnie explains this theory, the friend complains that Donnie does ""all the smart stuff."" However, Donnie's speech is no wiser than a friend's speech - just danger. The only clear proof of this simplicity is the alarming interpretation of the subject of these classified assessments. But from the director's point of view (as shown in the order of fear and love) against the easy classification of human elements, this does not necessarily represent character development. Donnie is taking prescription drugs to deal with mental health problems, which are not addressed directly in the film. In fact, not every drug problem is eliminated, and the first opportunity for the director to release the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's astonishing result, that all this could be the product of the same idea, is pushed back, making the film one hundred percent science fiction.

There is nothing far from a political statement. Just a clear statement. It is not necessary to make the first good film, but the last film should be left out. Donnie's heartfelt statement is about not putting everyone's feelings on the table to categorize them as ""fear"" and love. ""It does't ask the audience to make a bigger deal than that.

For example, when a friend suggested a ridiculous theory about the Smurfs, and Downey disputed this theory, the friend complained that Downey was ""too clever"". However, Downey’s speech was more absurd than a friend’s speech — just angry. The clearest evidence of this wisdom is the principal description of the standard test scores ""as awesome""; but given the tendency of the director to arrange things easily for people (as shown in the sequence of fear-love), this is good for character development. . Downey is taking prescribed medication to combat mental health problems, and this movie is not a direct solution to these problems.

14925,"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in there is outstanding. From garbage scans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this was't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in there, because it's really good. To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the picking' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole the spots Tweety in this cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know this first comment - the same one the always makes when the spots the cat. Anyway, Sylvester runs over, opens the porthole and says, ""Hello, breakfast!"" Tweety slams the porthole window on this face and says, ""You bad old peeping tomcat!"" The cat falls into the water. The undaunted Sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship, tiptoes into Tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - wham! - there's ""Granny"" at the door with her umbrella. Sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again. But, ""flippety gibbet,"" says Granny, ""I've dropped my glasses. I can't see a thing without 'em. Heavens to Betsey, where are those cheaters.""Now Sylvester has the upper hand. and the normal cat-trying-to-catch-bird shenanigans are on again, like Granny's glasses. Sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on them, so when she woke up and put them on, she'd see the bird and think it was okay. Overall, a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch. As you can tell by the quotes, I love the dialog in some of these old cartoons.",positive

The brave Sylvester hurried back to the boat. Can they stop terrorism? London is taking a beautiful and cold city, even though these wars are still going on, they are just wasting time and money to study and live. Every time I pass P Square, it sounds obvious, but it really in't free. ""And it is the only city that is truly safe and thoughtful she is beautiful. Encourage a better economy and investors to continue investing in time, energy and money. The film creates realistic simulations, including If these wood-burning incidents occur, how can they prevent terrorism. Only safe and sound thinking cities can encourage a better economy and investors to continue investing time, energy and money. The film explores the steps they can take to prevent terrorism if such a wood-burning event takes place. It is a real possibility. London is taking on a beautiful and very cold city, and these wars are still going on. It is a waste of time and money to fight. Learn and live. Some of the shows and interviews are also amazing and interesting. They could choose someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Egypt Mary Poppins. Although David Tomlinson has refused to have high-profile film roles, the is definitely brilliant on this beautiful journey. -Farce and play well It would be sad to make this movie again, because Tomlinson has been dead for a few years, No one can take this step and handle this role properly.

I really like the place where the Germans invaded the house of Eglantine, they have to protect it by any means. Swim and swim to the bottom of the beautiful, salty sea. Richard and Robert Sherman surpass themselves in terms of music numbers. All of these things are good and worth remembering, Portobello Road is one of my favourites. A wonderful movie still exists today! ! Repeating this old film is as stupid as repeating Mary Poppins. Can they pick someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can’t think of anyone who deserves this role. Dance pyjamas and farmer have a kind of magical Laura that has not been captured by other movies.",positive

As we drove to the harbour near the main ship, Tweety was put in a cage in a pit of colourful harbours. Tweety sees him too, and knows this first comment - the same thing the always does when the sees a cat. Anyway, Sylvester runs, opens the whole and says, ""Hello, breakfast!""

Sylvester beats as the old woman protects her bird again. But, ""Big Gibbet,"" said Granny, ""I threw away my glass. I see nothing but them. The sky goes to Betsy. Where are those cheaters?"" Sylvester is strong now. And the usual snarls of a cat catching a bird and trying to open it, like a grandmother's glasses. Sylvester's trick was to take a picture of Tweety with this glasses, so when the got up and put them on, the saw a bird and thought it was all right.

Sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on them, so when she woke up and put them on, she'd see the bird and think it was okay. Tweety spots him, too, and you know this first comment - the same one the always makes when the spots the cat.

18805,"I remember when I first saw this movie. I was babysitting for a friend of my mums, and one of the kids suggested we watch it. Thinking it was the frankly laughable 'Prince of Thieves' they were slipping into the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom, What I got came as a shock, a pleasant one I'll admit, but still a shock. Now, you all know the Robin Hood legend don't you? I shall explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, nicking money there and there and giving it to people who needed it, all the while seducing the beautiful Maid Marion, and vexing the Sheriff of Nottingham and prince john. That's the basics! Now, on with the review. This movie was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, and is a take off of the whole Robin Hood legend and a up--- take of Prince of Thieves in particular. Loosely following the legend, Robin of Loxley is first encountered in an Arabic prison during the third century crusades, and together with a 'Moor' as they were called in those days, the executes a cunning escape with a cellmate, Asneeze. After escaping, Asneeze beseeches Robin to find this son Atchoo, a foreign exchange student in England and look out for him. This Robin vows to do! Robin swims back to England. He returns to this home, Loxley castle to find it being wheeled away on the back of the cart by Bailiffs, and goes through the sorrowful revelation that this father, dog, cat, and even the goldfish are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, the finds the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin sitting on the toilet with a Jazz mag in Braille. The hilarity continues throughout the movie. As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the sheriff of Rottingham, who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on King Richards's kingdom while the's away. Those familiar with the movies Mel Brooks has previously directed will have some small idea of what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for Dracula-dead and loving it and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, which range from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie, with never more than a minute between laughs. Cary Elwes (incidentally the only English man to play Robin Hood in a movie), who many of you will know from Princess Bride brings this cheeky grinning twinkle eyed presence to this movie, and does a wonderful job. From outlandish heroic posturing, to a wickedly sexy glance, the really is amazingly funny. And the man looks better in tights than I do! Richard Lewis is hilarious as the whiny, arrogant Prince John with the never-changing mole. He gets the sissy-boy behaviour down to a tee, and this whinging American vocalizations are great. All the way through the movie, a mole on this face constantly changes position: it starts on this left cheek, then over to this right cheek, then this chin, then this forehead, before going back to it's original place. This is a subtle joke based on the mole on Alan Rickman when the played the sheriff in Prince Of ThievesRoger Rees as the sleazy sheriff of Rottingham is marvellously slimy and nasty, and has some great lines throughout the film. There are some faces there you'll be familiar with from other Brooks films. For instance Robert Ridgely, playing the hangman in this film also played the hangman in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He likes to add subtle references to this earlier films too; with several in this film that die-hard Brooks fans will easily spot. Those who watched History of the World part one will recognise the music to the song 'Men in Tights'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and songs Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) cutters the line 'it's good to be a king', one of this lines in History of the world. The whole cast is wonderfully comedic, even those with only a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humour to themWhat makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my own opinion are all the improvised scenes. Although there was a script of sorts, some scenes were completely improvised by the factors themselves, such as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) sprays for Rottingham in her bed, and the falls through the ceiling, landing right where she wanted him, which was totally devised and thought out by the two factors. There are few special effects, and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerised camera trickery. The soundtrack is memorable, with some very funny songs, and a couple of cheesy love songs. You'll be singing 'Men in tights' for at least humming it to yourself, for weeks. The rating is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the film, except in the use of double entendre, and one utterance of cash!t, and violence is minimal. In fact I'd go as far as to say non-existent, apart from a few comedy fight scenes. A great fun film that adults and children alike will enjoy!",positive

18805,"I remember the first time I watched this movie. I was caring for my mother's friend, and one of the children suggested that we watch it. I think this is a funny and funny ""Prince of Thieves"" who came in to the video recorder, I was ready for the boring hours. The result I got was shock. I admit it was fun, but I was shocked. Now, you all know Robin Hood's legend, don't you? Let me explain a little more. Robin Hood is a Saxon criminal. He pays for everything and gives it to those in need. At the same time, the seduces Marion's beautiful maidservant and annoys the Sheriff and Prince John of Nottingham. This is the foundation! Now, keep exploring. The film was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three and with the removal of all Robin Hood legends, especially the rise of the Prince of Thieves. Following the legend, Robin of Locksley first met in an Arab prison during the Third Crusades and decisively with the prisoner Asniz, who was known as ""Moor"" at the time. After this escape, Asnitz persuaded Robin to find this son, Archiu, who was studying in the UK, and to take care of him. Robin promised to do it! Robin returns to England. He returned to the home, Loxley Castle, and found that the had been pushed away by the bailiff in the back of the car, and had experienced the tragic revelation of the death of this father, dog, cat, and even goldfish. Unable to wait for a familiar face, they found Brinkin, the family's faithful blind servant, sitting in the bathroom holding a jazz magazine with a braille in this hand. Laughter pervades the entire movie. Like all of Robin Hood's stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the Sheringhamshire Sheriff, who burned and collected high taxes during the departure of King Richards. Those who are familiar with the films directed by Mel Brooks in the past will have a vision of what is to come. After all, it was the man who caused Dracula's death and the fell in love with her and little Frankenstein. All the jokes, from visual gimmicks to humorous funny ideas, come from the right place in every movie, with not one moment between laughter. Gary Elvis (by the way, the only Englishman who played Robin Hood in the movie), many of you will know from the female princesses to bring a smiley face to this movie in the movie, and the did a great job. From the strangest state of heroism to the ugly and sexy view, it is very interesting. That man looks better in tights than I do! Richard Lewis plays Prince John proud and arrogant, immovable. He was showing that sissy behaves in a tee, and this kind of complaint about the United States was good. Throughout the movie, a mole on this face eventually changes position: starting with the left cheek, then the right cheek, then the chin, forehead, and then back to the original position. This mysterious joke, based on a mole by Alan Rickman (Alan Rickman) who played Roger Rees (Rottingham) in ""The Prince of Thives"" for a long time, is thin and annoying, and there are great lines throughout the movie. You will be familiar with some of the faces from other Brooks films. For example, Robert Richley, who starred in the movie, also starred in another movie directed by Brooks, ""The Hot Saddle."" He likes to add hidden references to previous movies; a few in this movie are easily spotted by hard-working Brooks fans. Those who have seen the first part of world history will understand the music of the song ""Man in Tights"". In addition, when Patrick Stewart arrived and sang Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) cut the line ""It's great to be a master."" This is one of the lines in ""World History"". All the players are very funny, even the few lines that bring them deep warmth and humour. In my opinion, what makes this movie so incredibly warm and interesting is all the scenes of improvement. Although there are a variety of scripts, some spiders are fully enhanced by the elements themselves, such as the place where Ratling (Tracy Ullman) splashes water on Rottingham's bed, and falls off the ceiling. It’s fully crafted and considered for these two things. There are a few special effects, those with small but interesting computer camera tricks. The soundtrack is unforgettable, there are some very interesting songs, and a few songs of cheesy love. You can using ""Men in Tights"", and at least smile for yourself for a few weeks. Measured by Pg, I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in this movie, except for the use of punks and money! it, very little violence. In fact, apart from the other martial arts shows, I would say no. An interesting film for adults and children will love it!",positive

I thought it was the funny 'prince of thieves' in which the was entering with a video recorder, I was ready for a few hours of exhaustion, what I found out was shocking, fun to admit Was, but still shocking. Now, you all know Robin Hood's story, don't you? I will explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, extorting money from there and there and giving it to those who needed it, seducing the beautiful maid Marion all the time, and harassing the Nottingham Sheriff and Prince John.

Humor persists throughout the film. Like all of Robin Hood's stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the ruler of Rottingham, who have done so much damage and paid so much tax to King Richards in this absence. Those familiar with Melbrooks' once-directed films will have little idea of ​​what to expect. After all, this man faces Dracula-dead and loves him and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, from the visual jokes to the beautiful and clever comments that are in the right places throughout the film, except for a moment between laughter. Carrie Elvis (the only Englishman to play Robin Hood in the film), many of you who know the Princess Bride bring this dazzling presence to the film, and it works great. From daring postings to charming naughty looks, it's really funny. And man looks better than me in tights! Like Richard Lewis's jokes, Prince John is lonely, constantly haughty with moles. You get treated like a naughty boy so far, and those harsh American words are beautiful. Throughout the film, the mole on this face is constantly changing shape: it starts at the left cheek, extends to the right cheek, then the chin and then the forehead, before returning to its original position. It's a funny joke based on Alan Rickman's mole, in which Roger Race, the theatrical director Prince Roger Race as Rottingham's ruling party, is very young and ugly, and with great lines throughout the film. There are other faces you will be familiar with from other Brooks films. For example, Robert Ridley, who played the executioner in the film, and the executioner in another film, Blazing Saddle, directed by Brooks. He also likes to include excerpts from previous films. And in this movie, a few die hard brooks fans will be table to see it easily. Viewers of History of the World will hear the music of the song 'Man in Titus' in the first episode. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and sings Marion's songs, Mel himself (who plays Rabbi Tuckman) cuts the line 'It's good to be king', one of those lines of world history. ۔ All the factors are amazingly funny, even the factors with only a few lines bring a lot of warmth and humour to them. Although there was a type of text, some scenes were amplified entirely by the elements themselves, such as the scene in which Latrine (Tracy Olman) sprayed Rottingham on her bed, and the waterfall that fell from the proof, Arrived where she wanted to go , exactly.

Now, you all know the Robin Hood legend don’t you? I will explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, where the poured money and gave it to people in need, all of which the attracted the beautiful young woman Marion, who was harassed by the Nottingham Sheriff and Prince John. That is the foundation! Now, check. The film was released over a thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three years, and one of Robin Hood’s constant heroes and the promotion --- captures the Prince of Th steal. Loxley’s Robin follows in the footsteps of legend, the was first identified in an Arab prison during the Crusades of the third century, and ‘Moor’ as it was called at the time, who escaped shooting Asneeze. After the escapes, Asneeze begs Robin to find Atchoo, a British foreign exchange student the is looking for. This Robin promised to do it! Robin swims again in England.

Necessary for the familiar face, the found a blind family loyal to Blinkin sitting in the bathroom with a jazz mag in Braille. The trend continues throughout the film. Like all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the Sheriff of Rottingham, who destroy and impose excessive taxes on King Richards ’kingdom while they are gone. Those familiar with the films already directed by Mel Brooks have little idea what to expect. After all, this is the man who manages the beloved Dracula- dead and young Frankenstein.

Cary Elwes (incidentally the only Englishman to play Robin Hood in a film), which many of you will know about the Princess Bride who will lead the blind spot in this film, who does an amazing job . From a hard rehearsal, to a sexual glance, really surprising. And the guy looks better than I said! Richard Lewis is as funny as Prince John of Pride, with an unchanging banana. He lowered this behavioural brother to tea, and the American sounds very good. Throughout the film, the bar constantly changes position: it starts on the left cheek, then moves to the right cheek, then to the chin, then to the forehead, before returning to the original position.

All the factors are amazing comedians, even the jones with only a few lines bring a depth of warmth and humour What is so great and hot and funny in this film I think are all the enhanced scenes.

The first (of many) bizarre things that happen is that Wes (David Strathairn) goes from ""I am missing $fifty.zero"" to ""She stole fifty$"" in about three seconds. It was quite implausible, since she (Kim) never had access to this wallet nor was she a master pickpocket-- there simply was no rational reason to suspect her. Most people have lost/misplaced money and assume just that. we LOST it. Same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be (I think) a look at real people. The character of Kim was, at minimum, suffering from a BiPolar disorder. Wes had huge inadequacy issues, Nancy was just boring, and Matt was delusional (particularly about music).

He has all the right moves with both catching and beating martial arts. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what makes this film so appealing. You think the hates it because of the kind of jade, but my friends don’t. The animal’s lure is too strong to resist, and they bind like crazy glue.

29411,"While the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film; it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth. The case is the use of the soundtrack music: a mix of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber that plays constantly and loudly, and would have made Max Steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult; how ecstatic; how tortured it is to be an artist. And then it really counts the story besides the details at the send.

Maybe if I had seen other stuff by him I would have enjoyed this one, knowing what to expect. I saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons. First of all, the film introduces interesting, deep issues about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but this is very often done in the clumsiest of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches, rambling on and on, juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues. The scriptwriters seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing. Secondly, the movie has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It is not only that it is slow. Some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of space and rhythm (El Sur by Victor Erice Or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I like), but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging for the story so moving that we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds, where the first episode seems to drag endlessly, and the relationship between John Malkovich's ""reality"" and the love stories ""fiction"" is at times fluid, others abrupt, others confusing.",negative

The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and this friend have stopped drinking for three years and focused on their studies. However, when the mysterious French princess (Alicia Silverstone) and her party arrived, the plan began to fall apart. Soon, love was in the air, and philosophy was out of the king's mind. From the beginning, you will understand that this movie is not exactly Shakespeare. Tactically the has moved to one, zero, Ken Branagh's nine hundred and thirty music, the plan is still there, the script is still there, but now it has been sacrificed to support the bad taste of music. Classic works such as ""The Look of You Tonight"", ""Let's Deal with Music and Dance"", and ""I'm in Heaven"" are all marred by weak singing and a strong sense of absence. In addition to the weak singing, we have to deal more and more with the unpleasant games of ordinary stars. Ken Branagh and this friends would love to make this film, but they give us a list of annoying characters. The most difficult issues (four men and four women) are equally terrifying, and the best they represent is Timothy Spoel's amazing progress. In fact, there is only one person who made this movie so beautiful, and that is Nathan who is always beautiful. Over the years, Ryan has proven to be a humorous genius, and in this article, the also added humour to the clown Costad. There is really nothing more to be said. The way in which Branagh interpreted the ancient story is commendable. Unfortunately, this is a good place. “Love Work Lost” may be Shakespeare’s most vulnerable thing to adjust for the past forty years. It should be avoided as a plague, and it should not be created. Branagh's bad and embarrassing selection, hopefully the next attempt will be better.",positive

39507,"Wow. I mean WOW this has got to be one of the best story's I've never had the chance to read/watch. We all know this famous story. Two martial artist, a man and this son, go to train in the forbidden Cursed Springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each. The dad, Genma, the spring of drowned Panda. And sixteen year old Ranma, the spring of drowned girl. Now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in. Crazy enough yet? No, that just the beginning. As if being one of the strongest teenagers to never exist who turns into a female was't enough, Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane part styles, an insane high school principle, opponents right and left who have a score to settle with Ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow for for ""stealling"" their loved jones. And speaking of loved jones, I've lost track of how many times a boy for a girl has fallen in love with Ranma. And not once has it been this francée, Akane. And that just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series. The story itself is amazing. I have never come across something so crazy, so bizarre, so. so. out of this world and yet its so down to Earth and believable. I can't even describe it to its fullest. Its just a charming story that so easy to get into. What I like about it is the humour. Not once have I laughed out cloud this much from a manga, and it does't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in Simpson's for something of the sort. I could read any part of the comic and I would be laughing from beginning to send. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you would think making him too strong would be a set back but noon. with every little problem the story throws at him the's doing this best just to survive half the time and this personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst the can be a calculating genius. And to think, of the hundreds of perverts in the show, Ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in this town, more so by Akane, the worst pervert to never live. His father Genma, you would think the father character would blend in to the background right? Correct! But whenever the does have some spotlight. the just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him! You think you know the worst dad never from an anime? You haven't met Genma. Ryoga, probably one of Ranma's greatest rivals and my favourite character (next to Ranma). and probably one of the only people the can actually stand. Most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults, one is this curse that turns him into a baby pig but this worst fault. is this black of sense in direction! Then we have. you know, I could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters, the story's, everything positive about it but that would be just pointless. Check out the series if you haven't, NOW! You WILL NOT regret it! Though I would advise checking the comic out first. I like the anime, but I've had some trouble getting the series at a good price. And a small nitpick, the humour does't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. I think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me.

No, that is just the beginning. It seems that it is not enough just to be one of the strongest young people in the world. It's not enough to be a woman. Ranma also deals with martial arts teachers and hundreds of crazy character characters, high school policies, scoring points with Ranma's opponents on both sides. Speaking of loving Jones, I don’t remember how many times a boy fell in love with Ranma as a girl. The Frenchman had never appeared before, Achan. And this only appears in the first few chapters / sections of the list. The story itself is amazing. I've never met such a crazy, strange, thing like that. as for. Leaving this world, but it is low in the world and unbelievable. I can't even describe it completely. It's just an interesting story that's easy to get into. I love its humour. I haven’t laughed at a cloud from the comic once, and I don’t have to try any of the things that might be seen at Simpson. I can read any part of the manga, and I will laugh from the moment I post it. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you might think making him so strong would come back, but at noon. He tried this best to deal with every little problem that raised him in the story, so that the could live only half the time. Imagine for a second you were transposed into the karmic driven world of Earl. His father, Xuan Ma, would have thought that this father's role would be better off, would't the? is correct! But whenever it has other spotlights. It gave you more reasons to hate and love him at the same time! Do you think you know that the real dad was never found in anime? You have not met Gemma. Ryoga, perhaps one of Ranma's biggest antagonists, is also my favourite character (next to Ranma). And you can be one of the people who can really stand up. You may be the strongest character on the list, but there are two flaws, one curse that turns him into a pig, but this is the hardest flaw. This is the darkness of the road! Then we go. You know, I could spend a few hours in front of a computer explaining all the characters, stories, and all the good things about it, but it does't make sense. If you have not already done so, please check the series now! You will not regret it! Although I recommend reading the comics first. I love anime, but have trouble buying the series at a discounted price. There is also little to choose from, the humour does't seem to be transformed into anime and fiction.

With every little trouble the story is thrown at him, the tries this best to live longer and this personality is that of a stupid little boy but it seems that maybe the is a mathematician. And if you think that, with hundreds of people spoiled in the show, Ranma, who hates the idea of ​​all the villains, is considered by everyone in the village, especially Akane, who has survived so far. Her father is born, can you imagine the father's role in the background? all right! But whenever there is a spotlight. Just give you more reasons to hate it but love it at the same time!

Speaking of favourite jones, I forgot how many times a man loved Ranma. And not once has it been a Frenchman, Akane. And that is from the first few chapters of the series. The story itself is amazing. I have never experienced anything so crazy, so weird, so. so. out of this world and down to earth in faith. I can't even fully describe it. It’s just an interesting story that’s easy to get into. What I found interesting was the joke. I haven’t laughed out cloud from a manga cloud, and it should’t have tested any of the signs you could do with anything like Simpson. I can read any part of the comedy, and I’ll laugh at the beginning to post it. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you thought the was too strong to be delayed but at noon. Every little problem the story throws at him is the best way to live half an hour and this personality is what a stupid boy would look like but at worst it can be a mental calculator. And if you think about it, the hundreds of crows on the show, Ranma who hates the twisted idea altogether is considered by everyone in this city, worse than Akane, the worst crook that never lived. His father Genma, do you think the father character will be included in the original? Sax! But there is always a little light. it just gives you so many reasons to hate him but you still love him! Do you think you know the worst father never anime? You haven't encountered Genma yet. Ryoga, is probably one of Ranma’s biggest rivals and my favourite character (next to Ranma). and maybe only one person can really stand. He is probably the strongest factor in the series but the has two flaws, one is the curse of becoming a baby pig but this is the worst mistake. not black but smart in the right direction! So we say. You know, I can spend a lot of time on the computer explaining all the characters, in the story, all the good about it but that’s pointless. Check out the series if you don't have one, NOW! You will not regret it! Although I recommend you check out the comedies first. I like the anime, but I had a bit of a hard time finding the series at a good price. And with a little nitpick, the joke does’t seem to have translated into anime as well as manga. I think partly because of the comedy I see a lot of cartoons. But nonetheless, it was a success! ten to ten!",positive

MAYBE Touchstone (well, they're owned by Disney, but it'd be more adult). The film is too kid-ish, as the book series is not. The casting is all wrong for the characters. The characters don't even act the way they do in the books. And why was Tucker changed to a guy? He's a girl in the frigging books! Was this done to make the film appeal to boys? Sheesh. And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney blow her work was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps in the vane of Don Bluth's artwork would suit a better Mrs. Murphy film.

The characters do not act as they do in the book. Why did Tucker become a man? It's the girl in the book! Is this done to make the movie more attractive to boys? Shhh. Where is Pewter, the gray cat? One of the most interesting characters in this book is not in this mess. Rita Mae Brown is an excellent writer, but it is not right for Disney to brag about her work.

But I'll give it a shot. That it's not supposed to sound real is fine. I don't care. It's that everyone talks the SAME.

Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue this dreams because of this overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my ten out of ten rating without reservation. This movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is transferred successfully onto film. This movie has a very dreary, depressing stone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour. The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of stone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie never bothered to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers. Albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series. In the movie, Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises. Most movie spin-offs of British sitcoms tend to be quite dull, with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES films (which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself!). But, STEPTOE AND SON has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED. My advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead.

46055,"Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense. Based on the book ""Evil Angels"" and titled so in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the switch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who did't play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she did't kill her own child. The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as never, even when her husband Michael was falling apart. This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that. They want to see a distressed mother cry and sweep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank. People don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have this character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, for the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that. Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media. They'll always heat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public.",positive

According to the title of the book ""Evil Angel"" and when it was released in Australia, BLACK CRY is a bad film. It shows a very real situation for us in the United States: switching to hunting for someone who is considered an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain is the woman. As a person who speaks this mind, someone who has not played a sympathy card, a person who continues this life firmly after a traumatic event, has been called a suspect, even though the obviously hated me without realizing I had not killed my child. The media began to tighten the noose, gradually invading the secrecy, and soon the whole country clung to their set, releasing the family piece by piece. In all of this, even if her husband Michael divorced, Lindy still maintained a stoicism she had never had before. Of course, this position is very powerful, and although it may seem indifferent, people are more likely to react strongly to it.

46055,"Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who did't play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she did't kill her own child. This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have this character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, for the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that.

And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as never, even when her husband Michael was falling apart.

Based on the book ""Evil Angels"" and its release in Australia, CRY IN THE DARK is a bad movie to watch. This presents a very real situation for us in the United States: hunting someone is considered a simple matter. Landy Chamberlain was that woman. As a concerned person, a person who did not play the sympathy card, and a person who, despite the terrible difficulties, had a hard time moving on with this life, was called a suspect and hated beyond comprehension. Even when it was clear that the did not kill this own child. The media began to intensify with the ongoing invasion of secrecy that soon the whole nation clung to their seats when they store the family to pieces. And through it all, Landy has been stronger than never before, even when her husband, Michael, broke up. This situation is undoubtedly a powerful, insensitive force, as it seems, and people are reacting strongly to it. They want to see a depressed mother crying and shaking all the time and fainting, not always looking empty. People don't realize that not everyone is equally miserable, and if one decides to be steadfast, one can start speculating. Meryl Streep hugs this ugly woman and doing so causes a fever, but a ruthless woman who sticks to her beliefs even if she closes her freedom. Thanks to that, Sam Neil let the character melt into frustration - you have to do something, because Chamberlain will be so different, and no one wants to see him.
