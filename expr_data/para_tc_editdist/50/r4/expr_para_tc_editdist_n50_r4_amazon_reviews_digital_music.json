Let's face it, there is more to good songs and music than youth-oriented rock. I was in eighth grade when this album came out, and always liked it lot, and the funny thing is not until maybe thirty years later, cd I never meet anyone who liked it much . But I've always been a big BBoys fan. \"God Only Knows\" is among the finest compositions never, and, along with a handful of Brian's songs, deserves inclusion in the twentyth Century canon, along with Gershwin's and Kern's best, etc. I heard a beautiful recording of this by a Canadian children's choir, which sounds better than the BBoys. Beyond this, most the itunes seem to be about late adolescent angst, high production value for not. As one gets into the Middle Years of life, can anyone really praise \"Wouldn't it be Nice\", for \"Caroline No\" to the Sky? They remind me of whining choir boys, stretching to hit a note. Yes, Brian was looking for a new sound at the time, but on this record there is almost none of the fun and whimsy so obvious in their earlier work. It's true they were still very young (mid- twenty's probably) when they did PET SOUNDS. The songs with Mike singing the lead come off better, like \"I Know there's an Answer\", \"Here Today\", and \"I'm Waiting for the Day\", with the high pitched Wilson brothers doing the backgrounds. Along with their own SURFS UP, this is among the great late sixty's, early seventy's pop\/rock albums. Yes, it's up there with the best of the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, and the Byrds. But's let's not go overly gaga on it! Brian another Mozart for Handel??

Songs with lead singer Mike are better than lead singer. one hundred and ninety-eight list. One thousand nine hundred and sixty was declared the most popular party. Beautiful voices and voices, good song writing for most people, U. S. S. in particular, who can understand and comprehend being on the beach, cars and girls. However, Brian began to explore further in music and used the full and wonderful source of this musical talent. It began to heat up rinse as a recording label, and the band members, especially Mike Lowe, could't and would't understand themselves. I have heard many reasons for this emotional disorder but I am sure it is the reason. He was the one who heard the beautiful musical themes in this head and was not allowed to find the time, space and creative freedom to bring these successful titles. In addition, \"British Innovation\" was popular and brought a new perspective on artist and band music, both recording and production worldwide, and \"Motown Sound\" charted with great music. One artist after another, destiny is unpredictable and destiny tends to work when Wilson recovered from the breakup and was exhausted at home when the Beatles released the album \"Rubber Civil\". It could be an album that helps determine how Wilson feels about music and how the Beach Boys should go. He found this \"second spirit\" to recreate with the help of friend and singer Tony Asher, who began writing, composing, producing and recording songs that would be \"Pet Sounds\". It was a great project and one that would not only change the face of rock music but also change music forever. By the time teammates returned from Brian's trip, all the work was done without words. When other members, including Brian, put down their sweet words, they were one of the strengths of the album as always, they stopped changing the real game and the and the world of music will never be the same. This album will inspire many artists to change their mindset on how to write and record songs. Paul McCartney took a copy to John Lennon and listened to it over and over again until the focused on this thinking process. His brilliant producer George Martin was also listening to the album and now it was the result of what would have been the Sergeant Papers Lonely Hearts Club. \"It's ridiculous how destiny and destiny work, in't it? Brian Wilson, I heard from the beginning to post this album and I was amazed at what was done. You and Mr. Usher created an part that changed the world music a lot and The important thing is that it confirms your true wisdom. PS What some of them said about the album with Brian Wilson: Eric Clipton said \"We all, Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce and I consider Pete Sound to be one of those pop-pop songs that has never been released. The album, \"If I said I noticed it would be a trivial matter. I've never heard such magical voices, so amazingly recorded. There's no doubt that it made me and many others Changed the way people recorded. The wind, the pepper was an attempt to balance the pet's voice. \" Paul McCartney said: \"It was the sound of a pet that pulled me out of the water. I really like the album. I bought a copy of it for my kids so they can get an education in life. I think I did't teach music to anyone until they heard that album, preparations in the orchestra. Years, but for me, a complete, old record that can be beaten in many ways. I often play belly sounds and I cried. Singing on the bassline, which I think was probably the biggest effect that made me think while recording Pepper, took me away from the time when I was almost always there for a few years. Always wrote the best bass lines. \"Only God knows\" My favourite, very sensitive, it always puts pressure on me. \"You still believe me\" I, I like that music - I have it It's a skill. It's my favourite, I think. It's great when the post comes back in that kind of color, it makes me shake my back. \" Bob Dylan said of Brian Wilson's skill, \"This year - I mean, Jesus,\" Roger Waters. \"Pet voices changed everything on my record. \"Last summer, I heard 'Don't speak (put your head on your shoulders)',\" said Elvis Costello. It sounded good and sad, as it did in the sound of the pet. \"Only God knows\" is simple and beautiful and amazing when it first appeared; It still sounds perfect, \"said Tom Petty.\" I think I'd put it on with any composer out there - especially Pete Sounds. I don't think there's anything better than that, really. I don't think you'll be out of line with Beethoven - any musician. \"\" The Boys of the Beach \"Pet Sounds\" was a great project that will change the face of rock music.","overall":5,"summary":"Five Stars for the Rock era- Only four if you include other.","unixReviewTime":1007856000,"reviewTime":"12 9, 2001"}

(The horns are crucial; they help make \"Bryter Later\" that rarest of things--an excellent album that does't quite sound like anything that came before.)

There's still plenty of melancholy there; on Hazey Jane I, for instance, Drake tasks: \"Do you like what you're doing? Would you do it some more?

That album's vibe is I-want-to-kill-myself-because-life's-pointless-and-I-won't-be-noticed-otherwise; this is more like I-don't-quite-feel-like-going-to-the-grocery-store-today. And that resignation's leavened, too, with a cautious optimism--today may be shot, but tomorrow's at least worth sticking around for. \"Please give me a second grace; please give me a second face,\" Drake sings on \"Fly.\" And then on \"Northern Sky,\" the tasks: \"Would you love me for my money? Would you love me for my mind? Would you love me through the winter? Would you love me until I die? If you would and you could, then come blow your horn for me.\" It's a lovely song, but the pronouns alone are significant; on both this and \"Five Leaves Left\" there are times when the \"you\" refers to Drake himself, and the songs become mere mirrors, places for tortured artistic sensitivity and introspection, but on this, there are far more moments where the \"you\" is someone else.

One thing is for sure, only one of them is a singer. Elvis Costello\u2019s first thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven albums seemed to be the emergence of a great new talent, and the helped save the music to immerse themselves in the ocean of moderation. While there are a few exceptions (Neil Young thought), most of the music that was readily available (i.e., radio) around the mid -seventies was surprisingly, almost as bad as clothing. Now I realize this is why all the kids in school have to go back in time to find something we really like. The disco is a curse, boys anyway. Sexual pistols are an inspiration, but we as aspiring artists can\u2019t play to save their lives. Pistols have historically been valuable and fun, but as long as real talent comes along don\u2019t just combine them.

The buzz at the same time was that in spite of her success, Vanguard could not convince Baez to do more than one album a year. She and the folk music scene in the early sixties were still a major topic of conversation in sophisticated circles. One of the most prescient statements I never heard was from my German professor's opinion, expressed in the Fall of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three that the American folk music interest would not survive the arrival of The Beatles. In most ways, I think the was very, very right in that Baez' versions of old English ballads and material from Folkways cd not survive the British invasion. Instead, this musical revolution plus the target rich landscape of the mid one thousand, nine hundred and sixty spawned a great generation built on the legacy of Woody Guthrie instead of `Childe's Ballads. This was lead by Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs (the much missed Phil Ochs), Tom Paxton, Richard Farina and many more. Ms. Baez jumped on this bandwagon, primarily as a consort to Mr. Dylan, but not until she left us with these really remarkable renditions of historical music. Contrary to what you may believe from the title, these two albums were first published about a year apart, with titles even more modest that Ms. Baez' contemporary, Barbara Streisand. As I am not an expert on old English folk music, my best comparisons for Ms. Baez performances are, in fact Ms. Streisand on the one hand and the English Jacqui McShee (female vocalist for The Pentangle and The John Renbourn group) on the other. While Ms. McShee does a great job when she does the same material, I think Miss Joan sets the standard with her crystal clear, vibrato free voice. Baez also does better on this material than her principle competitor (on Elektra), Judy Collins. On the other hand, when I compare Joan to Barbra, I feel there is just something missing in Joanie's interpretation. Aside from having a great set of pipes, this, of course, is one of Streisand's strong points as she gives dramatically different takes on some old chestnuts such as `Happy Days are Here Again'. And yet, Ms. Baez justly famous crystal clear voice gives performances of these songs you will find nowhere else. It is highly unlikely that the contemporary music audience will again support an act doing this material. And, I don't think it's because of a `been there, done that' reaction.

Rdle infuses this charts with little ornamentation, flourishes that strike me as a bit hokey, even clownish at times -- invention and variety for its own sake, rather than supporting and deepening the underlying rhythm, chord structure, and melody of the composition. Sinatra's upper registers, brass, strings, all seem to suffer from some subtle distortion that smudges detail and creates a sort of odd, artificial electronic haze. I am far from having encyclopedic knowledge of the big arrangers of the era gone by, but I've heard many by Claus Ogerman, and as a point of contrast, I think the was more serious and at the same time laid back in this charts. I may buy this album -- its reputation as a classic is deserved (with my reservation about the arranging) -- but if I do, I will seek out the early release, not the later remastered CD. On the topic of sound quality, although I have not heard the original CD release, the remastered version truly does sound sub-par. I'm fairly familiar with what recordings from the mid-fiftys sound like, and I can't believe the original master tape of this Sinatra record never sounded as bad as this.","overall":4,"summary":"The Riddle arrangements are not as great as the vocal performance","unixReviewTime":1208304000,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2008"}

Twice we\u2019ve enjoyed watching the over of PBS\u2019s Greatest Shows on Sinatra\u2019s best television show (unfortunately not available on DVD). My respect for Sinatra has increased over the years. When your library bought this CD, I wanted to review it. I agree that Sinatra spoke out cloud when recording this album. Some of these live shows are very flexible, but in later years it sounds not the same. It\u2019s a matter of taste. I\u2019m thrilled with the subtle variations that still emerge that Sinatra uses to present these songs, many of them outdated. I\u2019m very excited about Nelson Riddle\u2019s fix. They are very busy. They call themselves vigilance when they buy to replay and allow them to focus on the soloist, i.e. Sinatra. The riddle adds to these charts a bit of decoration, coming out and hitting me with a bit of hockey, albeit occasionally rough-one-on-one creativity and diversity, rather than supporting and deepening melody, structure. The song, and the rhythm of the composition. The description there might make them sound a bit annoying about what it really is. In fact the songs on this album prove these flaws more than others. I am far from having the encyclopedic knowledge of the great organizers of the past, but I have heard a lot from Claus Ogerman, and in comparison, I think the is serious and at the same time is featured on this chart. Here again, it\u2019s a matter of taste. I thought the orchestra band had too much wrong kind of attention to itself many times over in songs for Swingin \u2019Lovers. The final analysis, with great songs and Sinatra itself in great shape, I still had to tie a star in the perfect five for the set, which keeps me busy from time to time with their angry, pointless, sometimes some are less stupid. On the subject of sound quality, even though I haven\u2019t heard the original CD release, this kind of remake really makes for a sub-sound. Sinatra\u2019s top note, brass, rope, all seem to suffer from a bit of distortion that deceives the details and creates a kind of thin, artificial electronic air. In fact, people with hearing impairments should not be involved in recognizing conventional albums. Anyone who has never done Songs for Swingin Lovers \u2019is likely to do something that suits these talents, like driving a car. Although difficult to teach correctly, there is definitely something wrong with the sound. I know I know what the mid-fifth recording looks like, and I can\u2019t believe the original tape of this Sinatra record has\u2019t been as bad as this one. I can buy this album - it\u2019s usually worth its reputation (while I still have a place on the set) - but if I do, I\u2019ll be looking for an early release, not a are -released CD.","overall":4,"summary":"The Riddle arrangements are not as great as the vocal performance","unixReviewTime":1208304000,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2008"}

It was The Commodores, in terms of newly formed bands, who most thoroughly represented the genre on Motown. Milan Williams,William King,Walter Orange,Thomas McClary and of course Lionel Richie in particular had now proven important members of a formidable musical team. Many of the bands members were multi instrumentalists. With their previous albumHot on the Tracks, the bands funk was at its most diverse and creative. Their funk was table to blend strong pop songwriting with hefty grooves that put them into the possible position of being a Southern version of Earth Wind & Fire in terms of success. Story goes that around this time, the bands co-producer James Anthony Carmichael had told Lionel that the songs the was writing for the Commodores did't work. And that the should be recording the songs the was writing for other people instead. This album marks The Commodores at the exact point before that change began to seriously take place.\"Squeeze The Fruit\",\"Funny Feelings\",\"Funky Situation\" and \"Patch It Up\" are all very much in the league of the classic seventy's Commodores sound-that think, bass\/guitar fried sound that. well to me always represented what made them distinct among the funk bands of that era. On the faster of those numbers? The feeling is almost rocking in a very clean and soulful way. On the slower numbers? The effect is very much in the Sly Stone vein-again with that Southern twist. \"Heaven Knows\" can actually fool you. It starts out sounding like a mid tempo, melodic love ballad before spinning of into that Southern Sly Stone variant funk sound on the choruses. \"Won't You Come And Dance With Me\" and \"Funky Situation\" both have slightly more jazz oriented choruses as a wraparound for the heavy funk elements. \"Zoom\" is actually a very elaborate, cinematic ballad that contrasts heavily with the the countryish gospel leanings of the big hit \"Easy\" which closes out the album. \"Brick House\", with its bass line and cat calling is not only the best known Commodores funk hit but among their very sexiest as well. Just as a frame of reference, without introducing any needless musical spoilers? This would be the last Commodores album that would have this particular sound about it. Their final two albums of the seventy'sNatural HighandMidnight Magicwould favor melodic soul\/pop and slow Lionel Richie penned ballads to a far stronger degree than hard funk. At least in terms of how their albums were put together. I do realize their are people who would say that entire change was already underway by the time of this album. And if someone asked me over a decade ago I'd probably have agreed with them. But one thing I realize is even the Commodores slower numbers during this period represent part of a diverse, fuller funk\/soul album package than they might've seemed. On this album? The slow songs are slow jams. Full of soul and full of cinematic funk. They have a rhythm and you can tap your foot to them. So when all things get done? This is in fact something of a coda on The Commodores classic funk sound. And a very strong one that any Commodores\/Motown\/funk admirer who does't already have it should seek out.","overall":5,"summary":"The Commodores Say Hello To Funky Album Number Five!","unixReviewTime":1403308800,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2014"}

As for the newly formed team, it is the Commodores that completely represent the Motor City genre. Milan Williams, William King, Walter Orange, Thomas McClary, and of course Lionel Rich, have now proven themselves to be important members of a strong music group. Many band members are multi-instrumentalists. On their previous album Hot on the Tracks, Funk made the most unique and creative album. Their funk is a combination of creating a powerful song with a rhythmic rhythm, making it the southernmost form of Spirit and Fire. The story is that this time, the band's producer James Anthony Carmichael told Lionel that the song they wrote for Brigadier General was not working. And you need to record songs written for other people. The album marked the exact time before Commodores began to take it seriously. \"Sing Fruit\", \"Funny Feelings\", \"Funky Situation\" and \"Patch It Up\" are all part of the old seventys of Union Commodores thinking about sound, bass \/ guitar sound. To me, this always represents what makes them stand out among the funk groups of the time. The speed of these numbers? This feeling is almost circulated in a clean and loving way. To the slow numbers? This effect is more pronounced in the Sly Stone veins - again with a lower twist. \"God knows\" can lie to you. It started to sound like a warm heat, a sweet love of ballad, then in the chorus it became a subtle sound from the south. Both \u201cYou Won\u2019t Come Come And Dance With Me\u201d and \u201cFunky Situation\u201d both have a little jazzy choir, like a toy band. \"Draw\" is the best ball, as opposed to the world of the \"Easy\" good news at the send of the album. The bass line and cat sound of \"Brick House\" is not the famous music of the Commodores funk, but one of their sexiest songs. Just like a reference frame without bringing any unwanted music stuff? This will be the last album of Commodores, and it has a special sound. Their last two albums in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, \"Higher Creation and Midnight Magic\", are more inclined to the soul of the music \/ pop and music lyrics by slow-moving Lionel Richie, more powerful than the hard rock. At least how their albums are put together. I realized that they would say that all the changes had already begun when the discs were released. If anyone asked me ten years ago, I would agree with them. But one thing I\u2019ve noticed is that even the slow numbers of Commodores at the moment represent part of the funk \/ soul album package rather than seemingly. On this album? Slow songs move slowly. Full of soul and horror of the film. They have a rhythm, you can step on them with your feet. What if everything is done? This is the only Funk classical music. It's very powerful, and any Commodores \/ Motown \/ funk admirer who towns it should check it out.","overall":5,"summary":"The Commodores Say Hello To Funky Album Number Five!","unixReviewTime":1403308800,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2014"}

Their career in the beginning of the ninety's was second to none, they almost sold twenty-five million copies with their first two albums, this one andIIand scored with several hits that would became some of the longest-running number one pop singles in history. There are few other R&B; groups that can compare to that. Members Nathan & Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman and Michael McCracy also differ from Jodeci, New Edition and similar groups in the sense that they work excellent as a quartet but few could point of the names of the individual singers, on the other hand few using as good together as Boyz II Men for were capable of making as memorable hits as they did and that's why they sold better then anyone else. They debut album from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one \"Cooleyhighharmony\" differ from their latter music though, on this release they're still searching for their trademark sound and we have an album divided into two categories, New Jack Swing Uptempo's and classic Ballads, to make it even more interesting we also get a few a capella songs that would make sixty's Doo Wop groups proud. Babyface, Michael Bivins ( New Edition, Bell Biv DeVoe) and Dallas Austin stands for the production. For those of your that bought the album back in the day probably recall another album cover and a way shorter playlist, this version is actually a reissue and feature a few more songs. A few remixes, one spanish version and two more songs that were left out of the original release, the beautiful a capella cover of the Five Satins one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six hit \"In The Still of The Night\" and Boomerang soundtrack \"End of the Road\" that quite surprisingly did't appear on the original release. The song spent an incredible thirteen weeks as #one on the singles chart, a record at the time. The album starts with four romantic ballads, \"Please Don't Go\" and \"Lonely Heart\" and \"This Is My Heart\", \"Uhh Ahh\" all alright but no standouts. Two a capella songs follow, the splendid \"It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday\". With the lyrics \"It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday. And I'll take with me the memories\/ To be my sunshine after the brain\" I think the song is about how hard it is to look back at old memories and accept that they are part of the past and will never come back, it could be about a relationship but also about childhood memories for old friends that you never see again. There is also another version of it with sound, but I like the A Cappella better. \"In The Still Of The Night\" is also A capella song about old memories, this time most definitely about a girl. Dallas Austin and Michael Bivins show their best sides with the upcoming three songs, \"Motownphilly\", \"Under Pressure\" and \"Sympin\" all catchy New Jack Swing!. \"Motownphilly\" was a big hit single and reached #three it also feature a cameo from ?uestlove from The Roots (minus that afro). This is their best uptempo and shows the tender lovermen suddenly finding street cred. Next song is called \"Little Things\" and it got this somewhat caribbean beat and is a midtempo and they using \"Little things mean a lotAppreciate what you got\/If you give all what you have\/It's forever we'll last\/Don't sit around and wait for all The great things in your life\", I could't agree more with that. \"Your Love\" is another midtempo with a sound quite typical for it's time. The last song \"End Of The Road\" closes the album and it's a good way to do it cause this is one of the sweetest love songs of all time. Babyface is a genius and few other one's using it like the Boyz. The song is about the send of a relationship where one part don't want to let go. I'm sure most people can see themselves in this song, like aforementioned it spent thirteen weeks at #one making it the biggest hit of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two. Overall, This was a great album but with a few additions it became even better. It's especially hard to Imagine that \"End of The Road\" did't appear on the original album release. With the perfect mix of uptempo and ballads it's also unique in the Boyz II Men catalogue and that's why \"Cooleyhighharmony\" is a special album worth purchasing for anyone interested in early ninety's R&B.; Having said that, this is simply a classic.","overall":5,"summary":"Reissue With Extra Tracks Makes it Irresistable","unixReviewTime":1203292800,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2008"}

Their work in the early ninety's was second to second. Their first two albums sold nearly twenty-five million copies. The album and II also won many popular songs, becoming the longest song in history. One of the songs. There are a few other R&Bs; comparable group. Members Nathan & Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman and Michael McCracy are also different from Jodeci, New Edition and similar bands because they perform as well as quartet, but few people can show the names of the musicians. that's why it sells better than anyone. Their first album was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one on \"Cooleyhighharmony\". Although it is different from this genre of music, in this release, they are still looking for their famous sound. The album is dived into two sections, New Jack Swing Uptempo and the Old Ones To make it even more interesting, we have also found a few capella songs, which will make the Doo Wop band in the sixtys proud. Produced by Babyface, Michael Bivins (new version, Bell Biv DeVoe) and Dallas Austin. For those who bought an album that day, they may remember another album cover and short playlist, this version has been are-released and contains many songs. Some remixes, a Spanish version and two other songs that were not included in the original version, a beautiful capella cover of five satin one, nine hundred and fifty-six songs \"In the Still of The Night\" and a boomerang soundtrack Surprisingly, \"End of the Way\" does not appear in the original version. The song spent an amazing thirteen weeks on a single chart as the # single, which was a record at the time. The album begins with four love bells, \"Please Don't Go\" and \"Lonely Heart\" and \"This Is My Heart\" \"Hmm\" are all good, but none of them stand out. Then came two capella chorus, the amazing \"It's so hard to say goodbye yesterday\". The words \"It's very hard to say goodbye yesterday. I'll take the memories with me \/ that my day behind my mind.\" I think this song is about looking back at the memory of the past and accepting how hard it is. Part of the past and will never come back. There is another version of the sound, but I prefer the capella. \"In the Still Of The Night\" is also a capella song about old memories, this time of course being a girl. Dallas Austin and Michael Bivins have featured their best songs in the upcoming three songs \"Motownphilly\", \"Under Pressure\" and \"Sympin\". \"Motownphilly\" is a single, up to # three. It also features a cameo with uestlove from The Roots (take Africa). This is their beautiful rhythm, which shows that the beloved loved one suddenly found trust in the street. The next song is called \"little things\", small Caribbean beats, medium speed, they use \"Little things mean a lot, thank you for what you have \/ if you give everything you have \/ we will live forever \/ don't sit and wait for all the big things in your life\", I totally agree with this . \"Your Love\" is another medium, and its sound is normal. The last song \"End of the Road\" completed the album, which is a good way because it is one of the most beautiful love songs. Babyface is smart, few people use it like Boyz. This song is about posting a relationship that does't want to let you down. I believe most people see themselves in this song, as mentioned earlier, it took thirteen weeks for # one to make it the biggest of the one, nine hundred and ninety-two popular songs. Overall, this is a great album, but it has gotten better after the content mixing. It\u2019s even harder to imagine that \u201cEnd of the Way\u201d was\u2019t visible on the first album. With a perfect blend of fast-paced songs and music, it also differs from the Boyz II Men's catalog, which is why \"Cooleyhighharmony\" is a special album that should be purchased for those interested in R&B in the early ninetys. Having said that, this is just normal.","overall":5,"summary":"Reissue With Extra Tracks Makes it Irresistable","unixReviewTime":1203292800,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2008"}

Their work in the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys was second to none, they sold nearly twenty -five million copies along with their first two albums, this and IIat produced several hits that would be the longest single pop number in history. There\u2019s a little more R&B; groups that can be compared to that. Members Nathan and Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman and Michael McCracy are also different from Jodeci, New Publishing and similar groups in the sense of working well in the quadruple, but few can point to the names of indivual artists. , on the other hand that fewer users Together as Boyz II Men have made memorable songs like they did and that\u2019s why they sold it better to others. They made a thousand albums, nine hundred and ninety a \u201cCooleyhighharmony\u201d which was different from their music later on, even when released, they were still looking for their voice in the commercial and we had a door split in two, the New Jack Swing Uptempo\u2019s and the classic Ballads, so to make it even more interesting, we\u2019re also getting some capella songs that will make up a sixty Doo Wop band. Babyface, Michael Bivins (New Edition, Bell Biv DeVoe) and Dallas Austin stand for production. For those of you who bought an album back in the day with an album cover and a way shorter than the song list, this type is really a remake and has other songs. A few remixes, a kind of Spanish and two more songs left in the original release, the beautiful beauty of five Satin covers of the thousand, nine hundred and fifty -six hit \u201cIn Still Night\u201d and the Boomerang soundtrack \u201c End The Road \"which surprisingly did not appear in the original release. The song lasted an amazing thirteen weeks as #mid one of the singles, a note in time. The album begins with four love vocals,\" Please Don\u2019t Go \u201dand\u201c Heart Alone \u201dand\u201c This Is My Heart \u201d,\u201c Uhh Ahh \u201dare well but nothing obvious. Two common songs followed, with the beautiful\u201c It was so hard to say goodbye yesterday. \u201dThe words\u201c It was so hard to say goodbye yesterday. is part of the past and will never return, it can be about the relationship but also about the childhood memories of former friends that you have never seen. There is another type of soundtrack, but I prefer A Cappella. \u201cIn The Still of the Night\u201d is also a capella song about past memories, this time mostly about a woman. Dallas Austin and Michael Bivins show their best parts in the next three songs, \u201cMotownphilly\u201d, \u201cPressure\u201d and \u201cSympin\u201d all New Jack Swing attractions! seems to be a suggestion from the roots (minus afro). or \"and they got it some Caribbean beats and midtempo it and they use\" Little things mean a lot thank you for what you have \/ If you give everything you have \/ forever I'll sit and wait for all big in your life \", more there I can't allow that.\" Your Love \"is another midtempo with a very casual sound during it. The latest song\" End of the Road \"closes the album and a great way to do this because it's one of the sweetest love songs never. Babyface is smart and there are others who use it like Boyz. The song is about sending a link which some don't want to release. I'm sure that most people will see this song, as we mentioned that it took thirteen weeks #example making a maximum song of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety two. In general, it is a a good album but adding a few is better. It\u2019s hard to imagine that \u201cEnd of the Road\u201d did\u2019t come out with the release of the original album. With the perfect combination of uptempo and ballads it is also unique to the Boyz II Men book and that is why \u201cCooleyhighharmony\u201d is a unique album worth buying for anyone interested in early nineties R&B .; When I say, this is normal.","overall":5,"summary":"Reissue With Extra Tracks Makes it Irresistable","unixReviewTime":1203292800,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2008"}

The liner notes offer song credits and the date and place where each song was recorded.

Some pop people get a taste of rock and roll together and composing powerful songs with melodies and songs works amazingly well which you will find hard to forget. Liner notes prove credit for the song and the date and place where each song was recorded. There's a picture of Elton - in addition to this classic top that - and another beautiful picture of these band friends. Overall, I recommend this CD to Elton John fans, pop rock fans and anyone who wants to know more about Elton John's past work. If you like this CD, I recommend the CD entitled The second part of The Greatest Hits is probably the best, but there are only two sets of Elton John CDs, One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Seventy Two.

If you like this CD, I recommend this CD entitled Greatest Hits part two for maybe better yet the Elton John two CD set called Greatest Hits one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two thousand and two. Overall, I highly recommend this CD for Elton John fans, fans of pop-rock, and for people who want to get better acquainted with Elton John's earlier work. Even decades later these songs are great songs; the still performs \"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\" at many of this concerts even today. The musical arrangements are all very well done; the rock and roll flavor mixed with a certain pop feel work incredibly well to produce powerful songs with lyrics and melodies that you will find hard to never forget.

It is not unconstitutional that cities require social services for people who see this album as an emotional statement of love that is denied before they are allowed to buy land. Instead, this CD should be seen as Clapton taking blue shapes and making their own, with the Delta, Memphis, Texas, Great Plains, British, and Chicago blues influencing earlier viewing from on higher than the other whites on the blues record that have not done so (only the likes of Robin Trower, Allman Brothers Band, ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Savoy Brown, Chicken Shack, Fleetwood Mac, Foghat, and John Mayall) .

Leila is a kind of fantasy album. He wrote and recorded it at a time when Jehovah was deeply in love with Patti Boyd Harrison, the wife of this close friend George Harrison. (It was an extraordinary friendship). Almost every song is full of the kind of determination and love that Clapton has never shown before. A song titled \"Bell Down Blues\" and \"Leela\" are passionate love songs. Songs on the cover, especially \"No One Knows You When You're Down\", \"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\", and \"The Key to the Highway\", raise the music. It was as if Clipton and Allman's guitars were talking to each other. Then there's Jimmy Hendricks' \"Wing Little.\" Hendricks died while recording the album. It was actually one of the most humorous songs, but Dominus turned it into a roaring song. However, Bobby Whitlock's solo song \"Tree at a Loss\" puts a crust on the cake. In the summer of the ninth, nineteenth century, Domino's worked as a session artist for another older album: Everything George Harrison Must Have. Clapton's Crossroads box set is much less available than it used to be. Another song, \"Roll It Over,\" written by Clipton and Whitlock, featuring Harrison and Dave Mason with guitar and backing vocals. Another premature birth of \"Speak the Truth\" made it faster than the LAYLA version. CROSSROADS also has five tracks from Domino's second abortion album. Extremely dedicated fans of Clapton want to take a look at it to get a full view of this first phase of the project.","overall":5,"summary":"Clapton's Magnum Opus","unixReviewTime":1028764800,"reviewTime":"08 8, 2002"}

Later, Duane Allman also signed a temporary contract, and this immortality album is the result. THE LAW is actually a compact song. He wrote and penned this song when the was in great love with Patty Boyd Harrison, the wife of this best friend George Harrison. (That unusual relationship). Almost every song is full of determination and enthusiasm that Clapton has not shown since. \"Bell Bottom Blues\" and the title track \"Layla\" are romantic violence. Cover songs, especially \"No one knows you when you're down\", \"Have you never loved a woman\" and \"The key to the highway\" are full of the excitement of interesting instruments. It's like the claps of Clapton and Allman talking to each other. Then came Jimi Hendrix's \"Little Wings\" cover. Hendricks died while recording the album. This is really one of the softest songs, but Domino has turned it into a roaring and moving song. However, in all of this, Bobby Whitlock's acoustic solo ballad \"Thorn Tree in the Garden\" is a surprise to the cake. In the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, the Dominos band worked as conference singers on another classical album: \"Let Everything Pass\" by George Harrison. The Clapton set for CROSSROADS contains some excerpts from these conferences. The song \"Roll It Over\" was composed by Clapton and Whitlock, with Harrison and Dave Mason as guitar and harmony. One is the earlier birth of \"Tell the Truth\", which plays faster than the LAYLA version. CROSSROADS also has five songs on Domino's second album. More focused Clapton fans may want to read these to get a full understanding of the gold standard of this work.","overall":5,"summary":"Clapton's Magnum Opus","unixReviewTime":1028764800,"reviewTime":"08 8, 2002"}

{"orig_index":6902,"reviewerID":"A3JJUCA6K4P31H","asin":"B0000024WV","reviewerName":"Elliot Knapp","helpful":[7,8],"reviewText":"More correctly, this review's title should be \"This remaster is glorious.\" I've been a fan ofThe Soft Machine Vols. one & twofer quite a while, and I've owned Third for over five years, but I never really \"got\" it until I purchased this recent remastered reissue. The sound is so much improved that it really transforms the album, giving the music a vitality that simply in't there in the early ninety's reissue. Listen to this reissue and you'll understand why this is the grandest statement that the Soft Machine would never make, and one of the top albums never produced by any of the prolific Canterbury bands. How can this music be accurately described? It's tough--\"jazz-rock\" and \"fusion\" don't come close to doing this genre-cracking music justice, not to mention the undesirable connotations brought on by both terms. A listen to the instrumental sections of the Soft Machine's second album will give you a hint at where the band was going, but there the band stretches out into much more complex, wild, terrifying, manic, and otherworldly areas with their sounds and improvisation. Really, the opener--\"Facelift\"--sums it up the best. Mike Ratledge's lieu morgan sounds fade into audibility, then are suddenly replaced by the most dissonant, audacious fuzz morgan sounds never produced. Sinister horns start to edge their way into the mix, and it's over five minutes into the song that the horns combine with the keyboard and bass to state the composition's main themes. On the older issue of this album, the sound is muddied--like you're listening to the band from the very back of a poorly-constructed shall, and everything sounds distant and alien. With the new mastering the instrumental separation is crisp and it's much more apparent (and easier to visualize) that the music is being made by just a few guys in a room, and it's all the more intimately foreboding for it! The band ominously states the piece's themes, shifts to another theme at a faster tempo (reminds me of a demonic twist on the Price is Right music), then gives way to some really tasty improvisation from Ratledge and Elton Dean, the sax player. \"Facelift\" was recorded live, and bristles with energy, but it's not devoid of studio manipulation--there's some pretty stripey looping (Hugh Hopper really dove into this later on thisone thousand, nine hundred and eighty-fouralbum, and some freaky backwards music as well. Much of the rest of the album follows a similar blueprint that \"Facelift\" establishes--the songs are all at least eighteen minutes long and feature some pretty wild improvisation and dark textures and moods, but they're not devoid of the quirks and sense of humour we all expect from the Soft Machine and the Canterbury scene. \"Slightly All The Time\" kicks of with some winding bass from Hopper and similar grand statements featuring horn\/organ harmonies, though it's a bit less scary than \"Facelift.\" The backbone of the composition is hypnotic electric vamps from Ratledge that shift dramatically over different tempos (dig Robert Wyatt's typically incredible drumming throughout), playing a backdrop for some good flute soloing. Fans of Wyatt and earlier Soft Machine will be pleased with \"Moon In June,\" the last Soft Machine track to feature Robert Wyatt's vocals and witty lyrics. It's a far cry from earlier work, though, as it's dreamy, meandering and not pop oriented at all. The lyrics are hilarious throwaways, though, and Wyatt turns in some mouth-watering drumming and some psychedelic percussive improvisation along with a violin toward the send (which predicts some of this later solo work onRock Bottom. \"Slightly All The Time\" closes the album with some really incredible delay\/loop keyboards and segues into some more blisteringly fast horn\/bass theme statements, passes over some more jaw-dropping tempo shifts and sick instrumental interplay, then fades back out over three minutes of similar keyboard loops. Overall, Third is completely one-of-a-kind. It manages to combine memorable songwriting and melodies with engaging instrumental prowess in a way unmatched elsewhere by Soft Machine for really any other jazz-rock music, which often tends to be virtuosic to the point of inaccessibility and distinctly lacking in memorable melody. Better yet, the band's decision to produce an album of side-long suites gives them room to stretch out into some really transcendent and psychedelic sounds. The icing on the cake is that there's a second disc in this reissue that includes a live performance of half of this album and a medley of material from Soft Machine Two. The production in't as clean as the live \"Facelift\" from the original album, but the playing and sense of experience is impressive--I'm sure Soft Machine were really a band best experienced live. If my words did't do this album justice, I'm not surprised, hearing this music is believing. Hopefully I at least inspired you to go out and pick this up--make sure to get the new two-disc remastered reissue.","overall":5,"summary":"This album is GLORIOUS","unixReviewTime":1224806400,"reviewTime":"10 24, 2008"}

The sound is so high that it really transforms the album, giving the music the power it lacked in the early nineties. Listen to this are-release and you'll understand why Soft Machine is the best statement never made, and one of the top albums produced by any Canterbury band. How can this music be accurately described? That's the decent thing to do, and it should send there.

Indeed, the opening - \"Facelift\" - is a very good summary. Mike Rutledge's liquid Morgan voices are reduced to a few voices, and are replaced by unpopular Puzz Morgan voices that were never born. The horns of evil begin to break through the mixture, and five minutes have passed in the song when the horns meet the keyboard and say the main themes of the composition. In the old issue of this album, the sound is muddy - like you hear a band behind something very poorly constructed, and it all seems distant and unknown. The distribution of instruments with new knowledge is so cool and so clear (and easy to see) that the music is made by a few boys in a room, and it's very dangerous! The band brutally refers to the pieces, rapidly moves on to another theme (reminds me of the devilish deviation in Price from Right Music), and provides some really cool stuff from sex players Ratledge and Elton Dean. does. \"Face Lift\" was recorded live, and it's powerful, but it does't use the studio-there's a fine-tuned twist (Hugh Hopper really does it in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-four albums. The rest of the album follows the same plan.)

We all look forward to the Soft Machine and Canterbury Square - Robert Wyatt (often unbelievable everywhere), playing the back of a sweet flute. Oing Wyatt and former soft machine fans will be delighted with \"Moon in June\", the latest soft machine track featuring Robert Wyatt's songs and funny songs. This is far from the previous work, however, it is dreamy, dynamic and not pop at all.

In the former case of this album, the sound is muffled - as if you\u2019re listening in the back of an unoccupied building, and everything seems distant and alien. With the new acquisition, the classification of instruments is complicated and it is very obvious (and easy to see) that the music is performed by many men in one room, and it is all unpredictable! The band clearly particulates the themes of the piece, moves on to other topics at a faster space (reminding me of a demonic twist on Value is the right music), and then gives Ratledge and Elton Dean a delicious way, the player. right.

Bernabo","helpful":[111,131],"reviewText":"It has been thirty years since \"Blood on the Tracks\" was released and of all of the albums recorded by Bob Dylan it is the one that has most increased in stature simply because every album produced since then has failed to rise to this level. I think the reason for this is mainly because it was born in a creative burst of pointed lyricism as this marriage to Sara Lowndes collapsed, with all the songs written in two months in the male of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four. I would no more expect any personal turmoil to provide similar inspiration any more than I would have expected any of the songs on this album to rise to the level of social rhetoric found in this greatest songs of the Sixties. In \"Blood on the Tracks\" Dylan also turned this back on this greatest backing band, returning to this artistic routes on an album that is largely acoustic-based. The songs run the emotional gamut from sorrow and regret to bitterness and spain. At the same time, despite the obvious point of origin for most of these songs, this is not an openly confessional album (cf. Courtney Love's \"America's Sweetheart\"). After all, we are talking the lyrics of Bob Dylan, which means cryptic riddles and allegories abound all laid out in ten classic tracks:\"Tangled Up in Blue\" is the best song on the album and the ambiguity about the characters and relationships Dylan sings about has only increased over the years with the shifting lyrics in various performances. The cover version by the Indigo Girls remains my favourite Dylan cover.\"Simple Twist of Fate\" is another great four-word phrase in a song that represents the most overtly personal song on the album. The stark instrumentation only serves to highlight the heartbreak of the existentialist lyrics and the mournful sound of the vocals.\"You're A Big Girl Now\" is a ballad on the send of a relationship and a sort of benediction in that clearly the woman is right to move on, but Dylan is still haunted by their physical encounters. You would think that this would have been the logical final track for the album, but it is not.\"Idiot Wind\" is song on the album that most reminds me of an earlier Dylan composition, namely \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" the pair being a set of put-down songs. The difference is that while both song flash out in lots of directions, this one keeps coming back to a certain \"babe.\" This is another song that has changed over the year for various reasons that could well inspire a doctoral dissertation.\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\" is a rather upbeat track, despite the descending chord progressions, and is usually considered a song hopeful of reconciliation rather than one eulogizing the breakup.\"Meet Me in the Morning\" stands out musically as the most blues oriented track that always struck me as cleansing the palette for what was coming next on the album.\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\" is a weight:fifty story song that basically wears down the listener's insistence that this is a biographical album. It also has a line that Dylan seems to using with unit pitch and without affection, to wit, \"and Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.\" Pay attention next time through to that one phrase.\"If You See Her, Say Hello\" probably represents the emotional low point of the album, with lyrics reflecting a singer who is crushed and embittered by the send of the relationship, turning this danger in on himself.\"Shelter from the Storm\" is a song of simple beauty, based on three chords and a simple melody, underscoring a profound sense of loss. The song provides an avalanche of symbols and metaphors, but actually seems to send on an optimistic note.\"Buckets of Rain\" provides a fitting finale, suitably depressing lyrics against a rather upbeat melody as irony once again abounds. After this song there is no where left to go.\"Blood on the Tracks\" is listed by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine as the #sixteen record on the list of the five hundred greatest albums of all time, between #fifteen \"Are You Experienced?\" by the Jimi Hendrix Experience and #seventeen \"Nevermind\" by Nirvana. It is one of ten Dylan albums on the list, behind #four \"Highway sixty-one Revisited\" and #nine \"Blonde on Blonde.\" This For pretty much the complete story on the making of this classic album, check out \"A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks\" by music journalist Andy Gill and guitarist Kevin Odegard, who played on the five tracks recorded in Minneapolis.

I think this is because the was born from a sharp creative explosion when this marriage to Sarah Landes broke up. All songs were recorded at one, nine hundred and seventy-four in two months. I would not expect any personal turmoil to prove the same encouragement, as I expect any song on this album to reach the social rhetoric level of the great sixties. In \"Blood on the Tracks\", Dylan once again turned this thing around to a great accompanying band, returning to this part form on an acoustics-based album. These songs cover emotions such as grief and remorse and bitterness even in Spain. At the same time, although most of the songs have a clear origin, they are not a public record (see Courtney Love's \"American Sweetheart\"). After all that, we are talking about Bob Dylan's songs, which means that ten old songs are full of mysteries and myths: \"Tangled Up in Blue\" is the best song on the album, and Dylan sings the characters' incomprehensibility and relationships only escalate over the years as the voices have changed in different games. The cover version of Indigo Girls is still my favourite Dylan. \"Simple Twist of the End\" is another phrase with four characters in the song, representing the most personal song on the album. Bright instruments will only brighten the sad heart of existing voices and the sadness of human voices. \"You're a big girl now\" is a ballad about relationships and blessings, because this woman clearly has the right to continue, but Dylan is still worried about their physical contact. You may think this will be the last track on the album, but it is not. The song \"Idiot Wind\" on the album reminds me of many of Dylan's first works, namely, \"Like a Rolling Stone\", which is a group of annoying songs. The difference is that although both songs are illuminated in many directions, this one often goes back to a certain \u201cbaby.\u201d This is another song that has changed all year around for a variety of reasons, and has the potential to promote medical promotion. \"You will make me feel lonely when you go\" is a very hopeful song, although the chord progression drops, is generally regarded as a song of hope for reconciliation, not a song celebrating separation. \"I met you in the morning\" in full music. It is the most beautiful song never. It always touches me. Specifies the color scheme for the next theme of the album. \"Lily, Rosemary and Jack of Hearts\" is a fifty-story song, which basically breaks the audience's insistence that this be a biography album. There is a line that Dylan seems to use without emotion on the stone unit, namely, \"Lily has washed all the dye on her hair.\" Look at that line carefully in the future. \"If you see him, say hello\" probably represents the track track. The words reflect the crush and spain of the artist due to the emotions. Translating this danger into \"Wind and Rain\" is easy Song Beautiful songs are controlled by the simple sound of a triad, which evokes a deep sense of loss. This song gives a lot of symbols and metaphors, but it seems to convey a promising atmosphere. \"Rain Buckets\" provides the perfect ending, with well-pressed vocals against the sound of hopeful music, and irony as well. After listening to this song, we have nowhere to go. \"Blood on the Roads\" was listed by Rolling Stone magazine as the # sixteen record among five hundred major albums of all time, among # fifteen \"Are You Experienced\"? \"By Jimi Hendrix Experience and # seventeen\" Nevermind \"by Nirvana. This is one of Dylan's ten albums on the list, second only to # four\" Highway sixty-one Revisited \"and # nine\" Blonde in Blonde \"about the production of this.

Are I think the reason is that it was born out of an explosion of straightforward songs because this marriage with Sarah Lundes was broken, all the songs written in two months between one thousand nine hundred and seventy four. I would no longer expect such encouragement from any personal disturbance as I expected from any song on this album to reach the level of social expression found in these great songs of the sixties. In \"Blood on the Tracks\", Dylan once again turned this back on this largest music group, and returned to these artistic tracks from a soundtrack album. Songs revoke feelings of sadness and grief and remorse, even bitterness and bitterness. At the same time, apart from a clear view of the originality of many of the songs, this is not a self-confessed album (cf. Courtney Love's \"Sweet America\"). However, we're talking about Bob Dylan's characters, which means that the mysterious puzzles and columns are a complete set of ten common tracks: \"Tangled Up in Blue\" is the best song on the album. The cover version of Indigo Girls has always been my favourite Dylan cover. \"Simple twist of fate\" is another fun four-word phrase in a song that represents the album's most prominent human song. The enlightened only works to break the heart of existential music and highlight the melancholy sound of the voices. \"You're a big girl now\" is a song and a kind of blessing in posting a relationship because it's clear that a woman has the right to move on, but Dylan is still overwhelmed by their physical confrontation. You'd think it would be the last logical song on the album, but it's not. \"Addict Wind\" is a song from the album that is very reminiscent of the song that Dylan originally suggested, \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" a combination of both songs. The difference is that when both songs are bright and point in several places, it keeps coming back to a certain \"child\". This is another song that has changed over the years for a variety of reasons that could affect the medical research theme. A song that hopes for reconciliation is the one that fuels separation. \"Met Me In The Morning\" is very popular in music as a blues song that I sang as the next clearing palette for the album. \"Lily, Rosemary and Jack of Hearts\" is a weight loss: a fifty-story song that weakens the audience's insistence that it's an album of human history. There's also a line that Dylan appears to use on the unit's pitch and without love, \"and Lily had already removed all the dye from her hair.\" Take a closer look at this one word next time. \"When you see him, the says hello\" probably represents the less emotional point of the album, featuring a crushed and angry artist in the lyrics who turns that danger into this own. \"Shelter from the Storm\" is a simple beauty song, based on three songs and music. Emphasis on a simple, deep sense of loss. The song proves a bunch of symbols and metaphors, but it does seem to send some hope. \"Buckets of Rain\" provides the perfect ending, songs suitable for unwanted music, as the controversy escalates. There is nowhere to go after this song. \"Blood on Tracks\" is listed as the # sixteenth record on Rolling Stone magazine's list of biggest albums, followed by # fifteen and \"Are You Experienced?\" Between the Jimmy Hendricks Experience and Nirvana's Seventeen \"No Matters\". This is one of Dylan's ten albums on the list, followed by # four \"Highway sixty-one Revised\" and # nine \"Blonde to Blonde\".

Don't be fooled though- other than \"Barracuda\", the rest of the album does't contain the same kind of aggression for heaviness so in a way, it's a minor disappointment.\"Treat Me Well\" reminds me of the Carpenters a little bit thanks to the vocal delivery, and \"Cry to Me\" is perhaps reminiscent of Joni Mitchell's Court & Spark days. However BOTH of these songs are quite good songwriting-wise (especially the latter) because the vocal melodies are really delightful. They work on a highly emotional level too, meaning, they almost make me shed some tears on a couple occasions. I immediately enjoyed the upbeat \"Say Hello\". A great song that one is. Alright you got me- the title song DOES rock pretty hard and will probably remind most people of \"Magic Man\". The similarities between the two songs is noticeable right away. Another highlight. I really love \"Sylvan Song\" which is basically a little instrumental introduction leading into the pleasant vibes and mandolin-soaked \"Dream of the Archer\". Together these two songs prove a beautiful, fairly complex portion of the album, and perhaps even a comparison to the song \"Dreamboat Annie\" would't be totally out of the question either. One song that feels a bit weaker than the rest is \"Love Alive\". The second part of the song is good, but the first half feels pretty average to me with a fairly weak vocal melody taking up too much time. Not a bad song though. Not at all. \"Go on Cry\" is perhaps just a disappointing way to conclude the album because it does eventually let loose and rock, but it takes four whole minutes to get to that point. Until then, you're just treated to a fairly funky and nearly ambient sounding soft jam. Overall, Dreamboat Annie still remains Heart's overall best album, but Little Queen is a pretty good follow-up. Just pay attention to the songwriting and forget about the fact it does't rock very hard and you'll find yourself getting into it much easier.","overall":4,"summary":"little accomplishment","unixReviewTime":1292457600,"reviewTime":"12 16, 2010"}

However, both songs are very good in style (especially the last one), because the sound of the voice is appealing. They also work on the emotional level, which means they almost made me cry a few times. I immediately enjoyed the hope of saying \"Hello\". Great song. Well, you get the sea \u2014 the title track is really rocky, and it can remind a lot of people about \u201cMagic\u201d. The similarities between the two songs are immediately apparent. Another bright spot. I really like the \"Song of Sylvan\", which is basically a small introduction, which introduces a fresh air and a \"dream shooter\" embedded in the mandolin. These two songs together make for a great and sophisticated album, and it is almost impossible to compare it with the song \"Dreamboat Annie\". One song that feels weaker than other songs is \"Love Alive\". The second half of this song is good, but the first half feels very familiar to me, and a weak songbook takes a lot of time. Although not a bad song. No it is not. \"Keep Crying\" might be just a frustrating way to send the album, as it eventually released and rocked, but it could take up to four minutes to reach this point. Until then, you will only feel the soft jam that is fashionable and close to the environment. Overall, \"Dream of sailing Annie\" is still the best album of the heart, but the young Queen is a good job to follow.

If you want some extra songs check the remastered version. STORYThriler was the album that made Michael jackson the king of pop and one of the greatest music artist of your time. Michael had always been a front figure, with the Jackson five in the sixty's and seventy's and had many good solo hits among the way too. \"Off the Wall\" from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine was this first solo album that we count from. It had loads of great disco inspired songs, but Michael cd't find this true self until \"Thriller\" was released. He's started dancing like never before which we could see on the music videos like \"Billie Jean\" \"Thriller\" and \"Beat It\" and wrote the majority of the songs on thriller maxwell. The album felt more personal, then any other material previously released. \"Thriller\" was the start of pop history. ALBUM\"Thriller\" is a perfect example of good pop, it's a flawless album that still feels interesting, twenty years after it was released. All of the songs are great and, also quite known Jackson songs that has been both played on radio and covered by others. They are all remarkable in there own way and classic songs that all could have become big sellers. The album starts with Michael Jackson penned \"Wanna Be Starting Something\" a catchy up tempo song. It's ghoulish with some disco influent. A great party song you won't stop dancing to. The second single \"Baby Be Mine\" was written by Rod Temperton it's also disco influenced but more of a uptempo-ballad then a dance song. Third song is \"The Girl is Mine\" featuring Paul McCartney that Michael was a very good friend of back then until Michael bought the rights for all Beatles songs, Michael also appeared on Paul's \"Say Say Say\". The song is a duet(obviously) where both want to have the same girl. The match is excellent, The take one verse each and then using together on the hook. It starts slow but becomes faster later on. A quite underrated song. Song number four is \"Thriller\" which also was written by Temperton. It's not only a classic song with a master piece of video when Michael showed the world how the could dance. But also a very good song, one of the best there. Next up is \"Beat it\" written by Michael maxwell, catchy uptempo rock-pop song where Eddie Van Halen player the guitar too. \"Billie Jean\" is smith and ghoulish, with unforgettable lyrics(written by Jackson). The first song Micheal showed how to dance to, a real classic. Next up is \"Human Nature\" a beautiful ballad written by Porcaro and Bettis, that later SWV covered. Here Michael also shows how a falsetto sound like. \"P. Y. T\" is also a disco influenced song, quite underrated maxwell. Written by James Ingram and Quincy Jones who also produced this masterpiece. The song is very special, give it some time. The last song is \"Lady of my life\" a beautiful power ballad. It has been sampled later on. It's a great ending of a perfect album. CONCLUSIONSWhat more can i add. \"Thriller\" is flawless, not only Michael Jackson's best work but also one of the greatest in pop and rock history. It made Michael a top star, and it launched this career both as a artist and as a songwriter. It has it all, uptempo songs, ballads, good lyrics catchy hooks and beautiful melodies. All songs are good and that's very uncommon that you can say that about a pop album. Even now more then twenty years after it's release it's still a pleasant album to listen to.

If you need more songs, please check the composition. THE STORY is a record that makes Michael Jackson the master of pop music and one of the leading musicians of your time. Michael has always been a leading figure, and Jackson Five had many independent solos in the sixtys and seventys. \"Beyond the Wall\" in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine was your first album. It has many inspired disco songs, but Michael and't find this true identity until the release of \"The Thriller\". He started dancing in an unprecedented way, as we see in music videos such as \u201cBillie Jean\u201d, \u201cThe Thriller\u201d and \u201cBeat It\u201d, and composed most of the songs by the thriller Maxwell. Compared to any previous release, this album feels more comfortable. \"Thriller\" is the beginning of the history of popular music. THE ALBUM \"Thriller\" is the perfect example of the best pop music. It\u2019s a flawless album that the feels is in demand twenty years after its release. All the songs are beautiful, and Jackson's famous song was played on the radio and was covered by others. They are all unique in their own way, and classic songs are probably the best-selling. The album begins with \"Wanna Be Start Something\" by Michael Jackson, a song that reaches the rhythm. Influenced by a particular disco, this is cruel. A beautiful group song, you will dance forever. The second one \"Baby Be Mine\" was composed by Rod Temperton. It also touched the disco, but it was more like a ballad than a dance song. The third song is \"The Girl Is Mine\", lead singer Paul McCartney, Michael was a good friend at the time, until Michael bought the copyright for all the Beatles songs, Michael also appeared in Paul's \"Say Say\". This song is a duet (obviously), and both people want to have the same girl. The competition was so good, everyone took the poem and took the bait together. It was slow at first, but then it slowed down. Very low song. The fourth song is \"Thriller\", also composed by Temperton. When Michael showed the world how to dance, it was not an old song with a master video. But it's also a very good song, one of the best songs out there. Next up is \"Beat it\" by Michael Maxwell, a fast-paced rock song, with Eddie Van Halen also playing guitar. \"Billie Jean\" is a blacksmith and a villain, with memorable words (written by Jackson). Michael showed how to dance to the first song, a real class. Next up is \"Man's Creation\", a beautiful folk song composed by Porcaro and Bettis, which was later sung by SWV. Here, too, Michael made a false statement. \"PY. T\" is also an influential disco song, adapted by Maxwell. Written by James Ingram and Quincy Jones, they also produced this masterpiece. This song is very important, give it time. The last song is \"The Lady in My Life\", a beautiful ball of energy. Sample later. This is the perfect ending to a perfect album. Conclusion What else can I add. \"The Thriller\" is flawless, not only Michael Jackson's best work, but also one of the greatest works in the history of pop and rock. It made Michael a top star and opened this career as a singer and songwriter. It has everything, fast-moving songs, folk songs, great vocals and great music. All the songs are very good, not to mention the popular albums are rare. Even today, more than two decades after its release, it still holds a beautiful record. It is flawless.","overall":5,"summary":"Michael Jackson- the King of Pop!","unixReviewTime":1082937600,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2004"}

Michael has always been a front runner, the had five Jacksons in the sixties and seventies and many solo tracks along the way. \"Outse the Wall\" was the first solo album we counted since one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine. There were a lot of disco-inspired songs, but Michael did't know it until the release of Thriller.

All the songs are fun, too, and Jackson's songs, both played on the radio, are famous and popular. They are all amazing in their own way and old songs that can be big sellers. The album begins with the writing of Michael Jackson's hit song \"Wanna Be Starting Something\". It's a ghost with some disco. A great party song that you will never stop dancing. The second single, \"BB Mine\", was written by Rod Tamperton, who was inspired by the disco but more upbeat ballad and then a dance song. The third song, \"The Girl from Mine\", in which Paul McCartney claimed that Michael was a good friend at a time when Michael had bought the rights to all of the Beatles' songs, also appeared in Michael Paul's Say Say Say. \u06d4 This song is a pair (apparently) when they both want the same girl. The game is great, say one verse at a time and use it together on the hook. It starts slowly but quickly. Very little song The fourth song is \"Thriller\" which was also written by Temperton. It's not just an old song with a professional video clip of Michael showing the world how to dance. But also a great song, one of the best songs out there. It is followed by Michael Maxwell's \"Beat Eight\", a popular rock-pop song in which Eddie Van Helen plays the guitar. \"Cat Jane\" is beautiful and passionate, with memorable words (written by Jackson). Michael's first song showed how to dance, a real classic. Next to \"Human Nature\" is a beautiful song written by Purkaro and Betis, which later covered SWV. Here Michael also shows how Falsito's voice sounds. \"PYT\" is also an influential disco song, Maxwell rarely. Written by James Ingram and Quincy Jones, who also created this masterpiece. The song is very special, give it time. The last song says \"Lady of My Life\" is a beautiful power ballad. It was sampled over time. The perfect ending to a complete album. What else can I add at the send? \"Thriller\" is flawless, not only the best work of Michael Jackson but also the greatest work in the history of pop and rock. It made Michael a top star, and introduced him to the work as an artist and songwriter. It has it all, uptempo songs, ballads, beautiful songs and great melodies.

This album alone helped launch a movie (Moonwalker) and a over game for Sega Genesis (three years after Bad's release) based on the movie and it won countless awards from after its release up until the decade's send (although none of those were grammy, unlike Thriller). Although there was a noticeable change in Micahel's physical appearance as well as this vocal range around one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, nobody scared because this swagger was still untouchable. Bad's tracks stayed true to its musical diversity with some changes compared to Thriller. For example, \"Man In The Mirror\" (#one pop\/R&B; hit) introduced this humanitarian expression as a solo artist of which the will continue to produce on this next two albums. Simular to \"Man In The Mirror,\" \"Another Part of Me\" (#one R&B; hit) expressed much on improving the universe of which was a appropriate choice of song based on the Disney's Captain EO short film (of which the was in over a year before Bad's release). That song tread more closer to The Jacksons' \"Can You Feel It\" (the first of its kind for Michael). Lyrically like \"Billie Jean\" and musically like \"Beat It,\" \"Dirty Diana\" served to be a more grittier and darker version than the both combined(something of which Michael hardly never records) which was very interesting for its time. Although \"Billie Jean\" emphasizes on a crazy groupie claiming that the singer father her child, \"Dirty Diana\" (#one pop hit) emphasizes more on a cold-hearted groupie trying to sleep with the singer for fame and fortune. \"Billie Jean\" was more based on Michael (prior to the song). Michael kept that the story\/theme-like songs coming with the groovy \"Smooth Criminal\" which was the lead song for the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight film, Moonwalker. For the first time (but not last time) in this career, Michael fights the rumour pitching media with \"Leave me Alone\" although it was'nt perceive to attack the media until the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight video came out to support Moonwalker.\"Liberian Girl,\" and \"Speed Demon\" were two of Michael's best from the album, although none of them were singles in the US for reached the charts. The former was beautiful and the latter was funky. \"Liberian Girl\" was written as early as one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three and was suppose to be on The Jacksons' Victory album, but Micahel decided to hold on to the song (while making some minor adjustments to the lyrics) until it was time to work on the Bad album. The title cut and \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" (both #one pop\/R&B; hits) had that pop\/dance flavor that were the lead singles on the album and their supporting videos (also with \"Smooth Criminal\") continued the group dance sequences that elevated Michael's status of being the greatest dancer of the world even further. The title track says it all with good reasoning and I'm glad that it was more street oriented (it was suppose to be a collaborative effort with Prince, but I'm glad that Michael recorded it only for himself). The album's first single \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" was a beautiful duet with Sideah Garrett (who previously sang \"Don't Look Any Further\" with Dennis Edwards three years before Bad) that was also the first of five #one pop singles on Bad. It was also known for not having a music video for it, despite of its success. The most forgettable track was the Stevie Wonder duet, \"Just Good Friends\" was a real funky jam and not the only time the collaborated with Stevie (on the same year, Michael joined Stevie on the similar \"Get It\" which appears on Stevie's Characters album and was a top ten R&B; hit). Another major miss was not originally including \"Streetwalker\" on the original one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven release because that was a jamming' number (maybe it should've been on the original instead of \"Just Good Friends\" when it came down to cutting down songs). All in all, the Bad album is one of this three greatest solo works in this adult solo career because of the quality of the songs and not because of the sales.

Although Mikahel's appearance and vocal cords underwent a definite change around one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-seven, no one is afraid, as this strategy has come to the fore. Compared to Thriller, Bad repertoire maintains the reality of its musical diversity, but with another change.

The key to music is a quiet choice because it engraved its own quiz stories of love, commitment and failure at the same time, all delivered in its wonderful and deep voice. Usually what Ms. Armadrading is a mix of artist-in-the-art acoustic music and electronic instruments and the introduction of other music styles such as blues, R&B ;, jazz and popular funky chords. Criticism rates for standard albums are often very high and not in line with everyone\u2019s preferences (my situation is worse than Nirvana\u2019s album \u2018Nevermind\u2019 in mind) but it really deserves any praise that given!

I can count on one hand the number of wrap albums that are as consistently funny and entertaining as this one. This album is simply phenomenal throughout. The three MCs there are fantastic. Busta Rhymes would of course go on to be the quick-lipped apocalyptic mainstream MC, but there the is a hilarious, immature teen. Dinco Dean carries the weight as the one who gels Busta with the equally zany and funny Charlie Brown, whose yelling and chanting make him the one who really stands out. Cut Monitor Milo makes the beats, along with an assorted group of other producers, and craps on occasion. LONS are a joy to listen to because they celebrate youth, and are quite capable of tackling issues on the youth of the world last their crazy humour. The production is excellent, using samples and creative instrumentals to make a unique yet simple sound that does't sound slightly dated fifteen years later. I can't think of another group that has so much character and charisma. \"A Future Without a Past\" is a concept album that follows Busta, Dinco, and Charlie through a day at school. These guys have hysterical thoughts about the goings on at the high school, and I laugh frequently whenever I listen to this. This album is a must-have for any fans of ninety classic ship shop. The skits are part of what make the concept work so well and make the album so much fun. Beginning with \"Homeroom,\" which has the guys skirting into school amid some sort of riot, and the classic song \"Case of the PTA\" plays the school theme perfectly, poking fun at the school system over a legendary production with an infectious chorus. \"Too Much on My Mind\" allows the MCs to voice the problems of their teenage lives, with a horn-laden hook. \"What's the Pinocchio's Theory?\" is crazy and hilarious, anchored by Charlie Brown. Despite its standard fun, \"Just When You Thought It Was Safe. \" displays a social consciousness that only the best MCs had in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. After a visit to the \"Lunchroom\" is the incredible \"Sound of the Zeekers,\" a crazy song with multiple guest wrappers. \"Sobb Story\" is great, and \"Feminine Fatt\" is a funny song where Busta speaks happily of heavyset women. I love \"Transformers,\" and \"Afterschool\" the LONS ask for role models on \"Show Me a Hero.\" \"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles\" is infectious and fast, as is the well-produced and executed \"International Zone Coaster.\" The self explanatory \"Teachers, Don't Teach Us Nonsense\" precedes Busta's hilarious \"My Dingaling.\" The album closes with the perfect \"Where Do We Go From Here?\"For as much success as Busta Rhymes would later find, in my opinion this is by far this greatest accomplishment. \"A Future Without a Past\" is amazing. It's unbelievably funny, musically catchy, and simply entertaining as the best ship shop is. Fans of A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and even Brand Nubian for Wu-Tang should pick this up without thinking twice, and they will see that LONS are a group as unique and enjoyable as any.

I can\u2019t think of another team with so much personality and charm. \"A Future Without a Future\" is an album about the day Busta, Dinco and Charlie spent school. These people have vague peas about what happened in high school, and I laugh every time I hear it. This album is a must have for fans of ninety classic stores. The skit is part of what makes this idea work and what makes the album so interesting. Starting from \"Homeroom\", the boys slipped into the school with some form of riot. The classical song \"PTA Case\" perfectly interprets the school's theme, amusing the school system with a well-known broadcast work. \"A lot to My Mind\" allows MC to use a horn-filled drum to express problems in their teenage lives. \"What is Pinocchio's idea?\" Crazy and interesting, hosted by Charlie Brown. Without quality entertainment, \"just when you think it's safe.\" Demonstrates social knowledge that only good MCs are present in one thousand and nine hundred and ninety-one. After visiting \"Lunch Room\", enjoy the amazing \"Voice of Zick\", a crazy song with a wrap to wrap for many guests. \"Sobb's story\" is beautiful, and \"Fatt Fatt\" is a funny song, Busta happily tells a tough woman. I like \"Translators\" and \"After School\", Lons asked for role models in \"Show me the Hero\". \"Airplanes, trains and cars\" are contagious and fast, as well-designed and well-designed \"roller coasters\". The self-explanatory \"Teacher, do not teach us nonsense\" preceded by the vibrant Busta \"My Dingle\". The album ended perfectly \"Where are we going there?\" Although the Busta Rhymes later achieved many successes, in my opinion, this is the biggest achievement. \"A future without a past\" is amazing.

On the other hand, I can count many wrap-up albums that have always been so funny and entertaining. This album is just everywhere. The three MCs out there are great. Busta Rhymes will continue to be the fastest MC with the usual apocalyptic, but there are also some funny and immature youngsters. Dinko Dan lifts weights as Busta and Charlie Brown bend down who sings like an adulterer and is funny, this screams and singing make him the best. Kit Monitor Melo blocks as well as occasionally corpses with a diverse group of producers. LONS is a pleasure to listen to because it entertains young people, and is table to deal with the problems of the world's youth in the list of their crazy jokes. The production is excellent, using patterns and part tools, a unique but simple sound that was not heard fifteen years later. I can't imagine another group with so many people and charisma. \"Future Without the Past\" is a thought-provoking album that follows Busta, Danko and Charlie all day at school. These guys have hysterical ideas about going to high school, and I laugh every time I hear that. This album is a must have for any fan of the Ninth Classic fleet. Skirts are part of what makes the concept work so well and makes the album so much fun. It starts with \"Home Room\", in which the boys enter the school amidst some sort of chaos, and the old song \"PTA's Case\" plays the school theme well, and a contagious The school system is mocked with a legendary product along the course. \"To Much on My Mind\" allows MCs to express their teenage life problems, with a horny fork. \"What is Pinocchio's theory?\" Crazy and funny, Charlie Brown anchored. Despite its usual fun, \"when you think it's safe.\" Public awareness shows that one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one were the best MCs. After the \"Lunch Room\" tour is the incredible \"Sound of the Zackers\", a disturbing song with many guests. \"Sob's Story\" is beautiful, and \"Fat Fat\" is a funny song in which Bosta happily talks about strong women. I like \"Transformers\", and \"Afterschool\" LONS is asking for a role model for \"Show Me a Hero\". \"Planes, trains and cars\" are contagious and fast, as is the \"international zone coaster\". The explanatory talk was preceded by Busta's beautiful song \"My Dingling\", \"Teachers, Don't Teach Us Nonsense.\" The album \"Where Do We Get From Here?\" Closes with The success of Basta Rhymes can be achieved later, in my opinion it is a great success. The \"future without the past\" is amazing. It's incredibly funny, musical fun and as much fun as the best ship shop. Fans of A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and Wu-Tang's brand Nubian should take it without thinking, and they will see that LONS is a different and interesting group like no other. This is a record that has never been accepted but is a must for any shipping fan.","overall":5,"summary":"Criminally slept-on...a fantastic classic","unixReviewTime":1167609600,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2007"}

I cannot truly cite a single reason why, but the way this album unfolded and the music it contains did it. Listen to the sound samples. Aside from Gershwin's masterpiece on track two these are all from Mingus' fertile mind. Of course having Jackie McLean's alto sax against J. R. Monterose's tenor sax may have something to do with my affinity for this album. McLean in particular is one of my favourite alto saxophonists, so that is probably a factor. I am also a fan of Mal Waldron's earlier work and this playing on this album - along with Mingus on bass and Willie Jones on drums make for a solid rhythm section. I will confess that I would have preferred Dannie Richmond on drums, but the would not join Mingus for another year. That is no discredit to Jones' playing which is excellent as much as it is my admiration for how Mingus and Richmond interacted on all subsequent performances. This album was recorded for Atlantic in their NYC studios on January thirty, one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six. Even though this album contains only four tracks it still clocks in a little short of thirty-seven minutes, which is about average for an album recorded and released in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six. More importantly it has stood the test of time. The music is as compelling today as it was in fifty-six, and for folks unfamiliar with Mingus' work and are just discovering him I am sure it's just as new because there is a lot happening musically on every track. I learn something new each time I listen. A perfect companion to this is Mingus' follow-on album from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven titledThe Clown. It marks Dannie Richmond's first appearance of many to come on a Mingus album, but it also takes the music on this one and extends it.

I can\u2019t quote a reason, but the way it happens is the album and the music it contains. Listen to sound samples. With the exception of Gershwin's part in Track two, all of this comes from Mingus' rich mind. Of course, Jackie McLean's alto saxophone and J's saxophone. R. Monterose tenor may be associated with my love for this album. McLean in particular is one of my favourite alto players, so this might be a thing. I\u2019m a fan of Mal Waldron\u2019s early works, and this performance on this album made a strong rhythm with Mingus on bass and Willie Jones on drums. I agree that I prefer Dannie Richmond to play the drums, but they will not join Mingus for another year.

The album was recorded in the Atlantic at their New York studio on January thirty, one thousand, and nine hundred and fifty-sixth. Although the album contains only four songs, its duration is limited, only thirty-seven minutes, about the average level of the album recorded and released in one, nine hundred and fifty-six minutes. More importantly, it has withstood the test of time. Today's music is as exciting as it was fifty-six years ago. For those unfamiliar with Mingus' work and have just discovered him, I believe it is the same novel, because there are so many things happening in music in each song. Every time I listen to it, I learn something new. The perfect match with this one, nine hundred and fifty-seven album \u201cThe Clown\u201d released by Mingus.

Certainly Jackie McLane's reverse sex is the opposite of JK Tanner's sex. R. Monterose may be related to my affiliation with this album. MacLann in particular is one of my favourite Alto Sexo fonts, so that's probably a factor. And I'm a fan of Mall Waldron's previous work and the drama on this album - Mangus on the bass and Willie Jones playing the drums. I will admit that I would have chosen Danny Richmond from the drum, but the would not have joined Mangs any other year. It's not a shame for Jones to play, which is great because it compliments me on how Mangs and Richmond have played in all of the following games. The album was recorded by Atlantic on January thirty at their NYC studios, One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Fifty-six. Although this album contains only four songs in a short span of thirty-seven minutes, which is an average of one recorded album released by one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six.

Phil Collins got this start behind the drum kit of the progressive rock band Genesis. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five lead singer Peter Gabriel left the band for a solo career and eventually Collins got the front man gig. From that time on Collins grew as a singer and gifted composer. As a song writer Collins has a great talent for expressing this dinner emotions quite clearly and without unnecessary flourishes- and Face Value more than any other project the cd (either solo for with Genesis) seems to express a very personal statement with a wide spectrum of subjects and musical styles. Mixing between ballads and rhythmic anthems Collins shows all the sides of the man- this loves, fears, frustrations and joys. With the ballads the has sometimes walked a pretty thin line between syrupy sentiment and deep tenderness; later in this career the totally surrendered to the syrupy side. But on Face Value songs like This Must Be Love and If Leaving Me Is Easy show a genuine and mature emotion that shows a gutsy honesty. (In my opinion personal ballads like these are very hard to express because it usually comes off as phone sentimentality, emotionally manipulative for sappy and shallow.)Then you have the more gritty songs like the atmospheric In The Air Tonight (which still sounds fresh to me even though I've heard it hundreds of times) and The Roof is Leaking \"trilogy\" that starts with an eerie isolated sound and culminates in a joyous horn and rhythm experience. Also I Missed Again is a great pop song. His cover of The Beatles' Tomorrow Never Knows seems a bit of an odd choice for him, but the pulls it off quite nicely and sums the tune and the album up with a distant sounding Somewhere Over The Rainbow; very fitting. Overall I think Face Value is one of those great records that came out when there was an extremely high level of creativity going on around the music biz so in the history books it does't necessarily shout out for recognition. Phil Collins and Genesis were one of the most popular bands in the world at that time and Face Value showed why. Although today it appears a bit pass\u00e9 for some to admit that they like Phil Collins one can't deny this amazing talent for the contributions the made through this music.","overall":5,"summary":"Superb Blend Of Phil Collins 1981","unixReviewTime":1111276800,"reviewTime":"03 20, 2005"}

It would have been easy to keep churning out their unique blend of hard rock and progressive rock year after year and milking it for all it was worth, but Rush has always been about trying new things and doing the unexpected. As a result, they have produced quite a few more great albums since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. \"Grace Under Pressure,\" \"Power Windows,\" \"Roll the Bones\" and, lastly, \"Counterparts,\" my choice for best Rush album of the last twenty-five years. On the surface, it is just a good old hard rock album, but it really is much more than that. The lyrics are some of the best Neil Peart has never penned. That is a bold statement conserving the lyrical jewels the has composed over the past thirty plus years, but I find the jones on this record to be of the highest quality. \"Cold Fire\" and \"Everyday Glory\" are shining examples and are two of my favourite Rush songs, lyrically and musically. The production is tremendous. The previous two albums, \"Presto\" and \"Roll the Bones,\" suffered a bit from the polite sound of producer Rupert Hine, but Peter Collins took the reigns on this one and the result was a cd that sounds as good as any other Rush album. I have never heard Alex Lifeson's guitar have this much bite before. Neil Peart's drums sound dynamic and crisp. And to say Geddy Lee's bass has major punch to it on this record would be an understatement. One of the strongest elements on this cd are Geddy Lee's vocals. They have never sounded better. Granted, they are a far cry from this shriek-happy days of the seventy's, but the has matured into a very good singer and this is this finest work to date. Check out the verses to \"Nobody's Hero,\" for example. And it goes without saying that none of this would matter without having good songs and \"Counterparts\" is loaded with them. In fact, every song is at least very good, even the soft-maligned \"The Speed of Love.\" My personal favourites are \"Double Agent,\" \"Everyday Glory,\" \"Cold Fire\" and \"Leave That Thing Alone.\" However, ask twenty different Rush fans what their favourites are and you will get many different answers, which is the mark of a good album. Most of the songs are someone's favourite instead of being a disc with three for four great songs and a bunch of throwaways. When it is all said and done, this is probably the Rush cd I listen to the most. It is still sounds as good as the day I bought it back in November one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three.","overall":5,"summary":"Rush's best post-Moving Pictures cd","unixReviewTime":1139875200,"reviewTime":"02 14, 2006"}

Year after year, they continue to design their own unique mix of hard rock and savant-garde rock and do their best. It's easy, but Rush is always committed to trying new things and doing the unexpected. As a result, they have produced many major albums since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. \"Grace Under Pressure\", \"Power Windows\", \"Roll the Bones\" and finally \"Counterparts\", I chose Rush's best album twenty-five years ago. At the top, it\u2019s just a pretty old hard rock, but it\u2019s actually more than that. The songs are some of the most beautiful songs never written by Neil Pilt. This is a bold report that focuses on lyrical jewelry created over the past thirty years, but I have found Jones on this record to be of the highest quality. \u201cCold Fire\u201d and \u201cDaily Glory\u201d are bright examples, two of my favourite Rush songs, whether they are songs for musical. The results are huge. The first two albums \"Presto\" and \"Roll the Bones\" were touched by producer Rupert Hine's masterful voice, but Peter Collins controlled the album, and the result was a CD that sounded like another Rush. I have never heard of Alex Lifeson's powerful guitar before. Neil Peart's drums are vibrant and crisp. And to say that Geddy Lee's bass has a significant impact on this record is an understatement. One of the most powerful elements of this CD is Geddy Lee's singing. They never sound better. It is true that they are far away from the happy days of the seventys, but they have grown up to be a good singer, the best job so far. For example, look at the verse \"No One Is a Hero.\" It is clear that if there is no good song, these things are not important, and the \"partner\" is full of them. After all, at least all the songs are very good, even with a \"little love\". My favourites are \"Two Agent\", \"Daily Glory\", \"Cold Fire\" and \"Leave It At All\". However, ask twenty different Rush fans what they like best and you will get many different answers. This is a sign of a good record. Most songs are a personal favourite, not a CD containing three, four good songs and a group of songs at the same time. All in all, this is the best Rush cd I've never heard. It still feels as good as the one I bought in November one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine.","overall":5,"summary":"Rush's best post-Moving Pictures cd","unixReviewTime":1139875200,"reviewTime":"02 14, 2006"}

It is majestic in it's simplicity. \"Pretty Good Year\" serves as the perfect opening track to a pretty great album. It begins tranquilly, with an exquisite strings arrangement backing Tori's piano playing and beautiful voice. However the song soon stumbles into a schizophrenic change to minor key where she moans with the sort of angst reminiscent of an alternative rock tune straight from Alanis's \"Jagged Little Pill.\" The next track is the classic single, God. It has sort of a jazzy feel to it with edgy screeching guitars (which get slightly irritating) in the background. This song is good mostly for the clever lyrics. \"God sometimes you just don't come through. Do you need a women to look after you?\" Bells for Her is musically quite simple (just Tori's vocals and some sort of an instrument that sounds like chiming bells) yet haunting. One of my favourites on the record is another catchy single, \"past the Mission,\" which sounds like a mellow, upbeat rock lullaby. \"Baker Baker\" is a song about a break up based upon the metaphor of a bakery. \"Baker, baker can you explain if truly this heart was made of icing?\" Preceding that is the whimsically ethereal, \"The Wrong Band\" that kind of sounds reminiscent of the music you'd hear at a carnival. Then there's \"The Waitress,\" one of Tori's experiments with industrial rock. The lyrics are ironic and somewhat comical, especially when she screams, \"I believe in peace, bitch!\" at the chorus. \"Cornflake Girl\" is one of Tori's most popular singles. It has an almost country twang to it with guitars and mandolins complementing the resonant piano playing. In my opinion, \"Icicle\" is one of the strongest songs off the record. It begins with an intriguing modern piano solo (with lots of dissonance) and continues with Tori's soaring soprano vocals. Cloud on my tongue is another nice piano ballad. Then behold. there comes the funky Space Dog. This song is lots of fun, with some great percussion, lot's of key changes, and some hilariously weird lyrics. Lyrics like \"Lemon Pie, the's coming through your commander still Space dog lines secure, space dog,\" remind me of some other riculous lines from a later album \"Boys for Pele.\" The last song, \"Yes Anastacia\" is an exhilarating nine-minute orchestra epic, drawing the album to a suitably dramatic close. I'd recommend this CD to any fan of quirky singer song-writers and certainly believe it is one of Tori Amos's strongest efforts.

Its grandeur is its simplicity. \"Happy New Year\" is an open song for the opening of a beautiful album. It starts in a quiet way, with a string arrangement that supports Tori's piano performance and a beautiful sound. However, the song quickly turned into a small schizophrenia, and she sighed anxiously, reminiscent of Alanis' other \"Jagged Little Pills\". The next song is an old song called \"God\". It has a jazzy feel, and a sharp guitar in the background (a little sweet). This song is mainly because of the clever lyrics. \"God sometimes does not pass. Do you want a woman to take care of you?\" One of my favourite records is another unpopular thing, \u201cMission Forward\u201d, which sounds like a roundabout and hopeful. \"Baker Baker\" is a song about breaking the baker's metaphor. \"Baker, Baker, can you explain that this heart is really made of icing?\" Before that, it was whimsical and ethereal, and the \"wrong group\" sounded reminiscent of the music you heard at the carnival. Then there\u2019s the \u201cwaitress\u201d, one of Torrey\u2019s temptations and a business stone. The words are funny and humorous, especially when the cries out: \"I believe in peace, bitch!\" in the choir. \"Nachos Girl\" is one of Torrey's most popular songs. It tastes almost rustic, and the guitar and mandolin go hand in hand with the sound of the piano sound. In my opinion, \"Icicle\" is one of the most powerful songs. It starts with one of the most interesting modern piano (with many exposures) and continues with Tori's singing on the flying soprano. The cloud on my tongue is another beautiful piano. Then look. Here comes a fashionable local dog. This song is very interesting, with beautiful songs, many great changes, and other funny songs. Songs like \"Lemon Pie, the boss from you are still safe in the line dog post, space dog\" reminded me of some silly lines in the latest album \"Boys for Pele\". The final song \"Yes Anastacia\" is a thrilling nine-minute orchestra, which will be a wonderful ending to the album. I would recommend this CD to fans of all the unusual musicians, songwriters, and I believe it is one of Tori Amos\u2019s efforts.

Notable include Test for Echo, Drive, and Half the World Singles. fourteen thousand, three hundred and eighty-six Playing guitar and roaring bass lines and drums. This is a test for Echo. Writing songs there is just like the last two albums, which have a lot of good stuff on the front of the disc. There are some top songs as well as some common (filling) things. Here are the songs: Test for Echo - Although Rush stepped forward with this heavy voice, Test for Echo took him back with a terrifying sound. The riff proved by Alex is cool. The words are strong. Overall a very beautiful song. I love it. Ongoing - Probably one of my favourite songs on the album. The driver is exactly what the driver is. This song plays straight and fast and strong until it enters your soul. Gaddy's voice is smooth. Part of the world - another cool song. Part of the land is affected. Listen to it over and over again and you'll love it. He pulls a little. The color of authenticity - cum. Music is not one of my favourites, but complex music. This song is trying harder than it should be. There is something wrong with that. Time and Movement - Is It a Metallica Run? The opening head is almost identical to the Bangers property. Highlighting its virtues, the song exemplifies the efforts of the sun and the moon, but stumbles upon its beautiful structure. Totem - I think this song reminds me a lot about Home on the Strange on Gaddy's solo album. We definitely have one of the brightest moments in this whole album. Very nice words Age of dogs - again. Is this a megalith rush? The whole wraps, wraps, breaks the shield. Iron Then continue to use dogs and cats and those coming from the Galapagos. Rush never compared this words to music in such a negative way. This song has very little meaning in this aspect. Unfortunately - was the comparison difficult? New! It lives This sounds too heavy. The lyrics of this song are harsh, but the music takes you into the dark. Milana - a great soundtrack. I would love to see Alex and Gaddy do this live. You did very well One of the highlights is in the Test for Echo. Lambo - Gaddy plays the bass and Alex starts to move. This is a promising genre of music from Get Go. Rush jamming has never been a bad thing. Is it really metal? Yes. They cry a little in the back, but it's a jam. Killer. Carve Away The Stone - Good sex on a heavy album. It's easier than many other songs. This is a gift for those of you who have reached the last song of the album. There is nothing better for better. Go straight ahead C + rush. Overall, this album gains the popularity of Counterparts and makes it even bigger. You can see that all those years when Alex was under pressure are now over. Guitar and bass and drums. This is a test for Echo. Some of the best songs around iTunes are key. Rush will take a long break before hitting the studio again. Sing!","overall":5,"summary":"The best Rush album I've heard so far.","unixReviewTime":1151798400,"reviewTime":"07 2, 2006"}

Highlights include the test slogans Echo, Driven, and Half World. <c Driving guitar and thunder bus lines and drums. That was the Echo Test. The songwriting is similar to the last two albums with most of the good stuff sticking to the front use of the plate. There are great songs there and common stuff (filler). The songs are: Experiment Echo - As Rush pushes up their heavy vocals, Experiment Echo returns with a surprising sound. Rifle Alex\u2019s offer is cool. Words are narrow In general, a good song. I found Waday - Probably one of my favourite songs at the door. Driving is real, driving. This song shakes straight and fast until you get yourself. Ghedi's voice was equal. Half the world - another cool song. Half the world is infected. Listen half a dozen times. He pulls the smallest. Correct Color - Um. The song is not one of my favourites, but the music is complex. This song is as hard as it should be. Something is missing. Time and Motion - Is it a rush at Metallica. The opening is very close to the head. Based on its characteristics, this song makes the effort between the Sun and the Moon, but it revolves around its intriguing structure. Totem - I think this song often reminds me of The Strange House on Geddy\u2019s solo album. It was definitely one of the brightest moments of this entire album. The words are so beautiful. Dog Years - Again. Rushkan a Megadeth baa? The discovery was trembling, trembling, devastating. One? It then continues to be used by dogs and bites and Galapagos tourists. Ever Rush to not deserve her words of music never bad. This song has very little meaning in that regard. BadVirtuality - Heavy parties? Naw! This is serious. It looks very serious. This song has catchy lyrics, but the music captivates you in the dark. Resistance - a great acoustic song. I love watching Alex and Geddy do it live. Very well made. One of the best places on the Echo Test. Limbo - Geddy is playing bus, and Alexna starts to shiver. It\u2019s a very promising melody. Emergency jams are never a bad thing. Tool really. Yes. They drank a little from behind, but it was sweet. The kill. Carve Away The Stone - Good sex up to heavy albums. Easier than most other songs. It\u2019s a gift for you to actually make the last song of the album. Nothing is great and noble. Just go straight to Rush. C + urgency Overall, this album takes the thunder created by Prevention and makes it very high. You could tell it\u2019s over all the years Alex underlined. Guitars and Buses and Drums. That was the Echo Test. Some of the biggest songs surrounded by some real iTunes. Rush takes a long break before you go to the studio again.

The size of this version is amazing, and it really shows the audience what it was like then, and Steve Nix's entire library. And it indicates a certain level of recording, but it is not enough to disrupt the overall quality of the CD. Taking part in the negative reception Tusk received from many fans and critics, Mack decided to release a live album of successful films. The latter reminds the audience why they were so successful in the first place. Eighteen of the eighteen double albums came from One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Seventy-Five Flatwood Mac and One Thousand, Ninety-seven Rumors, \"Sarah,\" \"Over and Over,\" and \"Not That Funny.\" One thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven tusks represent the lower part. Still, there are a few surprises, including the incredible performance of Peter Green's amazing cover \"Oh Well\" and \"Don't Let Me Go Again\", the number one star making Buckingham Nix's first unpublished album. There are also two recently composed songs that will delight the audience. Christine McVeigh is donating the beautiful ballad \"One More Night\", another beautiful, spicy song, which is great with a lot of her melting stuff on TUSK. Steve's new song \"Fireflies\" (#sexypop, #invents mainstream rock) is a hot mid-tempo rocker that most Nick fans will buy exclusively on this record - even though it was't a song. Was unmarried, and has not yet appeared on any other album.

Almost full of physical intoxication, such as \"Sarah\" and \"Over and Over\" also seem to revoke strong emotions in the live setting, with Stevie's melancholy translation of \"Landslide\" appearing particularly dynamic.

Van Halen's fifth album. By the early eighty's, even though Van Halen had remained really successful, there were problems in the group:Dav Lee Roth had become really egotistical, and as a result, problems in the band had cooked up and became a war between Roth against this fellow bandmates Eddie Van Halen,Alex Van Halen, and Michael Anthony. Van Halen had seen and done it all-they had been discovered by Gene Simmons while they were performing at a New York City club and gotten their recording contract as a result of it, and after their fourth album(\"Fair Warning\")had been released and had turned out to be hard, dark, and heavy, the guys in Van Halen were becoming quite tired-which may have been the reason that their fifth album,\"Diver Down\" had a half of original songs, two instrumentals, and half cover songs. How did the album measure up? Read on for my review of this:When Van Halen fans go look through their collection of VH cd, this tends to be their least liked CD from the Roth era. Why is that? Because of the large amount of cover songs there are on there. But what's the big deal? There may be only four Van Halen originals there that are not instrumentals(Hang 'Em High,Secrets,Little Guitars, and The Full Bag)but it's still a great album. Their cover of Roy Orbison's \"(Oh)Pretty Women\" and their cover of the Motown classic \"Dancing In The Street\" were the two songs that got the most attention off of this record, and they are both really good-Van Halen made those songs their own, and they both became classics in the library of classic Van Halen songs, even though they were cover songs. As for their cover of The Kinks' \"Where Have All The Good Times Gone\"(the opening track for this album), that song, in my opinion, was the best cover song Van Halen EVER did. It is also an excellent way to open an album. Now, let me move on to the original songs on this album. Out of the original songs,\"Hang 'Em High\" is, as mentioned at the top, an code to Clint Eastwood, and Van Halen did a great tribute to Eastwood. It reminds me of the tribute Gene Simmons did to the late silent horror factor Lon Chaney(RIP)on this self-titled one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight solo record. And \"Secrets\"-I'd give that song nineteen stars if I could. Really, it is that good. It is actually a blues song, and \"Women and Children First\" found Van Halen attempting blues, but this has one hundred percent blues. Artists like Aerosmith,Motley Crue,Slaughter,Warrant, etc.have all proven to have a bone for blues music-and Van Halen sure does(or did)have a bone for blues music. That song could have been and should have been a hit. Overall, a really good CD. Like I already said, this is probably the least liked Van Halen CD with David Lee Roth on lead vocals(the least liked Van Halen CD out of all of their CDS is the dreaded album with Gary Cherone on lead vocals)but it has proven to be quite underrated. The Van Halen\/David Lee Roth era was one of the greatest eras rock 'n roll would never see-and while this CD is not the best VH CD out there, it still is really good. And just in case You were wondering, look at Amazon's track listing for this on top-tracks one, six, seven, ten and twelve are cover itunes, tracks five and weight are instrumentals, and tracks two, three, four, nine, and eleven are original Van Halen songs with music and lyrics.","overall":4,"summary":"Really Good!!!!","unixReviewTime":1119916800,"reviewTime":"06 28, 2005"}

How does the album measure up? Read my review about it: When Van Halen fans look at their VH cd collection, it seems like it was their favourite CD during the Roth era. Why? Because there are a lot of cover songs there. But what's the big deal? There may have been four original Van Halen non -instrumentals (Hang \u2018Em High, Secrets, Little Guitar, and Full Bag) but it\u2019s still a good album. Their Roy Orbison cover '' (Oh) Beautiful Women '' and their Motown classic '' Dancing In The Street '' are the two songs that got the most attention on this record, and both are really great - Van Halen made those songs themselves, and they both worked well in Van Halen\u2019s standard music library, even though they were covered songs. Like Kinks \u2019cover of\u201c Where All the Good Time Goes \u201d(the opening track of this album), that song, I think, is the best song Van Halen has never done. It is also a great way to open a door. Now, let\u2019s move on to the original songs of this album. The original song, \u201cHang\u2018 Em High \u201dwas, as mentioned above, by Clint Eastwood, Van Halen\u2019s great tribute to Eastwood.

Artists like Aerosmith, Motley Crue, Gowrac, Warrant, etc. They all claim to have bones in blues music-and Van Halen certainly has (or produced) bones for blues music. That song could and should have been a hit. Overall, a very good CD. As I said before, it\u2019s probably the youngest Van Halen CD David Lee Roth leading the voices (the youngest Van Halen CD of all their CDs is Gary\u2019s dreaded door. Cherone on the vocals lead) but it\u2019s proven they are greatly appreciated. The Van Halen \/ David Lee Roth era is one of the best recordings I\u2019ve seen - and this CD in\u2019t the best VH CD, but it\u2019s still beautiful.

And what an album it is. After one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four's questionable processor DIVER DOWN, not only cd Eddie Van Halen prove this band could write great pop-metal, the showed beyond any doubt Van Halen had some of the best rock the one thousand, nine hundred and heights had to offer. In many ways, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of the most important for the band from a psychological perspective. Van Halen's first three albums were very successful. Eddie went into a dark era of this life, which lead to the creation of FAIR WARNING, one of the dirtiest, mean-spirited rock albums never recorded. Due to the chilly reception this disc got, Roth wanted DIVER DOWN to be more sunny and poppy to make up for the lacking sales of FAIR WARNING. Roth pressured the band to record a bunch of cover songs, with only a few original songs. This resulted in DIVER DOWN, easily the most uneven and weakest of the six Roth albums. At Eddie's disgust, the decided the'd rather make it with this own material than rely on other songwriters, and so took control for DIVER DOWN'S follow up. The Van Halen brothers were so dissatisfied with DIVER DOWN that Eddie founded this own studio, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, and recorded the band's music on this own terms. While this direction for artistic integrity would later lead to the career-killing VAN HALEN III, on one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, Eddie's decision to take control of the band's future paid off in spades. The biggest change to the music from the previous five LPs was the incorporation of keyboards, a decision David Lee Roth was not entirely happy with. Eddie is a classically trained pianist, and had been wanting to bring them in for some time. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is notable for really being among the first pop-metal albums to use synthesizers, which in the ensuing years would be widely employed by any number of bands in the pop-metal genre. Ironically enough, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, the band's next album and first with Sammy Hagar, is a natural extension of the direction Eddie began there. One of the album's biggest songs, \"Jump\", is built around keyboards rather than guitar. The songs of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four are some of the best, shiniest, and just plain fun pop metal around. The title cut is a short one minute keyboard instrumental.\"Panama\" is one of VH's best hard rock songs, and the only song about cars the band has.\"Jump\", the aforementioned song, is one of their most famous songs, and one of the biggest hits of the early one thousand, nine hundred and heights.\"I'll Wait\", another synth song, was a top ten hit about Roth falling in love with a model in magazines and having to deal with that heart break (think The Who's \"Pictures of Lily\", only with less mast involved). Most famous people have to deal with obsessive-compulsive stalkers such as this, I suppose. Lot more scary in real life than in the song.\"Drop Dead Legs\" is another typical hot mama VH song, but non the worst for the wear for common lyrical preoccupation for the boys (read: sex). Has kind of a slow rock tempo that's just dripping with raging . . . hormones and testosterone.\"Hot For Teacher\", with its amazing drum work and blistering guitar, was also a huge hit with an equally famous video. This was years before a lot of the teacher-sex scandals began breaking out all over the US. Don't know what school the boys in the video went too, but my teachers sure as hell did't look like that. That leaves the last two songs. While the whole party atmosphere that so characterizes Van Halen is maintained through the album, there's trouble in paradise. \"Girl Gone Bad\" is about exactly what it says it is. \"House of Pain\" is another troubled relationship, with Roth declaring the'd make it where this woman could never lead this house of spain. [\"House of Pain\" has Roth dumping this girl cause she's a little bit too much into S&M; for this tastes.] This is actually one of Van Halen's oldest songs, written before they got a record deal and resurrected at Alex Van Halen's insistence years after its initial composition. Much like the send of the album, no matter how great the party there's always trouble somewhere. After the band released one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, there was trouble in paradise between the brothers and their gonzo frontman, and David Lee Roth split in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five to forge a solo career. Van Halen hired Sammy Hagar and issued the first Van Hagar album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, and so began the never resolved Hagar\/Roth debate. Ultimately, the whole Roth\/Hagar debate is neither there nor there in regards to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. Had Van Halen called it quits after this record, they would still be remembered as a great rock and roll band, if a little preoccupied with sex and the frat boy image. Without a doubt, this, along with their debut, is easily the pinnacle of their achievements with Roth as front man. Both records are essential staples in any rock fan's collection.

(Sound ) Blooming in horizon) The first list is by Van Halen. What a wonderful record. After the troublesome processor of one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-four DIVER DOWN, Eddie Van Halen cd not show that the team could write a large metal, but there is no doubt that Van Halen has the best stone, nine hundred and nine thousand and the height had to be provided. In many ways, from a psychological point of view, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of the most important in the band. Van Halen's first three albums were very successful. Eddie entered this dark period of life, which led to the creation of the FAIR warning, one of the dirtiest and most infamous albums on the album. Due to the cold acceptance of this record, Roth hopes that DIVER DOWN will have the sun and poppy to make up for the black of FAIR WARNING sales. Roth forced the group to record a group of cover songs, in which a few of the previous songs. This led to DIVER DOWN, which may be the most uneven and weakest of Roth's six albums. Annoyed by Eddie, the decided to use this own resources instead of relying on other songwriters, so the managed the next steps of DIVER DOWN. Van Halen's brothers were so dissatisfied with DIVER DOWN that Eddie founded this own studio, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, and recorded the band's music in this own way. Although this side of perfect part later led to the career of VAN HALEN III, in one thousand and nine hundred and eighty-four, Eddie's decision to control the team's future paid off. Compared to the first five LPs, the biggest change in music is keyboard design. David Lee Roth is not entirely satisfied with this. Eddie is a trained pianist and wanted to introduce them for a while. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four it was one of the first famous metal plates to use synthesizer. In the years that followed, it was widely used by many famous types of metal. Surprisingly, the band's next album \"five thousand\", \"one hundred and fifty Album\" and Sammy Hagar's first album is a natural extension of how Eddie got started. One of the great songs on the album, \"Jump\", is built around the keyboard instead of the guitar. The songs one thousand and nine hundred and eighty-four are some of the most beautiful, bright, simple and interesting instruments. The title clip is a one-minute keyboard tool. \"Panama\" is one of the best VH rock songs and the band's only song about cars. The above-mentioned song \"Jump\" is one of their most famous songs, and it is one of the most popular songs of the first days of the first thousand, nine hundred and Supreme. Another synthesizer song \"I'll Wait For You\" is about the top ten songs about Rose's resurrection in magazine models and has to deal with a broken heart (think who's the \"picture of lilies\" involving the little masters). I think a lot of celebrities have to deal with obsessive-compulsive stalkers like this. It's more terrifying in real life than the songs. \"Drop Your Legs\" is one of VH's hottest from songs, but it's not the best thing for boys to wear (read: sex). There is a slow, cloud rock rhythm. Hormones and testosterone. \"It's hot on the teacher\", with its amazing drum and interesting guitar, is also popular in the same popular video. This was just a few years before the sexual harassment of teachers began to spread throughout the United States. I don\u2019t know which school the boys in the video went to, but my teachers are not like that for sure. The last two songs are left. Although the spirit of Van Halen's band is maintained by the album, there are problems in heaven. \"The Girl Has Gone Bad\" is what it says. \"House of Grief\" is another troubled relationship, and Rose announced that the woman would never be table to lead this Spanish house. [\"House of Grief\" caused Rose to dump the girl because she was a slave to S&M;] Like the delivery of the disc, no matter how big the party, there is something wrong. After the group released one, nine hundred and eighty-four copies, there was a crisis in heaven between the brothers and their lead singer Gonzo. Van Halen hired Sami Hagar and released Van Hagar's debut album from nine hundred and eighty-six to one thousand. Since then, the Chagall \/ Ross dispute has not been resolved. Finally, the entire Ross \/ Hagar debate about one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four did not materialize for take place. If Van Halen had announced this resignation after the record, if they had focused on gender and the image of the fraternal boys, they would always be remembered as a great rock band. There is no doubt that, with their beginnings, they can be the key to their success with Rose as a lead singer. These two records are a must have for any rock collection. As for anything better, it\u2019s hard to say - VAN HALEN is one of the best and most comprehensive releases in any team. Their voices are particulate quickly and have amazing guitars, which will prove to be a major influence, beyond the boundaries of the famous metal bands.

After one thousand weight hundred and eighty-four divers, Eddie Van Helen not only proved that the band could write beautiful pop metal, of course Van Helen had a thousand pounds of rock and nine hundred on the show. And to give height. In many ways, the one thousand, eighty-four band is one of the most important things from a psychological point of view. Van Helen's first three albums were very successful. Eddie entered a dark period of this life, which led to the creation of FAIR WARNING, one of the dirtiest, most infamous rock albums never recorded. Thanks to the disc's cool reception, Ruth wanted Diver Down to be very sunny and poppy so that the sale of unfair warnings could be stopped. Ruth pressured the band to record several cover songs with the first few. This led to DIVER DOWN, which is not easily matched by Ruth's six albums. To Eddie's annoyance, the deed it was better to do it himself than to rely on other songwriters, so the took control of Diver Downs. The Van Helen brothers were so dissatisfied with DIVER DOWN that Eddie set up this own studio in five thousand, one hundred and fifty and thus recorded the band's music. Although this direction of technical integrity would lead to the demise of VAN HALEN III, in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, tribute was paid to Eddie's decision to control the group's future. The biggest change in music since the last five LPs was the installation of keyboards, a decision that David Lee Roth was not entirely happy with. Eddie is a highly trained pianist, and the has always wanted to bring them in for a long time. One thousand nine hundred and eighty-four are noteworthy for joining the first pop metal albums using synthesizers, which will be widely used by any band of the genre of pop metal in later years. Ironically, Five Thousand, One Hundred and Fifty, the band's next album, and for the first time by Sammy Hager, the natural expansion of Eddie's direction began there. One of the biggest songs on the album, \"Jump\" is made with a keyboard instead of a guitar. One thousand nine hundred and eighty-four songs is one of the best, brightest and most beautiful music. The title kit is a one minute short keyboard. \"Panama\" is one of the best VH rock songs, and the band has the only song about cars. And one of the most successful films of all time. At the beginning of the thousand years, nine hundred and long. (Think about who the \"pictures of Lily\" are, with only subwoofers). I think a lot of celebrities have to deal with an oppressive striker like them. It's still scarier than singing in real life. \"Drop Dead Legs\" is another of VH's mother's most popular songs, but not the worst of the boys' usual troubles (read: sex). It has a kind of slow rock that just drips with danger. . . Hormones and testosterone. \"Hot for Teacher\", with its amazing work of playing drums and guitar, is also known for its equally popular video. That was many years ago when many teacher and male scandals broke out across the United States. I don't know which school the boys in the video went to, but my teachers believe hell did't look like that. It skips the last two songs. While every group event featuring Van Helen is featured on the album, there is an issue in Heaven. \"Girl Gone Bad\" is about what it says. \"House of Pain\" is another disturbing relationship, Ruth announced that the will do it when the woman will not lead this Spanish home. [\"House of Pain\" rejects Ruth because she has S&M. About this will.] It is one of Van Helen's oldest songs, written before the recording agreement was reached, and was revived many years after its original composition at the insistence of Alex Van Helen. Was Like the album post, no matter how good the party is, there are always problems somewhere. After the group's one, nine hundred and eighty-four was released, a crisis erupted in heaven between the brothers and their chief of staff, and David Lee Roth split this part-time job at one, nine hundred and eighty-five. . Van Helen hired Sammy Hager and released Van Hager's debut album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, sparking an unresolved Hager \/ Ruth debate. Finally, the whole Roth \/ Hagar argument does not exist and there are about one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. If Van Helen wanted to break that record, they would still be remembered as a big rock and roll band, if they had sex and a picture of a frat boy. Undoubtedly, this is the culmination of this success with Ruth as a leading man, with this debut. Both of these records are essential pillars in any collection of rock fans. Hard to say - Van Helen is one of the best debuts, released entirely by any team. His voice was quickly understood and the had an amazing guitar that could make a huge impact in addition to a wide range of pop metal bands.

Madonna keeps pushing that creative mind of hers into overdrive, this time with a funky mix of R&B, ship-hop, pop and even techno. She's really done it all when you hear this album. It's her artistic vision in many different shades. The album wanders interestingly into new territories that I'm sure Madonna never thought she would get into. The album starts off with the autobiographical account of fame \"Survival\". It's a very strong track that's brilliantly upbeat dance with a funky twist. \"Secret\" is one of her best singles never. A new direction altogether with blues placed guitars and her most captivating singing never. She hooks you in with her voice. Smooth production of urban hooks combined with near stripey lightness make songs like \"Inse Of Me\", \"Forbidden Love\" and \"Sanctuary\" very interesting. Each has a distinctive style that keeps the record following. The return to the dance floor is found on the disco grooves of \"Don't Stop\". Also worth note are her complicated yet brilliant singles \"Bedtime Story\" and \"Human Nature\". \"Bedtime Story\" is a Bjork co-penned number that really floats slightly from deep techno to dance pop. Madonna's sensitive voice really makes it operate well. \"Human Nature\" is ship choppy trip with Madonna battling the censors and critics armed with danger, honesty and cool jazzy production. The whole album wraps up with the beautiful ballad \"Take A Bow\". With the help of Babyface, Madonna makes another heartbreaking ballad with flush strings and a great combination of the two superstar's vocals. That's something that just can't be bought. Another hugely diverse collection from the woman that changed the face of pop. I think it's easy to say that it was the help of the ship producers (Dallas Austin, Nelle Hooper, and the one's mentioned), but it's Madonna's artistic vision that makes the album flow so greatly while other pop albums with various producers sound clunky and mixed. It's a romantic mix of tragedy and hope all in one that manages to all fit together perfectly.

Madonna always pushes her way of thinking fast, while mixing R&B, ship shop, pop and electronic music. When you heard this album, you cd everything. This is this artistic vision in many different tones. This album is entering a new category and I'm sure Madonna did't think she could get into an interesting way. The album began with the well-known autobiography \"Survival\". This is a strong song, and its dance is very exciting, fashionable. \"Secret\" is one of the best songs the has never had. The new direction with the Blues setting the guitar and this sweet singing voice never came to an send. He will draw with this voice. The smooth production of urban links paired with light almost flashes makes \u201cInside Me\u201d, \u201cUnrequited Love\u201d, \u201cHoly\u201d and other very interesting songs.

It is also worth mentioning that this hard and amazing songs \"Bedtime Story\" and \"Humanity\". \"Sleep Story\" is a figure created by Bjork, and it changes slightly from deep electronic music to pop dance music. Madonna's weak voice makes her work better. \u201cPersonality\u201d is a chaotic journey in which Madonna struggles with censors and critics for dangerous, honest and cool jazz activities. The entire album ended with a beautiful folk song \"Take a Bow\". With the help of Babyface, Madonna created another painful ballad, with a flat string and combined singing of two stars. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t buy it. Another series of women has changed the face of popular music. I think it\u2019s easy to say that the help of shipbuilders (Dallas Austin, Nell Hopper and the people mentioned above), but it\u2019s Madonna\u2019s artistic idea that makes the album go so fast, and some are made by different producers.

Wishbone Ash started in blues based songs but had a penchant for English folk and jazz. By this third album they had a loyal following that appreciated their ability to boogie but to be table to play pretty songs. To Wishbone Ash's credit much of this had to do with their stellar playing which was more based in minor key work than traditional blues. Django Reinhart was more of an influence than say Eric Clapton. On Argus the boys made their progressive album. Several songs were in the six minute plus range and featured multi sectioned arrangements. In particular Time Was, Sometime World, Throw Down The Sword and Warrior brought a mixture of progressive rock and some complex and engaging harmonized guitar work. Besides this guitarists Andy Powell and Ted Turner had unique qualities that made them easy to identify but were capable of working together in a way that made it hard to figure out who was playing what. That might seem a guitar geek's kind of compliment but really it had more to do with both guitarists desire to keep their work musical and within the framework of the song which was not always typical of seventy's guitar based music. Not to say there karen't some great solos, there are. They were so compelling that as a young guitar player I spent a great deal of time figuring out what they did because it was so unusual. A lot of other players must have done the same as the harmonies, phrasing and solo styles in many hard rock bands seem to have adopted this sophisticated style of playing. Beyond the skill of the guitarists bassist Martin Turner played what can be described as lead bass, often letting the guitar duo hold the rhythm together with drummer Steve Upton (who had a flair for understated jazz oriented playing). The singing is excellent with Martin Turner doing most of the lead vocals along with Powell and Ted Turner on harmonies. To a minor degree there are moments where the songs may seem dated in spots. This is more to the overplay of many of the ideas heard on this record exploited by bands of lesser quality. Critics were often divided about Wishbone Ash probably because they varied styles on each album. From a historical standpoint this band was making music that influenced other bands but never got the kind of reception their followers had.

Wishbone Ash originally focused on blues songs, but has a soft spot for British music and jazz. With the third album, they have loyal fans, they appreciate their uncontrollable creativity, but they can play great songs on the table. Wishbone Ash credit is largely related to their excellent performance, which is based more on smaller works than traditional blues. Django Reinhart is more influential than Eric Clapton.

In addition, guitars Andy Powell and Ted Turner have unique features that make it easy to spot them, but they can work together in a way that makes it difficult to see who is playing. This may seem like a compliment to guitar geeks, but it is actually more closely related to the desire of both guitarists to keep their music career and song frame, which is not always based on the guitar in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. Not that there are no big solos, there are. They\u2019re forced, like a little guitar, to spend a lot of time thinking about what they did because it was weird. Many other players have to do the same thing. Many solid rock bands seem to have adopted this difficult style of play in conjunction, phrases, and styles alone. In addition to the playing skills of guitarist and bassist Martin Turner, the also played what could be described as a master bass, always allowing the guitar duo to control the rhythm with drummer Steve Upton (low-level jazz talent). Martin Turner, along with Powell and Ted Turner, worked as many of the leading singers in harmony, and the singing effect was very good. At a lower level, sometimes a song may seem old-fashioned. This is mainly due to the fact that most of the views heard in this record were used by lower standard belts. Critics often disagree with Wishbone Ash, probably because they have different approaches to each album. From a historical point of view, the music produced by this group influenced other genres, but was not well received by their fans.

Many of the other players must have done the same as matching, articulating and single patterns as many hard rock teams seem to have adopted the modern style of play. In addition to the skill bassist guitarist Martin Turner played what could be described as bass-lead, it often allowed both guitars to touch the rhythm of Steve Upton\u2019s drums (with unspecified ability to jazz). Martin Turner\u2019s performance songs are great with most of the leading voices with Powell and Ted Turner matching. To a small extent, there are chances that the songs seem to date in places. This is likely because many of the ideas heard in this record have benefited small quality groups. Critics are often divided on Wishbone Ash perhaps because they differ in different ways for each door. Historically, this group has been making music that has influenced other groups but has never been well received by their fans. It\u2019s worth knowing if you love antique rock, melodic guitar playing of historical interest. With almost five stars of effort, I wanted to give us half the stars.

Most of the tracks on this album could have been recorded yesterday and would still hold up as contemporary. His command of studio trickery was beginning to come to light, and Jimi offers material that appeals to fans of this previous LP, as well as material that shows what mastery was to yet to come. The album starts off with a bit of fun with \"EXP\" as Jimi becomes Paul Caruso, a space alien with a sense of humour. Voices are seeded up and slowed down for the interview and then the guitar becomes the spaceship for this ride as Jimi wrestles feedback out of it and pans it from channel to channel. As the feedback swirls, it pans from speaker to speaker giving the effect of a circular movement. Although a bit pedestrian now, it was very advanced for it's time. We then slide into the slippery blues of \"Up From the Skies\" with Jimi furiously was-wahing away. His lazy vocal gives this song a laid-back relaxed feeling which is quite enjoyable. Jimi then repays a visit to \"Are You Experienced?\" territory with the hard rocking \"Spanish Castle Magic\". The rhythm section gets kudos there, in a display showing their trademark tightness. Mitch Mitchell especially gives this drumkit a workout on this track. Jimi slows the tempo back down to a more relaxing stone on \"Wait Until Tomorrow\", a great story about a boy and a girl who want to run away together, escapism being a recurring theme in this album. \"Ain't No Telling\" is a one of the weaker tracks there, but still points to the future as this guitar shadows the vocals with a very jazzy stone, a technique the would utilize more on the next LP, the landmark \"Electric Ladyland\". \"Little Wing\" another ballad revisits the escapism theme again and is one Jimi's most beloved tracks. \"If six Was nine\" is the song that links Jimi's hard rock past with this experimental future. The song begins as a pounding precursor to heavy metal, and if you concentrate really hard you can smell the smoke coming from Mitch Mitchell's drum kit. Marvel along with Jimi's wails and was was, Mitch's phased and swirling snare fills and Noel Redding's solid bass thumps. Toward the send of the song it evolves into a bluesy grave up and then implodes into an ethereal song to the heavens. \"You Got Me Floating\" is a nod to the future in which Jimi singlehandly invents funk. It is an amazing song, and though very far ahead of it's time, still nods to both past and future.\"Castles Made of Sand\", another ballad again returns to escapism, and shows how gifted a lyricist Hendrix was. This is a song I often refer to show all sides of Hendrix' genius. The backwards guitar solo is amazing. \"She's So Fine\" is one of the few songs on this LP that sound dated, but it was basically Noel Redding's vehicle so it can be forgiven. \"One Rainy Wish\" is a track that sounds like something thrown together as filler, and is also a weak track, the lyrics sound like something written while on an acid trip. \"Little Miss Lover\" is a return to greatness that expands upon the funk of \"Floating\" even more hard rock feeling. Another nod to both past and future! \"Bold As Love\" is the most amazing song Jimi Hendrix never created, it is basically the first power ballad, and is just a beautiful piece of part. Listen to the majesty of Hendrix' solos, especially the return after the false ending (when Mitch Mitchell does another beautiful phased out drum fill) when Jimi does the most heart wrenching solo of this short life over the phased and flanged backing track. This song succeeds on so many levels it would take an entry as long as this whole review to describe it. It is a beautiful, grand finale to Jimi's most heartfelt album, and a testament to the man who created it.","overall":5,"summary":"Just ask the Axis","unixReviewTime":1109116800,"reviewTime":"02 23, 2005"}

The album began with the excitement of \"EXP\" because Jimmy became Paul Caruso, a stranger in a humorous setting. The voice in the interview is planted and slowed, after which the guitar becomes the crux of the journey because Jimmy gets the report from it and moves it from one channel to another. When the response is rotated, it will switch between speakers, creating the effect of circular motion. Although she is a pedestrian now, she is very advanced. Then we slipped into the slippery blue \"Up from the Sky\" and Jimi left angrily. Her lazy voice gives this song a relaxed and relaxed, happy feeling. Jimmy then went back to \"Do you have experience?\" A solid stone field \"Spanish Castle Magic\". Part of the rhythm received praise there, indicating their closeness. Mitch Mitchell used this drum kit for this song. Jim goes down and slows down \"Wait still tomorrow\" This is a wonderful story about boys and girls who want to run together. \"No Speech\" is one of the weakest ways out there, but it points to the future, because this guitar uses a jazzy stone to cover words. This technique will be used more in the next LP. Electric Ladyland \". Another ballad called\" Little Wings \"reverts to the theme of the run, and it's one of Jimmy's favourite songs. As the song goes on, as this song is sent, it turns into a melted grave, and then rises to the melody of the heavenly music. Hendrix's intellectual background. The guitar on the back is amazing. \"You're very good\" One of the few songs on this record seems to be outdated, but it's Noel Redding's \"The Rain Wish\" song is a song that sounds like a piece of music. \"Little Lover,\" the said returns to size, Increasing the feeling of a heavy stone in the fear of \"swimming\".

Age and growing older is a common theme, and proves to give Carly plenty of elbow room for her always mature and thoughtful writing. The aforementioned \"Life is Eternal\" proclaims \"Life is eternal, love is immortal, and death is only a horizon,\" giving a bright ray of hope to the fact that we have no idea what lies ahead on the other side, next life, for wherever your own personal beliefs leave you. The bittersweet \"Happy Birthday\" focuses on the importance of growing old in numbers only; as the song's subjects celebrate a birthday the preconceptions of how to live life as an adult are clearly taking more of a toll than the years themselves. That in't to say page does't bring responsibility, however, as is explored on the dark and moving \"Waiting at the Gate,\" as Carly picks up a friend\/sibling out of rehab. \"You used to set the world on fire\/dancing in the dark\/now you play solitaire in a fenced-in park,\" Carly sings, as she bravely and compassionately stands by a loved one even though this youthful indulgences were not her own. Such material is darker than your usual Carly Simon fare (both musically and lyrically), which makes them all the more striking. There's still plenty of room for the facts of love, though. \"Don't Wrap it Up\" is a sunny tune about a mature woman taking love on her own terms; \"Didn't I?\" tasks for validation amidst a romantic demise; and \"Better Not Tell Her,\" one of the strongest cuts, tasks for discretion in the best interest of her estranged lover. When Carly sings, \"If my name comes up. leave out the white nights\/the moon in your window\/the promises after,\" it's easy to recall the heroine in Simon's \"We Have No Secrets,\" from her one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five album \"No Secrets,\" who found out the hard way that honesty sometimes tells you more than you want to know. On \"Better Not Tell Her\" the shoe's on the other foot and Simon uses life experience to try to spare everyone involved; including herself apparently, as the songs last line is \"I still love you.\" This is easily one of the most mature and complex takes on modern relationships never put on a rock record. The album's only misstep is the lukewarm \"That's Not Like Him,\" a song telling of a lover's unfaithfulness. The in-denial lyrics are clever enough, but it's musically not as memorable as what Simon is capable of, and the obviously-programmed percussion is clunky. Miles ahead stylistically is \"Fisherman's Song,\" a track that takes Carly's poetic, colourful lyrics to a new height and boasts a cameo by Judy Collins. The album closes with \"We Just Got Here,\" another exploration of page; herein Simon claims that life is indeed going by too fast. As the song's subjects \"bleed the pipes and bring in the plants\" at the send of another summer, they brave themselves for autumn in a lifetime's sense. Here Simon sums up the album saying that the weather may be cold ahead but with loved jones to support you and help recall fond memories, some of the best years of your life may be yet to come.

Age and maturity are commonplace, and this proves that she gives Carly a room in which she always has a mature and thoughtful elbow.

Thankfully, it's not just a revival of popular songs sung that way - it's really different. That's the decent thing to do, and it should send there. Some songs like 'Ice' are very different, and this song is very fast on this album.

Those and one spirited live set later War were back in the same basic place they were in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. But there was a change. As occurs with most musical genres a certain level of sophistication is bound to occur. And that's what happens there to a great degree. As another reviewer pointed out War were very much a collective band where one member never dominated the spotlight, at least not for very long. It was one of the main features of funk bands during the seventy's And on this album the bands very nature becomes the source of their latest development. Here vocals take a much stronger overall priority in the music than it did before, not that instrumentation still in't at the same level. Even still it's very much people music all the way.\"Don't Let No One Get You Down\" and \"Lotus Blossom\" both start the album out with two sophisticated midtempo funky soul ballads. A similar flavor returns later in the album with \"So\". But in between there's something very interesting happening. In keeping with the bands ability at instrumental jamming in a number of musical genres channelled together through funk \"Leroy's Latin Lament\" takes the cake-it's sophisticated balladry, afro latin funk and even mid seventy's pop\/rock all at once without never sacrificing it's sense of being firmly in the groove. There's no mistaking where \"Heartbeat\" comes in-it's full on boogaloo funk all the way and keeps it up for more than six minutes. It's always been one of my favourite of the uptempo grooves there, even when I only had the album on vinyl. \"Smile Happy\" and \"In Mazatlan\" both have these jazzy, harmony rich effects to them with the combination of percussion with different instrumental effects. Of course there's the big hit songs. The most well known, that latin rock classic \"Low Rider\" and the title track, with it's witty reggae style take on dealing with racial differences is another favourite of mine, no matter how much I've heard it. Musically speaking War would't make any more records quite like this interestingly enough until the early eighty's. They'd always remain one of the more individual of the original funk era bands. Very much in the spirited of Santana and Mandrill they seemed to have this certain flavor to their sound that was very much their own. All the same, especially in the slickness on some of the slower vocal numbers there the subtle changes in sound they'd undergo for the remainder of the decade does begin to show it's face. Unlike many bands who will switch styles in abrupt musical jump cuts,War had the good sense to make the transition gradually over the course of a few albums, as opposed to just getting themselves too wet in a new sound right away. Not only did it keep a lot of their listeners with them. But made the transitions seem less severe. And from my experience nothing seems to be more potentially frightening for any musicians to overcome with their audience than too severe a musical transition.

One thousand nine hundred and seventy-two in the world of informal settlements, builds power in less respected preachers. Those with the active force later the war returned to their original position at one thousand and nine hundred and seventy-two. But it has changed. Like most genres of music, there has to be a degree of complexity. This has happened on a grand scale. As one critic put it, War is a collective group, in which one member did not control the light, at least not for long. This is one of the main features of funk bands in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. In this album, the band naturally became the source of their development. Compared to the past, the main importance of lyrics in music is much higher, than instruments that are at a different level. Even so, owning one is still beyond the reach of the average person. \"Don't Let Anyone Disgrace You\" and \"Lotus\" both start their albums with some good soul melodies. The same flavor came back with \"Ke\" later on the album. But then something very interesting happened. It goes hand in hand with the intervening power of many of the band-led musical instruments through the funk \"Loy's Latin Lament\" - intricate folk songs, African Latin funk, and pop \/ rock in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and seventys without sacrificing its strong meaning in the groove. There\u2019s no doubt where \u201cHeartbeat\u201d came from \u2014 it\u2019s filled with boogaloo funk and held for more than six minutes. It\u2019s always one of my favourite quick moves, even if I only have vinyl records. Both \"Smile Happy\" and \"Mazatlan\" combine speed and variety of instruments to give these jazz, harmony and richness. Yes there are hot songs. The most famous, Latin rock classic \"Low Rider\" with the title track, which deals with racial differences in reggae style cleverly is something I love, no matter how much I listen. Speaking of music, the War did not make any more interesting records until the early one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. They were always groups of individuals during the first funk. In the spirit of Santana and Mandrill, they seem to have their own voice. However, especially with the slowdown of certain slow numbers, the subtle changes in sound that they have experienced over the past decade have begun to show. Unlike many bands that change styles with a sudden musical leap, War Wisely converts many albums instead of immersing them in a new sound. It does more than just keep a large audience with them. But it makes the change seem less serious. From my experience, for any singer, there is nothing more frightening than a drastic change in music. Is it all the creative caliper of this album that the War was table to completely avoid.","overall":5,"summary":"War Telling The People How They Feel","unixReviewTime":1318204800,"reviewTime":"10 10, 2011"}

The super enthusiastic Santana and Mandrill seem to have a special taste for their own voices. Still, especially with the softness of some of the slower voice numbers, there are subtle changes in sound that will continue for the rest of the decade starting to show its face. Unlike many bands that would change their style of music from song to song, War had a good feeling that they had temporarily changed on some albums, as opposed to soaking themselves too wet in sound. new immediately. It just does\u2019t have a large audience. But it made the transition very difficult.

G.'s one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four debut arrived at a turning point for ship shop music. As the old school style from the east coast was slowly growing stale, a new funkier and angrier approach was steadily growing in the form of gangsta wrap from the west coast. Then, of course, came \"Ready to Die,\" one of the finest ship shop albums of all time, and one that abridged the gap between the old and new schools. This is the album that introduced the world to the incredible wrapper and incredible character that was Christopher Wallace. A young, overweight Brooklyn native, a father, and a former hustler, Biggie impressed listeners not only with this talent but this personality on the mic. Technically, the is not short of amazing. His ingenious punchlines, late-night stories, threats, and jokes are delivered in this raspy, cheeky voice with precise technique, always on time and in a perfect flow. Lyrically, the covers many topics but the quality is never so consistent. On one song, the'll be telling a story of crime, on the next song the'll be poking fun at a ghetto closer, for seducing a woman, nostalgically reminiscing over the past, for dramatically philosophizing about the meaning of life and death. His verses are all meticulously written and never close your attention. Another reason \"Ready to Die\" is so great is the production. The young Sean Combs anchors a production team that uses extensive, clever sampling to create a unique musical backdrop for Biggie. The album is well divided between radio friendly singles and harder, darker songs that would be too rough for radio. The hardcore tracks inspired an entire generation of grimy New York wrappers that would reign towards the late one thousand, nine hundred and ninety, but the influence of the popular singles could also be felt on urban radio for years to come. \"Ready to Die\" is an absolutely classic ship shop album and one of the finest never, a must have for any collection. The album begins with a dramatic intro, which gives way to \"Things Done Changed,\" a well-produced and ironic look back at Biggie's humble roots. \"Gimme the Loot\" is one of the songs that shows this lyrical genius, where the plays multiple characters in a conversation, creating a classic track. \"Machine Gun Funk\" is an upbeat, funky cut sampling a song by Lords of the Underground for the hook. On the excellent \"Warning,\" Biggie again plays multiple characters during conversation, before dropping philosophy on backstabbers and issuing threats. The title track follows accordingly, as does the original mix of \"One More Chance,\" a song to a woman about their relationship (the more popular remix is not included on the tracklist). Perhaps my favourite song is the Method Man collaboration \"The What,\" a song where the two depressed MCs drop some dark knowledge and philosophy over a great beat. It does't get much better than having two of New York's finest wrappers over a solid one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four-styled beat. \"Juicy\" is an absolute classic, an emotional and effective rags-to-riches look at this upbringing, effectively sampling an heights R&B; hit by Mtume. Another of my favourites is the hopeful \"Everyday Struggle,\" which is blessed with the nicest beat on the album, a sunny, clever production over which Biggie recounts the troubles of trying to get by. \"Me & My B. \" is a humorous and enjoyable tune, followed by the unforgettable hit \"Big Poppa.\" This song has a perfect, Isley Brothers-sampling beat, a head-nodding bunker, and shows the humorously seductive BIG at this finest. The well done \"Respect\" and catchy \"Friend of Mine\" are worthy deep-album cuts, and the DJ Premier-produced \"Unbelievable\" has an unforgettable chorus and production. The album closes with one of this most stunning works, \"Suicidal Thoughts,\" a depressing insight of life from a suicidal person. Overall, \"Ready to Die\" is inspiring, beautiful, and immensely entertaining. This album does't sound like it has aged a bit, and even thirteen years later sounds as fresh and incredible as the day it dropped. Listeners of any page should be table to appreciate this masterpiece, it's so consistent that there's not one piece of skip material over seventeen tracks.

A woman, a wild animal, a great metal album - each is beautiful in its own way, ceaselessly entreating us to appreciate it. Yet curiously not everyone heeds beauty's call. Some are unmoved by the sight of a comely woman, others slay animals for sport, and then there are those who repudiate metal. \"It's just noise\" is a common complaint by many of the uninformed. Others look down their noses and spit, \"It's only pathetic losers who listen to metal!\"Pity the Discouraged Ones, for it is they who ignore the beauty before them. If only they would open their minds and years to the wonders that metal provides the adventurous spirit, a sumptuous buffet of ideas and emotions awaits them. Amongst the cornucopia that is my metal collection sits an object of such beauty, no words I write can do it justice. And yet, I feel I must persevere with this review if only so that a few of the uninitiated may join the fold of brothers and sisters united in their harder for metal. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to make the acquaintance of Morningrise, the most beautiful death metal album never created. Morningrise is the captivating creation of Opeth, arguably Sweden's most accomplished metal band. There are only a handful of geniuses in the rock music scene today, and Opeth guitarist\/vocalist Michael Akerfeldt is most assuredly one of them. Morningrise is simply stunning and, unlike with most death metal albums, its power and grace become apparent as early as the first listen. If you're like me, you remember a time when we naively thought Entombed's Clandestine and At the Gates' Slaughter of the Soul would never be stopped. But then along came Morningrise which bludgeoned those death metal classics effortlessly. Like most Opeth albums, Morningrise is oddly soothing despite its stylistic fluctuations. Akerfeldt alternates between guttural and clean vocals with such subtlety that at times you don't even notice the transition. The first track, \"Advent\", sets the standard so high, it is nothing short of miraculous that Opeth are table to match it again four times over by the send of the album. Throughout the album, the listener's senses are repeatedly aroused by moments of feral aggression only to be becalmed by passages of blissful tranquility. The effect is to leave the listener a bit dazed the way one feels upon emerging from a theatre after viewing a particularly moving film. Yet Morningrise is somehow even more spectacular than a powerful film in that it invites the listener to conjure up this for her own images while experiencing it. I will not even attempt to waste empty words on the merits of individual songs when to truly appreciate them, it is the music, not my prose, that you must experience. Uplifting and life-affirming, Morningrise is an album to be cherished.","overall":5,"summary":"Succor for the Discouraged Ones","unixReviewTime":1062288000,"reviewTime":"08 31, 2003"}

Akerfeldt alternates between intestinal and gastrointestinal sounds. The first song \"Advent\" set a high standard, it was a surprise that Opeth matched four times during the album's release. Throughout the disc, the emotions of the listener are aroused repeatedly in times of violent violence, but they are tempered by the flow of joy and peace. The result is that the audience feels a bit nervous when they leave the theatre after watching a movie. However, \"Dawn\" is more amazing than a powerful film by the way, because it invites the audience to experience and connect with this images.

The bonus track, Eternal Soul Torture, is usually below the recording of a poor quality demo that sings to be added to another track on this album.

Eventually, though, Morningrise emerged and promoted these metals. Like many Opheit albums, Morning Rise is uncomfortable despite the variety. Akir Field alternates between gut and foul sounds with subtleties that you may not even notice at times. The first song, \"Advent\" sets a very high standard, it's a miracle that Opeth sent him an album and put it on the table to match four times. Throughout the album, the listener's senses are repeatedly awakened just to wipe out the characters of pleasant peace in times of horrific violence. The result is that the listener is amazed at how it feels when someone leaves the theatre after watching a heartbreaking movie. However, Morning Rise is more amazing than a powerful movie because it invites the listener to include it in their pictures as soon as they hear it.

Now, even though it's one of their best albums most people will be turned off by it at first. I honestly was not the impressed with it the first time I heard it. But take my advice, over time and repeated listens this one will be on top of your favourite albums list, I'm about ninety-nine.nine hundred and ninety-nine% sure of that. Opeth takes a step forward from their honest record \"Orchid\" and begins to structure songs better and not make them so instrumental (this is further done in their threerd album \"My Arms Your Hearse\" where the record becomes more Progressive then Black). Michael Akerfeldts vocals also sound better, the death and clean vocals are better evened out. There are only five songs on this and the record comes in at over an hour in length, no song is under ten minutes. The album kicks off great with \"Advent\", definitely one of Opeths greatest songs. The acoustics in this are some of the most beautiful you'll never hear, as a matter of fact the entire album has some of the most beautiful acoustics you'll never hear. Anyway, afterwards comes \"Night and the Silent Water,\" not as good as \"Advent\" but still amazing, most especially the acoustic interlude in the middle. The threerd track OVERALL in't one of Opeths best, I was and honestly still am a little bored by this one. Although during the middle of the song comes another acoustic interlude which saves it and makes it semi-great, the bass work is also amazing and the best off the album on this song. After that there is the twenty+ minute \"Black Rose Immortal.\" Now, being Opeths longest song never I liked it a lot, Loved it even at some parts, but it did have its slow moments. Opeth sort of teases us at the last few minutes of the song because just when you think it's going to send it does't, and it does this tease about three times towards the send of the song, but does send with a hauntingly great guitar click. Track five- \"To Bid You Farewell\"- An Opeth CLASSIC. No Opeth fan should be without this song, it is in my opinion the most \"structured\" song on the record as the passages from electric to acoustic are smooth and everything is even, it's not too long for too short either. The Bonus track is something Opeth wrote and rewrote and finally became Advent. The production is horrid on this bonus track and it brings down the album as a whole, but you can always just hit the Stop button after track five. I did't really have a problem with anything on this record, the only thing that was slightly off (but not really that bad at all) was the way Opeth went into and out of other acoustic interludes. An electric guitar would suddenly stop, and a second for two would go by until the acoustic came in, not very smooth transitions at all, I mentioned them earlier how on track four, the song never seemed to send when it really should have because a guitar would do this tease and stop, then start up again with something that sounds completely different. It's done on Advent but doesnt hinder the song at all after you get used to it, it's also done smoother on track two and three. This is probably why the album takes a lot more patience to get into than any other Opeth album. I have to recommend this album, it's too amazing and gorgeous not to, but I would't recommend it as an opening album for anyone looking to get into this band. There is nothing like coming home after a stressful day and playing Morningrise, a gorgeous record.","overall":4,"summary":"One of thier best works ever!","unixReviewTime":1064275200,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2003"}

Now, although this is their best album, most people will be brought back to it from the beginning. To be honest, I was not impressed when I first heard it. But please listen to my advice. Over time and with repeated listening, this album will be at the top of your favourite albums. I'm sure about ninety-nine.nine hundred and ninety-nine%. Opeth took a step forward in their authentic record \"Orchid\" and began to create better songs, rather than making them more effective (this was further culminated in their third album \"My Arms of Your Heart\", the report has gone further than Black). Michael Akerfeldts' words also sound better, and death and clean words are better aligned. This song has only five songs, the length of the record is more than an hour, and no song is less than ten minutes. The album opens with \"Advent\" and is certainly one of Opeths' biggest songs. The sound effects on this album are the best you will never hear. In fact, the album as a whole has some of the best sound effects you will never hear. In any case, the next \"Night and Quiet Water\", although not quite a \"Arrival\" but still very surprising, especially the first middle sound. The third song is not one of the best tracks in the entire Opeths. Honestly, I'm tired of this track. Although another original song appeared in the middle of the song, the kept it and made it right, but the bus work was good, the is the best on the album's album. Then it became a \"Black Rose Fairy\" for over twenty minutes. Now, as Opeth's longest song, I've never really liked it, anywhere, but it's a slow moment. Opeth made fun of us a few minutes ago for a song, because when you thought the was going to send it, the did't do it. Download track five- \"Goodbye to you\" -Opez classic. In my opinion, this is the most \"planned\" song on the record, because the parts from the electronic sound to the original sound are smooth, everything is equal, and it's not too long for short. The bonus track was rewritten and rewritten by Opeth and eventually became an Advent. The production of this extra song is awesome, it makes the whole album awesome, but you can always click the \"Stop\" button after the fiveth song. I have no real problem with anything in this record, the only thing that is deleted (but not bad at all) is the way Opeth enters and exits other parts of the sound. The electric guitar will stop immediately, and after that it will pass for a second until the song is played. It is not a smooth transition at all. I mentioned how they are in the fourth song. This song does't seem to exist in real life. Send it when you send it, because the guitar will make this joke and stop, and then start all over again with something completely different. Made in Advent, but once you get used to it, it won't block the song at all, and it's smooth in the second and third tracks. It is for this reason that this album requires more patience than any other opening album. I have to recommend this album, it is amazing and beautiful, but I would not recommend it as an opening album for anyone who wants to join this group. There is nothing better than returning home after a stressful day and playing \"Dawn\", a good record.","overall":4,"summary":"One of thier best works ever!","unixReviewTime":1064275200,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2003"}

But take my advice over time and listen again it will be at the top of your favourite albums, I'm ninety-nine. Ninety-nine percent believe so. Opeth goes one step further than this trusted record \"Orchid\" and starts arranging songs better and does't make so many instruments (this is also done on this album \"My Arms Your Harass\" when the record is high. Becomes progressive and black). Michael Ackerfeldt's songs also sound better, death and pure sound are better released. It has only five songs and the record is more than an hour long, no song less than ten minutes. The album starts well with \"Advent\", which is definitely one of Opitus' best songs. In this case, the soundtracks are some of the most beautiful sounds you've never heard, in fact every album has some of the best soundtracks you'll never hear. However, after \"Night and Calm Water\" comes, not as good as \"Advent\" but amazing, especially the sound mix in between. Track thread is not one of the best opus overall, I was still a little bored with it honestly and honestly. While there is another sound pause in the middle of the song that keeps it going and makes it bigger, the bass work is amazing and the song is the best on the album. Twenty minutes after that + \"Black Rose Amr.\" Now, as the longest-running song of Opitus, I never liked it, I liked it in other parts as well, but it had slow-moving moments. The opaque style makes fun of us in the last few minutes of a song because when you think it will send it it won't send it, and it makes fun of it almost three times when it sends a song, but it's a Sends with very good guitar. Click Track Five - \"Goodbye\" - An Opite Classic. No Ophthalmologist should be without this song, in my opinion this song is \"too big\" on record because the path from electric to sound is smooth and everything is equal, very long and not too short. The bonus track is something that Opeth wrote and rewrote and it eventually became an adventure. The production in this bonus song is awesome and reduces the whole album, but you can only click the stop button after the fifth song. I had no problem with anything on this record, just something that was a bit far (but not so bad) that Opeth had a way to get in and out of some sound recordings. The electric guitar would stop abruptly, and then one of the two seconds would go into sound, not a smooth transition at all. I told them earlier that on the fourth track, the song did't seem like the guitar could really do that. \u06d4 Have fun and pause, and then start again with something that looks completely different. Performed in Advent but not banned at all after getting used to the song, it is easily done on the second and third tracks as well. Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly. I have to recommend this album, it's really amazing and it's good not to, but I don't recommend it as an opening album for anyone who wants to join the band.

But take my advice, after a while listen to this one again it will be on your favourite album list, I am almost ninety -nine. Nine hundred and ninety -nine% I'm sure. Opeth has taken a step forward with their faithful record \u201cOrchid\u201d and is starting to better organize the songs and not make them instruments (further doing so on their ninth album \u201cMy Arms Your Hearse\u201d if where the record is further developed after Black). Michael Akerfeldts sounds very good too, the die and the clean sound is well arranged. There are only five songs and this record is over an hour long, no song less than ten minutes. The door was opened with \u201cAdvent\u201d, certainly one of Opeths greatest songs.

The ugliest way of ALL is not one of the best Opeths, honestly I\u2019m still bored with it. While in the middle of the song there is another interacting sound that saves and makes it great, however the performance of the bus is also surprising and doors of this song. Then there's the twenty + minute \"Black Rose Black.\" Now, like the longest Opeths song I did\u2019t like, I loved even parts of it, but the minutes were slower. Opeth that kind of taunts us at the last minute of a song because when you think it\u2019s sending it\u2019s not sending, and it forces you three times to send the song, but will send you a big click on the guitar . Fifth Track- \"To Say Goodbye\" - CLASSIC Opeth. No Opeth fan should be without this song, I think the most \u201corganized\u201d song on record as the channels from electric to acoustic are equal and all equal, not too long also the Track Trail is something written by Opeth and rewritten and later became Advent. The release was too bad for this bonus track and slowed down the album entirely, but you could always hit the Stop button after following five. I don\u2019t really have a problem with anything on this record, the only thing missing (but really not too bad) is how Opeth came out and came out at another hearing. The electric guitar would suddenly stop, and for a few seconds it would continue until the sound came out, and without much movement, I already mentioned how they go on the fourth track, the song forever. It does\u2019t seem to be sent off when it\u2019s actually going to be because a guitarist will do this parody and stop, and then start all over again with something very different.

Anyway, afterwards comes \"Night and the Silent Water,\" not as good as \"Advent\" but still amazing, most especially the acoustic interlude in the middle. No Opeth fan should be without this song, it is in my opinion the most \"structured\" song on the record as the passages from electric to acoustic are smooth and everything is even, it's not too long for too short either. Opeth sort of teases us at the last few minutes of the song because just when you think it's going to send it does't, and it does this tease about three times towards the send of the song, but does send with a hauntingly great guitar click. Now, being Opeths longest song never I liked it a lot, Loved it even at some parts, but it did have its slow moments. I have to recommend this album, it's too amazing and gorgeous not to, but I would't recommend it as an opening album for anyone looking to get into this band.

In any case, the next \"Night and Quiet Water\", although not quite a \"Arrival\" but still very surprising, especially the first middle sound. Any Opeth fan should not have this song. In my opinion, this is the most \"built\" song on the record, because the passages from the electric sound to the first sound go smoothly, everything is the same, and it's not too far for too short. Opeth made fun of us a few minutes ago for this song because it did't happen when you thought it was going to be posted. Now, as Opeth's longest song, I've never really liked it, anywhere, but it's a slow moment. I would have to recommend this album, it is amazing and beautiful, but I would not recommend it as an opening album for anyone who wants to join this group.

However, later comes \"Night and Calm Water\", not \"Advent\" but still amazing, especially in the middle of the sound interval. No Opheet fan should have this song, in my opinion this song is \"very organized\" on record because the characters from electric to sound are smooth and everything is equal, not so long as to be too short. The kind of humour in the last few minutes of a song bothers us because if you think the'll send it, it does't mean that, and it makes fun almost three times when it comes to sending a song, but It sends with a big guitar click. Now, being a long Ophethus song, I never liked it, I liked it in some parts, but it had slow moments. I have to recommend this album, it's amazing and great not to do it, but I would't recommend it as an opening album for everyone who wants to join this group.

Talking music on online forums I might have heard one person recommend this album as being great. And some months back I saw it mentioned in a rock magazine. Those two things together made me want to check this album out. Musically, I find the sound harder than some other albums of the time that I've been exploring, mainly with reference to the origins of heavy metal. So, I'd say that I find the music in this harder than Cream, Jimi Hendrix and the debut albums of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Often the music is what you'd call 'heavy\/hard rock'. If you are familiar with AC\/DC's no hits album \"Powerage\", it's not a million miles away from that. sort of MCfive doing AC\/DC before AC\/DC. It's not as catchy as AC\/DC's ultimate Australian pub rock album \"Let there be rock\", but it's in that kind of territory, for some of Alice Cooper's harder sounding songs. The following year, Australian band The Masters Apprentices released perhaps the heaviest rock song up to that point in time, \"Turn up your radio\", which was a killer track. To the album. it seems to be an entirely live performance, and it does have some strong swear words, occasionally. Some of the are-song banter by the lead singer makes you think that the band is of African American origin, but looking at the cover part, they seem pretty white to me! Not sure, but maybe the band is playing to a black audience, and showing solidarity with them for something. Generally consistent in quality, the songs which I liked the best were:I want you right now: my pick as the best song on this album. It's very heavy rock (perhaps the heaviest sound in music to that point in time. certainly heavier than Black Sabbath's debut album). There is some good multi-vocals happening, and I like the slower tempo part of the song. The song's riff is ball park similar to The Trogg's classic \"Wild thing\". Best of the rest-Rocket reducer: Reminded me of Australian hard rock band of the seventy-eightys The Angels, and their song \"She keeps no secrets\", with regard to the guitar sound. The vocals also reminded me of Australian band Gangagang's classic \"Gimme some login'\". The song has lots of lead guitar histrionics. Starship: An epic song which runs to weight:fifteen minutes. It's very heavy rock with a strong riff. It later gets a bit more performance party, in a stripey kind of way. Lyrically, it's poetic in a The Doors kind of way. Experimental. The rest -Ramblin' Rose: has an introduction with evangelical zeal. Becomes heavy rock'n'roll, with fuzzy rhythm guitar and a squealing lead guitar. Kick out the jams: rock'n'roll song with spanking drums. The song which features a strong swear word, even by today's standards. Chorus is sort of catchy. Come together: Noise rock. Sort of equivalent to those AC\/DC records I mentioned before. Let There Be Rock, and Powerage, with regard to the guitar sound. Borderline: Has grating guitars, some good rhythm guitar and multi-vocals. Motor City is burning: Bluesy rock'n'roll with a bass boogie shuffle and B. B. King type vocals. If you like the rawness of this record, try AC\/DC's Powerage album. If you like the hooks in the songs there, you might enjoy AC\/DC's \"Let there be rock\" record.","overall":4,"summary":"The first hard rock album? 75\/100","unixReviewTime":1245974400,"reviewTime":"06 26, 2009"}

Musically, I find the sound harder than Cream's first albums, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. My favourite song is this: I want you now. In the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys, Detroit was full of similar groups, but MCfive did something. Anger in authority. This danger is really evident in their music, especially the kicking of the jam. This makes them the loudest, fastest and most annoying band of all Detroit bands. MFfive is trying to start a revolution, tired of hippies talking about peace and love. They say everything is bad, but they have not tried to change it. In their opening remarks, McCfive tried to get people to \"be part of the solution.\" The impact of MCfive cannot be underestimated. Without MCfive, today's music would be completely different. They created punk, strongly influenced the first metal band, and recorded some very good songs. These people are real converts. The CIA even keeps them. Considering this album is the endless roses, starship, I want you now, yes, kick the jam. MCfive is full of energy, it's the best \"rock\" One. Musically, it is better to return to the United States, but the power, attitude, and discourse of change were initially raised in the United States. they are cloud, fast and angry about their government, their country and society at large.

It\u2019s the same band, but MCfive has something they do. punk, had a huge impact on the first metal band, and recorded some great songs. In the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys, Detroit was full of similar groups, but McCfive did something. Anger against the authority was evident in their music. MCfive is a revolution, and Kick Out for Jams is a new declaration of freedom. The founder of punk, rebellion and the first anti-beauty dream, MCfive burned the American flag and promoted drug abuse long before the Sex Pistols emerged their first wardrobe. An adrenaline-filled band is too big to fit inside the four walls of any studio. Kick Out the Jams catches MCfive in its only way possible: live broadcasts, once in the face of a hurricane. The one, nine hundred and sixty-eight bombing episode is an invitation to justice, which breaks music barriers and overturns political click\u00e9s. UJ. C. Crawford and Robin Tyner joined a rotating activist to provide a rigorous test of the current political situation, allowing MCfive to formally act and lead their collective danger after each appeal was defeated. However, there is nothing official about MCfive. Combining Sun Ra\u2019s manic experimentalism, Jimi Hendrix\u2019s rage and Chuck Berry\u2019s passion for songwriting, Motor City Five is an American rock legend put together into one force. When this group reaches the stage, Earth is truly a body. When the guitar enters the space, the human voice rises above the standing position, unaffected by percussion and pressing the drum under a constant bass, hiding the boundaries between the notes, and between the instrument and each member The difference is almost impossible. to succeed. Eventually, all the music, all the slogans, and all the sound gives energy to the other waves of power, affecting the listener like a fast truck, until all the muscles in this body follow the Spanish revolution And the cache so far.

And this report destroys the earth and finally reveals the lost voice of an entire generation of people.

Too Low For Zero was a triumphant return to commercial form for Elton in the UK and Australia (less so in the USA) and saw him are-emerge as one of the top pop stars of the mid eighty's with a string of hits complete with snazzy, colourful videos, and this famous array of straw hats! Lyricist Bernie Taupin was back with a full set of lyrics for the first time in seven years too, which was a real bonus. The album showed Elton using modern synthesisers on several tracks and also other fashionable pop industry styling were used to try to update Elton's image. Gone was the shy and sensitive singer pianist of the early seventy's, and in this place was this flashy, sharply-dressed elder statesman of pop who defiantly reminded everyone in June one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three that I'm Still Standing!! This arresting, timely worldwide hit got the Too Low For Zero campaign off to a flying start, and next the succeeded again with one of this best eighty's songs :I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues, featuring lovely harmonica from Stevie Wonder and a great melody. Both these songs made the Top five, and soon the was challenging for the #one spot on the album charts again, narrowly missing there in Australia (#two), after seven years of (relatively)lean times commercially. Crystal is a snappy, synth-pop winner, while over New Year one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, we had the pure pop of Kiss The Bride. Elton may have known something we did't when the recorded this cheerful tune - in February one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four the surprisingly married this sound engineer: Renate Blauel, just as this song was speaking on the charts!! Talk about good timing!! The fifth hit was the title track, which is about coping with insomnia and depressed moods, but which does't sound glum at all towing to some synthesiser styling (even Elton the piano champion got into synthesiser keyboards in the early eighty's!). There was even a UK minor hit with the pleasant quality ballad Cold As Christmas, which, again showing impeccable timing, Elton released at Christmas one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three!! With all these hits, the other tracks could sneak into everyone's Elton collections unnoticed, but happily they're also pretty good. Religion is a fairly generic rocker, as is Whipping Boy. Saint is nice and features Elton in fine voice, while I really like One More Arrow, where the also creates melodious high harmonies. This is an Elton song that deserves to be much better known than it is. Nobody else can write such sincere funerary songs (in English) as Elton, who has the rare gift of singing about people who have died in a gentle but artistic way. Whoever it was that was held by \"the soft brown earth\" in this song can have had no finer tribute singer to commemorate this life than Elton. The album had a clever cover design , with a plain white sleeve and four symbols , one for each word of the album title. The bonus tracks there are the groovy instrumental Earn While You Learn and the Western-historical themed The Retreat (a nice Elton and Bernie song from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two). It's a shame they did't include the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two B-side Take Me Down To The Ocean on either this disc for on the reissued CD of Jump Up!, as this is a very enjoyable early eighty's Elton rarity not on any CD as yet.","overall":5,"summary":"80's pop winner for Elton John","unixReviewTime":1091923200,"reviewTime":"08 8, 2004"}

{"orig_index":28028,"reviewerID":"AO2AQRPPSTABB","asin":"B00000I25M","reviewerName":"Jeffrey J.Park","helpful":[3,3],"reviewText":"Released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, this great album from Manfred Mann's Earth band introduced a new lineup and explores a somewhat softer side that was not present on excellent albums like Solar Fire (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) and Nightingales and Bombers (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five). The Roaring Silence also featured the bands smash hit adaptation of Bruce Springsteen's Blinded by the Light, which placed them at the number one slot in America. Although I have personally grown weary of hearing this radio staple, the remaining material on the album is excellent and very interesting as well. The lineup includes Manfred Mann (Hammond morgan; electric piano; mellotron; mini-moog synthesizer; string ensemble; send vocals on Blinded); Chris Hamlett Thompson (lead vocals; electric guitar); Chris Slade (drums and percussion); and Colin Pattenden (electric bass). Joining the score group is a group of backup female vocalists; a formally trained choir comprised of male and female vocalists; in addition to string, woodwind, and brass players. The guys in the band are all great musicians and I especially like Manfred's synth choice - the prefers the warmer stone color. Of course, this use of mellotron is a huge plus in my book and the string synthesizer really works well. The choir is excellent and is featured on Babylon. Chris Thompson's vocal style is more in keeping with hard rock, but the tones back on the quieter tracks (Chris favor a harder edged guitar sound). Stylistically, this album is a toughie - in fact musicologist Edward Macan has referred to this band as \"unclassifiable\". I personally hear a mix of blues-based hard rock, soft rock, spacey progressive rock, and a tiny smudge of jazz rock. The neat thing is that just when you think that a piece falls into a predictable style; the group goes in a completely different direction, although they pretty much stay in progressive territory. In general, the music on this album is what I would refer to as being \"subtly complex\" - there is a lot going on in each piece, but it does not hit you over the head. I won't go into too much detail describing their cover of Blinded by the Light - suffice to say that it is a pronged-up version of a Bruce Springsteen tune that was immensely popular. My favourite part of the track is when Manfred starts playing Chopsticks (\"The Celebrated Chop Waltz\" by Euphemia Allen) in the middle of the instrumental break - it is pretty funny. Singing the Dolphin Through (written by Mike Heron) is the odd track out on the album - this is a soft ballad with female backup singers and mellotron (with string tape setting) pads there and there. Although I do not mind the piece one bit, other prog fans have a problem with it. In addition to these tracks, there is a great (live) froggy instrumental (Waiter, there is a Yawn in My Ear); and a series of pieces with progressive flourishes, more rocking sections, and spacer sections (particularly the nice, mellotron heavy ballad Questions). Starbird is cool in that the entire track seems to be loosely based on a single theme from Igor Stravinsky's Firebird Suite -Yes would open their shows with this excerpt. The choir parts on Starbird are excellent. Other nice moments include the opening to Babylon - this piece opens with the real choir, which is then augmented with Manfred on mellotron (with the choir tape setting). This remastered version of the album by Cohesion\/Creature\/Petbrook is pretty good and features crisp sound quality (although there are some quirks on Blinded by the Light); and informative liner notes. The bonus tracks include Spirits in the Night (which was originally recorded for Nightingales and Bombers and appeared on the US version of the Roaring Silence); and a single edit of Blinded by the Light. Both tracks are OK, although they do not add much to the original album. As a hardcore prog rock freak, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this album and would recommend it along with Solar Fire and Nightingales and Bombers. One other album that might prove enjoyable includes Nexus (Argent, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four).","overall":4,"summary":"This album has much more to offer than just a smash hit","unixReviewTime":1192320000,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2007"}

Introduce a new range and explore some of the softer sides. These are the Solar Fire (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) and the Nightingale and the Bomb (nineteen hundred and seventy-five). The noisy silence also includes a modified music band from Bruce Springsteen's Blinded by the Light, making them the number one hit in the United States. Although I'm tired of hearing this radio anchor, some of the things in the album are also good and very interesting. The list includes Manfred Mann (Hammond Morgan; electric piano; mellotron; mini-moog synthesizer; string binding; blind transmission); Chris Hamlett Thompson (vocals; electric guitar); Chris Slade (drums and song); and Colin Pattenden (power base) Joining the song by a group of archivists; a typical choir performed by both male and female musicians; without string, wood and brass singers. The people in the band are great musicians, and I really like Manfred\u2019s choice of composers \u2014 they prefer a warm stone color. Of course, this use of Mellotron is very useful in my book, and the compound string is easy to use. The choir is beautiful and different from Babylon. Chris Thompson\u2019s vocal style is more in line with heavy rock, but the stone goes back to a cool song (Chris loves the sound of a powerful guitar). According to Stylistically, the album is a tough guy \u2014 in fact, music expert Edward Macan called the band \u201cunexplained\u201d. I\u2019ve felt for myself the combination of a hard rock based on blues, a soft rock, a local savant-garde rock and a little jazz rock. Wisely, when the task is viewed as a predictable one, the group is moving in the opposite direction, albeit in a state of shock. Overall, the music on this album is what I call the \"hidden complexity\" - each song has a lot to do, but it's not surprising. I will not describe those who are blinded by the Light in detail - enough to show that this is a version of Bruce Springsteen's fork, which is very popular. My favourite part of the song was when Manfred started playing Chopsticks (\"The Celebrated Chop Waltz\" by Euphemia Allen) in the middle of a cracking instrument - it was fun. Singing Dolphin Using (written by Mike Heron) is a unique song on the album \u2014 a soft traditional folk song with a supporting female singer and Mellotron (with recording strings). While I don\u2019t care about this at all, some savant-garde fans have questions about it. In addition to these repertoire, there is also a large live (live) instrument (Guardian, there is Hawn in my year); and a series of progressive music, twists and turns (especially good problem traditional folk songs with a hard song). Starbird is cool because every song seems to be based freely on content in Igor Stravinsky's Firebird Suite - Yes you will use this quote to open their show. The Starbird chorus section is excellent. Other good times include the opening of Babel - a song opened with a real choir and performed with Manfred (set using tape) on Mellotron. This album returned by Cohesion \/ Creature \/ Petbrook is very good, with a clear sound quality (although Blindness in the Light has some features); and instructive liner notes. Bonus styles include night spirits (originally written in Nightingales and Bombers and from the American version of Roaring Silence); and the invisible light of the editor. Both of these songs are good, though they did't have much of an impact on the original album. As a hardcore savant-garde rock freak, I really love this album and would recommend it with Solar Fire, Nightingales and Bombers. Another fun album includes Nexus (Agent, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four).","overall":4,"summary":"This album has much more to offer than just a smash hit","unixReviewTime":1192320000,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2007"}

In addition to these tracks, there is a great (live) froggy instrumental (Waiter, there is a Yawn in My Ear); and a series of pieces with progressive flourishes, more rocking sections, and spacer sections (particularly the nice, mellotron heavy ballad Questions). Released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, this great album from Manfred Mann's Earth band introduced a new lineup and explores a somewhat softer side that was not present on excellent albums like Solar Fire (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) and Nightingales and Bombers (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five). One other album that might prove enjoyable includes Nexus (Argent, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four). I personally hear a mix of blues-based hard rock, soft rock, spacey progressive rock, and a tiny smudge of jazz rock. Joining the score group is a group of backup female vocalists; a formally trained choir comprised of male and female vocalists; in addition to string, woodwind, and brass players. Singing the Dolphin Through (written by Mike Heron) is the odd track out on the album - this is a soft ballad with female backup singers and mellotron (with string tape setting) pads there and there.","overall":4,"summary":"This album has much more to offer than just a smash hit","unixReviewTime":1192320000,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2007"}

Chris Thompson\u2019s vocal style is very close to hard rock, but the vocals are repetitive on quiet tracks (Chris loves hard guitar sounds). In style, this album is complex - in fact, music expert Edward Macan described this group as \u201cinseparable\u201d. I personally hear a mixture of solid blue-based rock, soft rock, advanced open rock, and a little smudge of jazz rock. The best thing is when you think the piece has fallen into a predictable shape; the group is heading in a completely different direction, even though they are mostly in developed terrain. Overall, the music on this album is what I would describe as \u201cdifficult\u201d - there\u2019s a lot going on in each section, but it does\u2019t hit your head. Not much detail will describe their cover-up Blindness-Lack of Light-enough to say that it\u2019s sort of an over-the-top version of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s very popular song. My favourite part of the way was when Manfred started playing Chopsticks (\u201cThe Celebrated Chop Waltz\u201d by Euphemia Allen) in the middle of the instrumental break - it was fun. Dolphin song through (written by Mike Heron) is the perfect way to get an album - it\u2019s a soft band with female artists and a mellotron (with string tape) over and over. While I don\u2019t have a problem with the piece, other prog fans have a problem. In addition to these footprints, there\u2019s a large (live) device with a swarm (Waiter, it contains Who\u2019s in My Ear); and a series of parts with progressive, vibrating parts, and space parts (especially the subtle, heavy questions in the melotron). Starbird is great for making the whole road relaxed based on a single theme from Igor Stravinsky\u2019s Firebird Suite -Yes they will open their shows in this section. The genius of the Starbird song parts. Other great moments include the opening of Babylon - this piece opens with the actual song, which is then added to Manfred on the mellotron (with the location of the song tape). This redesigned version of the Cohesion \/ Creature \/ Petbrook album is superb and showcases rhythmic sound quality (though with a bit of rudeness that is blinding to the eyes); and informational texts. The bonus track includes Night Nights (originally shot for Nightingales and Bombers that featured the American version of Noise Silence); and a Blind Editor. Same goes well, though they don\u2019t add much to the original album. As a solid rock-cut artist, I can honestly say that I liked this album and I would recommend it along with Sunlight and Nightingales and Bombers. Another album that might be interesting is Nexus (Argentine, thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four).","overall":4,"summary":"This album has much more to offer than just a smash hit","unixReviewTime":1192320000,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2007"}

The reason was the original LP never received an American release. For some reason Columbia Records deemed it unfit for release. Apparently Vertigo Records in their own country felt the same way, so they got it released on the WWA label. The original LP comes with a cool gimmick cover with a clear plastic window. Despite this being their harder-to-find album, this is, in my opinion, one of their best. Phil Shulman departed the band after the release of Octopus, probably because the was around ten years older than the rest of the band and probably feeling a bit old, being in this thirties, while the other band members were in their twenties. This left the band with their most stable lineup of Ray and Derek Shulman, Kerry Minnear, Gary Green, and John Weathers. This lineup would last until their one thousand, nine hundred and eighty breakup. In a Glass House is a more rocking album, but the band still than't in any way abandoned the medieval influences that made them famous (at least in the prog community). The opening cut, \"The Runaway\" proves this. It starts off with the sound of shattering glass, before the Hammond morgan kicks in, and you get to hear the vocals of Derek Shulman. \"Inmates Lullaby\" is a nice, laid-back piece, with Kerry Minnear handling vocals, with vibes. This piece hardens back in places to Acquiring the Taste, especially the percussion. \"Way of Life\" is another rocking number with Derek Shulman handling vocals again, but part of it mellows out with a more medieval vibe, and like often when the band goes medieval, Kerry Minnear handles the vocals. \"Experience\" is a wonderful number that goes through many different changes, from rocking to medieval. \"Reunion\" is another nice, laid-back piece with Minnear handling vocals, complete with strings (that reminds me of David Palmer's orchestrations for Jethro Tull, although the violins are from Gentle Giant themselves). The title track is another great prog rock number. There's actually a section where the vocal arrangements sound just like Yes (but replace Jon Anderson with Derek Shulman, and you get the idea). But the rest of this piece is Gentle Giant all the way.

The reason is that the original LP was not released in the United States. For some reason, Columbia Records believes it is not worth the distribution. Obviously, Vertigo Records in their country felt the same way, so they removed it from the WWA label. The original LP comes with a cool gimmick with a transparent plastic window. Although this is a difficult album for them, in my opinion, this is one of the best albums. Phil Shulman left the club after Octopus' release, probably because the was about ten years older than other members of the group. This provided the team with the strongest list, including Ray and Derek Shulman, Kerry Minnear, Gary Green and John Weathers. The list continues until one, nine hundred and eighty hands. In the Glass House is a rock-mass, but the group has not yet given up the central influence that made them famous (at least in the savant-garde community) by any means. The opening clip \"Runaway\" confirms this. It starts with the sound of broken glass, and before Hammond Morgan can begin, the will hear Derek Shulman's song. The song \"Inmates Lullaby\" is a beautiful, enduring song. Kerry Minnear deals with people's voices and sound. This piece solidifies where we get the taste, especially the percussion. \"The Way of Life\" is another rock music. Derek Shulman deals with words again, but some of them are softer in the medieval spirit, just as when a group entered the Middle Ages, Kerry Minnear dealt with words. \"Experience\" is an amazing number that has undergone many different changes, from swing to the Middle Ages. \"Reunion\" is another beautiful, returning piece. Minnear carries vocals and has a musical background (this reminds me of Jethro Tull\u2019s David Palmer orchestra orchestra, although the violin comes from Gentle Giant himself). The title track is one of the largest savant-garde rock figures. There is actually a sound arrangement arrangement that sounds like it (but instead of Jon Anderson and Derek Shulman, you get the idea). But the rest of the work has always been a giant in Gentle.

One effect I've seen before (and which band is better to play 'Effect Seeing' than stereolab?) Is by Danny Elfman. 'Edward Caesar Hands' and a kind of angel choir like that. I can bet on my last money that the song 'Edward' is in Tim Gain's sleeping bag with all the Sun-Raw, Beach Boys and New. It's all a good whisper of hallucinogenic beauty and splendour. And it should provide a great soundtrack in the fall. The leaves change and fall off. Cool night. One of their best things. And. One of this hit songs is not in 'The Black Arts'.

My roots of the Isleys start from the seventy on. \"For The Love Of You\", \"Sensuality\", \"Voyage To Atlantis\", \"Footsteps In The Dark\", \"Groove With You\", \"Let's Fall In Love\" and \"Make Me Say It Again\" have always been favourites of mine from The Isley Brothers. They have clearly made their mark as one of the best groups of all time in for&b. They have been table to maintain their longevity and you always hear their itunes on commercials for being sampled by wrappers for other musicians. Their last CD, \"Mission To Please\" was very impressive. R Kelly produced three tracks, including \"Let's Lay Together\" and the title track. The Isley Brothers are table to recapture their sound from past years even today. \"Tears\" was written by Babyface and that was my favourite song from the CD. Now in two thousand and one, The Isley Brothers are back with \"Eternal\". The honest single, \"Contagious\" is produced by R Kelly and it is a continuation of the \"Down Low\" type slow songs. Chante Moore joins Mr. Biggs and R Kelly and the results are pleasant. I am sure people wish this saga would come to an send but the song is very well put together. The majority of the rest of the songs are produced by Raphael Saadiq, Steve \"Stone\" Huff, and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis and James Wright. How's that for a production team for a CD. The Raphael Saadiq produced \"Move Your Body\" gets things off to a good start. The song has an old school feel to it and Ronald Isley takes care of things as usual. \"Warm Summer Night\" is a nice song as well. It's a remake of the old Chic tune and Ronald Isley's wife, Angela Winbush joins him as well. The best moments on this CD are when the Isley Brothers stick to what they do best: the love songs. The Steve Huff produced \"Secret Lover\" of\/Avant is a nice midtempo tune. Many people compare Steve to R Kelly but the still has a style of this own. My favourite two songs on this CD are the Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis and James Wright produced \"Settle Down\" and \"Eternal\". These slow jams are definitely classic Isleys. Even if you karen't a fan of Mr. Biggs, classic Isley Brothers fans will enjoy these two songs. \"Said Enough\" featuring Jill Scott has The Isleys taking a trip with the two thousand and one for&b train. This sounds like nothing the Isleys have done previously and the results are still good. The only reason that some people may not like this CD are one) people like Ron Isley and not Mr. Biggs and two) the lyrics are not as up to par as classic Isleys' songs. \"Eternal\" will remind people of their CDs of the past but it has a nice two thousand and one twist to it.

Her Rinse album held many good songs that did not make it on BNN, but she picked out many gems that were on Rinse. This pc.d. was no dud when it came out, and it still is a great pc.d. The songs on there are a bit more light- hearted than they are on her sophomore album Harmonium and have more of a radio- friendly vibe and I think that's why it was so popular over her sophomore album. Yet on her Harmonium she has more of a mature and stable sound, and a lot more intimacy, while on BNN it was a lot more commercial and her maturity sounds like it was just blossoming, which it was. That's one reason I love this album because it shows the woman Vanessa was becoming and it did sound like a promising future for her. When Harmonium came though it was amazing how well she grew, and how much more stronger she was music wise. And BNN started out that journey for her. And I could hear the maturity in her break out on this album beautifully, like on the in- depth and bomber Paradise, and the raw and emotional Wanted. I loved the songs and on Harmonium she has just further strengthened that side of her. The Top forty fans will not follow her anymore, because all they want to hear more of is A Thousand Miles, but people should realize she has grown from that era to a more mature musician. She was great in the BNN era, totally, but she only grew better in Harmonium and she will further more grow and I see nothing but success. Vanessa is a talented woman that just keeps getting better and I cannot wait for her third album that she is working on right now. It should come out either early for late next year- no one is too sure yet. Look out next year though. Be Not Nobody though started it all, and how influential and beautiful and emotional this album is just makes it an awesome album to have. The best songs on BNN are Ordinary Day, Unsung, Sway, Paradise, Paint It Black, Wanted and of course the never famous Twilight. Prince is the only song I don't like on there, I never got into it. The rest though I enjoy hearing. I highly recommend this pc.d. if you're into piano- driven musicians and I also recommend her sophomore album Harmonium. Both albums are awesome to own, and Vanessa Carlton is an awesome musician to know- one of the best we have out there.","overall":5,"summary":"The Maturity That Begun To Blossom...","unixReviewTime":1128211200,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2005"}

But I believe it was never released, because Vanessa wanted her song to have a lot of original sounds, so they kept rearranging it, but it became \"not human\". His album Rinse contains many good songs that did not appear on BNN, but the chose a lot of stones in Rinse. This computer did not appear to be outdated, it is still a large pc.d. The songs there are more relaxed than this second year album \"Harmonium\" and have a kind of broadcast spirit, and I think that's why the's so popular on this second year album. However, in this Harmonium, this voice is more mature, more stable, and closer, while on BNN, it is more marketable, and its growth sounds like it has just blossomed, which is real. This is one of the reasons why I like this album because it shows that Vanessa's wife is getting away with it, and it sounds like it promises her future. When Harmonium appeared, it was amazing that the grew up well and this musical wisdom became very strong. BNN began this journey. I feel like this growth has come out perfectly on this album, like deep paradise with bombshells, and are-demands and emotions. I love these songs, and at Harmonium, the further strengthened this side. Fans in her forties will not pay attention to her, as they want to hear more about Qianli, but people need to understand that she has grown from that time to a mature singer. He was very good at the BNN season, absolutely, but the has grown better at Harmonium, the will grow more, I only see success. Vanessa is a talented woman, always improving, and I can't wait for her third album to be released now. It should be launched early next year for at the send of next year - no one is sure yet. But pay attention next year. And No No it all started. The impact, the beauty and the feel of the album make it a great album. The best songs on BNN are the Ordinary, Unstoppable Day, Sway, Paradise, Paint It Black, sought after, and certainly Twilight, which has never been popular. Prince is the only song I don't like there, I haven't listened to it. Although I like listening to others. I highly recommend this pc.d.

Yet on her Harmonium she has more of a mature and stable sound, and a lot more intimacy, while on BNN it was a lot more commercial and her maturity sounds like it was just blossoming, which it was. And I could hear the maturity in her break out on this album beautifully, like on the in- depth and bomber Paradise, and the raw and emotional Wanted. The Top forty fans will not follow her anymore, because all they want to hear more of is A Thousand Miles, but people should realize she has grown from that era to a more mature musician. She was great in the BNN era, totally, but she only grew better in Harmonium and she will further more grow and I see nothing but success. Be Not Nobody though started it all, and how influential and beautiful and emotional this album is just makes it an awesome album to have. Her Rinse album held many good songs that did not make it on BNN, but she picked out many gems that were on Rinse.","overall":5,"summary":"The Maturity That Begun To Blossom...","unixReviewTime":1128211200,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2005"}

But it was't released, I'm sure, because Vanessa wanted her songs to have a lot of background sound so that she would't be table to recreate it. His album Rinse contained many beautiful songs that did not reach BNN, but the chose many of Rinse's treasures. Lee PCD was't crude when it came out, and it's still a big PCD. The songs there are much simpler than this second album Harmonium and have a radio friendly vibe and I think that's why the was so famous for this second album. Yet its harmonium has a more mature and stable sound as well as more intimacy, while at BNN it was very commercial and with its maturity it felt like it was just blooming, which it was. That's why I like this album because it shows that Vanessa was becoming a woman and it seems like a bright future for her. When the harmonium arrived, it was amazing how big the was, and how smart the was with music. And BNN started this journey for him. And I could feel the maturity on its release from this album in such a lovely way, like in Deep and Bomber Heaven, as well as raw desires and emotions. I loved the songs and the recently strengthened this side in the harmonium. The top forty fans will no longer follow him, as they only want to hear a thousand miles more, but people should see that the has become another adult artist since then. He was good in the BNN era, of course, but the improved in harmonium and will continue to grow and I see nothing but success. Vanessa is a talented woman who is getting better and I can't wait for her third album that she is currently working on. It should be released early next year - no one is sure yet. See you next year anyway. Don't Be Anything has already begun, and how powerful and beautiful and emotional this album is just makes it a great album. BNN's popular songs are Ordinary Day, In Sung, Soye, Paradise, Paint at Black, Wanted and Unpopular Twilight. Prince is the only song I don't like there, I never got into it. The rest though I enjoy listening to. I recommend this PCD if you are not a pianist based artist and I also recommend its second season album Harmonium. Both albums are great, and Vanessa Carlton is an amazing artist to know - one of the best artists we have.","overall":5,"summary":"The Maturity That Begun To Blossom...","unixReviewTime":1128211200,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2005"}

Eminem is so funny, and how do you think about these things? We like to think of him as a bully, who does't have a nice white wrapper with good names, but no one can deny the real Slim Shady. All the parts of Eminem are great, and this album is really no different. Some of Eminem's best and worst songs are in this album. Unless you have lived a short life, you have heard outside my cell and without Kleinen. Ok huh It's just a sample of real wrapper talent and the face behind the mask. On the other hand, there are some sad songs, like what they say, with the doctor. Drew, a famous wrapping artist. Now, this song for the two greatest players in history. It's really hard to hear. The album is great if you like Eminem, though not the biggest Eminem. However, it is good that Eminem has opened up more about this life. As yet, we did't really know who Slim Shady should really be considered.

Is it better? Not really, but I hear a definite growth of experimentation in sound. I haven't read any other reviews, however, I notice most of the ratings to be either three for four stars and I am left scratching my head, wondering why? My guess is many fans are having a difficult time getting into this album simply because the overall tempo is slower paced than the majority of their previous works, and perhaps your not used to hearing that from Massive Attack but, believe me, they've created some brilliant songs there. Just open your mind without any sort of expectation. The mood throughout is rather bomber with dark, atmospheric electronic dubs instead of funky trip-hop jones, and the inclusion of orchestrated instruments provide a cinematic feel that really seems to shade the melodies, accenting them chillingly. But by no means does 'one hundredth Window' tread into ambient territory. It would be best described as smooth electronica that will likely appeal to those who enjoy dance-tinged chillout music (visions of nice and snow come to mind when listening to this record). And replacing the sweet female vocalists Sara Jay and Elizabeth Fraser, who both sang on 'Mezzanine' when Andy Horace was't (and you gotta love this unique style, which I find to be very sexy. in a strange kind of way), the more powerful yet never gorgeous Sinead O'Connor guest sings on several cuts there; most notably \"A Prayer For England\" which comes on after a slightly more upbeat \"Butterfly Caught\", a personal favourite of mine.

Most of the tracks appear in their full length version and are divided between two discs: one is house music and another is ship shop. Maybe it's because I'm biased towards house music, but I found the first disc to be the more enjoyable of the two. David Morales near dominates this set with some impressive are-workings of cuts like \"Dreamlover\" and \"Fantasy.\" I'm not a huge fan of the original versions of either of these songs, but Morales gives these cuts this own disco flavor to make you forget the banality of their lyrics. Disc two is for the ship shop heads, and there's enough good stuff on this disc to make it noteworthy. Some standouts include the remix of \"My All,\" which segues into a remake of the Loose Ends classic \"Stay Awhile,\" and \"Thank God I Found You\" more than liberally samples Keith Sweat's \"Make it Last Forever.\" The disc closes with one of two thousand and three's catchiest singles, \"I Know What You Want\" featuring Busta Rhymes. The thirteen cuts on this disc are pretty enjoyable samples of radio-friendly ship shop, although not all are remixes. \"Sweetheart\" (with Jermaine Dupri) and \"Crybaby\" (with Snoop Dogg) both appear in their original versions. I did't seem to mind that, for they blend in with the rest of the other tracks nicely.

Most of the tracks come in full versions and are divided into two CDs: one is home music and the other is a boat shop. Maybe it\u2019s because I prefer home music, but I found the first CD fun. David Morales is almost obsessed with good editing works like \"Dreamlover\" and \"Fantasy\". I'm not a big fan of the first versions of these two songs, but Morales gave these clips this disco taste, making you forget the middle of their lyrics. The second CD is for the boat owner, there are enough good things on this CD that we need to mention. Other notable works include a remix of \"My All\", a remake of the Loose Ends classic \"Stay a while\", and \"Thank God I Found You\", not just \"Make It Eternal\" by Keith Sweat. The record ends with one of two thousand and three most interesting songs, \"I know what you want\", featuring Busta Rhymes. The thirteen episodes on this record are very interesting in the sample of retail radio stores, though not all of them are mixed. Both \"Sweetheart\" (collaborating with Jermaine Dupri) and \"Crybaby\" (collaborating with Snoop Dogg) are from the original versions. I don't seem to mind this, because they blend well with other songs. Although \"Remixes\" does not feature any new content, it is a good collection of Mariah Club hits.","overall":4,"summary":"Mariah on Fire.","unixReviewTime":1066521600,"reviewTime":"10 19, 2003"}

Maybe it's because I'm obsessed with house music, but I've found that the first album is the most interesting of the two. David Morales dominated the set with good cuts like \"Dream Over\" and \"Fantasy\". I'm not a big fan of the original versions of these songs, but Morales gives you a taste of your disco to forget the contradiction of their lyrics. The disc belongs to the heads of the shipping stores, and there are good things on this disc to make it stand out. Other highlights include a remix of \"My All\" which follows the old loose ends remake of \"Stay Away\" and \"Thank God I Found You\" plus free samples of Keith Sweet's \"Make It Last Forever\".

The arrival of Springsteen\u2019s website, if these words and emotions are facilitated by this music (achieved through poetry and grace during the process), can be seen in the schedule \u201cRosalita\u201d, \u201cThunder Road\u201d and seminar \u201c Born to Run \u201d, one of the most energy rich shows of all time. Since then usually after the sensitive songs and emotional songs of \"The River\", a huge despair of \"Nebraska\", full of Born in the years of the USA, a review of the Springsteen people in the Spirit that Tom Joad, and finally a good look at the next tracks of \u201cLonesome Day\u201d and \u201cThe Rising\u201d. While the challenges of both CDs mean they are alone and the biggest hits are, for the most part, they are more representative of this rock label. And the classic The Boss, fatten the package and gives you more than your value for money by adding a whole new tape. There\u2019s a lot of rock there - \u201cNo Guns\u201d, \u201cCode of Silence\u201d live and \u201cWind\u201d are my favourites. For someone who still offers a four-hour marathon run that moves well into the fifties, this should\u2019t be surprising; I wonder how many unreleased Springsteen songs can still come out of the park, even after releasing a box with four boxes. Perhaps, in the great tradition of rock artists, Springsteen is reluctant to release the \u201cbest\u201d box office because they have no desire to label any kind of brand in this profession that could be construed as retirement. All well and good. The finals should just go to the albums. But the newcomer to Springsteen music who did\u2019t know where to start, encountered large books with more than a dozen albums, half a dozen live collections and two box sections. I was in that position a few years ago, and I can say if this collection existed then, it would make my entry into Springsteen music easy and easy to understand. Experienced fans will still stay at the table to get into rare tracks and live shows, but for newcomers looking to get started with Bosska, this is absolutely the best place.","overall":5,"summary":"Almost makes 1995's Greatest Hits package irrelevant.","unixReviewTime":1071705600,"reviewTime":"12 18, 2003"}

Both of these hit songs were featured on T. I.'s two thousand and three hit album Trap Muzik. Urban Legend is the follow-up to Trap Muzik. Urban Legend was released in late two thousand and four and is in stores now. The first single from Urban Legend, \"Bring Em Out,\" has been the party anthem of the winter club season. This was the perfect first single to be released from this album which is hot like fire. The album opens up with the song, \"Tha King,\" everyone knows that T. I. is the King of the South and the affirms this on this track. This song is followed by the mellow track, \"Motivation.\" This laid back track is the perfect album cut. T. I. fans got a taste of track \"U Don't Know Me\" at the send of the video for \"Bring Em Out.\" This trunk song really gets the club trunk to pieces. The fella's are really feeling this song.\"ASAP\" is a CRAZY track. This melodic track is just off the hook. I think this will be a great threerd for fourth single from Urban Legend. \"Why U Mad At Me,\" is another song with a crazy track. The production on Urban Legend is melodic, original, catchy and fresh. The first six tracks of Urban Legend feature T. I. doing this thing solo. Tracks seven-eleven feature guests artists. Nelly is up first on \"Get Loose.\" I personally found this collabo a bit of a disappointment. I expected more from these two powerhouse wrappers together. It's an okay album track. Fellow Southern Rapper BG is featured on \"What They Do,\" Mannie Fresh is featured on \"The Greatest,\" Lil Kim is featured on \"Get Ya S*** Together\", and Pharrell is featured on track #eleven \"Freak Through.\" Out of these four songs \"The Greatest\" seems to be radio friendly and Mannie Fresh does't disappoint with this production. \"Freak Through\" featuring Pharrell is crazy and I think it would be a great second single.\"Chillin With My B***\" is another laid back track that features Jazze Pha. So if you liked \"Let's Get Away,\" you will probably be feeling this song. One of the most anticipated songs on the album is the all-star track \"Stand Up\" which features Lil Jon, Lil Wayne, and Trick Daddy. This song is okay, a perfect album track. Urban Legend is an album that T. I. fans will enjoy. T. I. is best on the tracks by himself, the could really have carried the entire album without any guests artists.

What is a fair charge is that \"Open Season\" just in't of the same quality of \"The Decline\". It does have a fair bit going for it: the excellent \"It Ended On An Oily Stage\", powered by a plumetting bassline and a memorable tune, and the bouncy surefire single \"Please Stand Up\", which overcomes slightly muted production to explode into a bursting pop chorus imbued with melancholy and hope at once - a natural successor to \"Carrion\", perhaps. Elsewhere there are certainly points of interest: \"North Hanging Rock\" starts folk and pastoral and builds into something that almost resembles Godspeed-esque post-rock; \"How Will I Ever Find My Way Home?\", featuring bassist Hamilton on vocals, is simultaneously innocently poppy and actually the loudest thing there, boasting not inconsiderable feedback, reminding of Sebadoh; \"To Get To Sleep\" features delay-laden, sparse guitar and crashing drums. But despite the sonic interest none of these tracks quite boast the quality of the first album. What's more tracks like \"Be Gone\", while decently constructed, are very much British Sea Power by numbers. Nothing on this album is bad; merely uncaptivating. The lyrics are still opaque, metaphorical and incredibly literary: nowhere else will you find \"I love your irradescent sheen\" the chosen phrase of endearment. That in itself is endearing, but there's nothing that does it quite as brilliantly as \"Fear Of Drowning\" for, in the send, \"Carrion\".

H. I. M. - His Infernal Majesty - Origin: Finland. THE DISC: (two thousand and five) ten songs clocking in at approximately forty-five minutes. Included with the disc is a ten-page booklet containing one band photo and song lyrics. Recorded at Paramour Studios, Los Angeles, CA. This is the band's fiveth studio album. There is a limited edition disc available (complete with tin case, twenty-four-page booklet and keychain). Label - Sire Records. COMMENTS: As of two thousand and seven-eight, I am relatively new to H. I. M. - \"Dark Light\" was my first purchase. For whatever reason, I knew the name, but not the music. My love of hard rock (AC\/DC, Rush, Deep Purple, Van Halen, etc), eighty's old school heavy metal (Iron Maiden, Metallica, Sabbath\/Ozzy, etc), and newer progressive\/symphonic metal bands (Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater, Symphony X) never crossed paths with H. I. M.'s pop\/alternative\/love metal. I had H. I. M. totally misread - judging the proverbial book by its cover. I looked at H. I. M. (Valo) and saw death metal for Marilyn Manson clone (not to mention a bad version of Tim Curry in the \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\" coming to mind from the cover of \"Razorblade Romance\"). Boy. was I never wrong. So endearing was \"Dark Light\", I went out and bought all their discs. For me, it was such a wondrous find. and I initially felt that I had missed out on years of good music. As for the album, \"Dark Light\" is full of crunchy guitars and melodies. Songs are for the most part dark with a gothic stone - dealing with love (and love lost), suffering, loneliness, Heaven and Hell, redemption, sacrifice, scarred souls and aspects of suicide. This in't a guitar album per say, but Lindstrom's guitar work is as much the highlight of this album as Valo's vocals. \"Dark Light\" was the band's break through album in the US (reaching #eighteen on Billboard's Top two hundred list in two thousand and five). The album also featured two hits with \"Rip Out The Wings Of A Butterfly\" (reaching #one in Finland, and #twenty in the US - perhaps the best track on the disc), and \"Killing Loneliness\". Throughout the album you'll hear some great piano\/keyboards and orchestra players. Other highlights include the (ballad) title track, the love story in \"The Face Of God\", the melody in \"Behind The Crimson Door\", and the closer \"In The Nightside Of Eden\". Not a weak track on the disc. Try this disc - this may be a sentimental favourite for me, but after hearing all this previous albums, I feel \"Dark Light\" is the band's most slick and polished album. A great introduction to H.

Despite the fact that I love Antennas, Sunta, Chop sue, I have never bought a SOAD album before. \u201cHypnotize\u201d was the third, but that\u2019s why I applied for this album. I like all the songs except \u201cTheft Society\u201d because I think it\u2019s neutral. My favourite song there is \u201cSoldier\u2019s Side\u201d. What I like most about them, is their dynamic beauty and the mood of the animals. <c In other words it was more than I expected. After listening to the entire album, I believe Hypnotize retains the weight of SOAD\u2019s previous albums but goes to places they haven\u2019t been to yet. Mezmerize, I think, is a very good album that is unique because the band has expanded its boundaries in music. Hypnotize continues to expand but in my opinion it is better than Mezmerize. I believe this album will be a favourite of both parts of true System fans, but that\u2019s my opinion. So what\u2019s amazing about this album? Isa. Attack- started the album out cloud, thanks to insane voices from Serj and different voices from Daron.two. Dream - a bit smaller than the attack, but it looks like something was stolen from this album. very good.full. Kill Rock in Roll- this song surprised me when I heard a concert in Atlanta. The studio type is even better. One of my favourite tracks right now. far away Pretend - we\u2019ve all heard it now. It\u2019s really amazing because it\u2019s a different direction to SOAD. I like it though because it has a shipping mindset.five. Theft Society - Daron and Serj have different voices and it's crazy! He may be my favourite right now. clix Absence- slows down the previous tracks, but still a powerful song. U-Fig- great guitar work on this .ight track. Holy Mountains - this road floats in the net and sounds scary. the studio type does it justice because it looks beautiful. kind of song but very cloud, I was impressed.nine. Around Rebellion- this is the crazy song of the album. the chorus repeats \u201cbanana banana, terracotta pie\u201d. It\u2019s hard to find the meaning of this track but Serj is everywhere in this place falling one.ten. It\u2019s similar to Heroin-Daron stars in this way. It\u2019s a very good song, one of the best I look forward to. Eleven. Alone Day - my favourite of the twelve clues. Don\u2019t get me wrong this is a good song but clearly a lot of people don\u2019t like it. Probably the slowest song on any System. Twelve album. On the military side - WOW! this track is incredible. It takes from where Side Intro Soldier left Mezmerize, and I think these are the most personal and emotional words the System has written. It ends the album very high, leaving you Mezmerized and Hypnotized by what you just heard. Hopefully this will convince some new audiences to check out this group. True fans don\u2019t need to be convincing. I\u2019ve been a big fan since the self-titled album, and I was really amazed at Hypnotize. If you think Mezmerize has taken it to a higher level, you still haven\u2019t heard.","overall":5,"summary":"The beauty and the beast of metal","unixReviewTime":1136764800,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2006"}

{"orig_index":51507,"reviewerID":"A3V4CL53QT9X7N","asin":"B000CDSS2M","reviewerName":"Jef Fazekas","helpful":[14,14],"reviewText":"With her latest release, the stripped-down THE BODY ACOUSTIC, Cyndi Lauper continues to reinvent herself and relaunch her stalled career. Starting with two thousand and three's AT LAST, both Lauper and her label have been trying to make people forget that she was the Girl Who Just Wanted To Have Fun, and instead precast her as a serious singer\/songwriter. THE BODY ACOUSTIC does a good job in advancing this goal. stripped down to an acoustic setting, Lauper's lyrics are at the forefront like never before, while her voice just shines. A prime example is the opening cut, the rollicking \"Money Changes Everything.\" One of the key tracks off of Lauper's SHE'S SO UNUSUAL debut, the song's edgy new-wave groove has been replaced with a stomping salt-country one. Amid handclaps and harmonica, this song about true friends and fame (and maybe, just maybe, record company politics) takes on a totally different vibe twenty-two years down the road; you can just hear the experience and hard-won knowledge in Lauper's voice as she sings the lines \"They shake your hand and they smile\/And they buy you a drink\/They say we'll be your friends\/We'll stick with you until the send\/Ah but everybody's only\/Looking out for themselves.\" Still a true winner! \"All Through The Night\" has a quiet elegance to it, and could have done very nicely on it's own without Shaggy's rasta wrap, which seems calculated and stacked on at the last minute for the guest star of-factor. \"Time After Time\" is probably one of the most beautiful ballads of the last forty-five years, and it's hard to imagine Lauper improving upon the original, but she does just that. Presented there as a duet with Sarah McLachlan, the track is even more delicate and lovely than the first time around. Once again, it seems as if Lauper (and McLachlan for that matter!) is table to draw from years of experience now, and infuses the cut with all that knowledge, spain and insight. I don't use the word \"masterpiece\" very often, but this is one time when it truly fits! \"She Bop\" is one of the tracks that most benefits from THE BODY ACOUSTIC's starker arrangements. Devoid of the frantic space and synth-heavy tempo of the original, this code to that greatest of taboos (for those of you who've been in a coma the last twenty-three years. that would be self-pleasuring!!) takes on a more intimate, almost pleading, vibe, reaching it's zenith with a line that pretty much got buried in the original version's mix (\"I bop. you bop. a. they bop\/Be bop. be bop. a. flu. she bop\/I hope He will understand\"). The whistling is also a nice touch. VERY cool! From there we segue into the disc's two new tracks, the sublime \"Above The Clouds\" and the emotional \"I'll Be Your River.\" \"Above The Clouds\" (written for Lauper's young son) has a muted quality to it, which is actually a good thing. it allows both Lauper's heartfelt vocal and Jeff Beck's tasteful guitar to absolutely sparkle. \"I'll Be Your River\", a soul-tinged torch ballad for Lauper's husband, is a mix of fear, heat, yearning, support, devotion and trepidation. in other words, it covers all the bases of love and commitment, much like a real relationship. Lauper has rarely sounded so soulful and earthy, and the lyrics are both touching and painful (\"Here stands a fortress built with great walls of silence\/Ready to crumble at the slightest word\/Finding the right one is becoming a science\/I'd like to scream but I main't gonna be heard\"). Yet, in the send, Lauper lets us know that, even with all the spain and work and uncertainty, it just might be worth it after all (\"What if all these fears\/That we both buy into\/Melt away and disappear\"). Lovely! The thing that becomes most apparent upon hearing these two tracks is that it's time for Lauper to get in the studio and record a full album of new original material: between these two tracks and a number of the lost SHINE cuts, she's writing some of the best songs of her career. I've always felt that \"Sisters Of Avalon\" never got it's just dues, in large part due to record company politics (Lauper's label had pretty much written her off by the time the album of the same name came out in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). There's a pulsating, driving energy to the song that's still evident in this more unadorned version, and Lauper's vocals soar, particularly on the borderline wrapped bridge (\"They brought her in in a new white dress\/But the stain left an cache on her mother's breast\/Now all that's left are the ghostly steps from a distant corridor\"). Anchored by a throbbing baseline and Ani DiFranco's and Vivian Green's sterling harmony vocals, this is still an undiscovered gem! The same can't be said for \"Shine\". as a relatively new cut - the title cut of Lauper's non-US released two thousand and one CD - the singer makes the mistake of doing an almost note for note version of the original track. It would have been much cooler to see her do it as, say, an almost spoken word ballad, just to shake things up. \"True Colors\" is both sweet and raw (as well as a tad bit pitch!), while \"Water's Edge\" is nakedly haunting. The disc could have easily ended on a strong note with \"Fearless\", all folksy and bare-boned. Instead, we get the only real bomb on TBA, a frantic, silly version of \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\", featuring Japanese super-stars (?) Puffi AmiYumi. This signature song of Lauper's has been remixed and prerecorded so many times that this would have been the perfect time to try something new, say, a hushed, bare bones acoustic arrangement. Too bad. But, overall, I've got to say THE BODY ACOUSTIC is a very nice reworking of some classic Cyndi Lauper material. However, I also have to reiterate. it's time for Lauper to get back in the studio and record an album of new original material (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics, something extra rare on best-of's and are-recording packages).","overall":4,"summary":"Great Reworkings.....Now Bring On The New Original Material!","unixReviewTime":1137974400,"reviewTime":"01 23, 2006"}

Since the last two and three thousand, Lauper and this brand have been trying to make people forget that she is a girl who not only wants to have fun, but also has her vision as a singer \/ songwriter. BODY ACOUSTIC has done a great job in advancing this goal. Simplified in the case of the original sound, Lauper's voice is in a way that has never been seen before, while this voice shines brightly. A common example is the opening clip, which enjoys \u201cmoney changes everything\u201d. One of Lauper SHE'S SO UNSUAL debut songs, the new savant-garde wave groove of this song has been replaced by a salty country country song.

Sing with Sarah McLachlan there, this song is softer and sweeter than the first time. I don't use the word \"masterpiece\" all the time, but this is the right time! \"She Bop\" is one of the most popular songs in BODY ACOUSTIC's strict setting. they stay in a coma for days twenty-three years ago. That would be fun !!) In a close relationship, In a nearly pleasantly case, I reached the point with a line almost buried in the first mix (\"I bop. You bop. A. They bop \/ Be bop. Be bop.a.flu. She bop \/ \u6211 Hope you understand \"). Whistling is also a good way. Very cool! From there we have switched to two new songs on the record, namely \u201cabove the clouds\u201d and the feeling \u201cI will be your river\u201d. \"Above the clouds\" (written for Lauper's youngest son) has a soft texture, which is really nice. It makes Lauper's loyal singing and Jeff Beck's beautiful guitar brighter. \"I Will Be Your River\" is a soulful torch ball from Lauper's husband, who is a mixture of fear, desire, longing, support, devotion and fear. In other words, it covers all the basics of love and commitment, like true relationships. Lauper rarely sounds loving and simple, touching and hurtful words (\"Here's a castle built with a great Big Wall \/ Ready to collapse in a small word \/ Finding the right person becomes a science \/ I like to shout, but mostly I won't be heard\"). However, in posting, Lauper informed us that with all of Spain, work and uncertainty, it would be better after all (\"What if all these fears \/ we accept \/ melt away and disappear\"). After hearing these two songs, the most obvious point is that it\u2019s time for Lauper to enter the studio and record a full album of new original stuff: between these two songs and some lost SHINE clips, the writes one of this best songs. of your work. I have always felt that \"Sisters Of Avalon\" I did not get but a required membership, largely due to the politics of the recording company (record label Lauper almost cancelled this one hundred and ninety when the album of the same name was released one hundred and ninety times. Seven). In this more radical version, the song is still a moving, driving force, Lauper's voice is cloud, especially on the fringe-wrapped bridge (\"They brought her a new white dress \/ But the stain left her bare breasts on her mother's clothes \/ Now. Based on the foundation of the beat and the pure words of Ani DiFranco and Vivian Green's harmony, this is still an unknown treasure! The same cannot be said of \"Shine\". As a relatively new clip - a clip of two thousand titles and one CD released by Lauper in a non-US space - the singer made a mistake and almost made a note on the translation of the original song. It would be more fun to see him do this, for example, a ballad that is almost colloquial, just to change the situation. \"Real color\" are fun and original (in a small stone!), While the \"Water Border\" is naked. This record concludes easily with a strong \u201cDon\u2019t Be Afraid\u201d article, and everyone can\u2019t be humble. Instead, we found the only real bomb in the TBA, which is a crazy version of \"Girls just want to have fun\", featuring Japanese (()) Puffi AmiYumi stars. Lauper's iconic song has been mixed and rewritten many times, and this will be a great time to try new things, such as a quiet, nude sound. that's bad. However, in general, I must say that BODY ACOUSTIC is an excellent adaptation of some of Cyndi Lauper's antiquities. However, I have to repeat. It\u2019s time for Lauper to go back to the studio and record a new album for the first time (like all of my comments, give this one half star a star if it has words, more rare among the best albums, and a Yes-recording package).","overall":4,"summary":"Great Reworkings.....Now Bring On The New Original Material!","unixReviewTime":1137974400,"reviewTime":"01 23, 2006"}

For the past two and a half thousand years, both Lauper and her label have been trying to make people forget that she was a new aspiring girl, and instead they broadcast her as a determined singer \/ songwriter. Body acoustics do a great job of advancing this goal. Low in music, Lapper's voice is louder than never, while this voice just shines. An important example is the opening kit, \"Money changes everything.\" One of the most important tracks from Lauper's SHE'S SO UNUSUAL debut is a new song that has been replaced by the world of salt. Between handclaps and harmonica, this song about true friends and fame (and, perhaps, a political company's record) presents itself on the street in a very different way for twenty-two years. You can only hear the hard-hitting information and information in Lapper's voice as the sings these lines \"They shake your hand and smile \/ And they buy you a drink \/ They say we're your Will be friends \/ We'll be with you until it's done.

Launched as a duet with Sarah McLachlan, the track is softer and more charming than never. Again, it seems that Lauper (and McClellan of this story!) Is now a drawing table with years of experience, and it involves cutting off all that knowledge, span and understanding. I don't use the word \"art\" often, but it's a time when it fits well! \"She Bop\" is one of the most popular body tracks. Without any clutter and the original synth heavy tempo, this code gets the most unacceptable (for those who have been in a coma for the last twenty-three years.

Lauper has never planted a soul and soil, and the words of the soldiers are touching and heartbreaking (\"Here stands a fortress of peace.\" Built with great walls \/ to crumble in a small sound Ready \/ Finding the right becomes science \/ I like to scream but I won't be heard \"). However, in the posting, Lauper informs us that, despite all the span and work and uncertainty, it can benefit after all (\"What if all this fear \/ that we both buy internally \/ we Melt and disappear \"). Dear! The most notable thing the heard when the heard the two songs was that it was time for Lauper to enter the studio and record an album full of real new things: between these two songs and the number of Shine Kits, the would write some songs. Is. In one of the best songs of all time, I've always felt that \"Sisters of Avalon\" did't get what they deserved, especially because of the company's political recordings (Lauper's label was so close to him at the time When the album of the same name one thousand nine hundred and nine hundred). The song beats, the drumming is still seen in this unconventional version, and Loper's voice grew louder, especially on the bridge over the border (\"They brought him in a white probe.

The same can't be said about \"Shine.\" CD Released - The Artist Made a Mistake in Making Almost Every Version of the Original Song. For \"True Color\" is fun and green (and a bit of a pitch!), While \"Waters Edge\" moves nude. The disc could easily have ended with a strong \"Fearless\" note, all unusual. And bone-free. Instead, we only get the real bomb in TBA, the crazy, stupid genre of \"girls just want to have fun\", including the well-known Japanese (()) Puffy Amyomi.

After a few stray shots that haven't been received well by many fans, Ghostface resurfaces with an album that is arguably this best since this Ironman album.

And even though there are a few classic tracks on those middle albums, they did't come anywhere near this debut album. Obviously the critics and fans penetrated this head enough for him to take this time to get this focus back. Now Ghost drops Fishscale, the beginning of a second wind for the Wu alum. From the start of the album, it becomes apparent that Ghostface main't playing this time around. After an vicious introduction, Ghost goes right into overdrive with \"Shakey Dog,\" a standout track that will put you right back to the Ironman days. He continues the same feel when the pairs off with RaekwonThe Chef once again on head-rocking \"Kilo.\" \"The Champ\" is the dis track that the underground has been eating up since the album started getting leaked. \"nine Milli Bros\" brings the Wu-Tang Clan collective back together to show that the crew is ready to make things right again. After a few skits, Ghost drops a short story on \"Crack Spot.\" The Chef Raekwon returns on \"R. A. G. U.,\" another prime example of the what the game's been missing for the last ten years. \"Whip You With A Strap\" is a narrative about the good role days when you could whoop your kids without Child Protective Services knocking at your door.\"Back Like That\" featuring R&B;'s newest sensation Ne-Yo is a story about a girlfriend who gets back at her unfaithful boyfriend by sleeping with this march enemy. \"Be Easy\" featuring Trife is nothing short of a rocking' house party record. Trife also guests on the aggressive \"Clipse of Doom.\" \"Jellyfish\" featuring Cappadonna, Shawn Wigs, and Trife could have had a better beat but still offers first-rate lyrics nonetheless. \"Dogs Of War\" features a marathon of verses from Ghostface, Raekwon, Cappadonna, Trife, and Sun God. \"Big Girl\" is just like Nas' \"You're A Big Girl Now\" only Ghostface resorts to wrapping over the entire original song by the Stylistics! \"Underwater\" is an unnecessary addition, but it does't detract too much from the rest the album. \"Momma\" features superb lyrics from Ghost and an 'Ashanti clone' named Megan Rochell. \"Three Bricks\" closes out the album with guest vocals from Raekwon and a borrowed verse from the late Notorious B. I. G. Ghostface Killah should be very happy with the work to took to make Fishscale so spectacular. And with fans and critics hailing this as the biggest release of two thousand and six so far, it will no doubt be the unofficial resurrection of this career if not the whole Wu-Tang Clan family.

It is clear that critics and fans alike have reached the point where it took so long to restore that focus. Now Ghost Fish takes the scale down, the second wind in Woo Alum begins. From the beginning of the album, it is clear that Ghost Fees is not running in it. After a brutal presentation, Ghost enters the extreme drive called \"Suspicious Dog\", which will bring you back to the days of Iron Man. He continues to feel the same way when the two of them go out with \"Requiem Chef\" over and over again. \"The Champ\" is a song that has been played underground since the album began to leak. \"Nine Milli Bros\" includes a collection of Wu-Tang Clan to show that the party is ready to get things right again. After a few games, Ghost dropped a short story \"Crack Spot\". Chef Recon returned from \"RAGU\", another great example of what the game has been lacking for over a decade. \"Whip You With A Strap\" describes the wonderful days in which Child Protective Services was table to entertain your children without knocking on your door.

I. G. Ghostface Killah. And since fans and critics have hailed it as the biggest release of twenty-six, zero so far, it would undoubtedly be an illegal resurrection for the work, if not for the entire Wu Tang family.

Seriously. OMGI hope that Rolling Stone was practising their prolific powers when they declared that Santogold was the \"future of music\" because I could totally get all wrapped up in this new wave of artistry. For the record, I am not a gigantic fan of M. I. A., an artist who Santogold happens to draw comparisons to. I mean, I like M. I. A., but I find that overall her style overshadows any real substance and her work resembles the early stages of a well intentioned experiment. Santogold fine-tunes that same experiment, with stunning results. A flawless mix of punk, industrial, jazz, ska, R&B;, ship-hop, dance, techno, African tribal and just about anything else you can think of, Santogold's self titled album is the definition of music. Santi White's vocals are nothing short of tantalizing, simply haunting in their almost eerie sense of provocative sensuality. You are intrigued as much as you are cautious. For me, there are a few prime standouts. Both versions of `You'll Find A Way' are just stunning, especially the album version, which for me feels a bit more organic. The punk rock overtones are flawlessly incorporated into Santi's vocal styling, creating something so absorbing and engaging; and that chaotic burst of chorus chanting is just the epitome of captivating. The `Switch and Sinden Remix' plays on the Indian influences that are prominent in Santi's exotic voice, but it adds a nice twist with the industrial take of ship-hop beats that just make for a brilliant variation of a brilliant song. `Creator' is very much along these lines of greatness, using fun and unique beats to stir excitement in the listener. Santi certainly delivers the explosion!`Say Aha' almost feels like a Sublime song in stone, but there is certainly ship-hop influences that flourish there and there. `L. E. S. Artistes' calls to mind Sting and The Police, and the vocals even remind me a tad of Gwen Stefani. This is certainly a pop inspired track that is destined for radio play, and it shows a more commercial side of Santogold, since the remainder of the album basically throws `commercial' to the wind.`Shove It' took a while to really grow on me (I initially found the repetitive chorus to be rather annoying) but the blues style jazz flow immediately caught my interest and made me give the song more of my attention. The lyrical message is also quite stirring, and after a few listens it has slowly crept up to the middle of my list. `Unstoppable' can get a little repetitive in parts (\"I've got to be unstoppable\") but the musical arrangement is so catchy and engaging. `Lights Out' is possibly the only song that has't really grown on me. The feel is very different (light girl pop indie rock) and while it's far from a bad song, it just does't really mesh with the rest of the album to me and kind of becomes forgettable. Seriously though. OMG`I'm a Lady' feels similar in ways to `Lights Out', but it also feels a little more polished. It also feels like it plays to subtle R&B; influences that make it feel a little more connected to the album, even though this album is really all over the place when it comes to influences. Two of the best songs on the album sandwich the one forgettable track (`Lights Out'). `My Superman' and `Starstruck' are just brilliant. I love the mellowed out vibe to `My Superman', an eerie chemistry with the sound coming through from every caching word. This is one of those song that `transports' you to a totally different place. `Starstruck' is similar in stone, playing off of Santi's enticing vocal display. She heightens her pitch and creates her own instrument, complemented by the twitchy beeps and sounds that litter the backing beats. The album closer (unless you count the remix of `You'll Find A Way' as the closer) is just stunning. `Anne' puts all of the best Santogold has to offer on display, offering a subtle yet absorbing beat placed with enticing vocals and haunting lyrics. Not since Robyn's self titled mind-blow have I been this completely provoked by a particular album. Sure, there are a few albums that I've reviewed recently that I may prefer overall (V. V. Brown's debut album `Traveling Like the Light' is exceptionally perfect), this is one of the most interesting, experimental and admirable albums I've heard in a long time, and should prove to be a masterful jump off point for this extremely talented artist!

On a side note, I\u2019m not a big fan of MOI, an part that dares to be compared to Santogold. I mean, I like M. I. A., but I\u2019ve found that its overall design covers every real thing and its work seems to be in the early stages of a well -planned experiment. Santogold did well in both experiments, with amazing results. A flawless mix of punk, industry, jazz, ska, R&B ;, ship-hop, dance, craft, African tribes and whatever you can think of, Santogold\u2019s album titled is the meaning of music . Santi White\u2019s voice is meaningless, only capturing their surprising sense of urgency. You are interested as long as you are careful. For me, there are some important areas. The two types of \u2018You\u2019ll Find a Way\u2019 are just amazing, especially the album type, which for me pretty much feels that way. Punk rock sounds are seamlessly integrated into Santi\u2019s sound arrangement, creating something catchy and catchy; and that the chaotic excitement of the song is only a symbol of attraction. \u2018Switch\u2019 and Sinden Remix play under the influence of the famous Indian soundtrack Santi, but it adds a nice twist to the industry of ship-hop beats making it a fantastic variation of an amazing lens.

The factors remember Sting and the Police, and the voices even remind me of tad Gwen Stefani. It\u2019s actually a pop -inspired track for the radio game, and it shows a lot of Santogold\u2019s commercial, as the rest of the album usually throws \u2018business\u2019 into the air. me (At first I found the repetitive chorus annoying) but the flow of jazz style blues immediately caught my interest and I was table to give my attention to the song. The literary message was also very good, and after some listening it slowly came out in the middle of my list. \u2018Unstoppable\u2019 can be a bit repetitive in parts (\u201cI have to be unstoppable\u201d) but the music editing is intriguing and enticing. \u2018Lights Out\u2019 was probably the only song that did\u2019t really grow on me. It feels very different (simple pop indie rock girl) and although it\u2019s far from a bad song, it just ignores the rest of the album me and some of it kind of becomes memorable. But seriously. OMG `I am a Lady 'feels similar to the' Light Out 'ways, but it also feels pretty bright. He also feels like the\u2019s playing R&B; the effects feel a little connected to the album, even though this album is really ubiquitous when it comes to effects. Two of the most beautiful songs on a sandwich album in a forgotten way (\u2018Lights Out\u2019). \u2018My Superman\u2019 and \u2018Starstruck\u2019 are just beautiful. I love the backward nature of `` `man man man aga okay '' ,,, which is a very bad chemical with a sound coming out of every hidden word. It\u2019s one of those songs that \u2018brought you\u2019 to a completely different place. \u2018Starstruck\u2019 is rocky, playing to Santi\u2019s charming soundtrack. It raises the stone and creates its own device, complemented by the lies and repetitive sounds of drum beats. The closest door (if you don\u2019t count the \u2018You\u2019ll Find a Way\u2019 combination as close as possible) is just amazing.

OMGI is hopeful that the Rolling Stones are exerting their full potential when announcing Santogold's \"musical future\", as I can be fully immersed in this new part conference. Make it clear that I am not a big fan of MIA, M. I. A. casts Santogold happening in comparison to it. I mean, I love MIA, but I find that her full style hides anything real, and her work is like the first stages of a well-intentioned trial. Santogold well prepared the same experiment and got amazing results. Santogold's eponymous album perfectly combines punk, industry, jazz, ska, R&B, boat jumping, dance, electronic music, African nations, and any music you can think of. Santi White's singing is very tempting, and the most memorable is the almost shocking joke. He is very interesting and very careful. To me, there are a few great people who excel. Both versions of \"You'll Find the Way\" are amazing, especially the version of the album, which feels natural to me. The punk rock song is perfectly integrated into Santi's vocal style, creates something interesting and interesting, and the chaotic choir song is an interesting show. \u201cSwitch and Sinden Remix\u201d played an outstanding Indian impact on Santi\u2019s unusual sound, but added a beautiful twist to the rhythm of an industrial boat, bringing just a stark contrast to the stunning song. The \"creator\" is well suited to these great techniques, using interesting and special beats to entertain the audience. Santi has announced the explosion! 'Say Aha' sounds almost like a low-key song, but there must be some exciting jumping experience there and there. `L. E. S. Artistes reminds me of Sting and the Police, and the human voice reminds me of Gwen Stefani. Surely this is a song inspired by pop music, set to be played on the radio, showing the commercial side of Santogold, because the whole album leaves \"commercial\" behind. It took me a while to \"take it off\" to develop it (at first I found the repetitive choir annoying) but the jazz flow of the style immediately aroused my interest and made me pay more attention to the song. The message with the songs is also very touching. After listening to it a few times, it slowly came down the middle of my list. The \"unstoppable\" part may be a recurring theme (\"I must be unstoppable\"), but the musical arrangement is appealing and interesting. \"Outdoor Light\" may be the only song I've never met. It sounds very different (the indie stone of a bright girl), although it is far from a bad song, to me it does not fit the whole album, and it is easy to forget. But seriously. OMG `I'm a Lady 'feels the same as` Lights Are Lights', but is also much improved. It also sounds like it's playing clever R&B; although the disc is ubiquitous in terms of impact, its impact makes it feel more connected to the album. Two of the best songs on the album are contained in a memorable song (\"Lights Shine\"). \"My Superman\" and \"Star Trek\" are just amazing. I love the cool air of \"My Superman\", which happens to be a shocking chemical that makes the sound of every word stored in cached. This is a song that \u201cmoves\u201d into a completely different place. \"Starstruck\" is very similar to stone, using Santi's seductive vocal performance.

The 'Switch and Sundance Remix' runs on Indian influences, notable in Santi's unique voice, but has a nice twist and industrial effect to the beat of the ship shop, creating a wonderful variation on the animated song.

I like the cool movie 'My Superman', a great chemistry that sounds from all the words in the archive. This is one of the songs that is moving to a completely different place.

I'm sorry to release the CD instead of actually buying the hard copy. I never realized what an important part of listening to Alice's CD was being read and the names of the characters on my own until I could do it. But my passion for music did not diminish in any way.

The stylized, hyper-magnified fragility of her performances is the biggest strength of Portishead's Third. In \"Nylon Smile,\" she pleads, \"I don't know what I've done to deserve you, and I don't know what I'll do without you,\" and her voice veritably quivers with hurt, you can easily imagine her as a poor wounded bird, plaintively lamenting her cruel fate. In many songs, she dwells with similar helplessness and sensitivity on feelings like, \"hoping I might change a little, hoping that I might be someone I want to be,\" \"tormented inside life, wounded and afraid,\" and \"I'm just emotionally undone, I can't deny I can't be someone else.\"That's the predominant stone of Third, but Gibbons also does a magnificently calm, distanced stone in \"Machine Gun,\" and becomes a bit warmer in \"Deep Water\" and \"The Rip.\" Eventually, the melodrama feels more like the style of an old silent film, for a story by Stefan Zweig, than like typical nineties-style angst. Gibbons' vocal style hasalwaysrecalled old torch songs, and she has lost none of her touch in the eleven years that passed since thelastPortishead album. If anything, she's spookier, more mysterious now. However, the music on Third is obsessively, insistently rudimentary, even for a minimalist decade like the two thousands. It's not \"repetitive\" in the sense that, say,Ladytronare repetitive. Third is full of surprises and changes: the abrupt ending of \"Silence,\" a fast keyboard line suddenly interrupting the slow space of \"Hunter,\" a cloud crescendo in \"Small,\" glitchy effects in \"Plastic.\" But these surprises have no musical content whatsoever. The keyboard line in \"Hunter\" plays a very simple scale, up and down; the crescendo in \"Small\" is a one-note keyboard line. Many songs prominently feature a shrill drone -- not a \"droning keyboard line,\" as one might write about a post-punk album, but a plain, unadorned beeping sound, either continuous for repeated. \"Silence\" begins with one (around zero:thirty). So does \"Magic Doors.\" So does \"We Carry On.\" These are not small, insignificant details; they actually form the musical score of the album. Things get a little more exciting with the rare appearance of a distorted electric guitar, at the send of \"Silence\" and \"Small,\" but there, too, it plays basic chords, covered in reverb. The issue is laid out starkly in \"Machine Gun.\" The drum track is lifted from New Order's \"Blue Monday.\" Okay, fine: steal from the best, everything old is new again, and so on. But New Order's song had about a dozen different unforgettable hooks apart from the drum track. \"Machine Gun\" not only has no other hooks, it has no other music, except for a short keyboard line (heavily reminiscent of ninetiesMOD music) in the send. But for most of its duration, Gibbons sings over just this drum track. To add variation, they produce the drum track in two ways -- a cold \"industrial\" sound and a louder, clanging spot-beating sound. They alternate. The send. If not for the striking, cold clarity of Gibbons' voice, there would be nothing to discuss. Not that it's all bad, but the good parts generally occur when the music does't try to call attention to itself, and retreats into the background (\"Hunter,\" \"Threads,\" \"Deep Water\"). Occasionally it is used to sort of gently guide the stone of Gibbons' vocal performance. The best such moment is on \"The Rip,\" perhaps the best song on the album, where a slight increase in tempo leads to a warm, dreamy climax. When the music is at the forefront, however, it can be quite frustrating to listen to. This style can be traced back to Radiohead'sKid A, particularly \"The National Anthem,\" which also simulated musical techniques using essentially non-musical stand-in sounds. Occasionally there are hints of Bjork'sHomogenic(the drum track in \"Plastic\" would have felt at home there), except without the pop moments. Overall, though, the sound of Third is closer toVolta, another musical simulacrum, featuring a wide array of instruments (diligently noted by reviewers) that failed to play anything of any interest at all. The minimalism of Third is anticlimactic. Exactly like Kid A, the careful space and the jarring sound suggest an album that requires careful attention and repeated listening, but in the send, the music reveals much less than it promises. It remains to listen to Third for Gibbons' often-amazing vocals, and treat the music as an occasionally pleasant backdrop.","overall":3,"summary":"Powerful vocals, meager instrumentation.","unixReviewTime":1230163200,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2008"}

However, when the music is playing, listening can be discouraging.

Sometimes there will be a tip for Bjork's Homogenic (drum song on \"Plastic\" will feel at home there), unless there's a famous moment. However, in general, the third sound is closer to Volta, another musical simulacrum, with different instruments (critics have carefully explained), but they can't play anything interesting. Third minimalism is anticlimactic. Just like Kid A, the intellectual space and the rough sound suggest an album that requires careful attention and repeated listening, but on delivery, the music reveals much less than it promises.

Gibbons' vocals have always been reminiscent of old Flashlight songs, and the has never lost touch with Portshead's latest album in the last eleven years. If so, you are a ghost, no longer a real human being. However, the music of the third is extremely, strong, meaningless, even a decade as small as two thousand. It is not \"repetitive\" in the sense that, say, Ladytronare is repetitive. The third is full of surprises and changes: the immediate send of \"Silence\", a quick keyboard line that suddenly affects the \"Hunter\" 's slow space, small, shiny effects from the cloudy Crescendo to \"Plastic\". But there is no music in these wonders. The keyboard line in \"Hunter\" plays a very simple scale up and down. In \"Small\", Crescendo is a notebook keyboard number. Many of the songs include drones - not \"drum lines\", as one might write about a post-punk album, but an audible, unadorned, repetitive sound. \"Peace\" begins with one (approximately zero: thirty). The same is true of the \"magic door.\" Similarly, \"we move forward.\" These are not trivial, petty details. They actually make music points for the album. Things get even more interesting with the unusual shape of a twisted electric guitar, where \"peace\" and \"little\" are sent, but even there, the basic songs are played, covered with a conscience. The problem is clearly stated in the \"machine gun\". The drummer was nominated for \"Blue Monday\" for the New Order. OK, OK: Be the best, all the old are new again, and so on. But the New Order song had about twelve memorable notes outside the drum track. The \"machine gun\" has no other hook, no other music, except for the short keyboard line (reminiscent of nineties music) on shipping. But most of the time, Gibbon sings about this drum song. To add variety, they produce drums in two ways - a cool \"industrial\" sound and a very audible, local sound. They take turns. Sent. If it were't for the wonderful, cool explanation of Gibbons' voice, there would be nothing to talk about. It's not that everything is bad, but the good parts are often when the music does't try to catch the eye, and then back off (\"Hunter,\" \"Rope,\" \"Deep Water\"). It is sometimes used to fix Gibbons' soundtrack. One such great moment is in \"The Rip\" which is probably the best song on the album, where a slight increase in tempo leads to a warm, dreamy climax. However, when the music is high quality, listening to it can be frustrating. This style can be traced back to Radio Head's Kid A, specifically the \"national anthem\", which also mimics musical techniques using non-stop stylistic sounds. Sometimes there is a suggestion of bjork photogenic (the drum song \"Plastic\" used to play there in the house), outside of pop times. Overall, however, the sound of the third is close to that of Volta, another musical musculacrum, which has many instruments (carefully marked by reviewers) that have failed to play anything interesting. Third, minimalism is anticlimactic. Just like Kid A, a careful space and cloud sound picks up an album that requires careful attention and listening over and over again, but in posting, the music shows far less than its promise. It's up to you to hear the voices of the Third Gibbons, who are always great, and present the music from time to time as a fun background.","overall":3,"summary":"Powerful vocals, meager instrumentation.","unixReviewTime":1230163200,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2008"}

The softness, the super softness of its performance is the Third Strength of Portishead. In \u201cNylon Smile\u201d, the asked, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I did to deserve it, and I don\u2019t know what I would do without it,\u201d and this voice was really trembling with injury, thinking that the was a poorly wounded bird., clearly mourning this cruel fate. In many songs, she lives with the same help and sensitivity to emotions such as, \u201cHopefully change a little, hope to be the person I want to be,\u201d \u201csuffering in life, hurt and scared,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m just emotional. , I can\u2019t deny that I can\u2019t be different. \u201dhot\u201c Deep Water \u201dand\u201c Rip. \u201dFinally, the melodrama feels more like the style of an old -fashioned movie, a story written by Stefan Zweig, than never before in the nineties. Gibbons \u2019vocal style is always reminiscent of old candle songs, and the has\u2019t lost this touch eleven years since this latest album at Portishead. If anything, the was more talkative than the is now. However, the music in the Third is very rhythmic, and enduring, even at least a decade like two thousand. This is not a \u201crecurrence\u201d meaning, say, a recurring Ladytronare. The third is full of surprises and changes: the sudden send of \"Silence,\" a quick code that suddenly interrupts the slow \"Hunter,\" the crescendo cloud of \"Little,\" the enamel effect of \"Plastic.\" But these amazing things also don\u2019t have music. The \u201cHunter\u201d keyboard line plays very slightly, up and down; The \u201cSmall\u201d crescendo is a single-key keyboard line. Many songs clearly describe a cracked plane - not a \u201crough keyboard line,\u201d as someone might have written about a post -punk album, but an unchanged, repetitive sound. \u201cSilence\u201d starts with one (around zero: thirty). Also \"Doors of Magic\". Like, \"We're driving.\" They are not quite detailed; they really make music points on the album. Things are a bit more interesting with the rare look of a twisted electric guitar, when sent to \u201cSilence\u201d and \u201cMinor,\u201d but there too, it plays on the main chords, covered by a reversal. The issue is widely presented in \u201cGun Machine\u201d. The path to the drums is taken from the New Order of \u201cBlue Monday\u201d. So, good: steal the best, everything old is new again, and so on. But the song New Order has almost a dozen different hooks that are memorable other than the drum track. \u201cMachine Machine\u201d has no other hooks, no other music, except for a short keyboard line (reminiscent of ninety -nine MOD music) for transmission. But for the most part, Gibbons sings along with this drum. To add variety, they make a drum beat in two ways-a cool \u201cindustrial\u201d sound and a cloud, point-to-beat beat. They are different. The sender. If not for the evidence, the cold evidence of Gibbons \u2019voice, nothing should be discussed. Not everything is bad, but the good parts usually happen when the music does\u2019t try to call itself, and goes back to the background (\u201cHunter,\u201d \u201cThreads,\u201d \u201cDeep Water\u201d). Sometimes it is used to gently guide the Gibbons rock sound. The best time for this kind of thing is \u201cThe Rip,\u201d which is probably the best song on the album, where a little bit of temporary boost brings out a high level of heat, dreaming. When music is in the lead, however, it can be very boring to listen to. This style can be traced back to Radiohead\u2019sKid A, specifically \u201cNational Anthem,\u201d which also mimics musical techniques using non-verbal sounds. Sometimes there are hints of Bjork\u2019sHomogenic (the \u201cPlastic\u201d drum line will feel at home there), except for no pop moments to be found. Overall, however, Third Sound is close to Volta, another musical instrument, featuring a massive instrument (carefully mentioned by the reviewers) that fails to play any interest. The third Minimalism is anticlimactic. Like Kid A, a discreet spot and jug-jug sound suggests an album that requires careful attention and frequent listening, but in delivery, the music shows less than it promised. It\u2019s up to you to listen to the most shocking voice of the Third Gibbons, and treat the music as a great and beautiful occasion.","overall":3,"summary":"Powerful vocals, meager instrumentation.","unixReviewTime":1230163200,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2008"}

Carol: What the does with \"wild horses\" is amazing. Carol: What she did with McJeger's song \"Wild Horses\" is amazing. There is no doubt that many types of showbiz feel in the depths of \"nightmares\" like Susan's. For some - another difficult story of an emerging person who has never paid a real fee. There is another way to look at it. There are all kinds of payments. Yes, there are trials and tribulations as well as real sacrifices that People dedicate themselves to the fellowship that they have to go through years of posting, without guaranteeing a reward for the post. That's exactly right. Duck \"which was found late by the name of Paul Potts), we must acknowledge that we have faced some painful experiences, painful disappointments and many other challenges that we must overcome. But more We are talking about devils there. And traumatic health conditions. Although this in't the kind of music Susan chooses, most of us who are deep into rock in roll know something about DYI ethics. Influenced astronomers sometimes lie (in some corners) the long-held idea that there is a big difference between a talented startup and a real artist. It has nothing to do with the success of the global Alien Pages that late flower players like Susan Boyle have their place. Having said that, I'm somehow disappointed with Susan's beginnings. I'm not sure what to expect in terms of song preparation and selection, but it was probably no different than the one we ended up with. It impressed me that the and Simon dug an old Stones ballet to someone in the administration, the can't say anything about the famous Patty Griffin song that really suits a large audience. However, one of the best things she could bring to the table - at least in her TV shows - was a solid, solid and sound delivery that was quite fun, but richer than the current ingenue crop ( Jones really can't using, even). But almost every word on this record sounds \"fun\" in my untrained years. The sentiments the has expressed about BRITAIN's GOT TALENT seem to have become unnecessarily strong. (I say \"for no reason\" because the was't really an artist who was crowded from the start). Her producers seem determined to make her sound like she's in her twenties, not her fifties. The inspiring word used in \"Wild Horses\" may indicate the \"other side\" of Susan Boyle, but unfortunately, it is less well known. YouTube's favourite favourites \"I Dreamed a Dream\" and \"Cry Me A River\" improved, but the first was much stronger than it should have been. I'm not so sure that in the case of Ms. Boyle, very little IS. Cabaret's style is \"cry\". However, it is very beautiful, and the very small sound works well there. The fact is that some iTunes, though very interesting, do not have everything that the words want (\"Day Dream Believer\" and \"You'll See It\") add to the sense of winning. It really gives Madonna a chance to claim her money in \"You'll See\" and I'm sure the song has a different meaning than her composer. In her personal comment on \"Daydream Believer\", Susan referred to the edited lyrics as \"Tomorrow's times don't make sense\" personally. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, of course, when a female singer sings a real \"cold shave and sting\", because women shave too, but everyone does their job. Changing \"sleeping gene\" to \"sleeping gene\" in this version is more than perfect, but why is the narrator still \"white horse on horseback\"? Maybe it's John of Arc's thing. Patty Griffin's song \"Up to the Mountain\" was written as a tribute to Martin Luther King, and although it would be nice to get approval, the current version is still faithful. Prevention works there - as in the case of the original Griffin. The \"wonderful grace\" is good news, but it is also a course. Susan stays in the field throughout the song. That's the decent thing to do, and it should send there. It has been pointed out that each song has a special meaning for Susan, and her liner notes show you what it is. In the old oak, \"the send of the world,\" the is careful to say that this is not true, \"this is just the beginning.\" We know this, Susan. This is just a song. But the dark voices forced him to speak louder than we see anywhere else. Like the television version of \"I Dreamed A Dreamed\", you drew the stops in the line \"In the hell I live in\". It does not do this in the recorded version. And I miss you a little bit.","overall":5,"summary":"Ah...Ms. Boyle...","unixReviewTime":1267833600,"reviewTime":"03 6, 2010"}

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"In two thousand and nine, original Guns `N' Roses and sex-Velvet Revolver guitar virtuoso Slash (a.k.a. Saul Hudson) pulled a Dave Grohl. See, in a move seemingly inspired by that creator of the band Probot, the stunning six-stringsman branched off to pursue and record with a solo project, this one an eponymous group that would release a debut the following year, in March of two thousand and ten. See, \"Slash\" (the album) finds Slash playing multiple instruments (including lead and rhythm guitars, acoustic guitars, backing vocals, and bass). And what's more, the guy enlisted an extremely impressive group of guest musicians and vocalists. In fact, every single one of these fourteen songs features a cameo by a pretty big-name. Hence, it is only a rare occasion for Slash to using lead vocals. The set kicks off with \"Ghost,\" a catchy punk-rocker that is placed with a fiery guitar solo and guest vocal wailing from The Cult frontman (Ian Astbury). But this opener, while decent through and through, is immediately overshadowed by \"Crucify The Dead,\" a crunchy hugger of a song that finds Ozzy Osbourne taking care of the vocals (and doing an amazing job at it, by the way), and is peppered with more pyrotechnic Slash soloing. And \"Beautiful Danger\" is another standout, as it finds an almost Nine Inch Nails-like electronic, pulsing guitar\/bass riff throbbing away behind female vocals supplied by the Black Eyed Peas' frontwoman, Fergie. Then, following the hit-single \"Back From Cali\" (which finds Alter Bridge frontman Myles Kennedy stepping in behind the mic), the listener is treated to one of the record's most memorable vocal performances in \"Promise.\" It is a power ballad that, despite featuring a cameo from Chris Cornell (the dude is heard wailing away throughout the song), ultimately comes across actually sounding more like a Red Hot Chili Peppers of-side rather. But the set's second half is every bit as memorable as its first half. Wolfmother's Andrew Stockdale supplies the vocals for the album's insanely catchy lead single, \"By The Sword\"; and \"Gotten\" is a lovely blues-rock ballad with emphatic singing from Adam Levine (of Maroon five fame), of all people. And the next song, \"Doctor Alibi,\" is a big-riff rocker that is, thankfully, heavier than most of its surroundings. And I might point out that the tune is catchy as check, too, but with Lemmy Kilmeister doing a classic Motorhead-sounding vocal impression, that fact should almost be a given. Next up, \"Watch This\" is an entirely instrumental cut, thus making it the possible (probable, even) highpoint of the record. But the fact that it boasts hefty, chugging guitar hooks, memorable, air-guitar-able leads, and excellent, epic soloing does not hurt matters, either. And the bass work is also noteworthy, there, as it is played by original Guns `N' Roses four-stringer Duff McKagen.

Hence, the song is, naturally, an insanely catchy one, and one that is littered with infectious vocal hooks.

And besides, the boy signed up for a very impressive group of musicians and singers. In fact, each of these fourteen songs contains a cameo with a big name. Therefore, using well-known words for slash is a rare occurrence. The set begins with \"Ghost\", an attractive pink rocker set on a hot solo guitar and the guest voice of The Cult Frontman (Ian Eastbury). But this opening, though respectable inside and out, is quickly covered by \"Crucify the Dead\", a furious song by Hugger that takes care of the voices (and is doing amazing things in it), and Slash soling is full of pyrotechnics. And \"Pretty Danger\" is one of the highlights, as the finds a guitar \/ bass riff with almost black nine-inch nails that cries after the words of a woman provided by Fergie, the wife of the former Black Eyed Peas. Then, after the hit song \"Back from Kelly\" (featuring Miles Kennedy leading the Alter Bridge behind the microphone), listeners were greeted with one of the most memorable songs on record at \"The Promise\". One is considered. It's a power song that, despite Chris Cornell's cameo (dude sounds like the whole song), sounds like a red hot pepper instead. But the second part of the set is not as memorable as the first part. Andrew Stock Dale's Wolf Mother provides the voice for the crazy album \"Buy the Sword\". And \"Gotten\" is a beautiful blues rock ballad sung by Adam Leon (the famous Maroon Five) of all people. And the next song, \"Dr. Alibi,\" is a huge swing, thankfully, heavier than most of the surrounding area. And I can point out that the song is as sweet as Czech, but with Lemmy Kilmeister as the voice for Motorhead, that fact must be taken into account. Next, \"View It\" is a complete cut, which makes it a high (potential, for) point for the record. But the fact is that the powerful, memorable, powerful guitar-making hooks, and even the best solo song, don't hurt the news. And the work of the boss is also noteworthy, as it is played by Duff McCagan with four stars by Guns N Roses. But these are really the voices, which are respected by Kid Rock, which is the most memorable feature in the next track after that, \"Hold On\". Burning, heavy, intense and cloud metal song with the mouth of the Avenged Sevenfold M. Shadows, which using captivatingly to the sound of guitar clicks and sharp melodies. But so is Starlight, as it takes a page from Led Zeppelin's playbook as it plays an epic duet between the artist (in this case, Malls Kennedy - again) and the guitarist (slash) to see it. Who can cry out cloud? Then, after \"St. is also a sinner,\" followed by a soft song, which was translated aloud and pure singing, a strong effort, \"We will all die\", guest songs with Iggy Pop presenting. The song, therefore, is naturally interesting, and full of contagious sound hooks. But surprisingly, the song is also remarkable from a musical point of view, as it is more complex and more dynamic. Very well played, unexpected, and very rewarding, \"Slash\" is a hard rock game with a truck full of bright \/ suggested tracks, and even more addictive riffs and hooks. \u06d4 So, this reviewer can't come to the conclusion that the dream of a hard rock fan is coming true, but it is definitely very close to getting such a big place.","overall":5,"summary":"(4.5 stars) 2010's best hard rock record","unixReviewTime":1383177600,"reviewTime":"10 31, 2013"}

And more than that, the guy wrote an incredible group of guest artists and vocalists. In fact, each of the fourteen songs contains a great and beautiful name. Therefore, it is only a rare occurrence that Slash uses bullet sounds. The avenue begins with \u201cGhost,\u201d an intriguing Punk-rocker set with flaming guitar and a guest soundtrack from The Cult frontman (Ian Astbury).

And \u201cBeautiful Danger\u201d is another notable one, as it gets almost Nine Inch Nails-like an electronic, drumming \/ bass riff from behind the female vocals provided by former Black Eyed Peas woman, Fergie . Then, according to the motto \u201cBack From Cali\u201d (got Alter Bridge frontman Myles Kennedy pushing the mic) It was a powerful force, even if it came from Chris Cornell (the dude could hear crying songs and all ), eventually turned out to be really noisy like Red Pepper.

And I can point out that the rhythm is also catchy in check, but Lemmy Kilmeister making a great soundtrack expressing Motorhead, that fact has to be paid for. Next, \u201cWatch This\u201d is a completely cut-out device, making it possible (perhaps, even) to be at the top of the record. But the fact it boasts a very heavy, bumpy guitar, memory, air-guitar-lead, and great, epic soloing also does\u2019t hurt issues. And the bass work was also noteworthy, there, as they played the original Guns `N 'Roses with four-stringer Duff McKagen.

Then, following \u201cSaint Is A Sinner, Too,\u201d with soft, acoustic-lushed ballet with warm and soft clean songs, came the intense effort, \u201cWe\u2019re all dying,\u201d featuring voices of polite guests.

Though I did purchase Notorious and Big Thing, and eventually Liberty, only to reluctantly realize that I did not like them at all. Duran Duran had succumbed to the traditional trappings of success and musical growth, and thus lost their personality. The overuse of funky rhythms, female backing singers and horn sections left me bored. Even their comeback in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three was of complete disinterest to me and I've not paid much attention since. But then came the reunion of the original line up. I saw them on tour for that reunion in late two thousand and three, and was so pleased with the show they put on. Duran Duran's debut album will always be my favourite, and when they played five songs from it, I was thrilled. Then they played two then-new songs and I was completely bored. When Astronaut was released, I did't go near it. Then came the news that Mark Ronson, a long time fan of DD's early sound, was going to try to bring back the sounds of their former glory, I could't help but be curious. As samples of new songs started appearing online, I could hear the long lost sounds of thirty years ago, and began to get excited. I purchased All You Need Is Now in its deluxe edition on the day of release, and I cannot stop playing it. I never thought the day would come that I would be excited about another Duran Duran album, and I thank Mark Ronson for reminding the band how amazing they can be when they are not immersing themselves in attempted credibility for modern \"growth\" nonsense. This album is better than Rio. The hooks on All You Need Is Now are endless. While some people have been indifferent to releasing the title track as the first single, I think its got a great melody and some appreciated quirk. But the highlights for me are the phenomenally catchy `Other People's Lives' and `Too Bad You're So Beautiful'. Followed very closely by `Runway Runaway', `Being Followed', and `Girl Panic!'It's usually the upbeat songs that catch my year initially, but some of the mid-tempo numbers have proven to be gorgeous instant classics. `The Man Who Stole A Leopard', `Before The Rain', and `Mediterranea' are all wonderful songs. The only truly dire song is the stomach-turning `Safe'. It's got all the excessive funky nonsense that put me off of DD in the first place, and it's very out of place in the track listing. The special edition I have came with a total of seventeen songs, and the last three seem obvious to have been done after Ronson's departure. They sound a bit more modern and fairly out of place. `Too Close To The Sun' has an attractive chorus but Simon sings the song so willingly whitney and nasally that it's a drawback. Simon can sound nasally, especially during live performances, but the's gone out of the way to do so there. `Early Summer Nerves' is an unlistenable bore. The best of the three is `Networker Nation'. Though it still sounds fairly modern, it's catchy enough but still not to the standard of the original album tracks. Having been turned off to \"new\" music for almost twenty years, I'm finding that some veteran artists have returned over the last several years with some of their best work. It's been so rewarding to hear artists in their fifty's and sixty's release material that rivals their best efforts from their heyday: Lene Lovich - Shadows and Dust (two thousand and six), The B-fifty-two's - Funplex (two thousand and weight), Sparks - Exotic Creatures of the Deep (two thousand and weight), Devo - Something For Everybody (two thousand and ten), Josie Cotton - Pussycat Babylon (two thousand and ten), and now Duran Duran. I highly recommend this amazing work. I've watched numerous recent interviews with Duran Duran regarding the return to their roots sound of this new album. They seem to be getting irritated about it and quickly defend it by saying that they believe it to still be modern. Not wanting to disrespect the band, this album would not have been the creative success without Mark Ronson encouraging the band to rediscover their originally exciting spirit. I fully expect this to be a fluke and that Duran Duran will be back to making forgettable music after this, unless they retain Mark Ronson to keep them sounding as they should. Yes, the new album is retro, but it's also undeniably Duran Duran. No one else sounds like them. In the fruitful early eighty's, numerous bands has such distinctive sounds that sounded like no other, but then they either split up for went down mundane street never to return. Duran Duran may just be revising an old neighbourhood from the past, but I would be overjoyed if they decided to take up residence there once again.

Although I bought Notorious and Big Thing, and eventually Liberty, I was so lazy that I did\u2019t like them at all. Duran Duran has given in to the traditional symbols of success and musical growth, and as a result they have lost their personality. Excessive use of fashion rhythms, feminine expressions and French horns makes me feel bored. Even though they came back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, I was not interested at all, and I have not paid much attention since then. However, there was a reunion of the original list. I saw them on tour during a reunion at the send of two thousand and three, and I was very happy with their work. Duran Duran's first album is always a favourite. When they played five of them, I was very happy. Then they played two new songs since then and I was really bored. When the astronaut was released, I did't go near it. Then came the news that Mark Ronson, a longtime fan of DD's voice early, would be trying to regain their former glory, and I can't help but wonder. As evidence of a new song starting to appear on the Internet, I heard a voice that had been lost for the past thirty years, and I became excited. I bought the deluxe version of \"Everything You Want Now\" on the day of its release, and I can't stop playing. I never thought I would one day be happy with another Duran Duran album. Thank you to Mark Ronson for reminding the team that it will be incredibly beautiful if they are not immersed in today\u2019s \u201cgrowing\u201d loyalty. This album is better than Rio. The hobbies on All You need Is are now endless. While some people karen\u2019t interested in releasing the title song as the first single, I think it has some great music and other quirks that deserve praise. But for me, the main thing is that \u201cother people\u2019s lives\u201d are interesting and \u201cvery bad, very good\u201d. Followed by \"Runway Runaway\", \"Follower\" and \"Girl Panic!\" These are morally hopeful songs that attracted me at first, but some of the fast-paced songs have proved to be popular classic jones. \"Leopard Stealing Man\", \"Before the Rain\" and \"Mediterranean Sea\" are all good songs. The only really scary song is annoying \"Safe\". It contains all the nonsense in the past that kept me away from DD in the first place, and it does't fit much into the playlist. I did a total of seventeen songs in a special edition, and the last three were clearly finished after Langson left. They sound more modern and out of place. The suspension of \"Too Close to the Sun\" is very interesting, but Simon is so excited about Whitney and the sound of this nose when the sings this song that it fails. Simon's voice sounds very nasal, especially during live shows, but it's no longer appropriate there. \"Early summer nerves\" is an insatiable loneliness. The most important of these three is the \"National Network\". Although it still sounds modern, it is attractive enough, but it blacks the quality of original albums. I have long been not interested in \"new\" music for the past twenty years, and I have found that some of the top artists have returned with their good work over the past few years. It is very meaningful to hear that the media of artists in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys and one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys is in line with their daily efforts: Lene Lovich-Shadows and Dust (two thousand and six), B-fifty-two-Funplex (two thousand and Weight), Sparks-Exotic creatures of the deep sea (two thousand) and difficulty), Devo-Something Everyone (two thousand and ten), Josie Cotton-Pussycat Babylon (two thousand and ten), now Duran Duran. I really appreciate this wonderful work. Recently I watched a lot of interviews with Duran Duran about this new album going back to its roots. They seem to irritate them and defend immediately, saying they believe it is still current. I don\u2019t want to disrespect the band, if Mark Ronson encourages the band to rediscover its first interesting spirit, this album could not be a design success. Hopefully this is just a worm, Duran Duran will make some memorable music after this, unless they keep Mark Ronson to keep the sound right. Yes, the new album is retro, but there is no denying that it is also Duran Duran. No one else sounds like them. In the early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, countless groups had a special sound that sounded different, but then they broke up for walked the streets and never returned. Duran Duran may be renovating the old place, but if they decide to stay there again, I will be happy. Welcome home children.","overall":5,"summary":"I never thought I'd buy another Duran Duran album.

Doreen's debut album will always be my favourite, and I was thrilled when the played five songs on it. He was playing two new songs by then and I was very tired. When the astronaut was released, I did not approach him. Then came the news that Mark Ronson, a longtime fan of DD's first voice, was going to try to regain this former glory. I was not surprised. As samples of the new songs began to appear online, I heard voices that had been missing for the last thirty years, and I began to rejoice. I've bought everything you need for a deluxe copy on the day of release, and I can't stop running it. I never thought the day would come when I would be happy with another Doran Doran album, and I thank Mark Ronson for reminding the band that if they talk about today's \"modern\" nonsense How wonderful it would be if I did't immerse myself in trying to be honest. . This album is better than Rio. The hooks of everything you need now are endless. Although some people have no objection to releasing the title song as the first song, I think it has some great music and other interests. But what stands out to me is that \"other people's lives\" are attractive and \"you're so bad, so beautiful.\" 'Runway Runners', 'Followers', and 'Girl Scare!' 'The Man Who Stole the Leopard', 'Before the Rain', and 'Mediterranean' are all wonderful songs. The only difficult song to answer is 'Safe'. It's all ridiculous nonsense that got me off DD in the first place, and it's not on the track list. The particular genre I came up with has a total of seventeen songs and the last three appear after Ronson's departure. They look modern and out of place. 'Too Close to the Sun' is an interesting chorus, but Simon sings the song with Whitney's love and joy that takes it back. Simon can be heard in the nose, especially during live play, but there are ways to do it out of the way. The nerves of early summer are an irreparable boredom. The top three are the Workers' Nation. Although it still looks modern, it is quite attractive but it has not yet reached the level of the original songs. After being shut down by \"new\" music for almost two decades, I have noticed that some experienced artists have returned with their best works in the last few years. It was great to hear of fifty-six artists who have resisted their best efforts since the days of their fame: Lane Lovich-Shadow and Dust (two thousand six), BB fifty-two Finplex (two thousand and one weight), Sparks - alien creatures of deep (two thousand weight), giants - something for everyone (two thousand and ten), juicy cotton - cat cat Babylon (two thousand and ten), and now during. I highly recommend this amazing work. I watched a recent conversation with Doran about bringing the sound of this new album back to its roots. They look angry at it and quickly defend it by considering it modern. Not wanting to offend the band, this album is not a creative success unless Mark Ronson encourages the band to regain their original thrilling spirit. I fully expect it to be a flick and that Doran Doran will return to make memorable music after that, as long as the retains Mark Ronson to keep this voice. Yes, the new album is retro, but of course Duran is Duran too. No one else looks like them. In the early eighties, many bands have different sounds that sound similar to each other, but then they separate to go on the road. He may be revisiting the old place in the meantime, but I would be happy if the decides to stay. Welcome home boys.","overall":5,"summary":"I never thought I'd buy another Duran Duran album.

Although I bought Notorious and Big Thing, and finally Freedom, I just had to figure out that I did\u2019t like them. Duran Duran fell into the cultural straps of musical success and growth, and thus lost their identity. I get bored with the overuse of entertaining melodies, female supporting artists and horn parts. Even their return of a thousand, nine hundred and ninety -three was completely uninteresting to me and I have not listened to him since. But then came the reunion of the original lineup. I saw them travelling to that gathering in the latter part of two thousand and three, and I was very pleased with their performance. The first album Duran Duran will always be my favourite, and when they sang five songs, I was overjoyed. Then they played two new songs then I got bored. When the astronaut was released, I was nowhere near. Then came the news that Mark Ronson, a longtime supporter of DD\u2019s former voice, would try to restore the sound of their former glory, I could\u2019t help but rejoice. When new song labs started appearing on the internet, I used to hear the long sound that disappeared thirty years ago, and they started having fun. I Bought Everything You Need Now It was in the Deluxe edition on the day of its release, and I could\u2019t stop playing it. I never thought the day would come that I would be happy with another Duran Duran album, and I am grateful to Mark Ronson for reminding the team how wonderful they are when they don\u2019t scatter themselves in an attempt to trust modern \u201cgrowth\u201d of nonsense. This album is better than Rio. The refrigerator in All You Need Now is endless. While some people were interested in releasing the track record for the first time, I think it got a good melody and some praise. But the things that stand out to me are the fascinating phenomena of `Dadka Other people's lives 'and` `Very Very Very Very Beautiful'. This is closely followed by 'Runway', 'Tracking', and 'Girl Panic!' Normally, the rising songs appealed to my year in the beginning, but some of the medium numbers proved pretty straightforward right away. \u2018The Man Who Stole the Tiger\u2019, \u2018Before the Rain\u2019, and \u2018Mediterranean\u2019 are all great songs. The only real song is \u2018Praise\u2019. He got all the interesting and extremely nonsensical comments that drove me to DD in the first place, and the was very far off the tracking list. The special edition I did had a total of seventeen songs, and the last three seemed to be made after Ronson\u2019s departure. They sound a bit modern and a bit out of place. \u2018Very Close to the Sun\u2019 had catchy songs, but Simon meant the song to Whitney and her nose and she came back. Simon\u2019s nose may bring, especially in live performances, but that has gone out of this way. \u2018Summer Sensors\u2019 is boring and inaudible. The best of the three is Networker Nation. Although it still looks modern, enticing but still does not reach the level of the trace of the original album. Turning to \u201cnew\u201d music for almost two decades, I found that some veteran artists have returned over the past few years carrying their best works. It was very helpful to hear the artists of the fifties and sixties released products against their best efforts in their time: Lene Lovich-Shadows and Dust (two thousand and six), B-fifty-two-Funplex (Two Thousand Weights), Sparks - Deep Creativity (Two Thousand Weights), Devo - Something For Everyone (Two Thousand), Josie Cotton - Babylon Pussycat (Two Thousand), and now Duran Duran. I highly recommend this wonderful work. I\u2019ve watched many recent interviews with Duran Duran about the return of the sound origins of this new album. They seem angry and quick to defend by saying they believe it is still modern. They don\u2019t want to be respected by the team, this album would\u2019t be a creative success without Mark Ronson encouraging the team to rediscover their interesting old spirit. I highly hope that this is a scandal and that Duran Duran will return to making music that was forgotten after that, until they keep Mark Ronson to express it as it is. Yes, the new album is retro, but neither is Duran Duran. There is no one else like them. In the fruitful early one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, many bands had distinct sounds that seemed non -existent, but then they parted ways to go on an unusual path never to return. Duran Duran may be reviewing a former neighbourhood, but I\u2019m very happy if they decide to move again. Welcome home, men.","overall":5,"summary":"I never thought I'd buy another Duran Duran album. This is amazing!","unixReviewTime":1301097600,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2011"}

The first four tracks are slow-burners, pretty much in the vein of \"Video Games\" but check out in particular \"Off To the Races\", an album highlight. The middle section of the album (tracks five though weight) brings slightly faster tracks, and shines throughout. \"Diet Mountain Dew\" is delightful, with playful lyrics like \"Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City\/Can we hit it low now down and gritty\". Likewise with \"National Anthem\" (not to be confused with Radiohead's \"The National Anthem\"). After a brooding \"Dark Paradise\" (see my review title), comes \"Radio\", by far the most readily accessible track on this album (chorus: \"Now my life is a sweet cinnamon\/like a of**king dream I'm living in\"). The last third album slows back down, and contains several other highlights such as \"Million Dollar Man\" (which reminds me of early Fiona Apple, think Never Is a Promise\/The Child Is Gone\/Pale September). The album ends appropriately with the self -explaining \"This Is What Makes Us Girls\". In all, this is quite the album. Mostly dark, brooding, biting, yet funny and playful at times. Definitely not for anyone in a hurry. I can't imagine this album will be a mainstream success (this is MILES away from Adele's \"twenty-one\"), but I could be wrong and I hope I am.

Lana was confident and in control throughout the show, which was a using-along for most of the crowd.

I was arguing that Lana's rapid growth was because her recording company Interscope had not planned carefully, but now that the album was out, let's put aside all hypocrisy and scepticism and focus on music. \"Born To Die\" (twelve songs; fifty minutes) can be divided into three parts. The first four tracks are slow-moving, almost identical \"video games\", but please take a look at the brightness of the \"To the Nation\" album. The center of the album (five to weight songs) brings the songs a little faster and runs all over. \"Diet Mountain Dew\" is fun, with playful words, like \"Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City \/ Can we beat it down now and be gritty\". Similar to \"National Anthem\" (can be confused with Radiohead's \"National Anthem\"). After thinking about \"Dark Paradise\" (see the title of my review), \"Radio\" appeared, the most accessible version of this album (Chorus: \"Now my life is a sweet cinnamon \/ like a king's dream ** I live in\"). Finally, the third album slowed down and included some of the highlights, such as \"Million Dollar Man\" (reminding me of the early Fiona Apple, who thought Never Promise \/ The Baby Gone \/ Pale in September). The album concludes with \"This Is What Makes Girls\". All in all, this is a very good record. It\u2019s mostly dark, meditative, and rough, but sometimes very funny and playful. Certainly not for anyone in a hurry. I can't imagine that this album will never succeed in the ordinary (this is far from Adele's \"Twenty One\"), but I may be wrong, I hope I'm wrong. Lana's very critical SNL came out (not so bad), and I personally can't wait to see her bring these songs to the concert. This album shows that Lana is a real genius, at the same time, she forgets all the fun and everything else. highly recommended! * Update * (June two thousand and twelve) I saw Lana Del Rey at a concert at Irving Plaza in New York last weekend. Forget \"Deer in the light\" SNL performance. He put it on for an exciting fifty minutes. Focus on the \"Jazz Lounge\" songs on the album (a live band consisting of a piano, three violinists and a guitar). Lana is full of confidence and control throughout the show, which is used by the majority of viewers. There are great shows everywhere, though I hope the can expand this career in a big band to bring to life such things as \"Diet Mountain Dew\", \"Radio\" and \"Off To the Races\" \"Trip-hop\" songs like that.

First thing I noticed off this listen is jack's not doing what the did on other cd's but diving deeper into this music catalogue. The catchy choruses of \"Many shades of black\" for infectious bass of seven nation was not there. What is there are the lyrics and storytelling for your ass and a musician weaving in old I mean old country time blues then current rock in' roll and folk songs done perfectly. Most of the songs on this cd somehow put me in the same mindframe of that song about the Milk man and the boy killing on Carolina Drama. Songs like Poor boy are catchy but some of the songs I actually love best are the jones without the catchy choruses (hypocritical kiss, i'm shaking). Basically this is how the cd hit me. oneMissing pieces caught my year as an uptempo rock in'roll song with a beat that seems a little bit off from catching itself but completely works the beat is very catchy but the's telling a great story that does't blend you to be table to using with the chorus, but listen greatfully. Great song, liked it first listen and it had me thinking the whole album would move in this direction. twoSixteen saltines is that hard fast garage rock (tone similar to fell in love with a girl). This song gives the album that punch and fast space. threeFreedom at twenty-one is him singing in a wrap-like stone that works because of the style of singing voice the uses. It helps to add diversity to the album since the uses a choppy singing voice for most of the cd. fourI'm sure everyone's heard love interruption. Great song. fiveBlunderbuss is somewhat reminiscent of a Led Zepellin song that never was. Jack sings on this song and sings in a talking voice over a grand piano and violin. The melody is hypnotic and folksy. \"doing what two people need is never on my menu,\" that line is award but describes this attitude to me. sixHypocritical kiss starts off like it's gonna be symphonic the way the piano introduces itself with a flushing of the keys it leads up to the epicness of a guy having an argument with this girl about why the's right and she's wrong. This is a song that is needed during a time when so many men want to using apology songs about how men are wrong and stupid. Love this song, it reminds me i'm a man and have the right to be right (haha). sevenWeep themselves starts off with guitars, piano and drums that somehow make me feel like I'm in a western showdown. Jack speaks of beating this girl up in the first line and talks bad about the guys who are suckers for love. He's not really singing in this song, but like announcing in a singing stone things that are about men's feelings of the world and relationships. It's a song that takes a stand about the choice of how men decide to be a specific type of man and what they can expect for consequences. weightI'm shaking makes me feel like I'm trapped in drag time song in the twenty's and seventy's somehow as the describes how a woman makes him feel great and the's shaking from bad nerves. He likens this nervous wreck to leaves on a tree shaking but the's jumping from insecurity and likes it. This is an old time style of song and works for where the rest of the album goes. ninetrash tongue is like a Little Richard song. God only knows when I heard someone sound like little richard (maybe Awol Nation) on that one song. He's telling a song about some monkeys, the breaks into old time piano playing and tambourines. I think i even hear a banjo. This is like some old time Chuck Berry Rock in'roll stuff with Jack growling out blues singing on an rock song. I wanted to hear him scream on this one for have some more fun with it, but it seemed like the was trying to focus on making the song authentic. ten this song starts off like i'm on a carousel but then leads it's way into being a ballad and then reveals itself to be a definite folk song with a banjo for very old guitar a simple piano playing and a catchy as hell chorus. Jack sings and tells the story of a poor boy. This song is an easy going, uptempo, fun song to me. Some of the greatest love songs are the jones that don't praise love for speak of the good side. eleven this song is like an old gospel one thousand, nine hundred and ten song with folk song lyrics. I hate to put it that far back but I listen to a lot of music and this is definitely Jack showing the can take a song from one thousand, nine hundred and ten and somehow bring Queen remnants out then the original jack white somehow turning this into a lullaby. This song works on so many levels. I wish I was smoking, but that past is gone for me. I would like to know what the was smoking to go there with it though. twelveon and on \"sun and the moon never change, they just rearrange,\" parables, philosophies sung in a tenor, a duet partially in harmony, a soft song crooning then changes to somewhat a mix of a jazz, psychedelic rock song. This song just starts to cement the continuity of listenability of the cd that lets you know that no song is going to make it so you don't feel the album. thirteen is probably my favourite because of the very weird harmony the uses. It's jazzy and psychedelic, sorry to say that again but it uses jazz keys and I don't even listen to jazz. it just is. The only thing rock and roll about the song is Jack's singing in the send. This song is a using-a-long song and makes you want to be on the road looking at cornfields and blue skies. The send of the song breaks into a zepellin type rocking out to send the song of with probably one of the most pleasant unique falsetto and harmonies i've heard in a while. Perfect way to send of the cd. To summarize it all I wanted to hear Jack really showcase this vocal range and using steady long notes and harmonies (like many shades of black) instead the used a choppy singing voice most of the time. I wanted to hear choruses from White Stripes Elephants that make you incapable of getting the song out your head. Instead the introduced me to what seems to be a very natural place for him musically, but new to my year. It took a lot of listening until I could hear and love what the was doing. He somehow updated the oldest blues, before Muddy Waters, and brought in himself Jack and one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's seventy's psycadelic era. He left out the eighty's vibe completely that some of this other cd's gave to. Eclectic cd that shows Jack is a musician that has influences but is so educated in music that the is creating, recreating and making style of completely this own. So many of this songs do this that I just have to give him the credit for being one of the greatest musicians out there today. Great masterpiece classic.","overall":5,"summary":"11times i didn' like it 12th time i loved it","unixReviewTime":1335571200,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2012"}

The first thing I noticed in this listening was that Jack did not do what other CDs did, but delved deeper into the music catalog. An attractive chorus of \"many dark shadows\" on the infectious bass of the seven countries is missing. What words and storytelling does your donkey have, a singer weaving in an ancient place I mean the blues of the ancient world, and modern rock songs and folk songs are perfectly made. Most of the songs on this CD somehow remind me of the song about the murder of a boy in Milkman and the play of Carolina. Songs like Poor Boy are lovely, but some of my favourite songs are Jones without the catchy chorus (drinking lies, I shudder). Basically this is how I beat the CD. OneMissingpieces became my fastest rock song this year. The song seems to deviate from it but it works perfectly. Group, but listen carefully. It's a very beautiful song. I love it for the first time listening to it. It makes me think that the whole plate will develop in this direction. TwoSixteensaltines is a kind of heavy and fast rock garage (similar to a girl\u2019s romantic stone). This song brings impact and speed to the album. The freedom of the three when the is twenty-one is that the sings on a folded rock, which works because of the style of singing the uses. It helps to increase the diversity of the disc, as most CDs use continuous singing. Fourth, I believe everyone has heard of the disruption of love. Great song. FiveBlunderbuss is reminiscent of Led Zepellin songs that never appeared before. Jack sings this song and sings with a voice that speaks on a grand piano and violin. The melodies are hypnotic songs and folk songs. \u201cDoing what two people want can never be on my menu,\u201d this sentence is rewarding, but it explains this attitude to me. six The kiss of hypocrisy was like the sound of piano music at first, and the flipping of keys, led to a man arguing with the girl about why she was right and wrong. This song is needed when many men want to show mistakes and stupidity with a song of apology. I love this song, it reminds me that I am a man and I have the right to do it well (haha). SevenWeep started with guitar, piano and drums, which made me feel like I was in the Western Conference. Jack talked about beating up the main girl, and talked about bad things about men who like to suck blood. He did\u2019t really using in the song, but as a reflection of men\u2019s feelings about the world and the relationship to the rock of singing. This is a song about how men decide to be a certain type of person and their expectations for the results. The shivering weight makes me feel like I\u2019m stuck in the songs of the twenty-seven year old, because it describes how a woman makes her feel big and trembling because of bad nerves. He compared the shocking blows to the leaves of a tree, but the jumped for safety and fell in love with it. This is an old style of song, suitable for the whole album. Ninetrash's language is like Richard's little song. God only knows if I heard someone sound like little Richard in that song (probably Awol Nation). He talks about a song about monkeys, which breaks the old piano and tambourine. I think I also heard the banjo. Similar to the music of Chuck Berry Rock in the past, Jack roars and sings the blues in rock songs. I want to hear him shout at this song because it's more fun, but it seems like the's trying to focus on making this song a reality. ten The song started out as if I were in a merry-go-round, but later evolved into a traditional song, revealing that it was a clear traditional song with a very old guitar band, a simple piano composition and an attractive choir. Jack sang and told the story of the poor boy. This song is a relaxed, fast and interesting song for me. Some of the biggest love songs are Jones, and they don\u2019t compliment love by talking about the positive side. Eleven This song is reminiscent of the thousand-year-old gospel, nine hundred and ten songs with folk songs. I don\u2019t want to put it away, but I listen to a lot of music, certainly Jack shows that one can take a song from the one thousand, nine hundred and one song, then somehow take out the rest of the queen and then the first one somehow Jack White turned into a lullaby. The song works on many levels. I wish I had smoked, but that former thing is gone from me. However, I want to know what it means to smoke there. Twelve to'clock and \"Sun and moon will not change, they are just adjusted\", the myth and philosophy are sung in the tenor, part of the duet agrees, a cool song is whispered, and then it becomes a jazz mix. rock songs of the mind. This song is just beginning to blend in with the continuous sound of the CD, informing you that no song will perform, so you will not hear the album. Thirteen is probably my favourite because of the extraordinary harmony used. It\u2019s jazz and psychedelic, I\u2019m sorry to say it again, but it uses the key to jazz and I don\u2019t even listen to jazz. That's it. The only rock music of this song is Jack's song on the release. This song is a very long song, which makes people want to look at the corn field and the blue sky along the way. The posting of this song breaks Zeppelin's style, sending it with one of the most special fests and conventions I've heard in the past. The perfect way to send CDs. All in all, I want to hear Jack really highlight this list and use long notes and harmony (like many black shadows) instead of singing bitterly most of the time. I want to hear the chorus of White Stripes Elephants, so you can't get this song out of your mind. On the contrary, it introduced me to a place where the seemed natural in music, but it was a new year for me. I spent a lot of time listening until I heard and loved what I was doing. He\u2019s a mysterious review of Bruce\u2019s oldest before Muddy Waters, bringing Jack and mental illness in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. He fully remembered the state of the eightys of some CDs. The eclectic cd shows that Jack is an influential but educated musician who creates, repeats this style. Many songs do this, and I have to praise him as one of the leading musicians today. Great part classics.","overall":5,"summary":"11times i didn' like it 12th time i loved it","unixReviewTime":1335571200,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2012"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"David Byrne has always been an important musical thinker as far as I'm concerned anyway. Always very strongly attuned to rhythms the was one of the few people of this era table to see the possibilities in the African concept of polyrhythms in music and finding new ways to expand on that. He not only did that as a founding member of Talking Heads but also through a couple decades of creatively groundbreaking solo recordings. Now there are a number of artists taking up this league such as Annie Clarke, better known as St. Vincent, who is in her way seeking to expand on the perceived foundations of \"pop\" music. So the two combined in two thousand and ten to begin recording this project that would not only combine her songwriting with this rhythmic sensibilities, but also add to that an enormous brass section arranged by people like Lenny Pickett but also electronic beats from John Congleton. With all these cooks in the kitchen, would it be possible for the duo's talents to be table to express their musical points coherently. The results are more surprising than one might think. One can dress it up any way they want, but the foundation of the music is there is still very much on funk. You can there that on songs such as the opening songs \"Who\",\"Weekend In The Dust\",\"Dinner For Two\",\"Ice Age\" and \"I Am An Ape\". Not only are Byrne and Clarke's musical outlooks both highly compatible but on these five numbers the groove is laid on thick for some uniquely produced funk\/pop epics. \"The Forest Awakes\" and \"I Should Watch TV\" showcase a more prominent Afro-latin rhythm. Nothing new for Byrne of course but the mixture of them with some of the orchestral horn arrangements and creative use of melody again creates a potent groove based set up. On the former song, in fact the influence of the Minneapolis\/Prince style use of the drum machine, prominent in ship-hop in years to come, is firmly in play. The only real full on orchestral\/progressive pop song on there is \"Optimist\" with Clarke on lead vocals. Towards the send of the album Byrne takes over heavy on the chunky, soulful groove of \"Lightening\" and the afro funk explosion of \"The One Who Broke Your Heart\" with the Dap Kings and the like minded afropop band Antibalas. The album ends with the slower, epic groove of \"Outside Of Space And Time\" with the swelling and romantic lyrical imagery suiting the music to a tee. For many people who've considered the innovation of funk in dance music during the seventy's as a passing fad usually indelibly linked with the still sometimes controversial disco era,Byrne has consistently proved critics and musical scholars wrong on that regard with this creative way with funk rhythms and this promotion of the original talents who produced them. Funny thing is, only on rare occasions has this never attracted a wide audience. And for that mostly earlier on in this career. Since the left Talking Heads in the late one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, most innovations in pop music have been based in some variation on the odour send of the alternative rock scene. The funk send of it only seemed to crop up occasionally and even then pushed far into the background with other things. Even if this solo work was hit for miss affairs commercially, the stuck to this guns that the seventy's funk\/soul era provided the pop world with an excellent base for expansion in it's future. By blending that aesthetic with the musical and songwriting talents of St. Vincent the was again table to fashion yet another successful hybrid from this. An excellent instrumental and melodic epic that should be enough for even the most jaded musical cynic to realize, in terms of music, it has't \"all been done\".","overall":5,"summary":"A Vital Meeting Between Two Important Musical Minds","unixReviewTime":1347753600,"reviewTime":"09 16, 2012"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"David Byron has always been a major music expert as far as I'm concerned. Am The one who has always been in tune with the rhythm is one of the few at the table this season who sees opportunities for the African concept of poly-rhythm in music and finds new ways to enhance it. Not only did the do this as a founding member of Talking Heads, but the also did some tragic personal recordings for a few years. Now a handful of artists are running the league, like Anne Clarke, better known as St. Louis. Vincent, who wants to expand the imaginary base of \"pop\" music. So the two put together two, ten to start recording the project, which would include not only the songwriting and the sound of the rhythm, but also a large piece of brass called the Lenny Packet. Like people have compiled, but also the electronic bits of John Congleton. With all these chefs in the kitchen, is it possible for a pair of skills to be on the table to show off their musical points together? The results are more dramatic than anyone can imagine. One likes it as much as one can wear it, but the musical foundation is still in a lot of funk. You can do this with songs like \"Who\", \"Weekend in the Dust\", \"Dinner for Two\", \"Ice Age\" and \"IMN App\". Not only do Byron and Clark's musical ideas coincide, but the five numbers have a groove in the thick of some especially crafted funk \/ pop epic. \"The Forest Avex\" and \"The Shodwatch TV\" show a very strong Afro-Latin rhythm. Yes, there is nothing new about Byron, but this combination with some orchestral arrangements and clever use of music also makes a standout based on a powerful channel. In the previous song, the Manipolis \/ Prince drum machine style effect, which will be prominent in ship shop for years to come, is strongly influenced. The only real accompaniment to the ongoing orchestra \/ pop song is \"Optimist\" with lead singer Clark. While releasing the album, Byron draws a lot of energy from \"Lightning\" 's Chunky, into the soulful groove, and into an Afro-pop band with ideas like \"The One Who Brooke Your Heart\" with the Deep Kings. The album ends with a slow, epic duet titled \"Space and Out of Time\" with music, a swollen and romantic image. For many who see funk remodelling in dance music during the seventies as a passing fashion that is often linked to the controversial disco era, Byron has always proven that critics and musicians create funk rhythms. They are not right in this way of doing and it is a talented development. The irony of talent is that only rare moments have attracted so many viewers. And this is especially true earlier in this career. From talking heads at the send of the millennium, to nine hundred and eighty, many new things in pop music are based on the difference in the concept of a unique local rock fragrance. Its funk posting only seems to increase from time to time and then goes backwards, among other things. Although the work was the only news item to be lost due to commercialism, it stuck to the guns when the funk \/ spirit era of the seventies gave the pop world a good foundation for future development. Provided. Combining this beauty with musical talent and writing St. Louis songs. Vincent was also placed on the table to make another effective mixture. An instrument and melody should be enough even for the most difficult critic of epic music, in terms of music, \"not everything happened\".","overall":5,"summary":"A Vital Meeting Between Two Important Musical Minds","unixReviewTime":1347753600,"reviewTime":"09 16, 2012"}

In the release of the album, Byrne, along with Dap Kings and an African pop group who thought of him as Antibalas, took the lead in the powerful and romantic \"Lightening\" and the African funk shooter \"Who broke Your Heart.\" The excellent instrumental epic and melodic epic should be enough to make the most tired people of music critics realize that, in terms of music, it is not \"finished\". For many people who think of the new funk version of dance music in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys as a short-lived fashion, it always has an indelible connection with the disco era which is still controversial at times, and Byrne has always proved that critics and music scholars in this regard. Not to mention, the rhythm of this funk design is to promote the actual talents they produce.

Since leaving the Heads of State in the late one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, many of the innovations in popular music have been based on changes in the smell of other rock scenes.

Before she had her problems and spent time in rehab, her music pop-y and sweet, and forgettable. Her first song back, \"Skyscraper\", was wok, but seemed to be a laboured effort to using about how she was overcoming her struggles. Her next hit, \"Give Your Heart a Break\", was a lot more energetic and fun. It really started to endear Demi and her singing to me. Now, we have her next big hit, \"Heart Attack\". The first fifteen seconds of this song nearly prevented me from never listening to it (and is why this does not get five stars). The intro sets her voice with some posing R&B; styling and then morphs into a horrible autotune before the rest of the song gets going. If it was't for the fact that I was't paying enough attention to this one, and I made it past this fifteen seconds, I would never have discovered the emotional power of \"Heart Attack\". Demi is table to get fun and flirty with the verses and then convert to a passionate power ballad voice in the chorus. There is nothing that comes off as artificial in how she expresses herself in this song (other than the first fifteen seconds). Demi is doing a lot to bare her soul through singing. This is, no doubt, part of the healing process for her, while also allowing her fans to benefit from her outstanding voice.","overall":4,"summary":"The heart of the song soars","unixReviewTime":1370390400,"reviewTime":"06 5, 2013"}

There are a lot of songs that are poorly written by clicking on \"Keep it small\". Oh my goodness, though Will Sheff can't write a click line. So this is almost a disappointment this year, thanks to the amazing way the Okkervil River has performed on their album, and I hope they can get back to the top in their next attempt!
