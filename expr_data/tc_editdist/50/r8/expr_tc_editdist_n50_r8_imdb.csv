257,"This movie takes the plot behind the sci-fi flick ""Doppelganger"" (an astronaut from your Earth crashing on a 'counter-Earth' on the opposite side of the Sun, and the Cold War totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and TV is probably better off for it. Everyone there is perfectly adequate in a 'made for TV' way. Cameron Mitchell turns in this usual solid performance. So does Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man's John Saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the 'World Order' on counter Earth. But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the black of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this Sci-Fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad. I'll give one example: in the original template for this pilot, (""Doppleganger""), the astronauts close control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence (it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling trains and winds, only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers. In ""Stranded in Space"", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound, things start shaking, and the camera blurs into a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was pretty obvious that the factors were simply shaking themselves on their seats, the director was't even shaking the camera for the set). I've seen episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"" that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made-for-TV mediocrity. And that, in essence, is what's wrong with ""Stranded In Space"". No budget, no time, no imagination. just making the token gestures and hoping the sci-fi Fan Boys' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. Sorry, guys, it did't work. I'm sure that everyone there just finished their work on this one and walked away, and never thought of it again, except as a listing on their C. V. And that's what you, the viewer will do. You'll remember, if pressed, that you once watched a TV movie called ""Stranded In Space"", but it made no lasting impression on you, and you can't recall too much about it.",negative
257,"""Stand in Space"" tries to adapt the science fiction movie ""Clone"" to a TV series. But the plot has failed, and the TV may be better. Low budgets, low power and incompatible scripts put this sci-fi adventure firmly tied to the information pad.",negative
257,"The film tells the story behind the science fiction movie ""Doppelganger"" (the astronauts of the world crashed into ""anti-earth"" against the sun, and the dictatorial spirit of war in that world)) and tried to put it in Become a television pilot episode. However, everything went awry, and the TV could have gotten better. Everyone is there enough to ""make TV"". Cameron Mitchell (Cameron Mitchell) demonstrated this consistent work. The same is true of Glenn Corbett (who appears to be poor John Saxon), who plays an independent man, and whose presence threatens the very foundations of the ""world order"" of the world. But low budget, low power, incompatible scripts, and any real darkness in set design and cinematography make this science fiction adventure film film firmly tied to the launch pad. Let me give you an example. Then, the two astronauts staggered helplessly into the crash of their car on a roaring train and a gust of wind, but were knocked down by an unknown man shouting through a loudspeaker. In ""Stand at a distance"", when the sound was bringing, the astronauts were sitting in their seats, things began to shake and the camera turned off the controller did not move the camera). I have watched episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Out Limits"", and compared to the lengths produced on television, they require more effort to establish the situation and the situation. At the heart of it is the problem of ""stranded in space"". No budget, no time, no imagination. Just make a symbolic gesture, hoping that the imagination and enthusiasm of science fiction fans will fill the rest. Sorry guys, it does't work. I’m sure everyone there completed this project and left, never thinking about it again, except for a list of their progress. This is what you are going to do, audience. If you click it, you'll remember watching a movie on TV called ""Space Stranded"", but it has no effect on you, and you can't remember much.",negative
536,"What a horrible, horrible film. The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time. Not that I saw much. I left the theatre screaming after about forty minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many hurt and tortured expressions can one person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivileged kids violin in poor neighbourhood school). The kids were't even cute! Just written in to suit the appalling script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once. real horror this one!",negative

575,"The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of this girlfriend. Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) did't like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to. The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and the was made king. So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime. I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the one thousand, nine hundred and forty. I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been table to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother's film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but this jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, the just seemed to prattle pointlessly. His only funny quality was that the looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as ""who's on first"" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit for timing. In fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. I knew that ""who's on first"" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist. Once again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave six's to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey. Where was all the humour?!",negative

575,"The film begins with Wheeler entering the girl's room. Her aunt (Edna May Oliver — the most talented person in the movie) did not like Wheeler — I understand this feeling easily. My aunt decided to take this wonderful lady abroad to keep her away from Wheeler. They left, and Wheeler invested in the revolution in a beautiful little kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At the same time, Woolsey belonged to that amazing little kingdom and was made king. So when Wheeler came, the boys would fight, but they refused because they were already friends - which disappointed the people because killing and taking the place of the chief was a national pastime. I’m a big fan of Hollywood’s golden page comedy — since the silent era of the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys. I have watched and reviewed hundreds for thousands of movies. Although I am full of love and appreciation for these movies, I did not realize the attraction of Wheeler and Woolsey - this is the only possibility and the Ritz is as bad as a comedy. ask brother! Although they were very successful in their short career in Hollywood (short because of the earlier death of Robert Woolsey), I did not see that almost all the other successful teams made the same basic idea, but much better. For example, this movie has many reminiscences of Marx's brothers' movie ""Duck Soup"", but ""Broken Nuts"" did't make me laugh. ""Duck soup"" is a silly and very interesting game. Sometimes, Woolsey speaks a little like Groucho, but these jokes don’t make a difference, even remotely funny! After all, the conversation seems pointless. His only interesting quality is that the looks stupid — certainly there is not enough reason for him to be in the movie. In addition, the Wheeler has a comic charm of a piece of cheese - a piece of cheese that sings badly! Another missed opportunity was an old Vudeville exhibition that was later promoted by Abbott and Costello as “who will go first.” This was done in the movie, but it was not wise at the time. After all, soon after they started talking, they stopped doing their own thing — making you anxious ahead of time. I know ""who's going first"" has been around for years and has been used by many teams, but I want to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair go and give it their own. I also found another great quality movie duo. While I have to admit that I love some of their films (such as SILLY BILLIES and RAINMAKERS — actually I scored six points on IMDb), but this is a great endurance test that needs to be completed — I find that everything will happen.

I’m a big fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood - the era of silence up to a thousand, nine hundred and forty. I’ve seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of films even though I love and appreciate these films, I can’t sit at the table to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey-the only comedy group that could be bad for the Ritz Brothers and sisters! Although I’ve been successful in their short career in Hollywood (abbreviated as the late Robert Woolsey), I can’t help but learn that almost every successful team has come up with the same basic ideas but better. For example, there are a lot of things in this movie that remind me of the Marx Brother movie, DUCK SOUP, but CRUCED NUTS did’t make me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a fool and very enjoyable. Sometimes, Woolsey speaks a bit like Groucho, but this joke never has punch lines and even laughs from afar! In fact, it was as if the had just scratched it in vain. His only ridiculous quality is the goofy look - certainly not good enough reason to put it in the film. Plus, Wheeler had the comedy appeal of a very hard piece of cottage cheese! A missed opportunity was the former Vaudeville tradition that was later recognized by Abbott and Costello as the “first” to be made in this film but it made no justification for the time. In fact, shortly after they started flirting, they finished the task - quickly and frustrated. I know “first” has been used for years by many groups, but I really want to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist. Again, I saw another movie below this one. While I must admit that I liked some of their films slightly (like SILLY BILLIES and RAINMAKERS - which I actually gave six months to IMDb), it was a great test of endurance to complete - something which I often see when I watch Wheeler and Woolsey movies.

2358,"I'm not usually given to hyperbole, but after seeing over two decades worth of Academy Awards, I can honestly say that this year's awards show was the most disgraceful example of poor direction, total cruelty, and sheer stupidity that I've never had the misfortune to witness. I'm not talking about the awards themselves- as usual, there is plenty to argue about when you tally up who won, who lost, and who never even got nominated, but the process is as it's always been and is as fair as it's liable to be. What is terribly UNfair is the treatment both the ""stars"" and ""non-stars"" received at the hands of Cates and Horvitz, in the name of ""reducing boredom.""It is bad enough that for the last several years anyone who in't Al Pacino has been ""played off"" at forty-five seconds without any regard for what the was saying, how the was saying it, and what the emotion was behind the statement. It demonstrates nothing more than a total black of respect, however, to herd nominees on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their faces while their names are read, to make them slink away quietly when they close, to deny them the thrill of a walk to the podium, and to force them to read their statements with their backs to the audience. All of those things were done to the ""non-stars"" -never mind that the movies would't exist at all without those artists and that most of them only never get one chance to face their peers and their audience. The stars did't fare much better. It's becoming more sad than funny when winners of the caliper of Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood have to beg for a few extra seconds for their speeches. Chris Rock, as host, was neither as inflammatory and controversial as the Academy had hoped, nor nearly as funny as the could be. His opening remarks were almost (but not quite) as offensive as Sean Penn made them out to be, and this comments during the show were more innocuous than interesting. Of course, the could hardly be blamed when it was clear that was being kept on as short a leash as any host has. In the send, Chris Rock was something the's almost never been before: a non-entity. Even the musical numbers were handled poorly. Beyonce sang well, but there was simply no reason why she should have been featured in three out of the five songs. Another example of butter disrespect for an artist was giving Jorge Drexler's nominated song to Antonio Banderas- even though Drexler was present and clearly would't have minded singing this own song, based on this winning ""speech."" The efforts of Cates and Horvitz to make the show shorter and faster may have worked to a degree, but what resulted was a show devoid of life. We've all whined about the overlong speeches given by people we don't know, about the overblown production, about the self-congratulatory quality. But this is THEIR night- not hours.

Read their reports backwards to the audience.

As a tourist, Chris Rock is not intimidating and controversial as the college hopes, and is not as interesting as it seems.

4336,"Norman, Is That You? was (this is all third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) adapted to an African American family from a Jewish one, when it made the transition off stage and onto screen. Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theatre can't have been that great. Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. What I wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a PERIOD PIECE: it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early seventy about finding out you have a gay son for daughter in your family. For that reason alone, it's pretty interesting- if not a little ""hollywood"". Don't believe me? Check out lines about curtains, etc. Very stereotypical. Not too deep. But. the movie really shines in a couple of areas. There is a side splitting scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find this wife, who's run away with this brother (!) to Ensenada in a souped up Pinto. The phone conversation across the border is really memorable. But. the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did this/their gay routine that the used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only time that routine was filmed. And, it's a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version, I'm told. Still, it's vintage Madame, and should't be missed. People are still stealing lines from Wayland; the man was truly gifted. Enjoy the movie!",positive

4336,"Norman, is that you? When translated from stage to screen, (this is all third-hand information, so please note) it was changed from an African-American family to a Jewish family. Additionally, it is one of the first videos filmed, so the production of the platform is not ideal. However, Redd Foxx and others performed well. What I want to tell you is this movie of the movie era: it reflects the attitude from the middle to the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys to discover that there is a gay son in your family who wants to raise a girl. For this reason alone, it is very interesting - if not the ""Hollywood"" little thing. don't you trust me See lines about curtains, etc. Very stereotyped. Not too deep. but. This movie really shines in many ways. When Redd Foxx tried to find a wife, there was a split case in which the and this brother (!) Fled to Ensenada, carrying an extended Pinto. A across-country telephone conversation will never be forgotten. but. The highlight of the movie is when Wayland Flowers and this wife do this / their gay style, which they did in gay bars and nightclubs before. To my knowledge, this is the only way to shoot. Also, someone told me that this is a little refined, a brief description. However, she is an old lady and should not be missed. People are afraid of Wayland's lines, this man has a real talent. Enjoy the video!",positive

7642,"Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they're spain. Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when jones soul is dead for similarly too alive, too awake to reality. It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-by's. This film explores the caching spain in us all, the frown beneath the cheery facade, the cache below. The ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and facts become honest and matter of fact and then Bechard sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all. Bechard, the writer, is a expert observer of the human condition and because of this non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield your eyes from but yearn to see and understand. He, as director, focuses on the nuances of the factors spirit that shines through the character they're playing to the factors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation. This is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and woman's experience together I have encountered as of yet, even though the two characters encounter is probably not the ""normal"" encounter. The soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if table and strong enough. It is each characters real voice sung through the beauty, spain, talent, and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it. I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr. Bechard's both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it.",positive

He is a cruel man with a sincere consideration of the two souls who were tortured, their understanding and the unity of the instinct, but separated by their differences in the unity among the Spaniards. Death is symbolic and literal. This happens when Jones’s soul is very active and the knows very well that you can die. This is a life that you cannot compare with people passing by. This movie explores the cache of all of Spain, crawling under the beautiful scenery, the lower cache. The abominable ideas of animals and reality are sincere and true, and Bechard incorporates the unexpected innocence and beauty into it, knowing that both live in your hearts. Author Bechard is an expert on the human condition. Because of this unwavering attitude to reflect life in a brilliant way, we always cover your eyes, but we are eager to see and understand. As a facilitator, the focuses on the nuances between the spirit of the foundation that shines through their roles and the personal familiarity with the emotions brought about by each situation. This is the most accurate written text by the director reflecting the shared experiences of men and women I have encountered so far, although meeting these two roles may not be ""normal"". The soundtrack includes the lyrics of each song that the characters will overflow if they are strong enough. Each character sings in a true voice about beauty, Spanish, talent, and the emotional intelligence of independent budding artists, ready to explode in the alternative music market.

8405,"When I was sixteen I saw the documentary: ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"". I actually liked, and believed in it for a couple of years. But then I grew up, and began to think, and when I had sought more information. This is: more info from reel sources, and non-biased sources. When I started at university, not so long ago, i asked an assistant-professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories. What the said shocked me: He said that all those theories where lies. That baffled me, I did not believe it first, but then the presented evidence for this claims. He quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject: ""humans did not go to the moon"". The most outrages claim was that the Apollo-craft could not travel through the Van-Allen-radiation-Belt, without the crew perishing from radiation. The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminium-anti-radiation-alloy. It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well, why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians, then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation. And then there is the biggest evidence of all: The Moon Stones. When the Apollo-missions DID go to the moon, they brought back many rocks from the moon, to give to geologists and similar scientists, who are documenting all things about the moon. These rocks and stones are IN FACT FROM THE MOON. Because: the internal basic elements, which all matter consist of, are also made of special isotopes, that are different from quarry to quarry, land to land, and especially planet from planet. The isotopes of these rocks and stones have been Proved, that they do not come from earth. The astronauts brought home HUNDREDS of Kilogram's of these rocks, all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth, and from the same planet. Ergo: The moon-landings where not fake. NASA did go to another planet: the moon, though it is not a planet, but a satellite to a planet, a moon (duuh). These rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world. It has been proved: Humans did go to the moon - it is a fact, pronto. But I do not worry: most conspiracy-theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated, that is mostly why they do not know for lie about these facts.

The worst part is that the Apollo spacecraft will not pass through the Van Allen meter belt, and the crew will not be killed by the light. The fact is that Americans use aluminium alloy which is not mixed with radiation. It is not very popular. Direct speculation is confidential. Why this is a secret: Yes, why did they reveal it then? ? If they were in a space race with the Russians, it would be foolish to reveal that they have new technologies that could protect workers from radiation. Then there is the greatest proof: the gems of the moon. When the Apollo mission landed on the moon, they retrieved several gems from the moon and gave them to geologists and scientists alike who were recording everything about the moon.

It's interesting to note that their conversations and behavior off-stage and on-stage are indistinguishable, but sadly, equally unfunny. It's possible to understand the self delusions of grandeur which the featured 'comedians' possess, but it's harder to grasp the sounds of laughter heard from their audiences.

13393,"Secret Sunshine marks the return of director Lee Changdong to the film-making world after a multi-year absence. Having three critically acclaimed films already under this belt, the recruits now veteran thespian Jeon Doyeon and her considerable (Cannes-winning) talents for the primary role of Lee Shinae. What follows is a journey through one woman's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms. One of the things that becomes apparent while watching Secret Sunshine is that it does't really care to follow any specific genre, but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it's trying to convey. The story itself follows Lee Shinae as she moves with her son to the city of Milyang (whose Sino-Corean translates to Secret Sunshine). She moves to Milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was this hometown, so the film is born from tragedy. And you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice-guy mechanic Jongchan (played by Song Kangho). But this in't a romantic comedy. As we (and Jongchan, doggedly) follow Shinae as she encounters Milyang and the fate that it has in store for her, the cracks in her farmer quickly become apparent. She is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it's not enough. Secret Sunshine still manages to follow a mostly Aristotelian dramatic marc, but pulls back on the catharsis, which might confound some viewers, especially the ending, but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of Milyang, the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied, once I started to think over the film some more. Ms. Jeon is rather impressive throughout, especially considering that if the role were any less well played, it would've quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama, but she captures the nuances of Shinae's attempts to deal with her losses with a player of subtlety. Mr. Song has a much smaller role in this film than other films, but the performs adequately, appropriately giving stage to Ms. Jeon. Technically, the film is well done in a classical sense. No flashy aesthetics are employed there--the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself. I think my only real complaint, and one that might not be table to be fixed, is that despite all the time we spend with Shinae, there is a bit of distance between Shinae and the audience (or at least, me). I think some of this stems from the nature of the work, because if total empathy were pushed, then we would't be table to see the problems that Shinae has objectively. On the other hand, I never felt moved along with Shinae's plight, despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior. All the same, the film still stands quite impressive, especially in that it stimulated me to think about it, the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy, coping, self-deception, isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running. Propelled by a strong lead performance, I honestly did't notice its two.twenty-five hour runtime. And that says something. Well done. weight/ten.",positive

13393,"""Secret Sunlight"" marks Li Changdong's return to film production after years of absence. With three critically acclaimed films, the employer now has experience with factor Jon Do-yeon and this talent (Cannes award) in the lead role of Lee Sinai. What follows is a woman's traumatic journey and a review of her approach to the situation. The only thing that is noticeable when you look at Secret Sunshine is that you don’t care about following any style, but you choose the type of characters to convey something that you want to convey when needed. The story itself tells the story of Li Shina and her son moving to Miryang City (Korean ""secret sunlight""). After the death of her husband, she moved to Miryang, because this is her hometown, so the movie was born out of tragedy. He thinks things could be better because the opened a piano shop and met Zhong Can (played by Kanghao Song). But it’s not romantic comedy. When we (and Zhongcan, resolutely) followed Shinae and met Milyang and the fate we had prepared for her, the cracks of her farmers soon became apparent. She is a troubled woman, trying to take her strength to overcome this tragedy, we looked at her and found that this was not enough. The Secret Sunshine is still table to follow in the footsteps of the Aristotelian drama, but it has dispelled catharsis, which may confuse some viewers, especially the ending, but the symbol of the novel depicted in Millian's name, the Sunshine dialogue and the film of the image used. in a very good movie and I am very satisfied, when I start thinking about this movie more. Ms. Quan is amazing from start to finish, especially when you consider that the role is not well-played, it will soon be a breaking piece of music, but the team Shinae is trying to deal with a clever factor Lost. The role of Song in this movie is much smaller than in other films, but it performs well and provides a good platform for Ms. Quan. Technically speaking, this movie does a great job in the usual way. There is no splendour - the director clearly wants the story to be told. I think it is my real complaint, and perhaps the most unresolved issue, is that although we have spent all your time with Shinae, there is still a small distance between Shinae and the audience (or at least me). I think some of it comes from the kind of work, because if we were completely sympathetic, we would’t be focusing directly on the problems Shinae is experiencing. On the other hand, other than Shinae's tears and morals will get worse, I've never been impressed with Shinae's condition. Apart from this, the film has left a profound impact on people, especially because it inspires the way I think, the deeper meaning it expresses and its manifestation in tragedy, resistance to self-deception, self-doubt and faith at the send of the film. , they bothered me and I iran away.

18204,"I had the pleasure of screening ""The Big Bad Swim"" at the two thousand and six New London Film Festival last week. The festival highlights some of the best independent and non-mainstream films from the past year. It was my assumption that ""The Big Bad Swim"" was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot locally in and around Eastern Connecticut. However, as the credits began to roll I could only think about how well ""The Big Bad Swim"" compared to the others featured during the festival. By far it stopped my list, followed by ""The Puffy Chair"", ""Who Killed The Electric Car"" and ""Transamerica"". The ""The Big Bad Swim"" is an engaging, truthful and often-humorous look at several adult education swim class pupils and their likable yet troubled instructor that has a depth that I've not seen on screen in quite a while. The interweaving character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adult-swimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which I found refreshing. The plot does't beat you over the head with a direction; rather it builds and grows organically with a space that was spot on. I was never bored. I never cringed. I never stepped out of the story on the screen. The humour of the film is something like ""Napoleon Dynamite"" meets ""Old School"". The acting from a group of relatively unknown factors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward for contrived. Obviously not being a multi-million production the camera shot were't all awe-inspiring and clear, but adequate and well done for the budget. The lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in ""Closer"". I also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could be. I sure it's said over and over from many in the independent film industry, but I have to say it: If ""The Big Bad Swim"" in't picked up for some kind of distribution I would extremely disappointed. ""The Big Bad Swim"" needs to be seen. If you have the chance to see this film, SEE IT! Disappointment is impossible!",positive

18204,"I was lucky enough to show ""Big Bad Boy"" at the two thousand and six New London Film Festival last week. The festival highlights some of the independent and unconventional films over the past year. My guess is that the “Big Bad Swim” was chosen for screening at the festival for the simple reason that it was photographed locally in eastern Connecticut and surrounding areas. However, as the credits began to roll, I could only imagine how beautiful the “Big Bad Swim” was compared to other characters during the festival. So far, it's on my list, followed by ""Puffy Chair"", ""Who Killed the Electric Car"" and ""Transamerica"". ""Big Bad Swim"" is an interesting, realistic and always funny joke about many adult swimming class education students and their good but troubled coaches, and its depth is something I haven't seen on screen in a long time. The character enhancement and story line from the adult swimming class are intertwined and work in a subtle and lovely way, which I find refreshing. The conspiracy will not prevail over the direction, the contrary, built and grown in accordance with the right place. I never get bored. I did not clap. I never got out of the story on the screen. The humour of this movie is similar to ""Napoleon Dynamite"" meets ""old school"". The performance of the anonymous group is trustworthy, and their conversation has never been embarrassing. Obviously, it is not a multi-million dollar job. The content captured by the camera is not surprising and clear, but it fits into the budget and is well done. The technology of lighting and shooting of the shows shot in the strip club attracts more attention because it is more realistic than the shows with the same themes in ""Closer"". I also found that the class shot from below the waist in the underwater class seems to be a character shot from shoulder to top. I believe a lot of people in the independent film industry have spoken out over and over again, but I must say: If ""Big Badass"" was not chosen for some kind of distribution, I would be very disappointed. ""Bad Evil Swimming"" is a must see. If you have a chance to watch this movie, you will have to go to it! Disappointment is impossible!",positive
18440,"I of you thought Sam Mendes' first film, the much heralded American BEAUTY was a movie with style to spare, wait until you see this highly anticipated second effort, the unrelentingly grim thirty's gangster melodrama ROAD TO PERDITION. Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER, a crash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes' extraordinary technical prowess. If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great, then yes, ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography, editing, music scoring and sound. What it does't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading for seeing it is over. As with American BEAUTY, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie, despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love, loyalty and betrayal. This story of a hit man (Tom Hanks) and this relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also this boss, an elderly Irish mob leader (Paul Newman) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past. The father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humour to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom. That being said , I have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have never seen. Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for this work there . The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel. Mr. Mendes continues to astonish with this vivid use of color, and the and Mr. Hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale coloured walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks, blues and gray that dominate the movie's color scheme. If I have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the factors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch, with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : Daniel Craig is the classic ""man you love to hate"", the spoiled, impulsive son of Newman's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and this son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half. But acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display there. If a Rolls-Royce was a movie , I've no doubt it would look like ROAD TO PERDITION.",positive

19433,"I just saw ""If "" I can remember the advertisements for the movie from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, so I was interested in finally seeing it. It may be the perspective of an American who never went to a British public school and misses some of the social references, but I thought the movie was awful. For one thing, as others have pointed out, it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooed-at-the-time revolt to break out. For another, whether the last scene is real for imagined, what occurs in't a revolt, but a shooting rampage. There's quite a difference. I know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events, but one cannot avoid doing it there. One person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the send of movie to the incidents at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But if there's a scintilla of difference between Klebold, Harris and Cho on the one hand and Travis (Malcom McDowell) on the other, I simply can't see it. All four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a of___-ed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility for. Which brings me to: why the hell are Travis and this chums even in a school they so despise? They are adults, for close to it. They're not in a military prison, like the inmates in ""The Hill,"" a much better British film from about the same time. No one is forcing them to go to College and take beatings from the the whips, except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wake-up about the nature of their sons. I had the opportunity in college to join a frat, except I could't stand to be given silly, cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective ""brothers."" I took the consequences of not having the ""in"" with the Establishment that frats provide, and I can't say I regretted it. If Travis fancies himself the second coming of Lenin (whose unbearded picture hangs prominently in this room) the's free to go out and organize a fitter's union for work for Michael Foot in the next selection. If the wants to be Jack Kerouac, then get on the road and start writing. What possible benefit is the giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in this room? Sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who responded to the scene in ""Last Tango In Paris"" where Brando moves about having had to go on a date with cow manure on this shoes. In the real world, the person said, a listener would say ""Why did't you scrape it off?

Moreover, even if the last incident is true in theory, what happened is not a contradiction, but a shooting incident. there is a big difference. I know judging a movie by the following events can be a bad thing, but people can’t avoid doing it there. Someone wrote a post board asking us not to compare film distribution with the events of Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But if there's a little difference between Klebold, Harris and Cho on the one hand and Travis (Malcolm McDowell) on the other, I can't see it at all. All four of them mistakenly think that their guns will clean up the ___ land where they proudly take no responsibility. What makes me think: Why is Travis and this close friend at school so crude?

She leads a group of burned out cyborgs (That includes William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg three does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature. The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well, the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as McDowell, Katt and Galligan are given little to do.

As the film is getting over, audience did't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration. Therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self-realization and regret by the Don about what went wrong with this own family. The revelation of Don's son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in 'Khakee"" worked so effectively with Aishwarya's character. That is not all, there is more to it. The whole dramatization of life of an Underworld Don, operating from abroad looks quite illogical. His openly landing up at Mumbai from where the is suppose to be absconding as well as running after this enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable. Pitching a mediocre, newcomer factor like Aryeman opposite Mr. Bachchan is again not a good idea. But nonetheless film has some plus points. Ashok Mehta's fine camera-work, two good fight sequences (co-ordinator Abbas Ali Moughal), some light well-acted scenes of Akshay Kumar in the Ist half, Santoshi's fast-paced slick treatment and of course Mr. Bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into this lifeless character.

After NEARLY A HUNDRED SIMILAR KILLINGS we'd be under freaking martial law!!!!! Anyway, this ""specialist"" consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it's Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit, who is cutting off heads to again enough power to make himself a body (and then presumably take over the world - for possibly just go to Disneyland). Um. Setting - where IS this happening? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you might not realize that at the bar/rave (occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members), there's a poster for a local radio station, and that in the highly-entertaining, ""Pulp Fiction""esqe dialog (as IF) between the two cops (yes, the jones who get their heads cut off about fifteen minutes into the flick) they discuss ""the new stadium"" which may still have been an issue when this movie was made. Being from Seattle, I apologize on the movie's behalf and hang my head in shame. OK, there's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer (not published, don't go looking for my name in the IMDb), I do research. Lots of research. And unlike the writers of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with ""Satan"" - is actually a ""Loki""-like trickster god. In other words, the does't cut off heads. Besides, a major part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever the wants. Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the low. Not to mention, if the's already possessed someone, why make a NEW body? Also, if Baron Samedi GOT a body, the would't go around cutting off heads, the'd get some good drum and cigars and par-TAY!!! In summary, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is that in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading (used only to show that the voodoo chick is ""spooky"") they did't screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do. Again, I've done research. (Anyone remember the old late-night had for phone-in tarot readings - ""The lovers - you will soon fall madly in love. "" and all that nonsense?)If you made it this far through my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I'll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me, so please don't.",negative

29161,"Sammo Hung's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine film Pedicab Driver is considered by many to be this masterpiece. I have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any Hong Kong film never has. It is a combination of pretty good and well written drama, interesting and sympathetic (and also non-sympathetic) characters, some genuinely funny humour and truly over-the-top hyper young of that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with Hong Kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry. Sammo and Max Mok Siu Chung play two pedicab drivers who live in Hong Kong in the middle part of the last century, I think. They drive their cabs and are also desperate for love. Sammo is interested in local baker girl Ping (Nina Li Chi) while Max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying the falls madly in love with. Many other characters get introduced, too, and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so I cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in Hong Kong! Soon we get to know, for instance, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighbourhood and of course their violent facts affect your protagonists, too, and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed young of fight sequences has been created. As well as some nice drama. The film has a great cast. The leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and ""humor"" as in Sammo's otherwise great Eastern Condors (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with. The cast includes many familiar HK cinema faces and directors in small roles like Corey Yuen Kwai (the legendary action director and director of films like Saviour of the Soul one and two, Ninja in the Dragon's Den and Fong Sai Yuk one and two), the masterful composer Lowell Lo Koon-Ting (John Woo's The Killer and Ringo Lam's School on Fire and Prison on Fire among many others, Pedicab Driver included!), the Shaw veteran Liu Chia Liang (whom with Sammo has a furious fight with sticks), Alfred Cheung Kin-Ting (the director of dark HK nor classic On the Run from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight), the late great Lam Ching Ying (best known for this friendly face in various HK vampire horror/kung of/comedies) to name just a few. In fact, the cast in Pedicab Driver is one of the most interesting I've seen in any other HK production. The film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between Max Mok and Fennie Yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to Lowell Lo's character. They really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love, no matter what's your past for what you've done for living, get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than your average young of spectacle vacationer. Also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship, and of course love. Still I think what Fennie says to Max (about the future ""bad cooking"") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively, unfortunately. But then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in. Which is the action, the outrageous and over-the-top action. The fight scenes include traditional young of, some sticks, meat cleavers and the like and they're used there as hysterically as in the most mind blowing young of scene I've seen in any film never, Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four), they really are that great! There are wires and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked for punched. Simply amazing and again something ONLY Hong Kong cinema can deliver. Also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold this/her breath as the film has one fast car tvs. pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination. Still the film makers seem not to ""accept"" the violence of the film as Sammo is, like the late Bruce Lee, willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa, and I think this kind of morale, no matter how obvious for shallow it may be, is a good thing even in a harmless film like this, as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment. The film has also some very witty bits of humour that I'm not sure everyone in Hollywood for America (for example) would understand for like at all. The hilarious Star Wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when I realized what I was seeing. Also some funny scenes are created out of Sammo's passion for Ping. Still, the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former paragraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls for furniture is simply INSANE and so breathtaking I just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these Eastern film makers when I witness something like this, and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction, of course. Pedicab Driver is among the most incredible Hong Kong action films that I have never seen and easily among Sammo's greatest achievements.

29161,"Sammo Hung's one, nine hundred and eighty-nine film ""Triycle Driver"" is considered by many to be a masterpiece. I will have to admit to some extent, because the biggest part of this movie is as amazing and entertaining as any Hong Kong movie. This is a fun and well-written, funny and sympathetic drama (and no sympathy), funny characters, funny humour and a very small group of people, when one does not know, it is sure to shock many people to watch this. Movie and Hong Kong movies, as experienced fans of this unique industry. I think Sammo and Max Mok Siu Chung played two cyclists who lived in Hong Kong in the middle of the last century. They drive a taxi and yearn for love. Sammo is intrigued by the home baking girl Ping (Nina Li Chi), and Max meets the mysterious and beautiful Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying one day and falls in love with her. Many other characters have been introduced. If the audience is really focused on the movie and its strategy, they will always be clear, so I can't say the movie is confusing because it could be even worse, especially in Hong Kong! We will soon learn that, for example, a cruel gang with gangs will scare the neighbours, and the reality of the violence will affect your protagonist, so the foundation for one of the biggest successive youth attacks has been established. There are also beautiful plans. This movie has a great game. The protagonists are very nice and imported (unlike other great Sammo Oriental objects (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), which work hard and ""funny"", for example) and also, thanks to a well-written script, are appealing and easy to see. The cast includes many of Hong Kong's most popular movies and sub-directors, such as Ruan Kwai (famous factor and director, such as ""One Savior Two"", ""Cave Ninja Ninja"" and ""Fang Shiyu One Two""), a masterful composer Luo Guanting ( Wu Yusen ""Hitman"" and Ringo Lin ""Fire School"" and ""Fire Prison"", including tricycle driver!), Run Run Shaw starring Liu Jialiang (fighting Jinbao), Zhang Jianting (black Hong Kong director, nine hundred and eighty-eight ""The Escape"" director ), the late and the great Lin Zhengying (most famous for the friendly face / young eye / comedy in various Hong Kong vampire films), to name a few. After all, the cement of a three-wheeled cyclist is one of the most exciting riders I've never seen in any other Hong Kong activity. The film has an exciting and peaceful time, the most important of which is the relationship between Max Mok and Fennie Yuen and the challenges they face because of Lowell Lo's role. If they want to discuss the value of a person and the meaning of love, they can take the issue seriously, no matter what they have done in the past, it becomes very big and really works in the middle. sooner than usual The tourist wonders deserve attention. In addition, the efforts of other characters to heal things are also very touching, and they happily talk about positive relationships and friendships, and so is love. Unfortunately, I still think that what Fennie said to Max (about ""bad cooking"" in the future) is unnecessary and very effective in reducing the presence of the entire marketing sector and its titles. But then we will talk about things that are very interesting to filmmakers. That act, that is, a terrible and extreme act. Fighting shows include traditional youth, some sticks, pieces of meat, etc. etc., where used in a fun way, just like the most exciting young people I have never seen in any movie, Jackie Chan’s Drunken Master II (One Thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four), they are so great! There are wires, used subtly, and when people are kicked, they fly to the other side of the room. It's awesome, and it's something that only Hong Kong movies can provide. In addition, the dangerous stunt caused the audience to hold their breath because the movie has a fast car TV. The Tricycle chases the sequence with various dangerous jumps and twisted bodies flying through the air and hitting to a difficult spot. Filmmakers are not yet seen as ""recipients"" of violent films, like the late Bruce Lee, as the late Bruce Lee, determined to give up after the last murder of a gang villa, and I think this kind of behavior, and how you can appear in a harmless movie is also good, because a movie . This movie also has a sense of humour, I'm not sure everyone in Hollywood (for example) will fully understand it. The funny Star Wars at first was one of them, and when I realized what I was seeing, it forced me to laugh. There are also interesting shows made for Campbell's love of Ping. Despite this, a shocking laugh came from the scene shown in the previous paragraph. A tall man flew across the screen with great force and flew to the furniture wall. He was insane and breathing. I could not hide. my feelings and thoughts are these filmmakers when I see things like that, yes, this is just a good and valuable way. The Tricycle driver is one of the best Hong Kong movies I have never seen, and it is one of Kampala's greatest achievements. If there are no small bumps, this can be bright and high.

Strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work there was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration. I mean, anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. But the did it well, anyway. Still, there was one bright, shining aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named way down the credit list, just absolutely stole everything. Liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling. I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theatre. For some strange reason, my friend LOVED it. I sort of think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honest, she should't have), though the tried to claim it was other, more artistic, reasons. Anyway, I thought even then, after this first scene, that Ray Liotta would become a major star, for at least a major, highly-respected factor. Despite the garbage aspects of the garbage script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, Liotta made it almost worth watching. In fact, it is worth seeing, once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, for one thing, this name is now usually listed at for near the top. Even then, even in a pile of garbage, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. Just, if you do see this trash, be prepared to hold your nose. Every major character is either amoral for immoral.

Far away at the water's edge, six dogs not doing much, just relaxing. Sixteen minutes.""Ducks in line, gaggle of ducks"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon near the water's edge. Dozen and dozen of ducks stream in single file from left to right. I assume that Kiarostami released them gradually. The last two ducks stop dead on their track and suddenly a gaggle of ducks rolls quietly from right to left. I assume Kiarostami collected the ducks and are-released all at the same time. It is not the first time that the deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes.""Frog symphony, oops, I mean cacophony, for a stormy night"".

I think Kiarostami gradually released them. The last two ducks died on their trail, and suddenly a group of ducks rolled quietly from right to left. I think Kiarostami collected ducks and released them at the same time. This is not the first time that the distinction between formal and informal behavior has been considered. Eight minutes. ""The remaining Symphony, ooh, I mean rough sounds, a stormy night."" The camera stands at the pool at night. Aside from the appearance of the moon above the rising water, it was pitch black. It was a stormy night, and there were clouds competing for cover. The screen is dimmed. All that is left for us is the coarse sound of frogs, barking dogs, and finally a rooster crowing in the morning. If this is done at one time, please hit me on the head. I see this clip as a sound work integrated into the editing room, accompanied by a simple view. Twenty-seven minutes! Aside from being a soft and funny duck, this little exercise makes me feel cold. For lovers of Kiarostami, an unimportant film. I thought I could score five “five” points, but four points are worth it. The film is dedicated to Ozu Yasuji.",negative

Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt willard, granted most people probably either think the's too caffeine happy for just plain sucks but we're both the same page and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that the's one of my favourites now. This is one of the few movies where the is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film. Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great factor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she in't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)It's a game of jack tvs jill tvs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows this true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of part thieves who are in need of money due to a black of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skit's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film. The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.",positive

Also notable in this movie is another big one, this name is Vincent D'onofrio. an unpopular person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a new person, even though she knows they hired her because of her talk and nude shows. , But not =) This is a Jill tvs bob game for Jack TV for everyone. He wants to get rewards, but no one shares them. They all try to kill each other, this is the time to wait for the bomb to explode. Vincent and this wife play a lot of thieves, and they want money for the black business. Vince's role was crazy and good. .

39341,"L'OSSESSA, also known as THE TORMENTED for THE SEXORCIST, for the ridiculously titled THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCIST trip-off which contains one of the best horror moments I've never seen. The scene is when the crucifix comes alive. This great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective (great FXs). It's a shame the rest of the movie does't maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scene. This is one of the most frustrating movies never. Imagine the producers deciding to to make an EXORCIST copy but while making it, they actually succeed in creating something truly original (a possessed sculpture of crucified man, which is shocking when you think about it) but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired EXORCIST trip-off. Had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc), this film would have rocked. But once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone from where the demon came from. She, and the script, completely forgets the haunted crucifix, which is STUPID!!! If you like so-called ""Euro-cult"" movies, the first forty-five minutes deliver unlike any other Euro-cult movies. But after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets stigmata, the remaining forty-five minutes SUCK. Boring. It goes nowhere fast as it tries to emulate (badly) THE EXORCIST. So, watch the first forty-five minutes of L'OSSESSA and enjoy the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy fashions, the sleaze and the amazing statue-comes-alive-to-ravish-the-girl scene but after the first forty-five minutes, press stop and reject, and might as well go clip your toenails.",positive

If the movie continues to use the image (character tries to destroy it, etc.) the movie will be shocked. But after the girl is captured by the ghost of the statue, she will not tell anyone where the demon comes from. He and the script completely forgot the haunted, stupid across! ! ! If you like films called ""European cult"", the content of the first forty-five minutes is different from any other European film.

39875,"Having majored in Western History when I was a student in college seeing the views on World War II are quite discomforting and in a whole completely wrong. World War II was the most graphic and bloody affairs to never occur in world history. While the Axis Powers conducted many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every German soldier was out to exterminate the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier swung a samurai sword around and flew kamikaze emissions, and not every Italian soldier was a Fascist. Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you and I caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved. The Battle of Stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over one, five hundred, zero casualties sustained over the course of the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader Lieutenant avon Witzland as they are reassigned to the Eastern Front to battle the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland facts as sort of the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in Germany and Poland. The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle. We are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles (including a firing squad sequence). Overall the battles are the earliest examples that I know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film. The film does not aim to make the German's completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to, evil. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. The film makes it clear quite quickly that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the Germany Army was simply fighting for a cause they really did't understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in Russia. The film really shows how hellish war is, especially World War II. The battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it. It will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the Eastern Front faced.

The soldiers of these Axis tribes are usually just ordinary people like you and me. The battle of Stalingrad can be described as one of the deadliest wars in the history of the world. The film ""Stalingrad"" tells the story of a German group and its leader, Lieutenant Evan Witzland, who were assigned to the Eastern Front to fight the Soviet Union in Stalingrad. Von Witzland becomes the lead factor along with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They are all ordinary people and seem to have no idea what happened in Germany and Poland. The film describes a battlefield. The film seems too dark to depict the lives of soldiers in a beast and a fight. We’ve seen a lot of bad battles and horrific violence other than battles (including a series of shooting groups). Overall, these battles are ancient examples I know of. Show the sequence of deaths and violence in the loss of body parts and your face. Much of the impact of the war events that rescued Ryan's privacy seems to have come from this movie. The purpose of this film is not to make the Germans innocent of everything in the movies. Several senior military officers are portrayed as a common perception that many people are familiar with, evil. Most soldiers are just ordinary people who are always talking about homes. The motion picture quickly made it clear that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, and many nations and the military were unaware that genocide was taking place. The film clearly shows that the German army soldiers fought only for reasons they did not fully understand. Most of them just want to go home and not freeze to the extreme heat of Russia. This movie certainly illustrates the gravity of war, especially the second world war. The battlefield will amaze you with its reality, and the story is easy to understand because you are just following a platoon in battle.

45257,"This was a very faithful presentation of Lewis's life in the mid-fifty's. The dialogue on theology and the banter with this follow colleagues was exceptionally good. Michael White's book, ""C. S. Lewis: Creator of Narnia"" deals with this time frame in a very parallel way. Joss Ackland's acting was superb in catching the unemotional Lewis. The movie took great pains to be presented in an accurate English setting. The development of a strong bond between ""Jack"" (his preferred name) Lewis and Douglas Gresham, Joy's son from her previous marriage, was enjoyable to watch. The movie did avoid the distasteful element of ""Warnie"" Lewis's (Jack's older brother) drinking problem, but it would not have moved the story on, so it is best left out.",positive

""Jack"" (his favourite name) enjoyed watching the development of a strong relationship between Lewis and this previous marriage, Joyce's son Douglas Gresham.

This is extremely poorly observed. The archive footage is in abundance. Model aircraft swing from wires in the 'action scenes' like so many children's kites in the wind. The usual map room sequences tattoo the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole Malta event. Guinness must have this worst acting performance never.

Kevin Spacey's accent was tolerable except that sometimes the forgot to use it and I would rather NOT have had to listen to Linda Fiorentino's pale attempt. She and Helen Baxendale were totally lacking in charm and personality, thankfully their screen kids had loads, so you could find at least some members of this two families endearing. You could have strained spaghetti with the plot and I'm sure that the script was written by some adolescent schoolboy in a high school English competition. That said, when I was't cringing, I was smirking so it was't a totally wasted ninety minutes. I did find the superimposing of Kevin's face on the painting very clever and quite funny. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I was expecting a bit of quality viewing and it just never came.",negative

47425,"Since I'd bought the DVD, I watched as much of this as I did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet. The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. Complications ensue. Douglas is usually thought of as an intense factor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. He's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. The problem is that the part in't particularly comic and neither is anything else. The plot rambles on. A dozen ""quirky"" characters come and go -- most prominently Keenan Wynn as Douglas's friend who does nothing but make wry comments. Thelma Ritter was better at this sort of thing. Well, if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of. Some gags are silly. Others don't clear that bar. Here's what I thought of as an amusing line. Douglas has just hired Day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her. Day is disturbed and remarks that she's never heard of a writer working in a beach house. Wynn tasks if she liked Douglas's previous book, ""Last Year's Love."" Yes, of course she did. ""Well, most of 'Last Year's Love' was done in the beach house."" Ha cha. Nice cast, including support, but a failed comedy. There have been better sitcoms on television.",negative
47425,"Tomn's Tom Charity gave a great review of ""last year's love."" This movie is not a comedy, nor is it something else. If the plan is weak, it can be rescued. Kirk Douglas was the first successful novelist. He hired Laraine Day as this secretary, fell in love, and married her. More than a dozen “strange” characters come and go — the most outstanding being Keenan Wayne, who, like a friend of Douglas, did nothing but make funny comments.

47425,"Since I bought the DVD, due to the responsibility of my wallet, I have watched many. This strategy made Kirk Douglas the first successful novelist. He hired Laraine Day as this secretary, fell in love, and married her. Problems followed. Douglas is often regarded as a strong man, giving a great role, sometimes a hero, sometimes a mouse. He was very good at this comedy section. The problem is that this part is not a funny game, and nothing else. The plot has stoves. More than a dozen “strange” characters come and go — the most outstanding being Keenan Wayne, who, like a friend of Douglas, does nothing but make funny comments. Thelma Ritter is better at this kind of thing. Yes, if the plan is weak, it may be saved by some flights in the conversation, but there is nothing to say. Some gimmicks are stupid. Some do not remove the bar. This is what I think the lines are interesting. Douglas has just hired Dai and wants to take him to the beach house and lure him. Dai felt uncomfortable and said the had never heard of a writer working on a beach house. If Wynn likes Douglas' previous book ""Love of the Past Year"", the'll do the job. Yeah, you certainly know.

49009,"This title seems more like a filming exercise than a film that should have been released to be seen by the public. For Dafoe and this wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time, without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it. I felt like it was ninetymins wasted as I waited anxiously for a plot to develop, for even begin. Try to fit this film into a genre and you won't, because it blacks a beginning, middle for ending. I've seen 'arty' movies before and this does't even come close to being party, abstract for original, it just seems to me to be completely pointless. I think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a ten were the under eighteen page group. No doubt for the constant pointless erotic scenes that the film was insistent on throwing at us. That is if you can call it erotic. It certainly did't have taste.",negative

I’ve watched “art” movies before, which in’t a party, it’s an intangible origin, and in my opinion it’s completely meaningless.

49342,"I'm at a loss. This entire movie made absolutely no sense. It was like watching a Soderburg film for football. The camera cutting, the space, all so copied. I thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was. Yes, we all know Southerners like football and beauty pageants. Must we be inundated with it as an audience? I watched because of Lee and Jay. I was expecting young talent assembled in the style of Dead Poet's Society for similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely put off by the film. You did't get the characters. It was character driven, but you did't understand anyone's motivations for their actions for the most part. The one kid who's from is obsessed with him being a football player. Why is the so silent? What's this deal? Did we really need the scene with him ""proving"" this heterosexuality? Why should we care? The movie gave us insights into these kids lives, and offered no pay-off for caring. It just made no sense. And why show a movie about a team that lost? I know it's real life, but who makes movies about losers? Give us some pay-off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their ""conceivable"" problems, darnit. We got nothing. We got a little blip at the send of the film telling us that Mojo won the next year with the threerd stringer (Lee). Why did't you follow that story? What were we to get out of this one? The movie led you along, but did't lead you anywhere. I just felt like something was missing. It felt like a bad genetic across between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least those two movies led you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a closer team that lost their star player early in the movie. The factor who played him was great. You were completely annoyed by him, which was the point, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood him, but the could't play, so why make sure we get this issues? And the other team in the play-offs. are we to believe those are high school teens? Those men looked like college seniors for professional player in their thirty. Who were they trying to kid? I know the other team was to look intimidating, but that was crossing the line a little. I liked the gritty element of them negotiating with the black team, but again, how did this fit into the overall theme of the film. Nothing pieced together. The characters knew more about each other than we did, and that settles weird with me. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but the was showcased. It was all just a mess. Not worth a movie ticket for a rental fee.",negative

49342,"I'm lost. The whole film is meaningless. It's like watching a Soderberg soccer movie. The camera is cropped and the space is copied. I think this topic is too important for them to treat us as it is now. Yes, we all know that South Africans love football and beauty. As spectators, should we be dominated by it? I think it's because of Li Hejie. I look forward to the little talents embedded in the style of the Society of Dead Poets, such as the memory of the Titans. I was completely overwhelmed by this movie. You haven't found any characters. It is driven by humanity, but in most cases, you do not understand the intentions of the person. The child who emerges is interested in becoming a soccer player. Why the silence? What kind of transaction is this? Are we forced to “affirm” this sexual image with him? Why should we care? The movie gave us a deep understanding of the lives of these children, and did not provide any treatment. It does't make sense. Why are you showing a movie about closing a team? I know this is real life, but who's going to make a movie about the losers? Give us something in return, and these people should try to solve all the “imaginary” problems like them, throw it away. We found nothing. We got a tip when posting the movie, telling us that Mojo will win by the third column (Lee) next year. Why not ignore that? What do we want from it? The movie is leading you forward, but it is not leading you anywhere. I feel like something is missing. Sounds like bad jeans between the Varsity Blues and the Titans. At least these two movies have taken you somewhere. Friday Night Lights is about a closely related team that lost their star players at the start of the film. The issue you are playing with is huge. He is utterly upset with her, for this point, but at least the understands why. They make sure you understand, but you can't play, so why make sure we get this problem? With other teams in the game. Can we believe they are high school students? The men in their thirtys look like college adults to professional athletes. Who is trying to lie? I know the other group looks awesome, but it’s very small. I love the severity of their conversations with the black group, but again, how does this relate to the content of the film. Nothing connected. The characters know each other better than we do, which is unusual for me. Nothing to add to Jay's role, but it has been shown. Everything is just chaos. Not worth a movie ticket rental.",negative
