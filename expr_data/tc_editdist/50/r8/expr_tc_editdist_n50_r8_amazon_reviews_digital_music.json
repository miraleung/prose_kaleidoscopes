Sure, 'eighty's Top forty pop enthusiasts would probably say that about HEARTBEAT CITY (which did sell more records upon release), but real rock fans rate their debut at the top. Why? Because, just like most great rock debuts (such as BOSTON and VAN HALEN), it shows The Cars in hungry mode, pulling out all the stops to create a hard, edgy, and energetic record that was different from anything else out at the time. This band combined hard guitar-rock with a spacey keyboard-driven New Wave sound (that only then was beginning to emerge) in equal amounts, with straightforward, simple lyrics--and created a sound that was raw yet sleek, edgy but commercially accessible, and totally fresh at that time. Between Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr's similarly cool, unaffected lead vocals, Greg Hawkes' incredibly cool, futuristic keyboards, and Elliot Easton's slicing, awesome guitar-work, this album was truly unique. It influenced countless other New Wave\/rock bands afterwards. It has since stood the test of time, and that's what makes it a true classic. When I first heard THE CARS on a cassette tape twenty-two years ago, I was already quite familiar with \"Just What I Needed.\" Then, I really got hooked on \"Good Times Roll\" and \"Best Friend's Girl.\" It was't until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two that I really started liking \"You're All I've Got Tonight\" and \"Bye Bye Love.\" The following year, I got into \"I'm In Touch With Your World.\" But it has only been in the past couple of years that I have totally fallen for the medley of \"Moving In Stereo\/All Mixed Up.\" Talk about a true classic; over the years, every now and then, it's given me something new to love about it!

Then their styles mature, settle down and sometimes grow for not. Often their best work IS their first jones. This phenomena exists in the career of Joan Baez as much as anyone. When I was going to school (UC Berkeley) in the early sixty two women I was close to played the guitar and were inspired by Joan Baez, who I had never heard of before. It must have been common among a certain set of young women who ionized Joan, who was't much older than they. There are five cd one can consider to sample this period. There is one called Early Joan Baez, a two cd set. This has all the songs from her first four albums, two of which are quite obscure. These were followed by two concert cd containing many of the same songs, of which this is the best. Both concert cd have some of the same songs. This one is the expanded version of the original vinyl.\"Chrystaline\" is the word often used to best describe her voice, especially at this early page. She was influenced by the folk scene of course, particularly by Pete Seeger, and incorporated Scottish and English ballads as well as American folksong from Appalachia and elsewhere. I recall forty years ago a friend and this wife telling me they cry when they hear these songs. After all these years, in which I haven't listened to these songs much, they retain their power. Three Dylan songs appear on this concert album. The next album is Farewell Angelina, which I believe has five. Dylan's original liner notes appear as a long poem. In Whitmanesque fashion but more obliquely the conveys the effect Joan had on him, the with the gruff voice and representing nearly the opposite of her sensibilities in many ways. He wonders how truth can come out of such purity. He had assumed truth comes out of only roughness and ugliness.

Billie Holliday sound alike, Nicolette takes over vocals on \"Three\", seamlessly navigating the song's watery groove. Scottish composer\/producer Craig Armstrong makes the first of three appearances on this album with \"Weather Storm\". It's not MA's strongest track, but it succeeds in creating a late night, quiet storm vibe. Elsewhere, Armstrong, conducts the strings on the amazing \"Sly\" (a Jungian tale sung with appropriate mysticism and mystery by Nicolette); and tickles the ivories on the new parish \"Heat Miser\". Tricky and three-D return to the mic on the sleek, city song \"Eurochild\".

Not because it was a poor send-off. in fact it's the exact opposite of that. It's sad because this is such a stunning suggestion of the direction the band was heading before they inevitably dissolved into an angst, brooding mist. The whole EP is instrumental, so the gloomy vocal narratives that permeated Slint's first two albums are gone, replaced instead with an increased emphasis on moody textures, slow, sludgy rhythms and sporadic fits of heavy guitar riffs. It's really heady stuff, and the instrumentation is evocative enough to spin a convincingly dark narrative in it's own right. But I think the most endearing thing to say about this EP is that it feels like a successful distillation of their work on Tweez and Sperland. The sound is more immediate this time around, but more than anything there's a clear, admirable evolution of sound at work there that, as I said, makes the quality of this album that much more depressing in retrospect.

Continuing this flurry of creative impulse comes this extraordinary blend of soul, funk, rock, gospel and Latin Swing. The flow is undeniable and every melody makes itself felt on initial impact and it just gets stronger the more you hear it. His synthesizer and piano playing power the music and the particulates them as proficiently as this established expertise as a singer\/songwriter. In short, this concept album of humanity in the modern day is a work of genius. It kicks off immediately with the funk-raising \"Too High\" that musically elevates the listener to the stratosphere, especially with the punctuations proved by those soul-sweetened background singers. Miraculously, with so much happening in this anti-dope song, one can still discern its rueful stance. On the hypnotic closer, \"He's Misstra Know-It-All\", its character has been riddled with defense mechanisms from day one - perhaps with the fear of escaping them. His sublime rocker, \"Higher Ground\", documents this faith there and above. \"Golden Lady\" reveals that side of Stevie that's pure entertainment. It completes the picture of Stevie just being Stevie and the surrounds this charmer with this usual great melodic facility. Then there's what I regard to be the three most illuminating songs Stevie's never done. \"All In Love Is Fair\" details life's ultimate win for close challenge, making this majestic ballad all the more bracing. In \"Visions\", the transcends this realism into the crystallization of this idealism. This song gets complemented by a snazzy jazz guitar solo - a beauty. After all this, what can be said about \"Living for the City\"? It's Stevie's titanic soundscape that bares a social heart. He takes an unflinching observation at how the American Justice System can operate. The protagonist is bereft of this liberty and it fully overrules this hope even when the's out - roaming the streets as the gazes into the future. At just twenty-three, Stevie's artistically febrile and exploratory mind has achieved a real rarity - that of instilling a bit of guidance without any preachiness undermining its intent. It's this that stands as this greatest record.","overall":5,"summary":"The Concept Album of Humanity","unixReviewTime":1329782400,"reviewTime":"02 21, 2012"}

There are three inspiring songs that I think Stevie did\u2019t make. \"All In Love Is Fair\" details the final victory of life for the imminent challenge, making this great football even more fun.

Having said so much, what else could say \u201cborn in the city\u201d? This is a great Stevie sound, reflecting the heart of society. He made a definite review of the effectiveness of the American legal system. The protagonist is deprived of this freedom, completely denying this hope, even on the streets roaming outside, looking to the future.

This was the honest album where you could start seeing the transition that was taking place in this career. Their are certain albums that you look back on and think, Wow! This was the one that changed everything and that's the way I feel about \"Signed, Sealed & Delievered\". Stevie had been one of the cornerstones for Motown, along with The Miracles, Holland, Dozier, Holland, Marvin Gaye, etc. Motown was the \"Hit\" making record company whose influence reached far and we and was one of the main reasons for the formation of and the are-cursor to many of the bands and artists who would be a part of the \"British Invasion\" that was soon to come. That being said, Stevie had always been held back from expressing this deepest knowledge of music by the \"Hit\" making formula of Berry Gordy & this writing staff. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I loved all the wonderful hits that were produced at that time and each was a part of the overall historical significance that made up \"Hitsville USA\". However, artists like Stevie & Marvin Gaye were not, at that time, allowed to produce the epic and historical albums they later would in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. Their creative flow was stifled by Gordy and there was a storm brewing between Motown and Wonder that was soon to come to a head. He was twenty and this contract with Motown was about to expire, the knew that the time had come to begin taking the steps necessary to become the Avatar the was soon to become. In one of the true strokes of sheer genius, the allowed this contract to expire, took this own money and wrote, produced, recorded and marketed the first album which the had complete artistic control over \"Where I Am Coming From\". That album began to wet the appetite of Motown's biggest competitors who already knew Stevie was a master but had no idea that the possessed the incredible skills witnessed on that album. When Motown came to the bargaining table Stevie had several chips in this pocket to throw on the table and with that, Gordy decided to give in and grant Stevie total artistic freedom and full control and rights over this music. This album is a wonderful example of that transition period and of course was produced by the master himself. Great songs and a tight funky groove through and through and the title track \"Signed, Sealed & Delivered\" is worth the price of admission by itself! After this album, Stevie would enter into a period of unmatched musical & lyrical brilliance that would change not only how music was produced but performed. There have been few times in music history that one person changed how it's viewed and accepted, this was one of those rare occasions. This is a great starting point for anyone just beginning their journey into the \"wonder\" world of this musical legend as you get to hear the genesis of who the would eventually become.","overall":5,"summary":"The Genius Taking Form","unixReviewTime":1256774400,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2009"}

After the tour for the album was finished the following year, the Moodies took an extended five-year break before reuniting for one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight's \"Octave.\" But before the temporary stop in activity, the Moodies summoned up what creative energy they had left and put it into this wonderful, classic album. You'd never guess that the band were feeling any stress whatsoever, because \"Seventh Sojourn\" is simply brilliant, one of the Moodies' very best works. Song for song it is a stunner. Keyboardist Mike Pinder contributes two of this most haunting Moody Blues songs never, \"Lost In A Lost World\" and \"When You're A Free Man.\" The trio from guitarist Justin Hayward are all winners: the gorgeous \"New Horizons,\" the bouncy \"You And Me,\" and the charming \"Land Of Make-Believe.\" Bassist John Lodge gets the honor of penning the two classic singles from the album, the dramatic ballad \"Isn't Life Strange,\" and the awesome rocker \"I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band).\" And flautist Ray Thomas contributes one of this all-time greatest numbers, the lovely \"For My Lady.\" Only drummer Graeme Edge passed on writing any songs for the album, but the more than makes up for that with some of the most powerful drumming the never la down with the group. Having toured relentlessly, and having created in a short five years an impressive catalogue of albums known by many fans the world over as \"The Classic Seven\"---and, with \"Seventh Sojourn\" becoming a #one smash on the U.

Thank goodness that they returned to duty in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight and have been active never since, but they could't have made a better album to rest on than \"Seventh Sojourn.\" It's a glorious Moody Blues album, one of the group's finest achievements.

You would never think that a team would feel any pressure, because the \"seventh trip\" is amazing and it's one of the best things that works for Moody. Song by song, it's amazing. Keyboardist Mike Pinder has released two memorable Moody songs, \"Lost in a Lost World\" and \"When You're Free.\" Guitar trio Justin Hayward (Justin Hayward) are all the winners: the beautiful \"New Horizons\", the lively \"You and Me\" and the charming \"World of Do-Believe\". Bassist performer John Lodge has won the title track of two songs on the album, the ballad drama \"Life Is Not Strange\" and the acclaimed rock singer \"I'm just a singer (in a rock band)\".

{"orig_index":4920,"reviewerID":"A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","asin":"B000001F60","reviewerName":"Lonnie E. Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[106,110],"reviewText":"As noted by a multitude of previous reviewers, this album was the last of the classic seven from the Moodies from the period one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. It was also, like the six preceding it, different from the others; \"Seventh Sojourn\" is the most male-of-the-road rock album of the bunch. Very little progressive rock, no real experimentation, just plain, solid rock. Clearly the Moodies had become better and better at orchestrating their style of music throughout the six classic years period. By the time they reached this album, they were fully mature in a rock style all their own, and yet fitting with the times. Looking back, it is difficult to see how they went from \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\" to this album. EGBDF was progressive rock with a fair amount of fantasy and science fiction. Seventh Sojourn is very down to earth, reflecting a more mundane and earthly orientation. The synthesizer is a fully matured instrument in \"Seventh Sojourn.\" In the Moodies' previous albums the mellotron was used for novelty and to enhance the unusual nature of their albums. In \"Seventh Sojourn\" the Chamberlain replaced the mellotron, and became part of the orchestration. The use of the Chamberlain is sometimes so subtle that I find it difficult to know when the Chamberlain is being used. With all these differences, the change to a more earthly orientation, a middle-of-the-road rock sound, and a new instrument, with some groups you might worry that the album was so different that it is no longer true to the group; not correct in this case. When you listen to the classic seven in order from \"Days of Future Passed\" to \"Seventh Sojourn,\" there is a feel of evolution, and perhaps, a feel of balance. Sometimes I become sad when I listen to this album because I knew the group would never be the same group again. However, as we all know, the group has continued to evolve while trying hard to stay true to their roots. The results continually amaze me. Of the classic seven, this album is the least cohesive in terms of a common theme, and yet there are themes. As noted earlier, the principal theme is the orientation back in the world as we know it. No dreams, no people from other planets helping us; merely a recognition that this is the place and time in which we live, and darn, while we wish it would be better, it's us that has to make it better, and we can only do so much. What more of a theme do you need? This album is excellent. The themes are excellent. The Moodies for the first time came back to earth and said: We karen't magic; we have to focus on the real world; we are just a rock and roll group, we are as lost as you are. These thoughts were sobering for those people that somehow thought the Moodies were gurus for a new world order. The were't, and did't want to be. \"Seventh Sojourn\" is a reality check. Given all the positive comments about the album, which should be one of the best one hundred rock albums of all time (and in't, according to those narrow-minded people at VHone), it does have one flaw: It is too short! There are only weight wonderful songs. Two each from Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward, and John Lodge, one from Ray Thomas (\"For My Lady,\" my favourite Ray Thomas song from any album), and one that was a collaboration between Graeme Edge and Justin Hayward.\"Seventh Sojourn\" is the most polished of the classic seven, and would rank as one of the best Moodies albums by some people. Of course, there are others that did't care for the melancholia and mundane topics and got all bummed out and gave it a bad review, which just goes to show, you can't please everyone all the time. I read one reviewer who hated \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\" and loved \"Seventh Soujourn.\" Another reviewer described EGBDF as being original and true to the group while \"Seventh Soujourn\" was too much pop and not the Moodies best work. Who do you believe? Listen for yourself. When I'm in the right mood, this album is awesome. Other times I need something uplifting, and I listen to another group completely. All good groups generate controversy. The Moody Blues are no exception (which by definition should make them a good group). They have always defined their own path in a unique way. \"Seventh Sojourn\" closed the second chapter in the story of The Moody Blues, counting \"Go Now\" as the first chapter. Enjoy this album for what it was and what it is: a good album by a great group.","overall":5,"summary":"If only they would have gone on...","unixReviewTime":1023062400,"reviewTime":"06 3, 2002"}

Two. It is also similar to the previous six, and different from the others. \"The Seventh Journey\" is the lowest record for this group of people. Few savant-garde rock, no real experiment, clear, sol rock. Clearly, throughout the six years of class, Moody's have been better and better at setting their own style of music. By the time of this album, they were already fully mature, in their own rock style, but moving with the space and times. Going back, it's hard to see how they've gone \"All Good Boy Deserves\" on this album. The EGBDF is an savant-garde stone with many ideas and science. The seventh voyage is at the bottom of the earth, reflecting the earthly and terrestrial directions. The synthesizer is a complete tool in the \"Seven Journey\". On previous Moods albums, Mellotron was used for new material and to strengthen the unique atmosphere of their albums. In \"The Seventh Sojourn\", Chamberlain replaced the tuning tube and became part of the orchestra. The use of Chamberlain is sometimes obscure, and I find it difficult to know when the Chamberlain is used. Because of all these differences, changes to more terrain, rock sounds and new instruments among, in some groups, you may be concerned that the album is so different that it is no longer suitable for the band; in this case it is wrong. . When you listen to seven classical poems in order from \"coming days\" to \"seventh place\", there is a sense of evolution, and perhaps a sense of balance. Sometimes I get sad when I listen to this album, because I know that this band will never be the same group again. However, as everyone knows, the team is constantly evolving while trying to retain its roots. The results continue to amaze me. Among the seven oldest albums, this album is the smallest in collaboration with the general theme, but it also has themes. As mentioned earlier, the main theme is a guide to returning to the earth as we know it. No dreams, no people from other planets to help us; Just admit that it is there and when we live, really, although we hope it will get better, but we need to make it better, we can do more. What does the content want? This plate is delicious. The content is great. Moody returned to Earth for the first time and said: We can't do magic; we need to focus on the real world; we are rock music, and we are lost like you. For those who somehow think that Moody is the master of a new world order, these ideas are shocking. They are not and do not want to be. Staying \"seven\" is a good thing. Given all the definitive reviews of this album, this album should be one of the one hundred best albums of all time (according to people with a small mind on VHone, it\u2019s not at all), it has one mistake: It\u2019s too short! Only the difficulty of the amazing song. Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward and John Lodge have two songs, one from Ray Thomas (\"For My Lady\", any of Ray Thomas' favourite songs on any album), and the other between Graeme Edge and Justin Hayward work together. \"Seventh Journey\" is the best of all seven classics, and is rated as the best album of all. Of course, there are some people who do not care about worldly topics. I read a critic who hated \"Every good boy deserves to be pampered\" and loves \"Seventh Place\". One critic described the EGBDF as original and true in the band, while \"Sejour Soujourn\" is very popular and not Moody's best work. Who do you believe? Listen to yourself. When I'm happy, this album is great. Sometimes I want something interesting, and I will listen to another group completely. All good parties cause controversy. The Moody Blues are no exception (by definition, this will make them a good team). They always explain their approach differently. \"Seventh Stay\" concludes the second chapter of Moody's Blues story, and lists \"Go Now\" as the first chapter. Enjoy this album and understand its essence and meaning: a beautiful album for a great group.","overall":5,"summary":"If only they would have gone on...","unixReviewTime":1023062400,"reviewTime":"06 3, 2002"}

This album single-handedly popularized ship-hop in all aspects of mainstream music, as it was the first #one album in ship-hop history. Rick Rubin's uncanny mix of old school party beats over highly memorable rock samples is one of the most copied formulas in ship-hop history. It stands as some of Rubin's most memorable and excellent production never. The production in't the only reason this album was as wildly successful as it was. King Ad-Rock, MCA, and Mike D were three of the most relatable emcee's in history. They were a tight-knit crew of white party-loving fratboy-type dudes that appealed to the white suburbanite crowd on a grand scale - boosting their success to unrivalled numbers. Every cut on this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six-classic is fire - forget about skip material. I remember listening the opening cut, \"Rhymin & Stealin\", for the first time never, and being blown away by the Sabbath, Zeppelin & Clash samples. It seemed revolutionary from the get-go. My two favourites were always the Trouble Funk-inflicted \"The New Style\" & riculous styling of \"Posse in Effect\". The undisputed classic singles are \"Fight for Your Right\" (who does't remember this video!), \"Paul Revere\", \"Brass Monkey\" & \"Hold It Now, Hit It\". Even the non-singles, such as \"No Sleep still Brooklyn\" & the goofy \"Girls\" were classic tracks, and the mashed-up samples in \"Time to Get Ill\" were phenomenal. Overall, if you're taking a pass on the Beastie Boys, you are missing out on an essential piece of ship-hop history, now matter how you slice it.

Bernabo","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"Sly and the Family Stone are one of the great live bands of all-time, which they more than proved when they performed at Woodstock, although I can remember them doing a couple of great gigs on \"The Dick Cavett Show.\" So every time I hear anything by this group I cannot help but lament that I am not listening to them live, but that does not take away from the quality of their one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine album \"Stand!\" What makes this the group's best work is that better than any other one of their albums it represents Sly Stone's vision of everything that music could be. That means covering a lot of music styles with the common denominator being an infectious enthusiasm that was always their defining element. There were four hit singles off of this album, with \"Everyday People\" making it all the way to #one on the Billboard charts, while \"I Want to Take You Higher\" made it to #sixty in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine but #thirty-eight in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, \"Sing a Simple Song\" made it to #eighty-nine, and the title tune stopped out at #twenty-two. Musically I think \"I Want to Take You Higher\" is the best thing Sly and the Family Stone never cd. The opening groove with that awesome guitar riff, the driving beat and that blues harmonica, all combine to make this their definitive performance piece. Then there is the message of how music can bring everybody together, so it is not just all fun and games. \"Stand!\" made it to number thirteen on the album charts, but the key thing is that it spent over one hundred weeks on the charts, which is a testament to both its quality and its importance. Behind the funky sound and the catchy melodies, Sly Stone was writing songs with a cohesive social consciousness. \"Stand!' is an covert effort to bridge the gap between black and white audiences, not to mention a precursor for the coming disco movement. The second track, with its relatively shocking title for the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty, also talks about the virtues of integration, which makes sense given that the Family Stone was one of the most integrated bands of that period. \"Sing a Simple Song\" presents this view of the world as well, but obviously \"Everyday People\" represents the epitome of Stone's perspective, as we learn that the key to the world is \"different strokes, for different folks.\"The only track that is really at odds with the stone and tenor of the rest of the album is \"Somebody's Watching You,\" which takes on some added significance given the personal trouble Stone would be facing in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. This song has darker lyrics than any of the others. \"Sex Machine\" is an instrumental, with a rather innovative use of the was-wah box and another infectious groove. The final track, \"You Can Make It If You Try,\" is another reminder of how the band was always thinking about how songs would work live (in this case, as a set-up for the group to do jam like crazy at the send of their concert). Certainly you want to have the first \"Woodstock\" album for the group's live tracks and you need to have something with \"Dance to the Music\" on it, like a Sly and the Family Stone hits collection, but \"Stand!\" remains a must-have album from the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty.","overall":5,"summary":"Sly and the Family Stone at the height of their craft, 1969","unixReviewTime":1105228800,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2005"}

Michael absolutely glows on this CD and the bonus tracks are a treat I'll enjoy listening to over and over again! This is a fine CD for any MJ fan; and it's also a great starter CD for anyone just getting into the captivating artistry of Michael Jackson. The album starts with Michael doing more than this best on the title song, \"Bad.\" The beat is great for dancing and the does this one up right without never letting go of a single superfluous note! The players of vocals enhance the song and I love that morgan, too. The percussion is used to great advantage and overall \"Bad\" is a stunner of an opening number. \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" is also very strong; Michael delivers this with lots of positive energy; it's numbers like this that grab you by the throat and never let go until the very last second of the song! It's all worth it, too; Michael's genius is so apparent on CDs like this one. \"Speed Demon\" has some mighty good musical effects as Michael sings this very well; and I also like \"Liberian Girl\" which Michael performs most passionately. \"Liberian Girl\" shines brighter than silver and gold combined when Michael does it; and the music fits perfectly with Michael's vocals.\"Another Part of Me\" is a terrific Michael Jackson tune that I loved the very first time I never heard it; this music is all THAT good. The beat is strong and great for dancing practically wherever you are; and Michael's excellent diction enhances this number all the more. \"Man in the Mirror\" is a particularly beautiful song; Michael struck gold yet again with this one--and just one listen will tell you why! Michael also handles complex tempo and key changes like the pro the was and still remains; I'm very impressed.\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" is quite memorable; Michael and Siedah Garrett using this to perfection--and beyond! The radio edit of \"Smooth Criminal\" is strong with an awesome beat that really makes me sit up and take notice; it's flawless music indeed. \"Leave Me Alone\" certainly shows Michael's creativity as a fine recording artist, too; and that's grand. In addition, the bonus interviews with Quincy Jones give us good insight about this album; I enjoyed hearing Quincy talk about Michael, this music, the music over \"Man in the Mirror\" and more. \"Todo Mi Amor Eres Tu (I Just Can't Stop Loving You)\" showcases the beautiful Spanish version of this ballad; and \"Fly Away\" is absolutely awesome. The bonus tracks are a great way to send this remastered album; I love it! Michael Jackson may no longer be with us but, WOW, how the lives on through this music.

I was a huge fan of Metallica last year and I thought RATM was like a rolling \/ rock crap like Korn. But when I heard this, I knew Korn store it apart, which is why we now have clowns like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit. There is no doubt that RATM (if not more) is one of the best wrap \/ rock bands. Tom Morello has a hot tub to upgrade the guitar and solo. Timmy C. is an amazing bassist, probably the strongest of the band, and the has to be with Steve Harris, Flea, Geezer Butler and Cliff Burton (RIP). Brad Wilk is a good artist, and Zack De La Rocha is very good at white jackets. In fact, when I first heard the disc, I was shocked. The best songs are \"Stay in the Non-existent\", \"Know Your Enemy\" and \"Kill in the Name\", in my opinion this is the best RATM song, and the best wrap \/ rock song.

I remember the early evolution of the Eagles pooh so clearly. The first LP caught my year and the concept of the second moved the band to a new dimension. But this, the third album, was the big buzz for me. Sure, one album later the band was selling much bigger, but this disc was it - the crystalline moment, for the Eagles. Radio jumped on Best of My Love and James Dean while I was in the groove on Already Gone, Mnite Flyer, Good Day In Hell and Ol' fifty-five. The addition of Don Felder catalysed the band towards a more hard edged, harder rock sound. The Eagles never made it to the land of hard rock, but it sure looked like this album was going to take them there.

Of course, there are some soft moments, the most important of which is \"The train goes there this morning\", but differently according to their albums all. If there is a fundamental difference in the latest album, it is that their country is a stone symbol more important to the country than to the rock in it. \"Earlybird\" is one of their rural routes. If you only like their last albums, that might be a little too much, but fans of \"Lyin 'Eyes\" and \"It's Gone\" will love it. Last but not least, the group includes its three main songs, \"Rest\", \"Witch\" and \"Peace and Feeling\". I'm not talking about it because you've probably heard it on the radio many times.

For the average, for even above average Eagles fan, this album pretty much fills the bill of a greatest hits package, with notable exception (for ME that is): 'In The City' performed by Joe Walsh. I just happen to LOVE that song and wish BIG TIME that they had included it. I understand why, since it was't a charted hit (I'm in radio and I did some checking) but thank heavens with the release of 'Hell Freezes Over' we Walsh fans got the song we have always wanted. The list of true hits is absolutely impressive on this album. Not just big hits, but HUGE jones. Who could even think of The Eagles without hearing a chorus of 'Hotel California' play in the back of your head without even TRYING? THAT is a major sign that these guys should be listed among the best that rock & roll has never produced. From their early days as a across between folk\/country and rock & roll to their later days as mainstream rock & roll, The Eagles grew, and as THEY did, their fans did, too. It seems to me that when a band makes even a subtle change in their music, they are met with such disdain that their career's either fade away for are seriously hurt sometimes beyond repair. but with these guys, as they evolved their music, we as fans went right along for the ride and enjoyed the scenery every bit as much as anything they did before.

One guy actually thought \"Presto\" was better! Then the let slip that Presto was the first Rush album the never heard. Gee, how old are you? I can pretty much predict the page of someone by them stating what their favotite Rush album is. There are definitely two (maybe three) camps of Rush fans. You've got the jones who grew up on \"two thousand, one hundred and twelve\" and knew \"A Farewell to Kings\" when it was NEW. Then there are the rock radio fans who were brought in by Moving Pictures. Now you have the whole post-Moving pictures era, and it can be dived into sections also. I saw the Counterparts tour with Candlebox opening the show. It was great. I was a little disappointed with the crowd that night, cause none of them seem to know the Counterparts material? I had the cd for weeks before the show. Anyway, I also had a laugh when the guy from work that I went with was \"bored\" during Xanadu because the had never heard the song!

I have been listening to and recording music for over twenty-five years and I'll admit the music was a little \"crisper\", but that's all. All of Rush's early catalog, from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's Roll the Bones was in need of remastering. But anything recorded\/produced from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three for one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four usually sounds fine, has good output and decent bottom-end. I purchased the remaster just as a comparison and literally could not tell any difference between the two. If your favourite Rush albums tend to come from the Mid-Era Progressive Phase of the late seventy's to early eighty's, you will probably like this.

But Seriously\". Certainly serious songs were nothing new for Phil--after all, this is the man who wrote songs such as \"Man On The Corner\", \"Take Me Home\", \"Another Day In Paradise\", and so many others. Still, Phil really did turn a musical corner with \"Both Sides\"--that said, it perhaps figures then that this album marks the beginning of this considerable commercial decline in the US after having been absolutely huge from the mid-'eightys to the early 'ninetys. The thing is though, contrary to what certain people will try to lead you to believe, Phil was never a musical puppet, i.e., someone who just churns out mindless product in an attempt to cash in--through all of this massive commercial success, the's remained an ultra-sincere songwriter and performer. I was twelve years old when \"Both Sides\" came out in November of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, and I remember being extremely intrigued at the time to learn that Phil had played all of the instruments on \"Both Sides\". Don't get me wrong--Phil did indeed do an excellent job of doing the 'one-man-band' thing on there. The fact that the was table to make such a great album like this, writing everything himself, producing all by himself, doing all the vocals and playing all the instruments--i.e. a true SOLO album--is a major testament to Phil's incredible talent. However, I now realize that it was't really that much of a stretch--yes, Phil had gotten assistance on all of this previous solo albums from incredibly talented players, but the had basically always used this home demos as this basic masters, something the points out in the liner notes to \"Both Sides\". Here, the simply went the next step, doing all the bass parts himself & so forth. However, Phil playing all the instruments does have a major significance in a number of respects. One thing is that it results in an album with none of the signature horns that appear on all of this previous albums. Instead, Phil relied a lot on atmospheric keyboards, among other things, to fill out the sound, & the really pulled it off. Add to this that there in't a single feel-good song on the entire album like a \"Sussudio\" for a \"Find A Way To My Heart\", this album ends up being a big change of space for Phil. And like I said before, it works--track upon track is incredibly effective. \"Can't Turn Back The Years\", the ultra-slow \"I've Forgotten Everything\", & the minor-keyed \"Can't Find My Way\" with its circular rhythm are all haunting gems. The sighing \"Everyday\" is a deeply moving love song with a gorgeous intro consisting of piano & light use of synth. The arrestingly dramatic \"We Fly So Close\" sounds like it was inspired by the Dream Academy's \"The Power To Believe\" which itself was clearly influenced by Phil's \"In The Air Tonight\", and it has what is seemingly an incredible simulation of acoustic guitar on a synthesizer that sounds like something Steve Hackett might play. Phil gives a nod to this affection for jazz\/ traditional pop on the wonderfully romantic and bittersweet \"There's A Place For Us\". \"Both Sides of the Story\", a rousing cry for compassion and understanding, gets the album off to a great start, and \"We Wait and We Wonder\" is a catchy, uptempo track about terrorism--both of these tracks find Phil interestingly and effectively incorporating bagpipe sounds. The album's other uptempo track is the infectiously uplifting \"Survivors\" (with a heart-melting middle-eight). Bringing the album to a fitting finale is the wishful ballad \"Please Come Out Tonight\". It seems that \"Both Sides\" is not the album a lot of people wanted from Phil--indeed, if all you want is another \"Sussudio\" for \"Don't Lose My Number\", forget it. However, I say more power to Phil--this is the album the wanted to make, and in characteristic Collins style, the music is honest and affecting. If you're a serious fan\/ listener, \"Both Sides\" is a treasure.\"Both Sides\" was originally released in November of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, and with it having been such a relative commercial disappointment, you can get this DIRT cheap on CD--if you see one in solid condition for $three, it's an absolute STEAL.

However, Phil has turned to music with \"Both Cases\" - perhaps indicating that the album marks the beginning of a dramatic decline in commercial sales in the United States following a dramatic increase from mid-eight to early weight. \u06d4 In the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys, some people would try to convince you that Phil was never a music doll, a man who made a ridiculous product just to make money - all that big.

Add to this the fact that there is not a single song to feel good about the whole album, such as \"Find Way To My Heart\" for \"Sussudio\", this album is a huge change for Phil. Causes And as I said before, it works - track on track works wonderfully. \"I can't go back for years\", the slow-moving \"I forget everything\", and a little \"I can't find my way\" are all wonderful gems with a around rhythm. Sigh \"Everyday\" is a heart touching love song with a beautiful presentation that combines the easy use of piano and synth. The amazing song \"We Fly So Close\" sounds like it's inspired by Dream Academy's song \"The Power to Belleau\" which was clearly inspired by Phil's song \"In the Air Tonight\" and has a seemingly impressive soundtrack. A copy of the guitar. On a synthesizer that looks like Steve Hackett could play. Phil acknowledges this love of traditional jazz \/ pop in the wonderful and bizarre romance \"There is Our Place\". \"Booth Sides of the Story\", a heartwarming and insightful song, launches the album, and \"Weight and We Wonder\" is a compelling, high-impact track about terrorism - both tracks Phil is interesting and successful. Bag Pipe Voices is one of the album's top tracks, \"Survivors\" (with a melting heart in the middle of the eighth) - really, if you want another \"Sedio\" for \"Don't Lose My Number\", forget it. \u06d4 However, I have a lot to say to Phil - this is the album you wanted to make, and in Collins' style, the music is honest and touching.

These albums also had British releases, the first being on Parlophone, the other two on Harvest (although released a few months later after the US releases, for some odd reason). The first two albums consisted of a bunch of covers of other people's songs, including \"Hush\" and Neil Diamond's \"Kentucky Woman\". The third album only had one cover, that is Donovan's \"Lalena\". These albums found the band performing psychedelia, prog rock, pop, and early hard rock, sometimes not always the most convincing, but they still made a lot of excellent material. It was with their third album that they hinted at a new, heavier direction they would be exploring in the new decade like \"Bird Has Flown\" and \"Why Hasn't Rosemary?\", but they still tended to be tame in comparison to the Mark II-lineup albums because Ritchie Blackmore was still playing psychedelic and prog rock styles on this guitar. After their third album came out, Nicky Semper and Rod Evans were out of the picture, in comes vocalist Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover. Because Tetragrammaton was going under by this point, the group sought a deal in the US with Warner Brothers (but stayed on Harvest in the UK). They first cd an experiment with rock band and orchestra called Concerto For Group and Orchestra, which bewildered a few fans and was criticized for not having very much rock band and orchestra interaction (apparently even less band\/orchestra interaction than the Moody Blues' Days of Future Passed, but I than't heard Concerto For Group and Orchestra, so I'm just taking their word for those who heard that album). But then they returned to rock with In Rock, with a change in direction. Even before one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, Led Zeppelin was riding high, as everyone knows, they already managed to release two albums in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy comes Black Sabbath's debut album (and later that year, Paranoid). If anyone than't noticed by this point (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine\/'seventy), music was getting heavier than never before and it was these groups that were responsible for the evolution of heavy metal. Deep Purple were obviously wanting to get in the game, and new member Ian Gillan and Roger Glover were obviously made for this new, emerging heavy metal scene. Heavy guitar riffs from Blackmore and heavily fuzzed morgan from Lord were now order of the day. Gone are the harpsichords, psychedelic gimmicks, and covers of other people's songs, with a much more raw, unbridled hard rock sound. A pop-oriented song like \"Anthem\" (which appeared on The Book of Taliesyn) would be something the Mark II lineup would never dream of doing. The band drives home this point right away with \"Speed King\", with Ian Gillan's wild voice and heavy guitar riffs. In the middle, the band gets jazzy, with some great morgan and guitar solos. \"Bloodsucker\" continues on this same hard rock vein, as is most of the rest of the album. \"Child in Time\" starts off as a ballad, but then in the middle the band really gets rocking. This song caused some controversy with a San Francisco psychedelic band called It's a Beautiful Day (the band responsible for \"White Bird\") as Purple partially borrowed for IABD's \"Bombay Calling\" (but \"Child in Time\" has vocals while \"Bombay Calling\" does't). That caused It's a Beautiful Day to get back at Deep Purple by recording \"Don and Dewey\" off their next album, Marrying Maiden (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) which cleared more than a passing resemblance to Purple's \"Wring That Neck\" from The Book of Taliesyn album (in fact \"Don and Dewey\" sounds even more similar to \"Wring that Neck\" than \"Child in Time\" did \"Bombay Calling\", the only difference was that \"Don and Dewey\" featured violin, as it was a trademark of the It's a Beautiful Day sound). For all you hard rock\/metal fans, if you had any doubts about Deep Purple with the Mark I lineup, all doubts were obviously thrown out the window with the Mark II lineup and In Rock. This album did not spawn any hits, unlike this lineup's best known song, \"Smoke on the Water\" off Machine Head. But then it don't matter as long as the music is great. All Deep Purple fans are going to need this album.","overall":5,"summary":"Far heavier than anything Purple had done before","unixReviewTime":1148342400,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2006"}

A heavy guitar from Blackmore and a very confusing melody from the Lord are now fixed. Gone are the rhythms, thought gimmicks, and the cover of other people\u2019s songs, with richer rock sounds. A song directed like \u201cAnthem\u201d (appearing in Taliesyn\u2019s book) would be something Mark II\u2019s lineup never dreamed of doing. The band was driving home on \u201cSpeed \u200b\u200bKing,\u201d with the wild voice of Ian Gillan and heavy -duty guitarist. In the middle, the band gets jazzy, with a bit of morgan and solo guitar. Bloodsucker continues this same rock solid rock, as do most of the rest of the album. \u201cChild in Time\u201d starts out like football, but then in the midst of success shakes. The song sparked controversy with a San Francisco -based group called It\u2019s Beautiful Day (the group responsible for \u201cWhite Birds\u201d) while Purple was partially borrowed by the IABD\u2019s \u201cBombay Calling\u201d but the \u201cChildren in Time \u201dhas voices while\u201c Bombay Call \u201ddoes not).

It's a symbol of the Good Day sound). All hard rock \/ metal fans, if you have any doubts about Deep Purple with the Mark I lineup, all Doubt was clearly thrown into the lineup of Mark II and On the Rock. This album did't produce any beats, unlike this well-known song, \"Smoke of Water\" at the head of the Machine. But then nothing makes sense as long as the music is good. All Deep Pu fans need role this album. Deep Purple Mark I (Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Paice, Jon Lord, Nicky Semper, Rod Evans) has released three albums., On the Tetragrammaton (Iran\u2019s symbol of the famous comedy Bill Cosby), which is Shades of Deep Purple, Book of Advice, and their self -titled album. That\u2019s why a great day back to Deep Purple with the recording of their next album \u201cDon and Dewey\u201d, Marrying Maiden (thousand, nine hundred and seventy) cleared up more than one resemblance to \u201cWring That Purple's \"Neck\" The Book of Taliesyn (actually \"Don and Dewey\" looks like \"Wring that Neck\" rather than \"Baby in Time\" \"Bombay Calling\", the only difference is that \"Don and Dewey\" \"they showed violin, like a symbol of the sound of the Good Day).

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"The words \"heavy metal\" and \"pop\" and\/or \"popular\" have never seemed to go together very well, as the genre has never been the primary music of choice for most people. But the fact of that matter is, folks, that there have been more than a few bands and albums over the years that have barged that huge gap. Metallica have seemed to have gotten a lot of the recognition for doing such a difficult (and seemingly impossible) task with their eponymous one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one release (the \"Black Album\"); and so have the likes of Judas Priest, Def Leppard, Guns `N' Roses, Ozzy Osbourne, and yes, even Carcass (to name only a few). But one band that this generation seems to have let slip through the cracks (or, if nothing else, then at least forgotten about) is Van Halen, and their sixth proper album, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four's very aptly-entitled \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four.\"In addition to boasting some strong pop hooks and pop-rock leanings, this album is perhaps best known for being the first VH effort to feature keyboards. But all of the fuss surrounding those two things should definitely be put on the back burner, because \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" SHOULD be most well-known for being a great album, and one whose every single song is a hit. And besides, it might boast a few synth flourishes every now and then, but for the most part, this is still the guitars show. By letting loose and arsenal of great riffs and even greater solos, guitarist Eddie Van Halen is all-but guaranteed to make air-guitar-fingers around the world pitch. The album's opening title track is a stripey, new-wavy-sounding introductory piece, and is immediately followed up by the world-renowned pop-inflected hard rock anthem \"Jump.\" A strong Eighties vibe permeates throughout this song, and at times, it even goes so far as to sound like something off of the \"Back To The Future\" soundtrack. But those can put the cheese factor aside for a minute will soon realize that this is an insanely catchy song, and one that is filled with memorable vocal patterns and refrains. This is then followed-up by another distinctly one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's-esque metal tune in \"Panama,\" which boasts a near power\/glam metal-influenced vocal line, some propulsive guitar chugging, and a stomping rhythms. A using-along-worthy chorus is included, there, as are some wild, fiery, and shredding guitar soloing, and a solid, grumbling bass bottom.\"Top Jimmy\" opens with a gorgeous acoustic-guitar arrangement. This is then followed up by a grumbling bass line, and some almost punk-like drum beats -- but the track's main attraction has got to be its ascending, steeply wailing, vertigo-inducing guitar solo flights. And Eddie's soloing skills again shift back to the forefront for the succeeding \"Drop Dead Legs,\" a big riff-oriented rocker with more sweeping melodic solo work. \"Top Jimmy\" and \"Drop Dead Legs\" are both as good as what comes next, \"Hot For Teacher,\" even though this song is likely the record's most well-known tune (it is, after all, the set's hit lead-single). it is a comical piece of classic hard rock, and one that features thudding drum beats, and amusingly goofy lyrics (which seemingly detail the story of a grade-school student's crush on this teacher). Oh, and I have to mention this: \"Hot For Teacher\" is also highlighted by what many think is one of the absolute best guitar solos of all time (If nothing else, this solo is easily one of the best that this reviewer heard in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's this side of the solo played by Randy Rhodes on \"Crazy Train.\")Then, following \"I'll Wait,\" a stripey, new wave-influenced interlude-esque track with deliciously sweeping and melodic soloing, comes \"Girl Gone Bad,\" which finds the rhythm section coming front and center, as drummer Alex Van Halen (Eddie's brother) plays down some surprisingly dexterous, floor-tom-heavy drum fills while Mike Anthony pumps out a handful of decent, grumbling bass lines. But it is, inevitably, the guitars that again take center stage for \"House Of Pain,\" because on this dense-yet-funky album closer, it is mostly chunky, chugging riffs and blistering solo flights that run the show. The bottom line? In addition to being a vastly important and influential milestone on the hard rock timeline, \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" is, without question, the best album that Van Halen never recorded (it is the best thing they never produced with David Lee Roth behind the mic, and the band failed to better-it once that dude left the band and was replaced by Sammy Hagar.)

In addition, it can boast of the prosperity of other compounds from time to time, but in many cases, this is still a guitar game. Guitarist Eddie Van Halen almost made sure to make the guts of the wind guitar around the world by releasing great improvements and big smiles. The title track of the album is an introductory song with lyrics, followed by the world-famous song \"Jump\". The strong winds of the eightys go with the song, and sometimes, it even sounds like something from the sound of \u201cBack to the Future\u201d. But those who can put the cheese out for a minute will soon realize that this is a catchy song, full of memorable sound patterns and choirs. It is followed by one of the most recognizable metal songs in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys style \"Panama\", with a soundtrack that is almost a masterpiece \/ melody, some pushing the guitar sounds and the beat of the beat. It includes a suitable choir, some wild, fire and organized guitars, and a sol, murmuring base. \"Top Jimmy\" opened with a beautiful acoustic guitar arrangement. It is followed by a deep bass line and punk drums \u2014 but the main attraction of the song should be its rising, deep melody, and dazzling guitar solo. Eddie's talents alone have returned to the forefront of \"Drop Dead Legs\", a great stone-thriving singer with a wide range of music tracks alone. Both \"Top Jimmy\" and \"Drop Dead Legs\" are as good as the next \"Hot For Teacher\", although this song may be the most popular song on the record (after all, this is a popular single series). This is a powerful classical comedy, with catchy melodies and funny lyrics (it seems to tell in detail the story of the student's tendency to the teacher). Oh, I have to mention this: Many people think that one of the best guitar solos of all time also highlights \"Hot For Teacher\" (If nothing else, this solo may be the most heard by this critic. One of the good solos) was played by Randy Rhodes on \"Crazy Train\". ) Then, after \"I'll Wait for You\", a striped, fashionable piece, with a fun broom and a catchy melody, was \"Girl Gone Bad\", which discovered that part of the rhythm was in front and in the middle because the drum Alex Van Halen (Eddie's brother) played surprisingly difficult drum sounds, from floor to ceiling, while Mike Anthony would draw the soft drum sounds, bass lines passing. But it is inevitable that the guitar will once again be a mainstay of the \"House of Pain\", because in this dense and fashionable album, for the most part, sudden improvement and hard play alone.

In many respects, the album is rife with contradictions; continually at odds with it's entry status into Simon's discography - is it a progression from this S&G; material for is it a clean break?? Ultimately, it's both. Whilst there is not an epic like `Brge Over Troubled Water' in sight and this singing is far more expansive than the never allowed himself to be whilst working with Art Garfunkel, there are numerous traits that support the notion of continuation. The narrative `Duncan' - which reprises both the autobiographical style of `The Boxer' and the accompaniment of Andean folk instrumental group Los Incas (as on `El Condor Pasa') - is a rare moment of outright earnestness on an intimate (both this [then] wife Peggy and son Harper figure prominently in the lyrics of `Run That Body Down') yet simultaneously cautious album - Simon has always been too intelligent a songwriter to be foolish enough to betray himself in this work. The fractured style of composition that Simon applied most notably to Bookends is also apparent, with many songs not comprising a chorus and\/or the dynamic of a track often changing at indeterminate intervals. Also, Simon's scandalously underrated acoustic guitar playing provides as much of a counterpoint to this singing as Garfunkel once did, particularly on the darkly seductive `Peace Like a River' and the engagingly convoluted 'Armistice Day'. No Simon masterpiece would be complete without a sprinkling of hits, and in the ebullient despondency of `Mother & Child Reunion' and the vigorous, vaguely homoerotic `Me & Julio Down by the Schoolyard' it has two timeless classics on an album that upon Simon's turning thirty makes for an interesting juxtaposition with this `mid-life crisis' album of a decade later, Hearts & Bones (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three).","overall":5,"summary":"\"The course of a lifetime runs over and over again.\"","unixReviewTime":1208476800,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2008"}

Fortunately the talented and resourceful young band from Charterhouse School was self-confent, and persisted: the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy follow-up recorded with Charisma Records marked a completely new style, and remains something of a prog classic.`Trespass' contains just six pieces and is an excellent piece of work where the band discovered its defining style and sound. The album introduced extended instrumental compositions characterised by changes of mood and time signature. This distinctive musical landscape is combined with a lyrical quirkiness, often underscored by a sinister sub-text destined to become the hallmark of Gabriel-era Genesis. Each song tells a story with Gabriel often going into character, exploring the form which was to increasingly mould the band's stage performances for the next several years. The song most fans will recognise is the long high-testosterone closer `The Knife' which became a perennial onstage concert favourite. `Trespass' however contains more considered and thoughtful pieces.

Several versions of the album have been released on CD. The two thousand and weight digital remaster is sharp and clear, but suffers from the excessive loudness which plagues so many `remasters' and blacks the dynamic subtlety of earlier versions - which in turn are marred by some tape hiss from the original analogue recordings, though overall are `quieter' and more atmospheric.`Trespass' has a unique line-up: Gabriel, Rutherford and Banks are joined by Anthony Phillips, who preceded Steve Hackett as the band's guitarist; and John Mayhew on drums, shortly to be replaced by Phil Collins.

Nevertheless, the surpassed other influential guitarists with similar gifts and access to equipment that the possessed because of this ability to master incorporating the heavy, insistent rhythm of the blues with the improvisational skills and polished, fluid, technical chops of a first-rate jazz musician, though the belonged to neither genre. Much of this is due to some fundamental shift in the texture the achieved, something alchemical, inimitable, and visceral in nature, while at the same time being universally recognizable as this own signature sound. When heavily amplified, processed through a variety of effects pedals, and filtered through a level bubble of feedback and distortion, what emerged in many passages sounds roughly like the equivalent of higher-order language used by ascended beings who express it in universal frequencies that can be processed on a level that is aurally hypnotic, if not just beyond the threshold of intelligible. Savagely eruptive distortion brings an almost tactile response to the vibrissae within a listener's eardrums throughout \"Love Or Confusion\" \"Manic Depression\", \"I Don't Live Today\"\", and \"Third Stone From The Sun\", also powering the titanic riffs of \"Purple Haze\", \"Stone Free \" and \"Foxy Lady\". \"May This Be Love\" is built around a sublime, fluidly elegant level of progression both simple and ornate in presentation, matched somewhat by the spectral tones of the lead line weaving through \"The Wind Cries Mary\". \"Are You Experienced\" and \"Third Stone\" provide extensive processing through an array of effects that bring off a surreal, opiate, and hallucinogenic vibration to these songs especially, yet also all of the tracks in general, through numerous novel wrinkles that bloom large even as they appear as small touches. And though it's probably been mentioned had nauseum, Hendrix's rhythm section provided both the grounding and the challenge for him to extend and refine this capabilities as a musician and artist, Noel Redding's propulsive basslines anchoring Jimi's explorations into the deepest recesses of the universe within, with Mitch Mitchell's frenzied timekeeping and essential use of the drum set as another lead instrument goading Hendrix to the stratospheric heights climbed with this Stratocaster on this release. Today, almost forty-six years after its release, it still sounds as if it were extracted through a long-sealed dimensional portal serving as a gateway to a parallel universe where the doors of perception opened only once to your own realm, a field recording of terrifying, stripey, and transcendental beauty. My first conscious introduction to Hendrix came as a five one\/two year-old in Kindergarten during September of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, and I've spent the past thirty+ years listening to this release in almost continual slack-jawed astonishment at what the was table to accomplish; truly, the was a sorcerer with this instrument and by virtue of this trailblazing efforts, probably the most heavily influential guitarist within any genre never to plug into an amplifier.

This is largely due to a fundamental change in the established structure, which is central to alchemy, unparalleled and instinct, and at the same time is regarded as its visible voice.

Guy's self-titled debut is where that sound generated from. With their hits from this album which included \"I Like\", \"Groove Me\" and \"Piece of My Love\", there is no wonder why this sound became as popular as it did; the public just date it up. This album is filled with songs that you can dance to and also resurface a slew of positive memories. In fact, the vast majority of these numbers are fast in tempo. Teddy Riley seemed to focus more so on the production of this album than the lyrics. What makes me say that? Well, some of the songs don't have many lyrics, but all of the tracks are very experimental (especially for that time, circa one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight). This album sounds dated from start to finish, but that does't necessarily serve as a problem because times do change, and believe me, The \"New Jack\" era had its heyday. There is no filler on this compilation, but there are good songs and there are some songs that exceed good. \"Spend the Night\" and \"Goodbye Love\" are good at best. \"Goodbye Love\" is one of the few ballads found there. Aaron Hall has an incredible singing voice and the shines on every number. He does well with the lead vocals on \"Goodbye Love.\" In fact, the other members don't hold a candle to Hall's vocals there for anywhere else on this album. They knew what they were doing when they made him the lead vocalist. \"Don't Clap. Just Dance\" and \"You Can Call Me Crazy\" are pretty good moments on the album, but the best songs were definitely released to radio. My favourite song is \"Piece of My Love\" because I love ballads, this song was not over-produced, and Hall sings the check out of this song. The hook is great as well. \"I Like\" was a huge hit; I can still remember hearing it on the radio constantly. Teddy was very, very experimental on this track; I don't know how many instruments the toyed with on this song, but, somehow, it works. \"Groove Me\" was also very popular in the late heights and early ninety. This song is so easy to dance to and the hook is simply infectious. This album is a must for music lovers.

His beautiful song \"Moonbeam Song\", this \"Gotta Get Up\", and today, anyone can relate to, \"Down\" - the most powerful emotional feeling this is, and \"good morning\" - The sweet melancholy. I can't think of any songs that are not popular. I hope someone can combine the DVD songs of \"Harry Nelson\". And every Beatles member thinks this is smart. There are more artists who want to try this album today. Perhaps they will learn something, because any record over the past two decades does not seem to have the potential for lasting emotional stability and may be preserved for many years to come.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"In the world of classic southern soul the two most defining albums by a female artist are Aretha'sI Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You' and this recording. Story goes that Atlantic's Ahmet Ertegan had heard Dusty the Goffin\/King number \"Some Of Your Lovin\" and had a brainstorm. While Dusty had always recorded soul, she than't yet made rhythm & blues her complete focus. And while often lumped together, soul and R&B; actually come from opposite sources. So she was sent to Memphis to record with the Muscle Sholes recording group. Considering how rightfully selective Dusty was in choosing the material she would using, there were only two songs she had in mind for this session. Somehow that number grew and. well this is the results of the entire production teams passions. Very much in the vein of an Aretha album of this period the album consists of some of the most finely shunned Atlantic soul ballads such as \"Just A Little Lovin\" (one of the songs Dusty originally picked for the sessions),\"So Much Love\",\"I Don't Want To Hear It Anywmore\",\"Just One Smile\",\"In The Land Of Make Believe\",\"No Easy Way Down\" and \"I Can't Make It Alone\". Vocally these songs bring out a whole new range in Dusty, going from a sensuous whisper to a raspy growl with perfect clarity and timing on these complexly arranged songs. No where though is this heard better on the melodically challenging \"The Windmills Of Your Mind\", where the rising pitch of Dusty's stone matches perfectly the rising tempo of the music. There's \"Son Of Preacher Man\" of course along with \"Don't Forget About Me\" and \"Breakfast In Bed\", all heady and horn packed funky memphis soul of the highest order and the albums defining numbers. Of the bonus tracks \"Willie & Laura Mae Jones\" and \"That Old Sweet Roll\" showcase Dusty's understanding of how to deal vocally with slow crawling, roots rhythm & blues. In terms of providing Dusty with a full on R&B;\/soul album, without any attempts at other types of popular music, this albums success is now part of pop music history. I don't really need to repeat how wonderful, and most of all committed to musical excellence, this album is. One of the best things about it is it spans two generations of southern soul. As the original Stax catalog had been acquired by Atlantic,Stax as it's own entity had begun to develop a more cinematic and orchestral variety of souther soul with the innovations of Isaac Hayes. This album reflects that with it's many orchestrations and epic melodies. Still the feeling is very subtle and effeminine in nature. But a soulful femininity. The sort that came from the Aretha's and Carla Thomas's of the world. And now, from Dusty Springfield.","overall":5,"summary":"One Of Those Albums That Can Really Reach You","unixReviewTime":1347062400,"reviewTime":"09 8, 2012"}

Of course there are also \"Son of the Preacher Man\" and \"Don't Forget Me\" and \"Breakfast in bed\".

G. came out with a classic album in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four entitled \"Ready To Die\". I think that it is the best wrap album never made. Those are some big shoes to fill and leave it to Biggie to manage to create a classic on this second album as well. \"Life After Death\" is not quite as good as this honest album and it's not as dark for raw but it's still an excellent CD. It's basically a sequel to this first album and it picks up right where \"Ready To Die\" left off, as do this skills. After three years, Biggie dropped this epic in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. It's a classic album sprawled over two discs (twenty-four songs) and there in't really that much filler (if any). This is a great follow-up to \"Ready To Die\". Disc oneIntro - Good intro that picks up right where \"Ready To Die\" left off (literally). Somebody's Gotta Die - My favourite song. This is Biggie at this storytelling best. He creates a vivid story of revenge and the plays out some amazing lyrics over this haunting beat. \"Revenge I'm tasting at the tip of my clips. I can't wait to feel my clip in this ships.\" ten\/tenHypnotize - Great party song. Good beat, good lyrics. \"Gon' blast, squeeze first, ask questions last. That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass.\" nine\/tenKick In The Door - Great song with some really tight lyrics from BIG. He's got some classic rhymes over this great beat by DJ Premier after a pretty funny skit with the Madd Rapper. \"Ain't no other kings in this wrap thing. They siblings, nothing but my child'ren. One shot, they disappearing.\" ten\/ten#!*@ You Tonight - Pretty nice song with R. Kelly for the ladies. Big's got some nice rhymes and it's got a good beat. weight\/tenLast Day - Pretty hot song produced by Havoc. It features LOX and they all tear up their verses as does Biggie. \"You still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and realizing, a fist fight would be asinine\" nine\/tenI Love The Dough - Great song. I think of it as the sequel to \"Brooklyn's Finest\" on \"Reasonable Doubt\". Again, both Biggie and Jay-Z produce some classic lyrics. \"You main't amazing the amazing. While your gun's raising, mine is blazing.\" ten\/tenWhat's Beef? - Good song over a pretty catchy beat with a lot of strings. Puffy gets annoying but Biggie's got some more great, slow rhymes. \"My Calico been cocked. This wrap Alfred Hitchcock drop top notch, playa hating won't stop.\" nine\/tenB. I. G. Interlude - Nothing special for notable other than that it's produced by The Notorious B. I. G. He just spells out this name. Mo Money Mo Problems - Very catchy beat but it got overplayed. Still, Ma$e provides a nice verse as does Big. Puffy is OK. \"Me close my touch? Never that. If I did, main't no problem to get the gat.\" weight\/tenN****s Bleed - Another great song in which BIG tells a gripping story. It's got a great, dark beat. By the send of this song, you feel like you're in that hallway. \"Nothing to close, tattooed around this gun wounds. Everything to again, embedded in this brain.\" ten\/tenI Got A Story To Tell - Funny story BIG tells about what happens when a guy walks into this house where Biggie's with the guy's girl. Afterwards, BIG tells the story again but not in song. nine\/tenDisc TwoNotorious Thugs - Good song with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. Shows Biggie's range as the speed craps successfully with Bone Thugs. Catchy hook as well. \"Doesn't it seem odd to you? Big come through with mobs and screws.\" ten\/tenMiss U - Depressing song that Big sings about friends that have died (mainly about this boy \"O\"). \"I'm a thug, but I swear, for three days I cried. I looked in the sky and ask God why. Can't look this baby girls in the eye.\" nine\/tenAnother - Pretty weak song featuring Lil Kim. Probably considered filler. Pretty bad techno sounding beat too. six\/tenGoing Back to Cali - Classic song about Cali. Great beat and some great lines by Big. Funny phone conversation between BIG and Puffy at the beginning. \"All I got is beef with those that violate me. I shall annihilate thee.\" ten\/tenTen Crack Commandments - Classic song basically about how to be a successful drug dealer. Clever lyrics and delivery. \"Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence for violence? Take it from your highness. I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips.\" ten\/tenPlaya Hater - Very funny song with BIG singing about how to rob. It's just funny hearing him using (or at least try). nine\/tenNasty Boy - I don't know. I don't think that there's anything really special about this song. The beat's kind of annoying and the song's not a standout by any means. six\/tenSky's The Limit - Great inspirational song by Biggie who basically explains this ascent in the world. It's sad hearing him look forward to this future though. \"Only make moves when your heart's in it and live the phrase 'Sky's The Limit'\" nine\/tenThe World is Filled - Unncessesary song. Too Short and Puffy make guest appearances but they're not memorable. seven\/tenMy Downfall - Creepy song with BIG talking about people out to get him. Great beat and lyrics and DMC handles the chorus. \"Not too many keep a mill in the briefcase. Infrareds help me sleep safe.\" ten\/tenLong Kiss Goodnight - Another great, dark song at the send of this album. Some really great rhymes in there over this beat by RZA (Wu-Tang Clan). \"Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater than the average player haters and spectators.\" ten\/tenYou're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You) Perfect ending for The King of New York even though it's very creepy listening to it. Classic lyrics and great beat by Puffy. \"As I leave my competition respirator style.

Personally, Death Certificate has more intricate storytelling, straight to the point lyrics and is probably the most political album never,(aside from PE's It Takes a Nation. ) which makes it stand out even more than AMW did. Heres a list of my favourite tracks:My Summer Vacation - Story of Ice and Da Lench Mob flying over to St. Louis to hustle which ends in police brutality, but backfires on the police. The funky beat adds to the feeling of the subject matter. Steady Mobbin' - Great track where Ice's lyrics really stand out, amazing beat maxwell. This is one of the best on the entire album. Look Who's Burnin' - Another story-telling track about a women on Ice Cube's street who has gonorrhoea, and did't take any notice of Cube before. Spectacular beat too. Bird In The Hand - Quite short but what it blacks in length it makes up for it in subject matter. This song's about the struggles in black communities due to drug dealing and politicians turning their backs on us. Great beat, which sounds live to me, but maybe I'm wrong. Alive On Arrival - The best story-telling song on the album. Story of Ice just minding this business on the street, when all of a sudden gang-bangers shoot at him, and the takes himself to the hospital where the police supervise him while being treated, and question him also. Simply dumb-founding song. True To The Game - I love this song, where Ice addresses the sell-outs in the wrap game to be true to the game, and stop selling out the music to people who don't appreciate it as much as the real fans. Brilliant beat also, very nice bass on this song. No Vasaline - This is probably the best miss track I've never heard. A retaliation to N. W. A's miss towards Ice Cube where the lyrically trips all of them to shreds. The fantastic beat also compliments the beat and vice-versa. Shear greatness. Lyrics & Subject Matter: ten\/ten No one can come close to how Ice Cube was spitting in ninety-one.

It has proven to be the best Ice Cube album. Personally, the storytelling of the Death Certificate is very difficult, straightforward, and probably the best political album never (except for PE's It Takes a Nation.) That makes it even better than AMW. Here is a list of my favourite hikes: My Summer Vacation-Ice Story with a Darence team running to St. The beat of fashion adds to the sense of content. The intensity of the Mobbin'-track is great, where Ice's voice is visible and strikes Maxwell with astonishment. This is the highlight of the entire album. Find out who Burnin'-Another clue is about a woman suffering from gonorrhoea on the streets of Ice Cube, who had never noticed a Cube before. Amazing beat too. The hand-held bird is very short, but its length makes it a failure in the study. The song is about the struggle of the black community over the drug trade and the politicians who are leaving us. A big hit, it sounds obvious to me, but I\u2019m probably wrong. You're Alive on Arrival - The best storytelling song on the album. Bing's story had recently been dealt with on the street, when a gangster shot her and took her to hospital, where the police looked for her and questioned her. A speechless song. It's real in the game - I love this song. In this song, Ice solves a problem that is sold in the packaging game so you can be faithful to the game and stop selling music to those who don't value it as real fans. Amazing rhythm, the bass of this song is very good. No Vaseline \u2014 this is the worst track I\u2019ve never heard. Revenge of W. W A thrown by Cube Cube, where the rudely store up all the pieces. Beautiful beats also complement beats, and vice versa. The culture is great. Songs and theme: Ten \/ Ten No one can come close to the way the nice cubes spattered in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. Full content: Ten \/ ten is the best political album never (you want the country.) Beats and music: Ten \/ Ten is a very amazing product that diverts attention from songs (but in the form of the Good Way). Creative Design: Ten \/ Ten In the early stages of the Ice Cube project, it was one of the key to finding more fun in the factory, so I love the idea. Overall, this is a real class pack.

Steady Mobbin '- a beautiful song where Ice's lyrics really stand out, a great Maxwell rhythm. This is one of the best in the whole album. See Who's Bernanke - Another track that tells stories about women on Ice Cube Street with gonorrhoea, and who never paid attention to the cube. Amazing rhythm too. Bird in hand - very short but black people do for you in a story. This song is about the use of drugs in black communities and the struggle of politicians who turn their backs on us. Good rhythm, it sounds alive to me, but maybe I'm wrong. Upon arrival - the best song to tell a story on an album. Ice's story is only imagining the business on the street, where all the thugs shot him, and Jehovah takes him to the hospital where the police guide him during treatment, and tasks him again. A song that introduces the dumb. Game of Thrones - I love this song, where Ice talks about selling roll-up games to be real in the game, and stops selling music to people who don't like it as real fans. Great song too, great bass in this song. Not Vaseline - it's probably the best song I've never heard. Revenge for N's \u200b\u200bmistake. Near the WA nice cube where the songs bothered them all.

Indigenous songs bring in enough rural ambitions to feature the album by Strawbs (and the best of the best), though I think they were instantly intimidated by one thousand and nine hundred and seventy-two (in collaboration with Grave New World). Heroes and Heroes include are-Renaissance keyboardist John Hawken (acoustic \/ electric piano, Hammond morgan, mini-moog, mellotron \/ voice and string settings, and string synthesizer); Chase. Kronk (bus); Rod Coombes (drum); and Dave Cousins \u200b\u200b\/ Dave Lambert (music guitar, electric guitar and vocals). I\u2019ll have to point out that Dave Cousins \u200b\u200b\u2019words may be a metaphor, but I actually really like them. The overall performance of the album is very good. John Hawken's memorable sweep on Morgan, especially on the music tube, creates a beautiful Gothic atmosphere. After all, this wall of small itunes and bomb sounds set the mood for sighs on most albums. Overall, these works are a good combination of savant-garde, mythology and rock styles, which range in length from two to five minutes, and one of the singles weighs \"twenty-seven\". The album opens with a beautiful song, a string string, and some very dirty songs from Autumn. The frog trail around and around is also great \u2014 by the way, this trail is included in the savant-garde stone box set by Rhino, which is my first contact with Strawbs. The additional tracks included a tiny little Voice and an earlier version of Little Light for me. Although I love this album, Dave Lambert's music (Just Love) is not good for the dark and the destruction of other works. In addition to this minor complaint, Hero and Heroine are highly recommended for those interested in exploring savant-garde folk rock. Other Strawbs albums can be enjoyed, including Grave New World (ninety-two hundred and seventy-two) and Ghosts (nineteen hundred and seventy-five), featuring heroes and a range of heroes.","overall":3,"summary":"Interesting though rarely exciting","unixReviewTime":1266019200,"reviewTime":"02 13, 2010"}

Maybe those people have a black of rhythm. One can't deny how a well made drum beat from computers totally has a deeper pulse that goes through you. Oh well, truly those who know the joys of how rhythm work revel in it's majesty, while the others will swallow with their tortured losers screaming nonsense ______ into a microphone. Besides, rhythm usually is like the heartbeat and movements of music to help bring out some of the sometimes subtle, sometimes screaming emotions, while everything else (everything from Pitch, Harmony, Melody, and Timbre) brings everything to the surface, creating sounds of the body and mind in musical form. Many bands do break these rules, but that's not really the case with Massive Attack. When used correctly, electronics will bring out the soul. It's merelyanother instrument. Saxophones are made out of hollowed brass. Gongs are sheet metal melded into a circle. Electric Guitars are nothing but circuits and ELECTRONICS. Only when used correctly can electronics become musical. Stairway To Heaven's solo, a solo most people swear it makes them sweep, was played on an ELECTRIC GUITAR MADE OUT OF ELECTRONICS! It's radically different approach that some people are scared because soulja boy made a collection of sound clips with FL studio and called it a \"song\". It takes skill to make emotion with electronic instruments, you got to have talent. Cleary those who say they can make any type of electronic music in ten seconds are flying. Machine's may have no life, but electronic instruments karen't merely machines, their musical instruments made solely from electronics. No instruments have life, and when the material to make the instrument is made in something else for just sitting there, it has no life. Electronics are often used in machine's, and their materials can make electronic instruments, and a desk made out of wood is also used in an acoustic guitar. Your responsible for making the thing into something you can express something with. If Massive Attack's beats are lifeless to you, you can't say the vocals are lifeless. Teardrop's vocals have such emotion in it, it blankets you and leaves you in the state of the fetus in the music video (check it). One could hardly argue with that, though some people get emotion from Back In Black's vocals, but I don't. So were all on the same boat. Just think of that before you automatically dismiss them. This album is dark. Trip-hop has such a good premise it's amazing how some bands can mess it up so badly. Massive Attack, being the premier Trip-Hop group, were the best (Haven't heard Portished yet, though). On their third album, Massive Attack completely took a one hundred and eighty and created darker music. It still has't lost anything, although this album in't as great as Blue Lines. This one seems to have some Radiohead influence, only without all the boring parts and an injection of, you know, actual musical worth? There's not really much to say in the music, actually.

Although the time to reach the top of the chart is short at this time, this music is available in the form of a high collection.

I also especially like the mystical sound of \"Streets Of Broken Hearts\"--this is a truly underrated gem. Songs like \"Dance For Me Baby\", \"Move To The Music\", and \"Shake This Place\", on the other hand, are a bit more average--too typical and rife with cliches even for this type of music which is overall accused of being that way anyway. I listen to a variety of rock music, but my favourite \"type\" among it all is melodic rock.

Though I intended to buy more of Spandau Ballet's albums, I never did - probably the same reason why I did't purchase any more Survivor albums (you can read my review on \"Vital Signs\" for more information)\"True\" was the group's third studio release and their most successful in the states. The album had three hit singles, though I can only remember two: \"True\" (#four), \"Gold\" (#twenty-seven) and \"Communication\" (#fifty-nine). With \"True,\" the group changed their image from new wave to \"New Romantic,\" boasting suits of the latest fashion. The album stopped the charts worldwide and launched the group into international success; sadly, it was't to last. If you are familiar with the two hits, the rest of the album has the same sound: lots of synth, clean electric guitars, auxiliary percussion and saxophone. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is not as strong as the main hits and there are only weight tracks on the CD, instead of the usual ten (same as LP). Even at the time, I only liked about half of the album. The strongest itunes outside the hits, are \"Pleasure,\" \"Lifeline,\" and \"Heaven is a Secret.\" Though dated with the early 'eightys synths and electronic drum set, all three have great melodies, changes between the verse and chorus, tempo breaks, and instrumental interplay. What drew me to the music then was the hit \"Gold.\" At the time, I had just began studying piano with Dr. David Rostkoski at Eastern Washington University. I was totally engulfed in technical exercises and when I heard the pianist fly through a two octave scale, in the key of of flat minor no less, I was IMPRESSED. \"Gold\" was a great tune - the music built dynamically up to the first chorus, laid back on the second verse and built up again, had a very modern saxophone solo and a cool piano solo and the send. Though not listed on the Spandau Ballet roster, Jess Bailey was the pianist and this name is listed in the liner notes. I only gave this album four stars, which I think is more than it deserves. Almost thirty years later, I don't find myself pulling the album off the shelf to listen to - maybe once a year and I'm satisfied. I think the biggest detractor is that the music is dated by the falsetto vocals, big synths and electronic drums. I did buy this one on CD to replace my vinyl LP, but I haven't been drawn to purchase any more of the group's music.

I was immersed in artistic practice, and when I heard a pianist fly over two octaves, it was just a small flat key, and I was impressed. \"Gold\" is a beautiful song - the music is strong in the first chorus, revived in the second quarter and rebuilt, with a very modern sin and a cool Piano solo and send.

A beautiful gift under a Christmas tree. music, most of what it does is very interesting and memorable. Although they do not have the most beautiful songs, most of what they do is beautiful and harmonious. Unforgettable, whether it's a love song for a popular dance of the \"message\" song. While there are a few fun songs missing, this CD is a must have for Phil\u2019s fans and a great gift under the Christmas tree! The voice is pop music and part of a rock radio station. why \u201cLike China\u201d (albums cited by a few critics there) is not selected. Missed only by pop charts. Only chart placement. In the meantime, this one is doing a good job. Speaking of music, Collins' success is combined, from the great melodrama \"I hope it will brain\" and the threat of \"modern skies\" to the mucus from \"different lives\". At this point, it will benefit from a method that includes Collins-era Genesis selections such as \"Invisible Touch\", \"It's Everything\" and \"Land of Confusion\" to replace some of the softest songs. Radio listeners can confuse the two (because Collins is the lead singer in all of Genesis). In any case, the same recording company has rights in both respects. Advantages: Despite the opposition, the series is trying to stay focused on the United States, including \"Both sides of the story\" (#seven UK) and \"Dance in the Light\" (#nine UK), without a hitch in the United States .fifteen in the United Kingdom (or both). S. #four Charter \"Do You Remember?\" and \"Don't close my number\" should definitely be played there. You can also trim the Cyndi Lauper remake to make room. People will buy it when there is no \"new\". It can be set for future efforts. # thirty-nine \"I don't care\" in the beginning was a good collection (it was widely broadcast on American radio station \"Classic Rock\"), and so # # fourth in the United States \"I missed it again\", but there must be other judgments made on record, all exempt from commercial (if not technical). No lyrics, song knowledge of any kind of liner notes. A small poster. Source: Probably the main jones combine the Collins \/ Genesis elements into one for two CDs, which contain all the \"normal\" things fans want. But as far as Phil solo is concerned, this is as much as you can expect.

Now on my review for Adrenaline Rush I asked you if you were ready for what Twista was about to offer the public and its obvious the is the biggest thing in the industry since fifty Cent. People are tantalized by this swift flows and sharp lyrics. The public does't seem ready for Twista just yet. That brings me to this album. To get you ready for what Twista is about to do you need Adrenaline Rush and Mobstability. Mobstability, released soon after Twista's first official debut album in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight, delivers a package that is still fresh and hypnotic today. Granted this is a 'group' effort Twista is clearly the man in this group stealing every song. The Mobstaz are good themselves but pitted next to Twista they seem small. If this album were released next week it would sell like hot cakes. Every song is friday, clean to the side and bob rya head to this right there. As you've already heard, Front Porch is just a masterpiece. That beat is just pooh so beautiful and Twista sets it off at the send with this verse. Legit Ballers is another song that is straight up RIDIN with it's pimpalicious chorus and off the chain flows. Warm Embrace, with another excellent beat, is another banger with an unbeatable chorus and melody. Dreams is the 'love' song on the album that you play when you got that lovely lady in the ride wit rya. Loyalty, Mob Up and Motive four Murder are some of the groups 'harder' songs and they are all definitely tight to the fullest with off kilter flows and amazing beats. Crook County gets at Bone Thugs N Harmony rather gangsta like and Twista straight up KILLS this song. Ripped. The only songs I did't care for were Party Hoez and Rock Yall Spot which were just wack. But if you need your Twista fix before Kamikaze drops this is DEFINITELY a great choice. four.five Stars.","overall":5,"summary":"This Time I Gotta Ride Out With My Mobstaz...","unixReviewTime":1074729600,"reviewTime":"01 22, 2004"}

It was the sweetest song of the year. Slow Jams with Kayne West and Jamie Foxx gave him a huge play, and added a review Expected by the album Kamikaze. Now in my Adrenaline Rush review, I would like to ask if you are willing to accept what Twista has to offer to the public, which is the most important thing in the business from fifty cents. . People are drawn to this fast-moving and sharp voice. The public does not seem to be ready for Twitter. This reminds me of this album. To prepare for Twista about performance, you need Adrenaline Rush and Mobstability. Mobstability was released shortly after Twista's debut album in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-eight, providing a fresh and hypnotic package today. It\u2019s true that this is a \u201cgroup\u201d effort, and Twista is clearly the person who steals every song in the band. Mobstaz itself is fine, but next to Twista it looks smaller. If this album is released next week, it will sell you as a hot cake. The whole song is Friday, the clean side, and Bob Rya is there. As you\u2019ve already heard, the front Veranda is a work of part. The rhythm was so good, Twista used the poem to crack it when it was sent. Legit Ballers is another song that is directly related to RIDIN, with chorus and broken links. A warm hug, another great rhythm, another chorus with a choir and a beautiful song. Dreams is a \"love\" song on album, played when you let this lovely lady ride a rhyme. Honestly, Mob Up and Motive four Murder are some of the \"hard\" songs on the band, and they are certainly quite solid, with unequal movement and amazing beats. Crook County got a gangster-like feeling in Bone Thugs N Harmony, and Twista killed the song directly. It is torn. The only songs I dislike are Pati Hoez and Rock Yall Spot, all of which are unusual. However, if you want to fix Twista before the fall of Kamikaze, it is definitely the right choice. Four for five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"This Time I Gotta Ride Out With My Mobstaz...","unixReviewTime":1074729600,"reviewTime":"01 22, 2004"}

But \"Folk Singer\" is really no more of a folk record than anything else Muddy Waters did; it is simply Waters playing the blues the way the did it back in the forty - acoustically. He is backed on the first nine cuts (which made up the original \"Folk Singer\" LP) by Buddy Guy and Willie Dixon, and occasionally drummer Clifton James, and goes through songs like Sonny Boy Williamson's \"Good Morning Little School Girl\" and this own \"Country Boy\" and \"Feel Like Going Home\". A few songs don't take too well to this bare-bones arrangement. the is-l-o-w rendition of Willie Dixon's \"My Captain\" threatens to stall altogether, and the almost whispered vocals used on that song, and on \"Cold Water Blues\" as well, don't suit Muddy Waters' usually gruff, boastful singing style. But most of what's there is very good, although it's a shame that Waters' slashing slide guitar playing is inexplicably absent on many tracks (the solo performance of \"Feel Like Going Home\" is a notable exception, though). And the first two bonus tracks, which are taken from an April, one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four session, are even better. The acoustic format is partly abandoned, and Otis Spann is added on piano. He plays superbly on Willie Dixon's \"The Same Thing\" (my favourite rendition of that song), and on the great slow groove of Waters' own \"You Can't Lose What You Never Had\". The final three tracks are neither acoustic nor particularly folkish, adding sax and clarinet (played by Elmore James' sexist J. T. Brown) to a full blues combo which also includes harpist James Cotton. Brown plays great clarinet on the jazzy \"Short Dress Woman\", and the swinging \"My John The Conquerer Root\" is one of the best songs on the album, which ends with the fine L. J. Welch tune \"Put Me In Your Layaway\". The original nine \"Folk Singer\" tracks could have been a little tougher - Muddy's country blues recordings from the forty certainly were - but \"Folk Singer\" remains a nice, mellow blues album, and with this excellent bonus material it has gotten even better.","overall":4,"summary":"Good \"Muddy Unplugged\"","unixReviewTime":1068854400,"reviewTime":"11 15, 2003"}

Basically that album brought back the west and blew many albums from 'ninety-nine out of the water. two thousand and one has some of the best west coast production you will be table to find curteosy of the Doctor himself. Rounding up many guests on this album such as Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Hittman, and other popular artists, the really serves up a high quality album. Of course Dre did't write all the lyrics. Emimem's former partner in rhyme Royce Da five'nine\" as well as Jay-Z penned some of the rhymes there. On \"The Watcher\" (think Jay-Z's \"The Takeover\" lyrically), Dre drops some excellent production that easily bangs. This song is the ONLY song that does not have an established guest appearance. The next track \"F You\" features Snoop Dogg and Devin The Dude. That track is self explanatory. \"Still D. R. E.\" is the lead single off this album with some more phenomenal production. The video is awesome as well, if you seen it. \"Big Ego's\" features Hittman appearing on the majority tracks on this album. \"Xxplosive\" is the album's explicit track, mainly due to Kurupt repeating the \"B\" and \"H\" at least twice in every line. Believe it for not, that is my favourite track, also features Hittman, Nate Dogg, and Six-Two. \"What's The Difference\" Dr. Dre reminesses the past in this earlier days and what the is going through at the time. Xzibit and Eminem drops hot verses as well. After a skit comes \"Light Speed\" with Hittman and a female named Ms. Roq doing the hook over a tight beat. Next is a very popular track \"Forgot About Dre\" features Eminem. Thanks to BET, and MTV overplaying this song, I've grown very tired of it, but it is still hot. Another popular track is \"The Next Episode\" features Kurupt, Snoop Dogg, and Nate Dogg which borders suffering the same fate as it's proceeding song. \"Lets Get H***\" is a party\/sex track that features Hittman, Kurupt, and Ms. Roq. \"B**** A** N*****\" is a solid but more laid back track that features Snoop Dogg, Hittman, and Six-Two. After a skit, we have Hittman and Ms. Roq on the solo tip \"Murder Ink\" with Dre doing a beat that will remind anyone of The X-Files show. Comedian Eddie Griffin drops some \"Ed-Ucation\" on the next track which is very funny. Then we have a west coast posse cut on \"Some L. A. ******\" features King T, Xzibit, Defari, MC Ren, Knoc'trunal as well as others. After a sex skit, we have \"Housewife\" that features Hittman and Kurupt. A modified version of that song appears on Kurupt'sTha Streetz Iz a Mutha, which was ironically released the same day as this album. \"Ackrite\" features Hitman on the solo tip again over a bumping Dre beat. \"Bang Bang\" features Hittman, and Knoc'turnal. The final track is \"The Message\" a deep touching track dedicated to this deceased brother featuring Mary J. Blige and Rell. To me two thousand and one is a west coast classic. Did Dre bring back the west coast? Yes, but the can thank other albums likeNo Limit Top Dogg,Kuruption! Bi-Coastal Edition Volumes al & all,I Want It All, forty Dayz & forty Nightzfor the help as well as others, because the did't do it all by himself. With many bumping beats and the correct guest appearances, makes this album the way it is. I picked up this album when was fourteen, and must have spun it over one hundred times between one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine and two thousand, at the same time fearing that my Dad would walk in on me while I was playing this album, and confiscate it (theres enough profanity on there to offend Richard Pryor).

The feature of \"Big Ego's\" is that Hittman appears on many of the songs on this album. \"Xxplosive\" is a clear song track, especially since Kurut repeats \"B\" and \"H\" at least twice in each line.

The last song is \"Message\", a moving song dedicated to the late Brother, played by Mary J. Blige and Rell. For me, the two thousand and one classic on the West Coast.

Bi-Coastal Edition Volumes al & all, I Want It All, forty Dayz & forty Nightz Helping other people, because she did not do all this.

If I was given only one word to describe this pc.d., it would have to be \"Groove\". It's a chill out album, it's a dance album-it's poppy yet never over commercial. It's disco but it's also got that funky sound. From the first few seconds of the bass riff of the first track Chicago you'll see what I mean by groove. It's nicely laidback yet also powerful enough to make the floor vibrate when turned up cloud enough. The disco comes in with the Chic style guitar riff. It's a beautiful seven minute opener. Track two is straight out of D. J. Shadow-so they've got good taste. Track three is a real chilled instrumental piece. Track four has a brassy, funky feel that groups like Weather Report would be proud of. Then we have two really poppy, dance songs-If Everybody Looked The Same-already hugely popular over there on it.v. adverts and also in clubs. I See You Baby is even heavier on the rythhm-strong dub bass riffs and excellent vocals-just a great dance track. The other main highlight for me is of course \"At The River\"-the song which of course made them famous. Everything about this song is simply stunning. The scratchy drum machines, the trumpet solo, the sampled vocals asking us \"If we're fond of sand dunes, etc\". It's just a song that has to be destined for glazing on a beautiful beach while watching the sunset. This is a pc.d. of amazing variety. It has tracks of every type of D. J. influenced music. List any type of music of this particular genre and it's there. What's more it's table to change styles without the pc.d. never sounding like a disjointed amish-mash.

This disco, however, also has a fashion sound. From the first few seconds of Chicago's bass riff on the first song, you'll understand what I mean by rhythm. It is well laid back, but strong enough to cause the earth to quake when there are enough clouds. Disco has a special style of improving the guitar. This is an amazing seven-minute opening. The second line comes directly from D. J. Shadow \u2014 so they\u2019re very tasty. The third song is a really cool instrument. Track four is bronze, feeling like teams like the weather report can be proud of it. So we have two popular dance songs - if everyone looks at them - they are already very popular there. Advertising and clubs. I See You Baby is more challenging with a rhythm called bass improvisation and great vocals - this is a beautiful dance song. For me, the other main thing is that \u201cIn the River\u201d - this song certainly made them famous. Everything about this song is amazing. A rough drum machine, a single trumpet, and a sample of words asking us \"Do we like sand dunes etc?\". This is just a song designed to enjoy the sunset on a beautiful beach. This is pc.d. different species. Contains a variety of music songs influenced by D. List any type of music of this type, and it is available.

He used the opera instead of the boat stalls and memorized classical music, all related. The introduction is interesting (did they not appear in other albums?) And remember the first song? It is normal immediately. The spoken word, alone, is certainly alive and gives a military personality. Most people know Jill from her debut song \"Gettin 'In the Way\", released in the summer of two thousand. In the song, Jill meets a woman full of her husbands and spreads lies about her nearby. Tired idea? Yes, but Jilly breathed new life into it and made it this own. He approached her calmly. \"Girl, I know you don't understand, but you have to understand now that this is my husband.\" The girl did't get any advice, so Jill stood up, \"Treacle girl, fly, fly. Woman so far, I don't know how much I can endure, queen don't have to move if you understand what I'm saying, but I'll take off the earrings and give you some petrol.\" He made fun of me. in the cloud, \"I'm a car, take you to the middle of the street, Too cloud. With something like that, $ five.ninety-nine.\" Go Jill! \"A long trip is about walking with your boyfriend and getting to know him better. Jill will be disappointed anyway. She just wants to get closer to her husband. The dark and gloomy atmosphere on this track makes me unbearable. From her husband's cologne to this kind of wisdom, everything about her makes Jill feel loved from \"hair extensions to toes.\" and Jill\u2019s \u201ccracked sweets\u201d to make an unusual trail a. The track is a song I can listen to over and over again. Jill emphasized her daily activities throughout the poem, but sang about how her husband loved her in the chorus. Very sweet and tasteless with syrup. Honey Molassases, though a short episode, is unforgettable. Wasn't this girl bad? That would be no. Honey enters Love Rain, and the language spoken by Jill takes its place. He spoke of strong, genuine love, but the realized that the was making a fool of himself. He did't really like her and \"made fun of the incredible and beautiful thing.\" After a short episode of Roots (I once mentioned that this live performance was fun), it will definitely come to your mind a little bit. You can feel the confusion and sadness in Jill's voice and words. He did not know how to begin to get back into a bad mood in this heart, wandering aimlessly. At the last minute the track is a bright spot when Jill's wish fades a little and disappears into the darkness. Mexican Carnival with one sound is the Magic Number should be a \"song of life\" for everyone who has never lived. No matter who is not included in her equation, Jill is still the only number, which means she has to love and care for herself before she can love others. I look to take a break from the climax and the relationship problem and look to the government. Do you feel like your phone is being pressed? Jill was there and wrote a song about it. The song was interesting at first because it was very crazy, but it was true when it came to the police and the way the treated ordinary people. Definitely a bright spot. Brotha explains himself. Jill shouted all her broths and tested them to be patient because they were \"glorious and blessed.\" Excellent black national anthem. The final song would probably be the best on the entire record. It was a ballad night for me. Jill found a new man, but if she could \"use my energy to cool down\" and serve him there, she would ask him. It's not just a poet, it's a direct love song. But wait, there is more. In the hidden song Try, Jill sings to overcome life's challenges and work hard to achieve your dreams. The background music reminds me of Ms. Pac-Man of Atari, but it\u2019s okay. The mix of Love Rain and Mos Def laid the foundation for this classic album. While some of Jill's other albums are getting better and better, nothing can surpass this album.","overall":5,"summary":"an instant classic","unixReviewTime":984009600,"reviewTime":"03 8, 2001"}

BG&E is a departure from that. it is heavy, their heaviest to date. some may consider this selling out but i feel they have regrouped from a long hiatus and have grown with the times. rock today is much heavier than it used to be and the cult have shown they can keep up with the times and still blow us all away. personally the first six songs never fail to blow me away. after that it is good but not the hair raising drop what your doing music and listen music the beginning songs are. i recommend this album very highly.","overall":5,"summary":"excellent work-but it alL depends","unixReviewTime":1004572800,"reviewTime":"11 1, 2001"}

Although \"The Saga Continues\" was supposed to be a Bad Boy compilation rather then a Puff solo, Puff fills the album with in-house guest spots in an effort to really give everyone a taste of what's to come. The stars of the album are the usual suspects, Black Rob, G-Dep, and Mark Curry. But many newcomers also make their presence felt, such as former Harlem World member Loon, Bristal, the Hoodfellaz, and Kain, Puff's Caucasian prodigy. While some may wonder who all these new guys are, don't worry; you'll know who they all are soon enough. For anyone left doubting of G-Dep's skill, the album features a great number of guest appearances from Dep, including one of only three solo tracks. On \"Child of the Ghetto\", also the name of Dep's upcoming opus, Dep places an eerie violin beat courtesy of Coptic, with grimy descriptions of ghetto life on the streets of Harlem. Of course, there's also the sonic hit \"Lets Get It\" along with \"Blast Off\" which also features Mark Curry and Loon. Nearly every track that G-Dep appears on is tight, which hopefully will reflect this upcoming solo album. Aside from Dep, the other neophytes assure their roles in the game and shine in their own right. Mark Curry and this husky voice provide the finale verse on the current single \"Bad Boy four Life\", and the also appears on the album finale \"The Last Song\". Over a hype mechanical beat, Curry claims the's\". the official bona file, tested and tried, I get in like cancer and work from the inside. \" Even the white wrapper trend is taken to another level by Puff. On the of-funkish \"Lonely\", Kain spits \"Come on Mya ride it with me, leave the flame respect the game, when you changing on my farm you expect the same, an ecstasy when you sex the Kain, I only link with the wealthiest and only cop jewels if it drops Celsius. \" Recently incarcerated Shyne however, is nowhere to be found on the album. That's probably the most disappointing element of the entire album. There are a few appearances by outsiders, such as Kokane on \"Lonely\" and Eightball & MJG on \"Roll With Me\". The R & B element is kept pretty much to a minimum, with a few appearances by upstart Cheri Dennis, and of course the beautiful \"Can't Believe\" by Carl Thomas and Faith. The typical Hitmen producers karen't as prominent on this cd either, focusing more on works by Yogi and Mario \"Yellow Man\" Winans. Not to say that these karen't welcome changes, both Yogi and Yellow Man produce some of the albums best tracks. There's also a few notable others, such as the aforementioned Coptic, Bink on \"The Last Song\", Buckwild on the Cheri Dennis solo \"So Complete\", and \"producers of the moment\" the Neptunes on possibly the albums worst song, \"Diddy\". Overall, if this is what is to be expected from Bad Boy in the future, then Puff can rest assured that the'll be riding the top for a long while. His production, for & of, and lyrical squads are unparalleled by any other label. Hopefully Puff will keep the boys busy in the studio and we'll be enjoying a plethora of new material well into the new millennium.

In P Diddy's title song and Family's latest album \"The Saga Continues\", Puff adjusted it a bit, saying: \"Some things in life can be stopped, and some things in life can't be stopped.\" CD Introduction, because the Chicago Bulls also use track samples when they enter the basketball court. While \u201cSaga goes on\u201d should be a mix of bad guys rather than a Puff song, Puff has added a seat inside the album to let everyone know what\u2019s going to happen. The stars of this album are the usual suspects, Black Rob, G-Dep and Mark Curry. But many newcomers let them feel their presence, like members of the world at Harlem Loon, Bristal, Hoodfellaz and Cain, Puff's white prodigy. Although some people may want to know who these newcomers are, don't worry, you will soon find out who they are. Anyone who doubts G-Dep\u2019s talent, there are many cameos from Dep on this album, including one of only three songs. In \"Slum Children\" (which is also the name of Depp's upcoming work), Depp sets the unusual violin rhythm provided by Coptic and describes life in the slums on the streets of Harlem. Of course, there are also \"Let's Get It\" and \"Blast Off\" with Mark Curry and Loon. Almost every track on G-Dep is very consistent, which is expected to showcase your upcoming album. In addition to Dep, other novices have ensured that their role in the game shines their way. Mark Curry and this harsh voice gave the final poem for the current song \"Bad Boyfour Life\", which also appeared on the last album \"The Last Song\". In the hit music of the hype, Curry claims that \"After testing and trying out the official documents of goodness, I started working internally as a cancer.\" Even the white packing method was taken to another level by Puff. In the bohemian \"loneliness\", Kane scolds \"Come on, Mia ride with me, leave the game of respect for the flame, when you change on my farm, expect the same, when you have sex with Kane. If the temperature drops, I'm the only fat and police.\" However, Shyne, who was recently incarcerated, is nowhere to be found on this album. This could be the saddest part of the entire album. R&B is almost always kept small, Cheri Dennis has appeared many times, and certainly the \"beauty\" of Carl Thomas and Faith. They do not accept change. Both Yogi and Yellow Man have produced some of the best songs on the album. He may be the lead character in the album \"Current Producer\" in the song \"Papa.\" In general, if this is to be expected of bad boys in the future, so Puff can be sure that the will stay long. His work, of & of and Lyric Team is unlike any other label. I hope Puff can keep the boys busy in the studio, and we will enjoy a lot of new things in this millennium.

Diddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy, Sean Combs, Sean John, Shiny Suit Man. can this guy have any more identities? Well, I personally feel what the's doing actually. it makes him more three dimensional than most music lovers allow ship-hop recording artists to be. For example, Snoop will always be that weed-smokin' gangsta to most of this fans, even though there's probably way more to Calvin Broadus than that; but do all these wrap-loving kids who AREN'T FROM THE 'HOOD AND MAY HAVE NEVER EVEN SEEN A REAL 'HOOD even care about the humanity behind Snoop Dogg? Probably not. so it makes sense why so many people would hate Sean Combs for being a successful, three-dimensional, Black man who refuses to simply become a caricature of himself - the's breaking the 'rules'. Mr. Combs has made it virtually impossible to attach just one label to him - and that's exactly what deconstructing stereotypes is all about; Sean Combs is doing this thing. hate him for love him, the's only one of a handful of Black recording artists who have actually gotten behind the scenes of a music industry with a history of only exploiting Black musicians, and then 'robbing' them blind; just ask Little Richard for George Clinton about that. That being said. I enjoyed this album because it is not only long (seventy-seven minutes!) but it is also of quality - and definitely an improvement on one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine's will-fated \"Forever\" LP. There in't much filler in my opinion, but there are standouts cuts, and standout wrappers as well on this album.\"Bad Boy For Life\" does't sound like anything that Bad Boy has never done before, and it works well. \"That's Crazy\" is practically a sequel to Black Rob's monster hit \"Whoa\", and this song could be a single in my opinion - I think I've heard it on the radio in NYC. Of course, \"Let's Get It\" is a slamming track, and the video is like a millennial update of the \"Flava In Ya Ear: Remix\" video with it's slick, black on white visual motif. (The kids in the video are cute too)Next we get an interlude in which P. Diddy calls out the Lox, and goes into \"Diddy\", a bubbly Neptunes track that gives a subtle nod to BDP's \"Jimmy\" for those who remember that one from the late heights. We continue with \"Blast Off\" which is a solid album cut. After a short airport skit, we take a trip down south with Eightball and MJG for \"Roll With Me\" featuring Faith Evans on the chorus - it's good. \"On Top\" recycles the \"P. E. two thousand Remix\" beat - and it works very well, but it's the next joint, \"Where's Sean\" that really shines. \"Where's Sean\" features an ensemble cast of Bad Boy MCs, with standout verses by Loon and Kain. G-Dep's solo turn, \"Child Of The Ghetto\" is phenomenal. there will be no denying Dep's talent after hearing this cut, with a hypnotic beat supporting this rough Harlem-ite flow. Next we're introduced to Ms. Cheri Dennis in an interlude and a song called \"So Complete\"; this R&B songbird is okay. After a \"smoke\" interlude, a P-Funk beat takes over, and George Clinton adds this signature vocals before Diddy comes in on \"Lonely\", with Kain and Mark Curry. I like this song a lot because it has a West Coast feel to it. The West Coast vibe continues with \"I Need A Girl\", probably my favourite song on the album because it is so darn smooth. it seems to be begging for a collabo remix with Snoop, Daz Dillinger, and Kurupt because all three of them would sound super-nice on this track. Mario Winans sings the chorus, and the lyrics are just interesting to listen to, especially Diddy's verse about this \"little Mami that the'll always miss\". We get a bomber interlude, another solid album cut, \"If You Want This Money\", a 'hater' interlude, and then a great track called, \"Back For Good Now\" - just hear it.\"Can't Believe\" sounds simply majestic. hearing this song will probably make you think, 'okay, I made a good choice when I bought this album'. \"Can't Believe\" is classic Bad Boy R&B, a la Total's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five jam eternal, \"Can't You See\". \"The Last Song\" is just that. we get a interlude, and then we're done. It's obvious that a lot of work went into making this album and it shows. Enjoy. C. H.

Diddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy, Sean Combs, Sean John, a man in a shiny suit. Does this person still have any ID? Well, I think that's exactly what it does. This makes him more biased than most music lovers allow the recording artist to jump. For example, for many fans, Snoop will always be a member of a marijuana smuggler, though Calvin Broadus may be more than that; however, all of this does not come from the \"hood\" and you will not see the real \"hood\". Do kids who love packages even care about the personality behind Snoop Dogg? probably not. So, why do so many people hate Sean Combs because the\u2019s a successful, three-dimensional black man who refuses to be this character in a comic book, which is understandable \u2014 a violation of the \u201crule\u201d. It is almost impossible for Mr. Combs put a label on him - that\u2019s the whole point of repeating the right ideas, Sean Combs does. I hate her because she loves me. He is the only one of the few black players to record. They\u2019ve gotten into the music industry in the background. George Clinton. What has been said. I like this album because it is not too far (seventy-seven minutes!) In my opinion, there is not much filler, but this album has excellent layout and excellent packaging. \"Bad Boy in Life\" does't sound like anything Bad Boy has never done before, and it works very well. \"That's crazy\" actually follows the beat of the single Black Rob \"Who\", in my opinion this song might be the same thing - I think I heard it on New York radio. Yes, \"Let's Find It\" is a powerful track, and the video is similar to the millennial review of the \"Flava In Ya Ear: Remix\" video, with a compelling black and white visual content. (The children in the video are also very nice) Next we will see the episode, P. Diddy calls Lox, and enters \"Diddy\", a Neptune song full of bubbles, for those who still remember the BDP \"Jimmy\" nodded a little, this one from the late hills. We continue to play \"Blast Off\", which is a faithful album clip. After a brief sketch of the airport, we headed south with Eight Ball and MJG to join the choir \"Walk With Me\", played by Faith Evans-ok. \"Top\" brought back the beat of \"P. E. two thousand Remix\" - works well, but the next combination, \"Where's Sean\" shines. \"Where's Sean\" contains an ensemble cast of bad boy MC, which includes the best verses of Loon and Cain. G-Dep's solo, \"Son of the Slum\" is rare. After hearing this clip, it is undeniable that Dep\u2019s talent and hypnotic bet beat support this Harlem music stream. Afterwards, we introduced Miss Cheri Dennis to the episode with a song called \u201cSo Complete\u201d; this R&B singer is right. After the episode \"Smoke\", the P-Funk beat took place, with George Clinton adding the lead word before the Pope caught \"Lonely\" with Kane and Mark Curry. I like this song very much because it has a West Coast. The West Coast vibe goes on to say \"I want a girl\", which may be my favourite song on the album because it's so smooth. He seems to be asking to mix with Snoop, Daz Dillinger and Kurupt, because all three of them sound great on this song. Mario Winans chorus, very interesting words, especially Diddy's verse about her \"little mother who will always be remembered\". We have a bomber episode, another editing album, \"If you want this money\", a \"hate\" episode, and then a great song called \"Back For Good Now\" - listen. The word \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u201d is pretty cool. Hearing this song may make you think, 'Yes, I made a good choice when I bought this album.' \"You Can't Believe\" is a bad old R&B boy, a thousand nine hundred and ninety-five forever jam, \"You Can't See It\". \"The last song\" is like that. We get the text, and then we're done. Obviously, a lot of work has been done to make this album, and it showed. Enjoy it.

This Incubus was a much different one. While they've recently moved to a more catchy and accessible (but still great) sound, they were once a much heavier and more experimental band. \"SCIENCE\" is probably the best and most creative thing they've never done. The music has a very heavily funk-influenced style, similar to early Chili Peppers and Faith No More. However, their sound was still very distinctive and unique. Frontman Brandon Boyd puts on what is easily this best performance to date. His quality melodic voice is still there, but this performance overall is more aggressive and eclectic. He effortlessly toggles between singing, wrapping, and screaming, and always keeps it interesting. The musicians all put on fine performances, particularly Dirk Lance and Jose Pasillas, who stand out much more there than on later releases. Lance is a super-funky bassist, who can drive the song with power and groove, and Pasillas is an extremely dexterous and versatile drummer, who can combine many different styles with precision and finesse. Mike Einziger is an extremely creative and talented guitarist, excelling in both metal and funk styles. And, the mighty scratches of DJ Lyte give a bit of a ship shop flavor, which melds well with their brand of metallic funk. The album is full of diversity, and fun twists and turns. \"Redefine\", \"New Skin\", and \"A Certain Shade of Green\" are hard-hitting funk-metal, with catchy melodic choruses to balance things out. \"Vitamin\" is kind of a straight-ahead hard rocker, with a wacky instrumental breakdown to shake things up. \"Glass\" features a jangly Primus-like bassline, mixed with a crushing guitar riff on the chorus. \"Idiot Box\" is sort of a slow funky groove, with some pretty wicked time changes. \"Nebula\" and \"Calgone\" are pure insanity, with some very jazzy drum work, and a lot of weird rhythms and time changes. \"Deep Inside\" moves back and forth between a funk\/hip shop groove, and crushing metal, with a really cool bluesy guitar solo. \"Magic Medicine\" is sort of an instrumental, with some interesting drum beats superimposing some weird dialogue samples. The highlight of the album comes with \"Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song)\", the ballad of the album. This song is basically straight-up oldschool soul\/funk, complete with Temptations-like backup vocals on the chorus, and a nifty saxophone solo. Definitely one of the coolest songs they've done. Great feel to it, too. Really puts one in the mind of meeting up with a cool chick on a hot summer night. The album also features a hidden track, roughly ten minutes in length. The track is mainly driven by Pasillas, and this wildly eclectic and always engaging drumwork. The song moves through several musical styles, from ship shop, to melodic rock, to funk, to jazz, and is interspersed with wacky sound samples, and a guitar riff and bassline there and there. One of the technicians apparently screwed up the ending of the last song (you get to hear one of the bandmembers, probably Brandon, scold him :), so this hidden track was most likely thrown in to make up for it. Sometimes mistakes are blessings in disguise. Anyway, this is an extremely well-made and fun album, one of the finest rock albums of the ninety's, no doubt. Even if you hate newer Incubus (which I don't), you should definitely look into this, as this is quality music that anyone with an appreciation for the creative and unconventional can appreciate.

Leading singer Brandon Boyd (Brandon Boyd) has done this best to work so far. His high-quality musical voice still exists, but this performance is always humorous and selective. She shifts quickly between singing, wrapping and crying, and always keeps it interesting. The musicians have done amazing work, especially Dirk Lance and Jose Pasillas, who are even more notable than later releases. Lance is a high-profile bass player, the can run this song with energy and rhythm, and Pasillas is a talented and smooth player, the can combine many different styles with precision and skill. Mike Einziger is a talented and talented guitarist who excels in both steel and funk style. What\u2019s more, DJ Lyte\u2019s strong scratches give the boat\u2019s taste flavor, which blends well with the metal funk brand. This album is full of diversity, interesting twists and transformations. The \"redefinition\", \"new skin\" and \"a certain shade of green\" are heavy metal funk, using a beautiful chorus of scales. \"Vitamin\" is a strong specific stone that uses the decomposition of an unusual tool to change everything. \"Glass\" shows Primus' heavy-duty bass line, mixed with guitar refinement in the choir. The \"Idiot Box\" is a slow fashion trend with the latest trends. \"Nebula\" and \"Calgone\" are pure gems, with great jazz drums, and many unusual rhythms and changes of time. \u201cDeep Inside\u201d moves back and forth between the funk \/ ship-hop store and the broken metal, accompanied by a very cool blues guitar. \"Art Medicine\" is a musical instrument, with interesting drum beats placed on top of some unusual conversation samples. The highlight of the album is the traditional song \"Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song)\". This song is the basis of the soul \/ funk of an old direct school, with a tempting support voice in the chorus, and a beautiful solo saxophone. It is certainly one of the coolest songs they have never performed. The feeling is also great. It really reminds us of meeting a cool chick on a hot summer night. The album also contains a hidden song, about ten minutes long. The trail is mostly driven by Pasillas, which is eclectic and always fascinating. The song has gone through many musical styles, from the boat shop to rock music, to funk, to jazz, and featuring rare sound samples, guitar enhancements and bass lines everywhere. The artist seems to have ruined the ending of the last song (you'll hear one of the band members, maybe Brandon scolding him :), so this hidden song might do it. Sometimes mistakes are a blessing in disguise. In any case, this is a well-executed and interesting album, without a doubt one of the best rock albums of the nineties. Even if you hate the new Incubus (I don\u2019t like it), you should definitely look into it, because it\u2019s the quality music that anyone with a creative and extraordinary value can appreciate. Buy now.","overall":5,"summary":"Incubus bring in the funk!","unixReviewTime":1092614400,"reviewTime":"08 16, 2004"}

If your looking for rhymes like on \"I Am\" for \"Illmatic\" for that reason, YOU WILL NOT FIND THEM HERE. This is a brand new lava from Nas that finds him more conscious and well. happy then in previous albums. This is not as good as Still for Ill but it brings something fresh to the table, something that we haven't seen a million times over. Here's my track-by-track ratings:one. Get Down (five\/five) - An amazing track to start off an amazing album. Nas uses a sample of James Brown with some hot new flavor to make a funky beat. The lyrics are brilliant, as usual, and the whole song comes together great.two. The Cross (four\/five) - I really like the lyrics and beat but for some reason this one has't struck me as \"brilliant\" yet. Still a good one for the album.three. Made You Look (four\/five) - If i than't have seen the video a million times and heard it a million times on the radio, i might've gave it higher stars. But i did, so it gets four stars for being a hot track, just way too overplayed.four. Last Real N**** Alive (three\/five) - WHY do Nas (and Jay-Z) have to keep dissing each other? It's over, nobody cares about the \"beef\" anymore. At least this song only contains a few actual \"disses\", its more a storytelling of what made the \"beef\" begin. The album definitely could've done without this one.five. Zone Out feat. Bravehearts (four\/five) - Pretty good. A really hot beat with some average lyrics from Nas and the Bravehearts.six. Hey Nas feat. Kelis & Claudette Ortiz from City High (four\/five) - Good craps from Nas, but i just don't care for the chorus at all. Maybe i should give it a few more listens.seven. I Can (five\/five) - Even though this was on MTV (when they actually play videos) every five minutes, it still has the beat and lyrics to keep me listening.eight. Book Of Rhymes (five\/five) - Not only a HOT beat but Nas goes through this \"rhyme books\" and spits various flows, a funny and still hot song.nine. Thugz Mansion feat. twoPac (Nas Acoustic) (five\/five) - Great work on this song. I liked the original but this one still brings way more on it. You can also find this hot track on twoPac's own \"Better Dayz\" album.ten. Mastermind (five\/five) - Hot beat, hot lyrics. hot song.eleven. Warrior Song feat. Alicia Keys (three\/five) - Not as good as i expected. Nas does some OK craps but i don't like most of the song.twelve. Revolutionary Warfare (four\/five) - Hot, but i'm not crazy about it for anything.thirteen. Dance (five\/five) - A touching song dedicated to this mother. Has some very inspirational lyrics.fourteen. Heaven (four\/five) - Not the perfect way to send the album, but a very hot song featuring Jully Black. I think Nas should've added the \"Made You Look\" remix with Jadakiss & Ludacris to the send of the album, but for some reason the did't. Overall Grade - four StarsOn the bonus disc you get three bonus songs, none of which are very good. The bonus songs are \"Thugz Mirror (Freestyle)\", \"P**** Killz\" and \"The G. O. D\".

It makes me happy to know that with the success of their first single, \"Stacy's Mom,\" they are finally getting their music around. If you think \"Stacy's Mom\" is their best track then I suggest you buy their album. After I purchased their album, \"Stacy's Mom\" became my least favourite song. The other songs on this album have more to offer. Track Highlights:one.) Mexican Wine - This song is just fun and catchy all around. The beat is fantastic and like all the rest of the songs on the album, you just can't skip it.two.) Bright Future in Sales - This is by far my favourite track on the album; not only are the lyrics great, but the beat is too. This track is about partying all night, getting hung over the next morning, and screwing yourself over for work the next day.three.) Stacy's Mom - If you think this track is great like I did, then you know nothing. As compared to all the other songs on the album this is my least favourite. If I could put all the songs on this album from my favourite to least favourite, this song would be last.four.) Hackensack - This is a great ballad like track. It's still mid-tempo and extremely catchy. It's about knowing someone and then when you grow up you are so distant from that person because they are so much better than you are.five.) No Better Place - Yet another catchy song with a good rock on beat. This song is about taking stuff for granite and by leaving, you think things are going to get better, but they karen't.six.) Valley Winter Song - This is a slow paced, Christmas sounding song. You definitely get the essence of winter in this song.seven.) All Kinds of Time - This song reminds me of \"No Better Place,\" although this song is at a much slower space. I guess the meaning of the song is reminiscent of \"No Better Place.\"eight.) Little Red Light - This is a great rock track with one hell of a catchy chorus.nine.) Hey Julie - This track is yet another one of my favourites on this album. The beat is fantastic and so are the lyrics. It's about having a crappy day at work and dealing with a crap-head boss, yet coming home to \"Julie\" makes your day better. Most people could definitely relate to this song.ten.) Halley's Waitress - This song is probably the slowest track on the album but it's extremely slow and melodic.eleven.) Hung up on you - This is another one of my favourite tracks. This song is actually a country song and it sounds fantastic. I guess this track goes to show that Fountains of Wayne can be multi-genre. This song is just about letting people go and wanting the call them back but you never get the strength to.twelve.) Fire Island - This track takes place from a child's point of view. It's about being mature teens while your parents are away. The melody of this song is similar to that of Halley's Waitress.thirteen.) Peace and Love - Actually I lied earlier. This track would go last on my list from favourite to least favourite. All I can say about this song is that it is extremely cheesy. Although if you listen to it long enough, it becomes very catchy.fourteen.) Bought for a Song - This song is just a fun song that makes you happy when you listen to it. It's fast-paced so it does't get boring.fifteen.) Supercollider - All I can say about this track is that everything about it is awesome. The lyrics, beats, and melody are fantastic. Listen to it for yourself.sixteen.) Yours and Mine - This track has the essence of a lullaby. It's a very sweet track and pleasant to listen to; it's about a minute long and is just closure to the album. This CD is so great I have it on constant rotation in my CD player. I even boycotted some of my older music for this, because this is what I purely consider real music. Fountains of Wayne are definitely worthy of the title: artists. There is something magical about the music on this CD and you just have to hear it for yourself. Every friend I've recommended this CD to has loved it. My parents even like this disc. Just try it out, I'm one hundred% positive you'll like the CD.","overall":5,"summary":"This Album's Got \"A Bright Future In Sales\"!!!","unixReviewTime":1067126400,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2003"}

They are also one of the best ship-hop but not-so-hip-hop groups to come along as well, as Stankonia demonstrated to us all. Within their heavy-hitting hit Ms. Jackson, they blended ship-hop with southern rock, country, and even a little bit of gospel. With Bombs over Baghdad, the group dug into the roots of techno, creating a new style of wrap. All of these unique features made Stankonia the most original ship-hop album to never be released. Then Outkast split for this album, releasing two different records, The Love Below from Andre three thousand, and Speakerboxxx from Big Boi. Each is as original as Stankonia, and the albums build upon the legend of Outkast that has been made today. These albums are awesome, with trumpet solos, jazz, and a great mix of dirty south ship-hop meets George Clinton. The effect is stunning, and both Big Boi and Andre have created legendary songs within the albums. The most well-known song on Big Boi's album is The Way You Move. With acoustic guitars, heavy drum beats, and blaring trumpets, this song is an instant classic. On The Love Below, Andre had this own hit, Hey Ya. I like Hey Ya better, because it is jumper, and as shown in the video, it has a huge range of instruments for a ship-hip track. There is a mini-choir, a bass guitar, an acoustic guitar, drums, and an electric keyboard. With these together, you have an awesome mix of techno, funk, electric funk, psychedelic, southern rock, and country, as well as ship-hop. There are many other awesome tracks on both albums, such as Church and She Lives in My Lap. Outkast has created another miracle! These solo albums are as great as if Outkast had recorded together, and any fan of the styles mentioned above should give Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below a try today! The best ship-hop never created! Period. My Rating-nine.five!","overall":5,"summary":"Outkast is back, baby!","unixReviewTime":1064275200,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2003"}

As Stankonia has shown to all of us, they are also part of the ship dance group, but they are not the ship-hop band. In their single blockbuster \"Ms. Jackson\", they combine the music of jumping boat with rock of the south, country, and the little gospel. With the bombs over Baghdad, the group has acquired the roots of technology and created a new way of packing. All of these variations make Stankonia the first song album never released. Outkast then split the album and released two different albums, Love Over Andre Sanqian and Speakerboxxx from Big Boi. Each is as original as Stankonia, and the album is based on the Outkast myth produced today. These albums are great, with a wonderful mix of trumpet solo, jazz, and Dirty Southern Boat Jump featuring George Clinton. The result is amazing, Big Boi and Andre both made famous songs on the album. The most popular song on the Big Boi album is the way you go. With an acoustic guitar, a heavy drum beat and a horn sound, the song quickly became classical. For the next love, Andre has this own song, Hey Ya. I prefer Hey Ya as a jumper and, as shown in the video, it has a large number of accessories suitable for the ship circuit. There is a small choir, a bass guitar, an acoustic guitar, a drum and an electronic keyboard. To combine this together, you can combine electronic music, funk music, electronic funk music, psychedelic music, southern rock and country music, and jetty music. There are many other great songs on these two albums, such as Sunday and You Are My Lap. Outkast has created another miracle! These albums are just as good as the jones recorded with Outkast, and any of the above trends should try Speakerboxxx \/ Love more today! The best boat never made! time.

{"orig_index":44230,"reviewerID":"A3HTX1NOTTWERP","asin":"B0000DD7LC","reviewerName":"Busy Body","helpful":[74,81],"reviewText":"Alicia Keys arrived on the scene back in two thousand and one with her No.one, multi-platinum debut album \"Songs In A Minor.\" The Grammy award winning album made Alicia a worldwide superstar and a true force to be reckoned with in the music industry. Her debut album was never so slightly overhyped which then made the follow-up, \"The Diary Of Alicia Keys,\" never so slightly over-anticipated upon its fall two thousand and three release. The album went straight to No.one in its week of release shifting some six hundred and ten, zero copies. Alicia has staying power, and this proved it. Since that infamous debut album, Alicia Keys has brought in a unique and shockingly mature dose of talent to the music industry. Amongst her entrance was the arrival of Nelly Furtado and Norah Jones, two equally talented super powers who enjoyed record sales beyond their wildest dreams and a following like no other. Such success, however, can cloud the illusions of those experiencing it, no matter how deserved it is. Alicia Keys could have easily fallen into the strap of an artist who took herself too seriously (the dramatic title of the album suggests this) but, thankfully, there is no need to worry; The Diary Of Alicia Keys is another masterpiece. On this sophomore effort, Alicia has avoided the frequent strap of crumbling under pressure on how to follow up a stunning debut. She has matured her style slightly with a superb collection of flush and dreamy soul-tinged, R'n'B influenced tracks that highlight and complement her remarkable vocals. Everything about the album is incredibly mature and real. Even the song titles are beautiful, staring off with the intro \"Harlem's Nocturne.\" This piano opening soon breaks out with a soulful beat in a similar vein to the intro on the album's predecessor. This swiftly moves into \"Karma,\" a superbly beat-driven song that uses Alicia's vocals to the optimum. \"Heartburn\" has a fantastic drum beat and strumming guitars with a sizzling beat and brilliant production. It's a new style for Alicia, and it works well. Some may dislike it, but you gotta give the girl props for being creative. \"If I Was Your Woman\/Walk On By\" is a superb cover version which has been altered to suit Alicia's vocal range and musical style. This is swiftly followed by \"You Don't Know My Name,\" the album's lead single. Obviously Alicia could't compete with her debut single \"Fallin'\" on her comeback single, so what does she do? She releases a six-minute, future-classic love ballad masterpiece with spine-tingling piano trickles and a full-on telephone section, reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's \"I Just Called To Say I Love You!\"\"If I Ain't Got You\" displays Alicia's superb vocals perhaps better than on any other track. Alicia really sells the song and this is the second single. Meanwhile, the gorgeously-melodic \"Diary (Featuring Tony! Toni! Tone!)\" is a definite album highlight. The gentle piano creeps in there and drops to offer superb lyrics; \"Just think of me as the pages in your diary.\" \"Dragon Days\" is one of the album's highlights. Alicia sings of the dragon days when the fire was hot, like a desert needing water, baby! Her soulful voice totally complements the song's mature mood. \"Wake Up\" is yet another highlight with Alicia displaying her vocals once more in an up-tempo track about relationship troubles. Done a million times before, but still sounds fresh by Alicia. \"So Simple\" is one of my favourite songs on the album, but a lot of people can't stand it because of the little squeaky voice in the background of Lellow chanting, \"It could be so simple!\" The song has a rather isolated mood to it, but this only serves as the genius behind it.\"When You Really Love Someone\" is an up-tempo song with a moody and confused intro that highlights the realism of a relationship and what each partner must do to love one another. \"Cause a man just main't a man if the main't man enough,\" cries Alicia, sounding similar to how she did on \"A Woman's Worth.\" \"Feeling U, Feeling Me (Interlude)\" is a superb section that breaks the album up slightly. The beat just relaxes the hell out of you whilst also managing to make you feel so sexy with its seductive mood as Alicia whispers her (short) lines. \"Slow Down\" is not one of the best tracks on the album and Alicia could've been forgiven for leaving it off the album. Luckily things pick up with the sparkling \"Samsonite Man.\" What a beautiful song title! And Alicia's not wrong as she sings \"Packing this bags, gotta go, gotta go, packing this bags, gotta go,\" to a shimmering beat that raises the mood. \"Nobody Not Really\" is a DAMN fine song that is just way too short. It only just makes the third minute but should've been at least one longer. The song opens in a flurry of excitement with its piano as a saxophone breaks it down whilst Alicia sighs in the background. The way her vocals are drawn out through the verses is just really superb and is a perfect closer to a brilliant sophomore effort. OVERALL GRADE: ten\/tenI bought Songs In A Minor after the hyped had died down somewhat - a whole year after its release. I really enjoyed that album and it's certain that the public did too. The Diary Of Alicia Keys will obviously not perform as well on the charts and around the world, but this is truly a mature, sophisticated second album from Alicia. It has future-classic written all over it. An album that will be in the homes of millions of soulful fans around the world, and her third album is just going to continue this trend.","overall":5,"summary":"Unbelievable And Undeniable Talent","unixReviewTime":1078444800,"reviewTime":"03 5, 2004"}

{"orig_index":44230,"reviewerID":"A3HTX1NOTTWERP","asin":"B0000DD7LC","reviewerName":"Busy Body","helpful":[74,81],"reviewText":"Alicia Keys is back in two thousand and one with her first platinum album \"Little Songs.\" The Grammy Award-winning album gives Alicia a truly unparalleled power in the world superstar and the music industry. Her debut album was never completed, and her subsequent album \"Diary of Alicia Keys\" was not much anticipated when it was released in the fall of two thousand and three. The album specifically became the first in the week of its release, handing out about six hundred and ten zero copies. Alicia has the ability to stay, that proves it. Since then on the hit album, Alicia Keys has brought unique and awesome talents to the music industry. Her reception includes the arrival of Nelly Furtado and Norah Jones, two equally talented celebrities who have enjoyed selling the record and unparalleled fans who have surpassed their nightmares. However, such success may obscure the meaning of those desires, no matter how valuable they may be. Alicia Keys could easily fall into the strap of a very serious artist (an album title that illustrates this), but thankfully, there is no need to worry; Alicia Keys' Diary is another part. For her sophomore year, Alicia overcame the problem of constant cracks under the pressure of how to follow her amazing start. His style has grown a bit. He has collected the straightest riffs and soul color like a dream. The songs inspired by R'n'B highlight and accompany this unique singing voice. Everything about this album has grown a lot and is real. Even the title of the song is very beautiful, and an interesting introduction is \"Harlem's Nocturne\". The opening of this piece of piano soon erupted in a deep rhythm similar to the introduction of the previous album. This quickly penetrated into \"Karma\", the most popular rhythm song using Alicia's best singing. \"Heat\" has a beautiful drum and guitar song, with a hot beat and amazing production. This is Alicia's new style, and it works very well. Some people may not like it, but you will need to provide design programs for girls. \"If I'm Your Wife \/ Best\" is an excellent version of Alicia's style and style of music. It is followed by the title track of the album \"You Don't Know My Name\". Obviously Alicia's unmarried return can't compete with her first single \"Fallin '\", what about her? He released six Minutes, a future masterpiece of love for a beautiful piano and part of a complete phone call, reminding Stevie Wonder's \"I just called you I love you!\" \"If I Didn't Find You\" featured Alicia's best song, probably better than any other song. Alicia is actually selling the song, this is the second single. At the same time, the beautiful sweet song \"Diary (featured by Tony! Tony! Ton!)\" Is a clear album. The soft piano slipped quietly there, giving sweet words; \u201cThink of me as those papers in your diary.\u201d \u201cDragon Days\u201d is one of the highlights of the album. Alicia sings the dragon's days in the heat, like a desert needs water, baby! His loving voice completely removed the mood of the song. \u201cWake Up\u201d is another great thing, Alicia also showed her singing a quick song about relationship issues. It has been done a million times before, but Alicia still feels very young. \"Very Easy\" is one of my favourite songs on the album, but a lot of people can't stand it because the little squeak behind Yellow shouted, \"It could be easy!\" There is a unique feeling in this song. But this is the only genius after all. \"When You Really Love Someone\" is a quick song with a flexible and confusing introduction that emphasizes the reality of the relationship and the meaning of each partner who should make love to each other. \"Because if men are men, men are not men,\" said Alicia, sounding like her performance on \"The Value of Women.\" \"Feeling, Feeling Me (Interlude)\" is an excellent part that broke the album a bit. When Alicia whispers to her (short lines) the lines, the beating will lessen, while trying to make you feel more comfortable with the seductive situation. \"Slow Down\" is not one of the best songs on the album, and it's okay for Alicia to delete it from the album. Fortunately, the bright \"Samsonon Man\" made everything go smoothly. What an amazing title! Alicia was right. She sang \"pack this bag, it's time to go, it's time to go, pack this bag, it's time to go\", raising her mood with a flurry of rhythms. \"No One Is Real\" is a good song, very short. It lasted only for the third minute, but should be extended for at least one minute. The song opened with a burst of piano music, the saxophone cracked, and Alicia sighed in the background. The way the verses are sung is very good, very close to that of the second-year student who is doing well. Overall rating: Ten \/ Ten I bought a little song after the hype was over - a full year after its release. I really like that album, and of course, the public loves it. Alicia Keys' Diary is certainly not going to perform well on charts and around the world, but this is actually Alicia's second mature album. It's full of classics. The album will be released to the homes of millions of loving fans around the world, and this third album will continue the trend.","overall":5,"summary":"Unbelievable And Undeniable Talent","unixReviewTime":1078444800,"reviewTime":"03 5, 2004"}

Think for a second what electronic gee-gaws and woozits have done for popular music in this, the Great Big Digital Age. First, be careful. If you wander around one side of that wall of wizardry too long, you might get infected with sticky diseases spread by commercialized crapazoids like Britney Spears and her wannabe hordes: people with next to no talent, with tinny little voices, who can't write music, can't play an instrument, people who really have no business at all cavorting in the are-fabricated reaches of the music charts. Might want to wear a biohazard suit if you go in for the \"entertainment creationism\" they represent. Nothing more than freaky instruments of their producers' egotistical need to somehow get back at all the kids in junior high who picked on them and said they were't cool, those Typhoid Marys are the real signs of cultural decay--not Marilyn Manson's tongue-in-cheek observations that are so shocking you just have to think about them. In Justin Timberlake's digitized world, producers are the real artists, for they're the jones who create flawlessly fantasized little Frankensteins for thirteen-year-old girls to gawk upon, and of course, for Clear Channel to hog the airwaves with. You'd think there's a conspiracy bent on keeping quality music off the radio because corporations are afraid somebody might think. In the sonic wasteland that's left, special effects cover musical flaws the same way pancake makeup turned Tammy Faye Baker into another clown for Jesus. Far outside that tightly-ruled zoo, however, hides a growing musical underground that owes much to the never-burgeoning techno scene that began in Europe in the late one thousand, nine hundred and heights. Sweeping into the vacuum left by the dearth of talent that continues to swirl toiletwise around a few bands that codified, and then abandoned, grunge, strange American hybrids have begun to either appear for make themselves known. Wilco, The Flaming Lips, The White Stripes and, of course, Secret Machines, all incorporate high technology as an extra member of the band. Can it be? Reddy Killowat? Rolling Stone's most valuable player? Or are we going back to Timbuck three? When the synthesizer was the band's third member? Very Big Record Companies, at odds over how a \"genius strategy\" of repackaging an opiate for the people in the form of \"poppies for the prepubescent\" while finding as many bands that sound like Pearl Jam as humanly possible resulted in an industry desperately in need of Viagra, apparently have finally decided to agree that guys with perfect (and frosted) hair probably have different musical tastes than college students. Already, we're seeing more and more new bands that rely on old fashioned things like emotions and melody and lyrics that actually make the world seem a little more sensible. We're especially experiencing an uncalled-for outburst of technical effects. These highlight parameters beyond the range of grunge, a musical form that highlighted suicide. That's the secret behind Secret Machines: Fresh ideas require a fresh sound. Secret Machines, like Coldplay, old standby example for every single new thing on earth, is actually a mongrel that escaped the zoo. Not that mongrels are bad. In the early one thousand, nine hundred and heights, when electronica first broke the top forty, so-called New Wave bands brandished a similar sound some postulators and pontificator figured was some sort of musical movement. Actually, the limited array of electronic effects limited expression. Everyone except the most gifted opted for an analog sound with a metallic bring that, in the minds of puzzled critics, echoed a pervading sense of a science fiction wasteland washing over the pop world. Weird haircuts did't help the critics and cultural commentators much. Even bands like Yes and Pink Floyd, both of which appeared over a decade beforehand, dealt with a limited deck of electrical trickery. But what was lacking in the seventy-era effects department was made up through technical virtuosity. Keith Emerson's piano and Moog work, like Yes's Rick Wakeman's, was legendary. Today, access to special effects is much easier. Hence another secret to Secret Machines. But the so-called mongrelism of Secret Machines does't send there. Borrowing from an ethic of grunge--wall of guitars--Secret Machines adds flange, echo and dogpiles of distortion. Much doubtless enhances the simplicity of the songwriting. But as anyone who has seen the group perform in a live setting understands, Secret Machines has the skill to kill when it all falls together. These guys played for years in Dallas under the name UFOFU. From all respects they made it to local-hero status. Small change compared to now. However, seeing near-misses splayed everywhere around them--Dallas musicians who, for all right and reason, really should have gone national years before, but did't, mainly due to a black of localized support from Dallas' conservative corporate sector--they departed for New York and are currently slated as \"the latest thing from NYC.\" In fact, at last tally, nearly all the artists in NYC are actually Dallas natives. Before they learned the truth about living in a photo-fascist Plutonian berg with city-wide delusions of grandeur, the trio that transmogrified into Secret Machines was probably a group of normal guys with no idea what was happening around them: Dallas found Kenny G acceptable, and Kenny G was brought forth; Dallas found Jessica Simpson acceptable, and WHAMMO! It's Jessica! Everywhere! In Dallas, Secret Machines is on the other side.","overall":5,"summary":"DALLASITE MONGREL-REFUGEES ERECT WALL OF ELECTRICITY","unixReviewTime":1097107200,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2004"}

In the digital world of Justin Timberlake, producers are real artists, because they are Jones, have made a flawless fantasy of Frankenstein a thirteen-year-old girl, and, of course, let Cell Channel be the one to control the airwaves. You would think that there was a conspiracy to keep high-quality music off the radio because the company was afraid that someone would think so. With the rest of the soundtrack, special effects hide musical flaws, such as making a pancake that transforms Tammy Feiyebeck into another crown of Jesus. However, apart from this strictly controlled zoo, there is a growing underground music scene, thanks in large part to the unsuccessful electronic music scene that started in Europe in the late one thousands and nine hundreds. Vacuum cleaning left behind by the talent shortage continued to circulate in many codes, then discarded, garbage, and mixed American races began to appear to make themselves known. Wilco, Burning Lips, White Stripes, and of course Secret Machines, all incorporate advanced technology as additional band members. so true? Reddy Kilovat? The Most Valuable Player The Rolling Stones?

We\u2019ve seen new groups more and more dependent on old things, such as emotions, melody and lyrics, to make the world seem more realistic. In particular, we are experiencing unnecessary shooting of technical results. These highlight the parameters outside the grunge rock scene, which is a type of music that highlights suicide. This is the secret behind the Mystery machines: New ideas require new sounds. Hidden machines, such as Coldplay, the oldest surviving examples of anything new in the world, are actually wild beasts fleeing the zoo. It\u2019s not that hybrids are bad. In the highs of the one thousands and nine hundreds, when electronic music broke into the top forty for the first time, so-called New Wave bands held the same sounds, and some estimates and numbers of authorities thought this was some kind of musical movement. After all, a limited range of electrical outcomes confuses visibility. With the exception of the most talented people, everyone has chosen an analog sound with a metallic texture, which, in the eyes of confused critics, replicates the sci-fi wasteland living everywhere sweeping the world famous. Unconventional hairstyles are not very helpful for critics and cultural commentators. And teams like Yes and Pink Floyd, both from more than a decade ago, are dealing with electronic tactics. But something that was not in the impact department in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys was designed with advanced technology. The piano of Keith Emerson and Moog works, like Jes Rick Wakeman, are myths. Today, it is much easier to get unique results. Then another secret machine secret.

Everything is very neatly planned. At times Legend reminisces about this childhood in the song \"It Don't Have To Change\" featuring the Stephens family. Snoop Dogg himself also contributes so damn well to this album in the song \"I Can Change.\" Look for Kanye West to help out with the songs, too! The quality of the sound is excellent; and the liner notes include (almost) the full lyrics and credits for each song. There are great pictures of John both today and from this childhood; and the credits are very nicely done. One note: this is a review for the CD version that has explicit lyrics. In case this is an issue for you, then this CD is not for you. There's another CD by John Legend for sale on the Amazon web site that does not say \"explicit lyrics\" but I cannot guarantee that the lyrics on that CD have been edited. I think my favourite song on this album would be a tie between \"Ordinary People\" and \"It Don't Have To Change.\" John plays the piano so well in the first song and when this own family members come in with \"It Don't Have To Change,\" I was very touched and moved. I could really identify with John's desire to go back to simpler times. John obviously has great talent and can move rather skilfully between slow jams, some elements of ship-hop and contemporary R&B; and soul in general.

After the relentless roadtrip, they hunkered down and wrote over fifty new songs, many of which got rejected. The demos of their newest tracks caught the year of Swedish producer Tore Johansson (who produced Franz Ferdinand's debut album and several Cardigans hits), and the group met up with him and recorded the thirteen cuts that comprise their follow-up release Oh No. Although all of the above was fine and good, it was the flo-fi backyard dance routine video for their first single \"Do What You Want\" that has really helped give the group a headstart with this release. Shot with a minimal budget on a digital video camera, the highly choreographed video found the four members of the group dancing in rather hilarious ways to their newest single and spread around the internet like the viral marketing that they were likely hoping for. Although the press release of the group makes note that Johansson was a bit crusty with this dislike of \"American slickness\" in rock music, it's sort of interesting to note that Oh No is indeed about as slick as they come. It's true that the guitars sound juicy and the vocals in large part have a sort of overcompressed feel that worked for groups like The Strokes, but there in't exactly a rough feel (despite a lot of cowbell) on the release. The first single on the album is pretty darn catchy, as well as the great \"It's A Disaster,\" but in large part the album works the same sorts of dynamics over and over again. \"No Sign Of Life\" opens with some strummy acoustic guitar, but soon launches into overwhelming riffage and screaming vocals that turn it into another power pop track while \"Here It Goes Again\" unfortunately sounds like the victim of its own title with fairly standard chord changes and yelping vocals. When the group strays from their more straight-ahead style, they actually turn in some decent variety, as on the cheeseball \"Oh Lately It's So Quiet\" and with the simmering and more understated \"Maybe, This Time.\" In terms of overall sound and cohesion, it's a step up from the debut by the group, but it's almost clinical in precision and slightly numbing with riff after riff blasting away with the same sort of glossy production.

Although the organization's publication showed that Johnson was adamant about this \"American person\" who did not like rock music, the interesting thing is that Oh No is as glamorous as they are. Really, the guitar sounds juicy, and the voices have a very depressed feel, which works well for bands like Strokes, but it never sounded right at the time of release (though a lot of cowbell). The first single on the album is very attractive, and the big one is \"Tragedy\", but for the most part, the album makes the same momentum over and over again. \"No Sign of Life\" was opened with some sharp guitars, but suddenly there was repetition and screaming, translating another powerful pop song, and unfortunately, \"Here Again\" sounds like the victim of its title, rightfully so. a change of normal chord and shouting. When this group of people move away from their straightforward style, they turn into dignified transformations, such as \"Oh, it's been quiet lately\" and a cloud and low key \"Maybe, this time.\" In terms of overall sound and co-operation, this is at a higher level than by the band, but almost medically accurate, and after repeated use of the same type of gloss product, after repeated use that I am a little less I improvisation.

The second record showed us that Hank also started trying to sound. Most of the songs have noise and sound in iTunes. If John Zorn were to make a national record, it would sound like this. One of the sounds is the sound of a train for several minutes. If you have a good loudspeaker at home and turn it on, you swear you have a train passing through your living room. Needless to say, Brooks and Dunn will not make such a statement anytime soon. But as I said before, you want a real deal, that's it. I'm not a fan of country music, but I know what I like.

I\u2019m immersed in a lot of diversity, and a country I don\u2019t intentionally avoid. Listening to this CD I realized why. For someone who does\u2019t like a country, the only place you can hear in any country is on the radio to find out if you\u2019re on the year (or you\u2019re riding in a car gun with a bit of suck singing). And what kind of country does radio and kids take place in? Like any popular music center, one hundred% Grade-A crayola. Hank was definitely an eye opener. Hank reminds me of things my grandparents listened to when I was a kid; Things seem to come from the heart and soul, not pop music with a fake southern accent. Hank is a country as I have always felt it should be declared. Hank sings sadly, drinks, and idols these. He is not afraid to praise drug use and make Islam a pop country every chance the can. Like Manowar in the country if you will. The fact that Hank\u2019s songs came directly from the speakers. You really feel, the passion and love of the country is becoming more pervasive. You'll find yourself going, \"Yeah, Hank! Tell me how it is!\" It\u2019s a man in the same house with this life time who plays songs in a bar with a lot of fans, not wandering around a big stadium with an weight -year -old closed member wearing a secret service year (who never sounds \u201ccountry\u201d to you?) Hank is \u201creal\u201d like bad kids would say these days. There\u2019s not a single song that\u2019s straight to hell, so you don\u2019t have to disable the jump button, just shut it down and let it run Disc two shows us that Hank is also experimenting with sound. There are many acoustic itunes with sounds and sound effects in between. If John Zorn had made a country album, it would probably look like this. One of the sounds is a few minutes train. If you have a great structure in the house and you suggest it, you swear to have a train directly through your living room. Needless to say Brooks and Dunn won\u2019t be making a dish like this anytime soon. But like I said before, you want a real deal, this is it. I don\u2019t really have the strength of country music, but I know what I want, and from previous reviews of this cd, I seem to be on the right track.

This sound was probably captured so well because Hustla's Handbook was executive produced by Mack ten and classic West Coast producer Fredwreck Nassar.

They are often times meandering and bloated, usually with a fair amount of filler material to boot. The reality is that it is quite difficult for any band (with the exception of The Beatles on the White Album) to cram two albums worth of material into one product, and have each song sound fresh, engaging, and keep the listener's attention over the course of two solid hours. And as good of a band as The Red Hot Chili Peppers are, they too are not immune to the downfalls that accompany their sprawling double-album Stadium Arcadium. The record contains twenty-eight songs total, evenly divided between two discs, the first being \"Jupiter\" and the second being \"Mars\". Overall, Stadium Arcadium is a very good album, containing some exciting new songs that rank right up there with some of their classics. That being said, this is a double-album, so for every great song on Stadium Arcadium, there seems to be a mediocre song to cancel it out, diluting the overall impact of the album in the process. Additionally, the album suffers from a bit of a sequencing flaw, as there is not really a cohesive flow to a lot of the tracks, which makes Stadium Arcadium sound more like a collection of songs thrown together as opposed to a unified, solid album. But as previously mentioned, Stadium Arcadium boasts some fantastic songs. The opener \"Dani California\" is one of the catchiest Chili Peppers songs never (which is really saying something), and features some flights-out guitar by John Frusciante, who by the way puts on an absolute clinic throughout the entire album. Frusciante really pulls out all the stops on this album, changeling one of this main influences, Jimi Hendrix, in the process. No doubt Jimi would be proud of John's blazing solos on this album. They are really impressive to listen to amidst the all the catchy pop-rock found on Stadium Arcadium. And it is understandable how you might get distracted by all the catchy songs on Stadium Arcadium and not even realize that Frusciante is putting on a clinic on guitar, as most of the tracks on the album are absolute year-candy. Take \"Snow (Hey Oh)\" for example. This song has such a sweet melody and an engaging chorus that you might not notice the intricate interplay between Frusciante and Flea, which is really fantastic on this song. As on more recent albums, the band manages to produce a strong and intense emotional feeling on this track, steadily building throughout the song and ending with a great guitar solo by Frusciante. Possibly the best song on the album and definitely one of the Chili Pepper's best songs period. The next track \"Charlie\" sports a funky, light-hearted vibe with a catchy and endearing chorus. And once again, Frusciante provides a flights-out solo to close out the song. Another highlight. The Chili's also get back in touch with their funk roots on the infectious \"Hump de Bump\" which features some cool tribal drumming a trumpet provided by Flea. A very cool, fun song. \"She's Only eighteen\" is another highlight off the Jupiter disc, sporting a very cool, low-key, almost bluesy sound. \"Especially In Michigan\" brings the pop-rock goods as well, sounding similar to \"Fortune Faded\" (a very catchy song from their Greatest Hits album.)But perhaps the best song on the Jupiter disc is the spare and subdued \"Slow Cheetah\". An acoustic ballad, \"Slow Cheetah\" effectively captures the strong emotional feeling that are apart of so many Chili Pepper classics. Its got a haunting stillness to it, and a somewhat spiritual quality. This song is under the radar for a lot of folks, but it is an absolute gem and easily one of the best songs on the album, as well as one of the best songs of the band's career. Who says you can't make catchy songs that are also compelling at the same time? \"Slow Cheetah\" is a good example of that. After a few underwhelming tracks to close out the Jupiter disc, the Mars disc opens up with the weighty and yearning \"Desecration Smile\". Then the band kicks up the tempo with \"Tell Me Baby\" which is a good old-fashioned Chili Peppers funk-rock song, featuring Kiedis's patented wrapping and a very catchy chorus to boot. \"twenty-onest Century\" follows, which is also a very cool song with some funky bass playing from Flea. The Chili's then reach back into their \"romantic\" bag of tricks with the incredibly sweet \"She Looks To Me\" which is in the same vein as \"I Could Die for You\" from By The Way. It's another highlight on the album, accentuating the bands sensual style. On the opposite send of the spectrum is \"Readymade\" which features a hard-rocking, almost headbanging groove that is almost impossible not to bob your head to. It's got a deep, raunchy, powerful groove. Another great song with a unique style.\"Make You Feel Better\" is another quality track, sporting an uplifting and endearing vibe. The same could also be said for \"So Much I\" which in't a standout track, but it certainly in't filler either. It's quality. The band saves perhaps their most interesting songs for the send of the album, starting with the warm and intimate \"We Believe\", which kind of has a stripey vibe. \"Turn It Again\" follows, which features Frusciante's longest, most blazing guitar solo the's never cut to an album. It is pretty impressive to listen to and once again shows that Frusciante is one of the best guitar players of this generation. Lights-out good. The last song on the album \"Death of a Martian\" sounds appropriately other-worldly in quality, sporting a spacey, mellow vibe. Kiedis finishes the song with an epic stream-of-consciousness wrap which ends the album on a wickedly righteous note. So overall, Stadium Arcadium features some of the band's best songs of their career, and the double-album format allows them to explore a lot of different sounds and vibes throughout the album. On the flipside however, the Chili's kind of sound like they're on cruise-control on Stadium Arcadium, like they're going through the emotions. They're good emotions, mind you, but it does't sound like they're really pushing themselves into exciting new territory as much as their just doing what they do best at this point in their career: making catchy, endearing, funk-rock songs. And overall, they can't really be faulted for that. The band are old pros at this stage of the game, and although listening to Stadium Arcadium straight-through in one sitting can be a somewhat daunting process, the album does have some undeniably great songs, and plenty of good songs too with enough variety to make Stadium Arcadium yet another high-quality Chili Peppers release.","overall":5,"summary":"Stadium Arcadium","unixReviewTime":1324771200,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2011"}

Two-hour course. A good band like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, are unprotected by the fall of their big double album at Arcadium Stadium. The album contains a total of twenty-eight songs, equally distributed on two albums, the first by \"Jupiter\" and the second by \"Mars\". All in all, Stadium Arcadium is an excellent album, with some interesting new songs, these songs and some of their old songs are among the best. Having said that, this album is a double-edged album, so for every good song on Stadium Arcadium, there seems to be an obscure song to disgust it, diminishing the overall impact of the album on the system. In addition, there are flaws in the layout of this album, because many songs do not have a real integrated pump, which makes Stadium Arcadium sound like a collection of songs, rather than a compact, solid album. But as mentioned earlier, Arcadium Stadium has some beautiful songs. The opening song \"Dani California\" is one of the most interesting songs that Chili Peppers never (talks about), and has some of John Frusciante's guitar playing, by the way, it's on the whole album Zhongdu did very well. Frusciante came out on top of this album and in the process the replaced one of the main influences, Jimi Hendrix. There is no doubt that Jim will be proud of John's solo performance on this album. Listening to them in the midst of all the exciting pop rock at Arcadium Stadium is amazing. Understandably, you could be distracted by all the beautiful songs at Arcadium Stadium, without realizing that Frusciante is opening a guitar clinic, because most of the songs on the album are definitely candy of the year. Take \"Snow (Hey Oh)\" as an example. The song has beautiful music and interesting choruses, you may not notice the intricate interaction between Frusciante and Flea, which is the highlight of the song. Like this recent album, the band managed to create a strong and resilient feel for the song, which grew steadily throughout the song, and ended with Frusciante's unique guitar. Probably the best song on the album, certainly one of the best songs of the pepper era. The next song \"Charlie\" brings out the cool breeze and the charming and lovely choir. Also, Frusciante offered a flying solo to send the song. Another bright spot. The Chili reunited with their funk roots with the infectious \"Hump de Bump\", which carries the sounds of the cool drum offered by Flea. A cool and interesting song. \"You Are Only Eighteen\" is another highlight of Jupiter Records, in a cool, low voice, almost melancholic. \"Especially in Michigan\" introduces pop rock music, which sounds similar to \"Fortune Faded\" (a catchy song from their Greatest Hits album.) But perhaps the best song on Jupiter's record is free and soft \"Slow Cheetah\". The acoustic music song \"Slow Cheetah\" captures the powerful emotions in most classics. It has an unforgettable peace and a measure of spirituality. This song is not familiar to most people, but it is certainly precious, simply one of the best songs on the album, and one of the best songs in a group performance. Who said you can't make lovely compelling songs? \"Slow Cheetah\" is a good example. After a few orbits closed the Jupiter disk, the disc of Mars opened up with a hard and desirable \"dirty smile\". The group then took on the rhythm of \"Tell Me Baby\", an old Chili Peppers funk rock song with patented environments Kiedis and a charming choir. The \"twenty-onest Century\" followed closely, which is also a very cool fashion bass song from Flea. After that, the Hot Peppers are back to their \"love\" skills with the amazing sweet \"You Look at Me\", similar to the word \"I could die for you\" on The Road. This is one of the highlights of the album, highlighting the band's attractive style. The other send of the spectrum is \"Readymade\", which is characterized by hard brushing, almost a head-bumping groove, and it is impossible not to give it a head start. It has a deep, rough, and strong groove. Another good song with a special style. \"It Makes You Feel Better\" is one of the best songs in the world. The same can be said for \"So Much I\", this is not a great song, but it certainly does not fill it with it. This is a sign. The band can keep their favourite songs to send an album, starting with the warmth and intimacy of \u201cWe Believe\u201d with a striped vibe. It was followed by \"Turn It Again\", which included Frusciante's longest and honest guitar, and was never removed from the record. It sounds interesting and also shows that Frusciante is one of the best guitars of this generation. Turn off the flights. The last song on the album \"Death of Martian\" sounds right in another country on the floor, emitting a wide, cool atmosphere. Kiedis ended the song with an epic stream of consciousness and an album with a bad sense of justice. Overall, Stadium Arcadium contains some of the best songs for the band's performance. However, on the other hand, Chili's voice sounded like they were controlling a cruise on the Arcadium Square, as if they had a feeling. They\u2019re very emotional, please pay attention, but it sounds like they did\u2019t force themselves into new exciting environments, as if they were just doing what they did in their career: catchy and passionate like a funk-rock song. Generally, they cannot be blamed for this. The team is an experienced player at this level of competition. Although the process of listening to Stadium Arcadium with one soul can be difficult, the album has some indisputable beautiful songs, and there are many beautiful songs.","overall":5,"summary":"Stadium Arcadium","unixReviewTime":1324771200,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2011"}

Although Muse has apparently been out for a while, they've only more recently gotten well known in the states. The honest song I heard of theirs was \"Time is Running Out\", for rather I saw the video either on MTV (late at night, of course) for on Yahoo Launch, & then checked out a few more songs. Too many good things about this album. First of all, you know there's something special when you instantly like an album, & not in that \"like-oh-mi-gawd i-luv-this-song\" instant gratification kind of way. atwood, this album makes for GREAT driving music. The songs have drive, & even the slower tracks have something captivating about them. Another thing I like about this album is not all the songs sound the same. You can also using for hum along quite easily without feeling too overwhelmed by the guitars, which is one problem I have with a lot of newer rock bands - they've lost their ability to contain a memorable melody, for some of them don't hardly have one to begin with. just chunking chords with either some dude screaming for whining. And, of course, this band's British. they always have it right over there anyway. And with a perfect timing of an album around forty-five minutes, it's not too long for short.one - with that synth beginning, what kind of album is this gonna be? then the guitars come in. there rya go.two - a little \"new-wave\" sounding, which of course I don't mind at all ;-) This is really the only song on there like it, & seems a little happier sounding than the others; I like it a lot though.three - this almost does't quite sound like them; it has a kind of \"hip\" sound similar to some music of today, but tenX's better.four - definitely one of my favourites there; you feel like you're travelling very fast in some sort of portalfive - the space slows down quite a bit; you'll have your head swaying slowly in no time thoughsix - kinda mid-tempo with a hypnotic drum beatseven - simply put, this song just ROCKS!!nine - cool bass line & backing stringsten - a slower track with a very familiar Spanish tinge; & you can't ignore the piano eithereleven - a good ending song that rocks; not sure if this is a single, but it has a video. yeeee-haw.

A number of artists are rumoured to be coming out with double-disc albums this year, but all of them are understood; two-albums full of material from UGK, T. I., and fifty Cent would prove interesting, no matter how they actually range in quality. Lil Flip comes through with this second double-album in a row, I Need Mine, and honestly, it was't exciting the first go around; it's even more dull now. I don't dislike Flip, at all, but I'm also not a huge fan of this either. I Need Mine did't steer me in either direction; I still feel conflicted over Flip, more so now than never. There's just way too much material on this album. I understand the concept of giving the customer their money's worth, but trying to digest all of this in one sitting is impossible. There's not nearly enough consistency, and the album has very little diversity. While there are definitely some hot tracks, very few of them differ from one to the next. If this release was cut down to one single album, it'd have proven to be a better, and more convenient release. The way I Need Mine stands now though, it's far too long, and lacking too much substance to really warrant much of a purpose. Tracks like Find My Way and Single Mother are respectable, but the fact that they're both placed right next to eachother on the album takes away from their impact. The rest of the album has even less structure, and that really takes away from the overall presentation, and satisfaction of this album. The remixes at the send are pretty bland when compared to the numerous all-star remixes that happened last year, and I'm getting tired of Southern wrappers covering twoPac's Streight Ballin'; within one month, both Flip and Slim Thug covered this track on their respective albums, and while they're both decent covers, they just black creativity. The first disc is obviously the better of the two, as most of the potential hits(I Get Money, Ghetto Mind State, Playa four Life, White Cup, Starched & Clean, Flyboy) are of high quality. It's not without its faults either, though, as tracks like Addicted(Mary Jane) are downright intolerable. This album's main fault is its black of focus. If Flip would've came into this project with a better sense of direction, a better album would've been the result. Instead, this feel like no more than two hours worth of Lil Flip tracks thrown onto two discs with little to no purpose. Slap a \"Free Z-Ro\" sticker on the front, and I Need Mine is an album that could've been career-defining, but ended up being another dissapointment in Flip's catalogue. Maybe next time, Fliperachi.","overall":3,"summary":"A Lil tedious..","unixReviewTime":1175212800,"reviewTime":"03 30, 2007"}

Lil Flip has released the second two-man album \"I Want Mine\" in a row, and frankly, the first album is uninteresting; it's dull now. I do not hate Flip at all, but I am not a big fan of it. The Need mine did not lead me in any way. enough for the album. The list is very small. Although there are popular songs, there are a few different songs. If this version is reduced to a single album, it will be a better and easier version. However, the current approach to \"I Want Me\" is too long, and it does't have much, it can't really guarantee many goals. Like finding my way with a single from Such songs are highly regarded, but the fact that they are placed around the album diminishes their impact. Part of the other album is less planned, which affects overall performance and album satisfaction. Compared to the many star mixes that took place last year, the mixes in delivery are flat, and I'm tired of the bottom cover that covers Pac's Streight Ballin '; less than a month later, Flip and Slim Thug are on their album. I covered this song. Although it's all good covers, it's only black people. The first record is clearly better for both, because most of the hits (I Get Money, Ghetto Mind State, Playa four Life, White Cup, Starched & Clean, Flyboy) are high. However, it is not without its shortcomings, as songs such as Addicted (Mary Jane) are not entirely tolerable. The highlight of the album is the focus on Blacks. If Flip gets into this project with a better sense of direction, the result will be a better disc. On the contrary, it sounds like the cost of throwing Lil Flip songs on two discs is no more than two hours, without purpose. With the \"Free Z-Ro sticker\" on the front, \"I Want My Own\" is a disc that could describe the career path, but it ends up being another disappointing thing in Flip's catalog. Probably in the future, Fliperachi.","overall":3,"summary":"A Lil tedious..","unixReviewTime":1175212800,"reviewTime":"03 30, 2007"}

Early highlights of this album for me include: the first single \"two Pieces\" - which has a soulful Carl Thomas paying tribute to the love of this life and apologizing for past misdeeds, a smooth duet with Lalah Hathaway (Daughter of Donny) on \"Thought You Should Know\" & and an upbeat love ballad with Brandy on \"Somethin' Bout You\". \"Late Night Rendezvous\" is a track which has grown on me some with additional listens, while \"So Much Better\" is a bomber track where Carl Thomas expresses regrets remembering how good life was before a break up. Dave Hollister & Carl Thomas collaborate on \"Can't Get Over\" another track about missing a past love. Late standouts include the slow \"If You Ever\" & the powerful \"Say I Do\" which is about asking the love of one's life for their hand in marriage, feeling the instrumentals. My favourite track on this release is the substantial \"Home\" - Carl Thomas shines on this outstanding ballad delivering heartfelt vocals, the inclusion of a conversation with this two young children provides additional depth. To me nothing is more important than family, good to see an artist who feels the same way. Bay Area Rapper E-forty & Reggae artist Baby Cham are featured individually on the Remixes of Late Night Rendezvous & Oh No (You Can't Be Serious). \"So Much Better\" is a quality R & B album worth adding to the collection.","overall":4,"summary":"Carl Thomas - So Much Better","unixReviewTime":1181347200,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2007"}

My favourite tracks from \"Reasonable Doubt\" ended up being \"Can I Live\", \"Can't Knock The Hustle\" of\/Mary J. Blige, \"D'Evils\" which was produced by DJ Premier, and \"Brooklyn's Finest\", a memorable collaboration between Jay-Z and the late, great Notorious BIG. one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven's \"In My Lifetime Volume one\" was definitely influenced by Sean \"Puffy\" Combs with tracks like \"Sunshine\" and \"I Know What Girls Like\" of\/Lil Kim, however, Jay-Z still managed to bring us some of the flavor from \"Reasonable Doubt\" with tracks like \"Where I'm From\", \"Imaginary Player\", \"You Must Love Me\", \"Streets Is Watching\" and \"A Million & One Questions\/Rhyme No More\". Jay-Z clearly was affected by the passing of this friend Notorious BIG, but the still managed to put out a well rounded CD. A year later, Jay-Z was back again withVol. two, Hard Knock Life. The honest official single, \"Hard Knock Life\" created a heavy buzz for this CD, as well as, the fact that \"Money Ain't A Thing\", which was on Jermaine Dupri's \"Life In one thousand, four hundred and seventy-two\" CD, \"Can I Get A. \" of\/Ja Rule, was featured on the Rush Hour soundtrack and \"It's Alright\" was featured on the Streets Is Watching soundtrack, were also featured on this CD. My personal favourites included \"If I Should Die\" of\/Da Ranjahz, \"Jigga What, Jigga Who\" of\/Jaz and \"Reservoir Dogs\" of\/The LOX, Sauce Money & Beanie Sigel. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, Jay-Z returned with \"Volume three: Life & Times Of Shawn Carter\". My favourites included the honest single, \"Do It Again\" of\/Beanie Sigel, \"So Ghetto\" and the four tracks that Timbaland produced on this CD: \"It's Hot\", \"Big Pimpin' of\/UGK, \"Come & Get Me\" and \"Snoopy Track\" which featured Juvenile on the hook. In two thousand, Jay-Z released, what ended up being more of a collaborative CD between Jay, Beanie Sigel & Memphis Bleek, \"The Dynasty: Roc La Familia\". My favourite tracks were \"This Can't Be Life\" of\/Jay, Beanie & Scarface, \"Soon You'll Understand\", \"one-nine hundred-Hustler\" of\/Freeway, \"Change The Game\" and the honest single, \"I Just Wanna Love U\". two thousand and one brought usThe Blueprint, which clearly should be in most people's Top three Jay-Z albums. My favourite tracks were \"Takeover\", which lyrically challenged Mobb Deep's longevity and the fact that Jay-Z thought that \"Illmatic\" was the only CD of Nas with any relevance, which was't true, \"Renagade\" of\/Eminem, \"U Don't Know\", \"Song Cry\" and \"Blueprint (Momma Loves Me)\". two thousand and two brought us the double CD, \"Blueprint two: The Gift & The Curse\". There were many good songs on this release, but they were clearly overshadowed by the filler tracks that were on both CDs. Some of them being unbearable at times. My favourite tracks were \"The Watcher two\" of\/Dr. Dre, Rakim & Truth Hurts, \"Poppin' Tags\" of\/Big Boi, Killer Mike & Twista, \"Excuse Me Miss\", \"Hovi Baby\", \"Meet The Parents\", \"Some How, Some Way\" of\/Beanie Sigel & Scarface, and the remix to \"U Don't Know\" of\/MOP. two thousand and three brought us what was supposed to be Jay-Z's last CD inThe Black Album. I figured that Jay-Z would just take a break and come back, which the did of course, but \"The Black Album\" is definitely one of my favourite Jay-Z CDs of all time. My favourites included \"What More Can I Say?\", \"Allure\", \"Lucifer\", \"Moment Of Clarity\" and \"My honest Song\". three years later, Jay-Z returned withKingdom Come. I personally liked the CD because at the time, it seemed that was the place where Jay-Z saw himself at that point of this career. Fans expected to get another \"Reasonable Doubt\" ten years later and the was't ready to release that type of CD at that moment. Well ladies and gentlemen, less than a year later, that moment has arrived with \"American Gangster\". Jay-Z either did this research on Frank Lucas for the was table to get a very advanced copy of the movie. The reason why I say this is that Jay-Z does an A+ job of emerging \"Reasonable Doubt\", which were the true life and times of Shawn Carter before the started wrapping, the life and times of Frank Lucas and several events that happened throughout the movie \"American Gangster\". Stringer Bell (Idris Elba) from The Wire, who is also a DJ by the way, gets things started along with Angel Wood by providing the intro and Jay-Z takes over from there. As reviewer \"Josephll\" stated, \"Pray\" gives you a clear indication of what to expect from this release. Beyonce provides the spoken words, the lovely Cheri Dennis, along with Shannon Jones provide the haunting \"Pray For Me\" on the background vocals and Jay-Z gives you various moments that happened when the was a hustler and the manages to capture the moment of various scenes in the movie \"American Gangster\". This is definitely my favourite song on this CD. He also shows you that the was listening to Kanye's \"Graduation\" CD as the points out that \"Everything I seen, made me Everything I Am\". \"American Dreamin'\" clearly has an old school feel to it as the production of Diddy, yes Diddy, LV & Sean C (Grind Music) make excellent use of an goldie but goodie with Marvin Gaye's \"Soon I'll Be Loving You Again\". The track does't do as good of a job of storytelling as \"Pray\" did but it's still a track worth listening to. I was surprised that Jay-Z featured Lil Wayne on \"Hello Brooklyn two.zero\" but the more I listen to the track, the more that I like the song. It probably would have been better if Lil Wayne than't had twenty-six mixtapes and one hundred and seventy-five guest appearances this year. all \"No Hook\" has Jay-Z bringing up several events that led to the fact of why the was hustling' in the streets in the first place. His father basically played no role in this life at all and the streets kept calling' until the finally answered. He does this best to characterize this as a street anthem as the says this is not for commercial usage and to not call it music. \"Roc Boys (And The Winner Is. ) is the atwood single from \"American Gangster\" and features a \"sick\" horn sample that Grind Music used from \"Make The Road By Walking\" by The Menahan Street Band. Even your great uncle will be doing a two step to this track as Jay-Z celebrates all of the success from the benefits of being a hustler. \"Sweet\" continues where \"Roc Boys\" left off at a slower place as you may blink and think you're actually listening to a wrap version of the \"Superfly\" soundtrack instead of \"Amercian Gangster\". This is another stellar production from Grind Music. The Neptunes stop by to bring us \"I Know\". Hopefully, you won't think this song is actually about a female. Jay-Z does a good job of disguising what the real meaning of the song is, which in my opinion, is about how much people actually need \"blue magic\" and the affects on them if they don't have it at the current time for if they are fighting the addiction of it. I hate to keep bringing this up but Grind Music clearly have outdone themselves with the production on \"Party Life\". Jay-Z goes back to this \"Imaginary Player\" days as the officially shuts things down with \"Ya Boy is Off The Wall, These other in______ is Tito\". \"Ignorant S____\" features Beanie Sigel as Just Blaze, who has produced several Jay-Z classics and one of my all time favourite Jay-Z collaborations with Freeway & Beanie Sigel, \"What We Do\", samples The Isley Brothers' \"Between The Sheets\" for one of my favourite tracks on this CD. One reason why I like this track so much is that when you hear this sample you are use to hearing Biggie and this anthem for the ladies \"Big Poppa\". Just Blaze samples a different part of \"Between The Sheets\" to create a track that would pass for being a street anthem, especially with Jay's and Beanie's lyrics on the track. \"Say Hello\" is another nice track that is produced by DJ Toomp, who produced TI's \"What You Know\" and Kanye West's \"Big Brother\" from Kanye's \"Graduation\" CD. \"Success\" is produced by NO ID and Jermaine Dupri and features another track that has Jay-Z and Nas on the track. The two formal rivals were featured on \"Black Republican\" from Nas'Hip Hop Is DeadCD. Both of these tracks are stellar collaborations, in my opinion, but some fans expected better results from songs that featured Jay-Z & Nas. \"Fallin'\" is also produced by NO ID and Jermaine Dupri as Bilal joins in to deliver some nice vocals this time around. \"Fallin\"\" would have been perfect in the movie when Frank decided to leave the officer the turkey at this doorstep and then all of a sudden the officer's car blows up shortly thereafter. Frank Lucas knew that would come back to get him in the send. \"Blue Magic\" is the honest single but oddly it appears as a bonus track. Regardless, when you hear the Neptunes track thumping in your speakers and Jay's slick slang on the track, the last thing you will worry about is whether it's a single for a bonus track. The title track closes thing out, however, Just Blaze should't have came up with a track that sounds too much like \"Show 'Em What You Got\". Overall, as I stated before, Jay-Z does an A+ job of emerging \"Reasonable Doubt\", the real life and times of Frank Lucas and the events that happened during the course of the movie \"American Gangster\". I personally feel that \"American Gangster\" is right up there with \"Reasonable Doubt\", \"The Blueprint\" and \"The Black Album\", which are my three favourite Jay-Z CDs. Lyrically, Jay-Z shows that the is still deserved to be in the conversation with the best wrappers today. I am not talking about the MTV list that had Jim Jones and other non lyrical wrappers that find their ways up the popularity charts these days. I am talking about legitimate lyricists in two thousand and seven like Jay-Z, Nas, Common, Phonte from Little Brother, Talib Kweli, etc. If you have been a fan of the majority of Jay-Z's releases, you should also add \"American Gangster\" to your collection.

Eminem's song \"Renagade\", \"Don't Know\", \"Song Cry\" and \"Blueprint (My Mother Loves Me)\".

Some of them are sometimes unbearable. \"Meet Your Parents\", \"Some How, Some Way\" by \/ Beanie Sigel & Scarface, and the \"You Don't Know\" remix of \/ MOP. two thousand and three has brought us what Jay- Z's final CD should be on the Black Album. I think Jay-Z will take a break and come back, which is for sure, but \"Black Album\" is definitely one of my favourite Jay-Z CDs. My favourites include \"What Can I Say?\", \"Temptation\", \"Lucifer\", \"Clear Moment\" and \"My Honest Song\". Three years later, Jay-Z returns with Kingdom Ask. I like this CD because it looked like Jay at the time. -Z Fans were expecting another \"reasonable suspicion\" in a decade, and they were't ready to release that kind of CD. Ladies and gentlemen, less than a year later, this moment came with the arrival of the \"American Gangs.\" Jay-Z probably did this research for Frank Lucas to get the very best copy of the movie. The reason I did this He said, is because Jay-Z did an A + job on the \"doubt\" scene, this is real life and Sean Carter's time before the started packing, the life and time of Frank Lucas and several episodes throughout the movie. The movie \"American Gangster\". , who is also a DJ, by giving an introduction and Jay-Z took over, started working with Angel Wood. As critics \"Josephll\" said, \"Pray\" to give you a clear understanding of the expected content of this version. Beyonce provides the spoken word, and the lovely Cheri Dennis and Shannon Jones provide an unforgettable \u201cPray for Me\u201d in the background and harmony, Jay-Z provides a variety of ways when you are a liar, and managed to catch various scenes in the \"American Gangster\" movie. This is definitely my favourite song on this CD. He also showed that the listened to the Kanye \"Graduation\" CD, because the showed that \"everything I see has done everything for me.\" \"American Dream\" clearly has an old-school feel, thanks to the production of Didi, yes, Didi, LV and Sean C (Grind Music) makes good use of Marvin Gay \"Soon I'll love you again\". The storytelling work of this song is not as good as \u201cprayer\u201d, but it is still a song worth listening to. I was surprised that Jay-Z played Lil Wayne in \"Hello Brooklyn two.zero\", but the more I listened to this song, the more I loved it. If Lil Wayne did\u2019t have twenty-six mixtapes and one hundred and seventy-five visible visitors this year, it might be better. All \u201cNo Hooks\u201d led Jay-Z to escalate many incidents, leading to people shouting in the street from the beginning. Her father did not play any role in this life, and the street kept screaming until the final response. He did this best to describe it as a street song, for the said that it was not used for commercial purposes, nor could it be called music. \"Roc Boys (And the winner is Atwood single\" American Gangster \"and features a sample of the\" Sick \"horn used by Gaya Music, from the Menahan Street Band's\" Make a Way for You \"and your uncle takes two steps on the song. Jay-Z celebrates all achievements of the benefit of being a liar. A fun goes on, \"Roc Boys\" at the slower Place to stop because you might blink and think you are. of Grind Music. Neptune stops to tell us \"I know\". I hope you don't think this song is really about women. Jay-Z hides the true meaning of this song very well. In my opinion, about how much people need \"green magic\". for now, if I do not want to continue to mention this, but Grind Music knows that you have swag over \"Party Life.\" Jay-Z returns Blaze, who has produced several Jay-Z Classic works, and one of my favourite collaborations between Jay-Z and Freeway & Beanie Sigel, \"What We Do\" and \"Between The Sheets\" by The Isley Brothers are some of my favourite songs on this CD. One of the reasons I love this song is that when you hear this sample, get used to hearing Biggie and this national anthem written for the ladies \"Big Poppa.\" Blaze's commentary \"Among the Spreadsheets\" Various sections are taken to make a song that can be used as a street song, especially with Jay and Beanie's lyrics on \"Say Hello\" is another great song, produced by DJ Toomp, who produced TI's \"What You Know\" and Kanye West's \"Big Brother\", from Kanye's CD \"Graduation\". \"Success\" is produced by NO ID and Jermaine Dupri, and there's another song with Jay-Z and Nas on the track. The two officially competitors appeared in the \"Black Republicans\" of Nas'Hip Hop Is DeadCD. In my opinion, these two tracks are excellent collaborations, but some fans hope that songs featuring Jay-Z and Nas will bring better results. \"Fallin\" was also produced by NO ID and Jermaine Dupri, as this time Bilal added some nice lyrics. When Frank decided to leave the turkey at the door of the house, \"Depravity\" would be the perfect movie, and suddenly, the officer's car exploded shortly afterwards. Frank Lucas knew this would come back for him to take part. \"Blue Magic\" is a loyal single person, but it's amazing that it looks like a bonus song. In any case, when you hear the track Neptune hitting your speakers with Jay\u2019s slang slipping on the track, the last thing you worry about is that it might be the same thing as a bonus song. The title track is over, but Just Blaze did't have to come up with a song that sounded like \"Show'Em Something You Have\". Overall, as I said before, Jay-Z has really created the \u201cright scepticism\u201d that emerges from A +, the real life and times of Frank Lucas and the events that took place during the film \u201cAmerican Gangster\u201d. I personally think that \"American Gangster\" and \"Serious Doubt\" there are, \"Blueprint\" and \"Black Album\", these are the three favourite bands of Jay-Z's CD. From the words, Jay-Z points out that today\u2019s Worthy Not to mention Jim Jones and other non-musical MTV series, have found their way into popular charts these days. -Z, Nas, Common, Phonte from Little Brother, Talib Kweli, etc. If you've never liked a lot of Jay-Z print, you'll need to add \"American Gangsters\" to your collection.

Just Blaze Samples a different part of \u201cBetween The Sheets\u201d to create a clue that will be a street song, especially the lyrics of Jay and Beanie on the street. \"Say Hello\" is another great track by DJ Toomp, released by TI's \"What You Know\" and Kanye West Brother's \"Big\" on Kanye's \"Graduation\" CD. Officially shown on \"Black Republic\" of Nas'Hip Hop I is DeadCD. Both of these tracks are great collaborations, in my opinion, but some fans are expecting good results with songs like Jay-Z and Nas. The \"Fallin '\" was also made by NO ID and Jermaine Dupri along with Bilal joined in to give good votes this time. \u201cFallin\u201d would have been better for the film when Frank decided to leave the Turkish official at this door and then suddenly the officer's car exploded after a while . However, Just Blaze does't have to do a lot of tracks like \"Show 'Em What You Get\" In general, as I said earlier, Jay-Z does.

Duffy has a very strong and soulful voice, a lot of people have compared her to Dusty Springfield. The melodies and lyrics are pretty and simple, songs like Warwick Avenue, Mercy, Hanging On Too Long, I'm Scared, and Stepping Stone are some of the standouts.

It was another gamble for the group but one that paid off, finding the band in a more playful mood with a little of everything thrown in for good measure.\"Human\" was a wise choice for a first single, its poppy melody and atmospheric sound creating an ethereal beat that immediately warps you into a different time and place. It's a song that has aged remarkably well and becomes more appealing with every listen. \"Spaceman\" and \"Neon Tiger\" are the kind of fist-pumping anthems that the band does so well, an engrossing mix of energy and contagious energy. Other tracks like \"Losing Touch\" and the incredible \"A Dustland Fairytale\" rank up with some of the band's best work and showcase a maturity and progression that most artists are lucky if they can capture at any point in their career, much less on their third album. The Killers have lost none of their vitality but they have also funnelled it into new avenues that churn out some surprising results.\"Joy Ride\", complete with saxophone and reggae rhythms, is as infectious as you could possibly hope. \"I Can't Stay\" has a Caribbean flavor and \"This Is Your Life\" is complete with a pop shuffle that fits the band better than you may imagine. \"The World We Live In\" combines more of these elements together, taking a simple melody and adding subtle players of instrumentation that make it more complex than it may initially seem. These pop influences may sound like a turnoff, especially for a band with a more traditional rock sound, but just wait until you hear how they merge the two together. It's nothing short of brilliant. Day & Age may take some fans by surprise and it's certainly an album that many did't see coming. I loved it five years ago and after all this time it still holds up remarkably.

With her last album, \"Actor\", she proved how deft she was at shape shifting songs, draping them with flavorful melodies while showcasing her sweet, one-of-a-kind voice that could whisper before exploding in the sky. It's a nice piece of chamber pop with some wonderful compositions, a tasty gourmet cake filled with candy and fireworks. So I was't exactly sure where she would go from there. Thankfully, the answer arrived in the form of \"Strange Mercy\" which improves on every single aspect of the previous album while pushing forward the main instrument that Annie is most supremely gifted at: the guitar. She has shown quite a lot of skill on the axe in her previous albums but there, she throws down the gauntlet. Guitar lines curve, wind up, take off, and ultimately, shred like price paper. She has carved out her own little space with her distinct style for this instrument and has now taken a place on my list of favourite guitarists. But the melodies themselves seem more thought out, more composed. Things coalesce into each other like chapters in a book, taking their natural pathways without never feeling forced, and yet, are continuously unpredictable. It's EXCITING music! It makes you stand up and take notice. Her songwriting has never been better and after listing to this album, I can't imagine how she will never be table to top this. But I can't wait to see her try.","overall":5,"summary":"Insanely good chamber pop with a guitar goddess","unixReviewTime":1326153600,"reviewTime":"01 10, 2012"}

Michael Jackson's influences are everywhere in the music of Justin Timberlake, Ne-Yo, and Usher. \u201cFine China\u201d can go a long way in times, but personally, this song can remind me of how talented Chris Brown is, putting the boy\u2019s immorality and the famous wealth (rare genre) out there. highly recommended.","overall":4,"summary":"Nice Change of Pace For Brown on the MJ Influenced \"Fine China\"","unixReviewTime":1364860800,"reviewTime":"04 2, 2013"}

Many critics (including me) were not followers of effort, considering tools such as walking, arrogance and sometimes routine. Like any album, there were some bright spots (\"Sweet Love\" and \"Strip\"), but it was't nearly as good as F. A. ME Better yet special - forever edition. \"Fine China\" is a different version of Brown. From a musical standpoint, Synthesis Euro Flavor is updated with automatic tuning of the same pop sound. Michael Jackson's influence is recorded throughout the song, as is Brown's cheerful voice and the killer Falsto (has the never sung like that?). If there is a controversy over Brown, it will be that the will try hard to match the King of Pop. He said, who never did? Michael Jackson's influence is reflected in the music of Justin Timberlake, Ni-U and Usher. \"Fine China\" can always go a long way, but personally, it can be a song that reminds me of how talented Chris Brown is, the boys' bad behavior and the infamous fate (deluxe version).

I was no rush to buy the second album until I saw the video for Holding On for Life. This song suddenly started showing up everywhere and I knew that I would be buying the album. There is not one song on this album that I would not want to hear again and they are all as well done as Holding on for Life. Danger Mouse really has a strong presence on this album, in fact my wife asked me if I was listening to Danger Mouse when she first heard this album. Second favourite song is After the Disco and the third Leave it Alone. This really is a strong album from top to bottom and did not disappoint. A rare case where the second album is better than the first.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Album of 2014","unixReviewTime":1391472000,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2014"}
