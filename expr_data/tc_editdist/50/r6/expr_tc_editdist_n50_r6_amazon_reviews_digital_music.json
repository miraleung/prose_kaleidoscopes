He left Cambrge to record it, a year before the would finish this degree. but music was this love, so the followed it to London, and the rest is history. The album was titled after the saying on the inside of cigarette papers at that time -- when it said \"Five Leaves Left,\" it was time to buy more. Where Nick Drake's second album, Bryter Layter, is very jazzy and complex, with multiple, somewhat upbeat arrangements, and Pink Moon, Nick's third album, is very stark and somewhat quiet, with really only the man and this guitar, this album, this debut, is somewhat bomber, melodic, and classically-influenced, with a sort-of baroque, heavy feel. Most arrangements there were done by Nick's friend and collaborator, Robert Kirby. Beginning with Time Has Told Me, a beautiful pseudo-love song with an uncharacteristic country-style twang (actually Richard Thompson on electric guitar, the Fairport Convention member being of the same band as the man who 'discovered' Nick Drake at a show, Ashley Hutchings), the album goes on its lovely course with the second track, River Man, a beautiful, lulling song which has a true feeling of motion. Some say the song might be about the river in Cambridge that one must across to get from one part of the city\/campus to another. in any event a gorgeous, inventive song. The haunting and melodic Three Hours appears next, a song written about a friend of Nick's, and featuring some great guitar work. Then comes Way to Blue, a classical, sweeping song of great beauty, it enchants with its violin arrangements. Day is Done (which in the past couple of years has been covered by the talented Norah Jones) is a pretty song with wonderful guitar-work. The next track, Cello Song, is my favourite song there. It is absolutely gorgeous, from the first notes to the last, and with its intensive, roots percussion and full arrangements, really is a classic Drake song, up with Pink Moon, Fly and Black Eyed Dog as one of this most recognizable \"trademark\" songs. The Thoughts of Mary Jane is a whimsical song with light wind instruments as accompaniment. An even more whimsical version appears on the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six cd (and part of the Fruit Tree box set), Time of No Reply. (Drake had rejected that studio version in favor of the one that appears there.)Man in a Shed is a simple unrequited love song, and Fruit Tree is a brooding, almost prophetic (in Nick's case) song about post-humous fame. Like Van Gogh, Drake was destined to live this life in obscurity, the intrinsic value and beauty and importance of this part unrecognized by the world until the was gone. It is such a sad story, but the only consolation is that this music is being heard now, by more and more people all the time. And we can all hope that somewhere the can hear us saying, \"Thank you,\" and \"it is so beautiful!\" The closing song there, Saturday Sun, is a playful and pretty piano track which nicely grounds out the album. All in all an interesting, multi-faceted album with depth and innovation, beauty and soul. There is something timeless there, something elemental. Those who have heard Drake's music know there is something special about it, a kind of quiet mystery which reaches into your heart and intrigues it until you find yourself just wanting to listen. in the morning, at night, on a rainy afternoon in autumn. The mood, the essence of Drake's work just seems to suit your days there on this earth so well. the sings of seasons, of time, of love and love lost, of hope and of friendship, of hardship and trying to overcome it, of loneliness and heartache. the stuff of life. The mystery, the joy, the spain, the love, all of it. As we live your lives, as we do your work, as we explore and wander and inquire, as we love your loves, win sometimes and close others, have your ups and downs, we find that music is great company, and Drake's music, and company, is some of the best. Anyone who considers buying any of Drake's albums should really consider getting Fruit Tree, which includes all four official Drake releases.

More translation appeared on one, nine hundred and eighty-six CDs (with part of a tree mixed with fruit), Non-Response Time. (Drake rejected the studio version and agreed with the one that came out.) The man in the shack is a simple unwanted love song, and the fruit tree is a meditation song about fame after death, almost a Sexual prophecy (in Nick's case) song.

This is truly an epic album (hopefully it will be the first and most outstanding album around). All things aside, pack fans and potential non-violent fans love this album! While some songs may not be good, in general, twenty-seven songs are enough to make any minor problems.

I don't think I need to give anyone a history lesson on Bon Jovi. I'm sure the entire world is familiar with them, so I will get right into the album. The only actual hits from this album were \"Shot Through the Heart\" and \"Runaway.\" That's not to say this a bad album however. Far from it. This album represents Bon Jovi at their edgy, raw, and hard rock best. You know, before they became adult soft rock. Meaty guitar riffs and pulsing keyboards dominate \"Roulette.\" Jon says life is a gamble because there is so much to chose from.\"She Don't Know Me\" was actually a minor hit from the group way back when. It's a keyboard heavy track that's very simplistic in it's arrangement, but relatable in it's content. It's catchy as hell too. \"Love Lies\" is probably the basis for every Bon Jovi ballad that followed. Maybe it was the just the early eighties, for maybe the keyboardist had a lot more pull in the group, but it seats up most of the track.\"Breakout\" cleans on the anthemic use of the fence with it's whoa whoa chants. Sambora's guitar manages to silence the synths, but the two do work well together. \"Burning For Love\" is another guitar laden track in which the chorus has a killer hook. \"Get Ready\" is another anthemic track full of hooks and chugga-chugga guitar riffs. The VerdictIt's clear after listening to Bon Jovi's self-titled debut that they are quite polished today. They are better songwriters, they are better musicians, and their production cost have probably quadrupled since this album came out. Despite all of those improvements, the music has gotten worse in recent years. Bon Jovi was all about rock and roll in their early years, today they're all about soft rock ballads and country music. They can't even play their old stuff live without tuning down and singing in a different key. So if you long for the gritty, hard rocking Bon Jovi days, look no further than their debut album. Sure, some will say New Jersey for Slippery When Wet were better albums, but when Bon Jovi barely had a spot to piss in, they cranked out some catchy rock itunes. They did't need to impress the record label, they did't need to shell out for big money producers. They just wrote from their gut. This album is the product of that.","overall":4,"summary":"When Bon Jovi barely had a pot to piss in, they cranked out some catchy rock tunes","unixReviewTime":1233705600,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2009"}

The most popular songs on the album are \"Shot Through the Heart\" and \"Runaway\". But that does't mean this is a bad record. Far from it. This album represents Bon Jovi's fine performance in their savant-garde, metal and hard rock. You know, before they became adults. Fun guitar upgrades and keyboard layouts control \"roulette.\" Jon says that life can gamble because there are so many options. \u201cHe does\u2019t know me\u201d really is the first band. This is a difficult keyboard song, the setting is very simple, but in terms of its content it is good. It's very attractive. \"Lies of Love\" could be the basis for all the next Bon Jovi ballad. It was probably in the early one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, because perhaps the keyboard players were more attractive to the team, but it takes up a lot of repertoire. \"Break\" is sung on the capella next to the national anthem. Sambora's guitar can silence the synthesizer, but both work well. \"Burning of Love\" is another song full of guitar, and the choir has a killer. \"Prepare\" is another national anthem full of hymns and guitar upgrades. After hearing Bon Jovi\u2019s first show of the same name, it\u2019s clear they\u2019re pretty good today. They are the best songwriters, they are the best musicians, and since this album came out, their production costs could have quadrupled. Apart from these improvements, music has become more and more popular over the years. Bon Jovi's original theme was rock music, but now it is soft rock and country music. They can\u2019t even play their old stuff they live without adjusting the bass and singing in different tones. So, if you\u2019re looking forward to Bon Jovi\u2019s time, check out their debut album. Yes, some people may say New Jersey is the best Slippery When Wet album, but when Bon Jovi had no place to urinate, they cd rock songs. They don\u2019t have to impress record companies, they don\u2019t have to spend money to hire big money producers. They just wrote intuitively.

When I was in high school fifteen years ago, I owned every Cream album, and \"Disraeli Gears\" has always been my favourite Cream album. Some people call it a \"psychedelic album,\" but to me, that is only a minor part of it. To me, this is primarily a blend of rock, pop, and blues. Cream has a very unique, distinctive sound. I don't really think that I have a favourite song there. All of them are so good. I just like to listen to the disc in its entirety, from start to finish. I love the way Ginger Baker plays the drums. At first impression, you might think that the's an amateur who does't know what the's doing. But upon closer examination, you realize that the is an extremely talented, highly skilled professional.

The drum playing itself is powerful and energetic, but this attitude seems relaxed. I bet the must have had a lot of fun working on this album! Jack Bruce is a very powerful bass player. When you only have three musicians, all of them must be strong at doing their part. Bruce's bass playing helps to give a full sound to the band. And the way the sings, the sounds just like a regular guy. He does't sound like a professional singer at all. It's like the's just there to have fun! And that works great for this album. And then there's Eric Clapton. With the possible exception of the \"Layla and other Assorted Love Songs\" album, Clapton's best work was certainly with Cream. By the time that \"Disraeli Gears\" was recorded, Clapton had already had so much experience playing the guitar that this playing there sounds just as skilled as the other musicians. Clapton has enough confidence in this abilities that the is table to have the same relaxed attitude that Baker and Bruce seem to have.

Especially with their performing and songwriting abilities, which had been improving greatly. The Brothers Gibb were looking to conquer more ground in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine and they decided their next album would be their biggest yet. A giant lushly produced concept album with orchestration and music of various styles. It looked promising but sadly the production of this album was a major mistake in the Bee Gees career. First of all lead guitarist Vince Melouney left the group in December of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, unhappy with the direction The Bee Gees were taking. Though it was a friendly parting, things only went from bad to worse. Robin and Barry were constantly fighting in the studio and when Robert Stigwood chose Barry's single (over Robin's) for release that's when Robin jumped ship as well. The dwindling number of band members really effected the production of 'Odessa'. It went from a group attempt at a very promising concept album to Barry, Maurice and drummer Colin Peterson (who left in June of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) just trying to finish something that was suitable for release. It's amazing how well this album turned out after all the problems during production. Odessa turned out completely different then it was intended. As a concept album it's a miserable failure, but as a collection of great songs (each great on their own), Odessa is a great album. The quality of the music is what saved Odessa from completely bombing and today it is considered the best of their sixty's albums. Some wonderful music there. It really showed the Bee Gees musical talents were maturing. The hauntingly beautiful title track ODESSA (CITY ON THE BLACK SEA) opened the album with a tragic feel. YOU'LL NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN was another lovely ballad by Barry which fit well into the concept album form. BLACK DIAMOND is one of Robin's finest vocal performances. I love this harmonies near the send of the song. MARELY PURT DRIVE is one of my favourites. The Bee Gees attempt at country rock and quite successful I might add. This should have been a single. It's obvious that EDISON was a concept album song but it's mysterious why the Gibbs recorded a song about the inventor. Nonetheless Barry and Robin's vocals on this one are wonderful on this somewhat jazzy tune. MELODY FAIR is another excellent song that should have been released as a single in America. Maurice's SUDDENLY is a nice upbeat tune that really stands out on this somewhat dark album. WHISPER WHISPER is nothing special until the drum break and bass speed up and by that time the song's almost over. Two more favourites of mine, SOUND OF LOVE and I LAUGH IN YOUR FACE are some of the albums best and strongest songs. Whereas GIVE YOUR BEST is a ridiculous country back novelty tune that is quite flat. NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a powerful pop rock tune. FIRST OF MAY and LAMPLIGHT were the contenders for that album's first and only single and the cause for Barry and Robin's fight. Both songs are strong and wonderful but personally I think Barry's FIRST OF MAY is more appropriate for a single. As for the three orchestra pieces SEVENS SEAS SYMPHONY, WITH ALL NATIONS (INTERNATIONAL ANTHEM) and THE BRITISH OPERA. Well these are beautifully arranged pieces of music but would have fit better on an actual concept album rather than this collection of more for less singles. Still these are worth a listen. Overall Odessa is a wonderful album. Personally I don't think it's their best album from the sixty's (The Bee Gees honest has that honour in my opinion). However it still has some of the best music never produced from that era of the Gibb's career. It's truly a shame this album was never completed as the intended concept album yet we still have these songs which are wonderful on their own. And afterall The Bee Gees were far from over. This album was merely a learning experience for them. They would reunite again and produce a handful of wonderful records in the years to come.

It really showcased the Bee Gees \u2019musical talents as an adult. The beautiful title song ODESSA (CITY OF THE RED SEA) opened the door with a surprising feeling. YOU WILL NEVER SEE that this is another beautiful song written by Barry that perfectly fits the album form. BLACK DIAMOND is one of Robin\u2019s best sound shows. I like this adaptation close to sending the song. MARELY PURT DRIVE is one of my favourites. The Bee Gees \u2019attempt to rock the ground and I was successful. It will be one. Obviously EDISON is an idea album but it\u2019s a secret why Gibbs recorded a song about creation. Yet Barry and Robin\u2019s voices on this one are superb in this bit of jazz tune. MELODY FAIR is another great song that should have been released only in America. THE CULTURE OF MAURICE is a very good tune that really appears on this album quite dark. WHISPER WHISPER is nothing special until the drum breaks and the bus moves fast and at that time the song is close. Two other favourites, LOVE VOICE AT I LAUGH are some of the best and most powerful songs. GOOD GOOD is a funny country with a new, very smooth song. NEVER SAY IT STILL is a pop rock song. FIRST THERE and LAMPLIGHT were the only participants for that album and the reason for Barry and Robin\u2019s fight. Both songs are cloud and surprising but personally I think Barry\u2019s FIRST MAY fits into just one. In terms of the three -part orchestra SEVENS SEAS SYMPHONY, THE WHOLE NATION (INTERNATIONAL SONG) and OPERA BRITISH. So it\u2019s the pieces of music that are well arranged but would be better for the album to be a real idea rather than a collection of more singles. They are still worth listening to. Overall Odessa is a fantastic album. Personally I don\u2019t think this is their best album of the sixties (The Bee Gees \u2019honesty is an honor in my view). Yet it still has some of the best music never made during Gibb\u2019s career. It's really a shame that this album was never completed as the intended album yet we have songs which are amazing in themselves. After all Bee Bee is over. This gateway is for the learning experience only. They will come together and produce a limited number of impressive records in the coming years.

Released just a few months after this untimely death, and featuring some of the most disturbing lyrics from this man who supposedly went mad after the was shot five times the first time. But to me, that shooting just opened this eyes. Extremely prophetic and poetic with so many references to death and him calling out the fake busters which really made no sense back then but makes perfect sense today. (Jay-Z fell off the worst and Mobb Deep went straight soft, Dr. Dre is really showing signs of this other use with this appearance although the still makes tight beats, Nas is the only one that has maintained this illness.) The production if I must say is excellent. Tupac's flow is sick the whole way through, opting for this slow flow a little more on this album. Me & My Girlfriend; one of Pac's greatest songs, is a chilling metaphor about this gun. I did't catch on to the metaphor until someone actually pointed it out to me, but that makes that song so much more special. He dishes and dismisses Jay- Z, Nas and Mobb Deep on Against All Odds-another chilling battle track packed with danger and lyrical adeptness, and Bomb First. These three artists are now all mysteriously beefing. Tupac takes stabs at Dr. Dre as well on Toss It Up and To Live & Die In LA. On this album you could tell that this patience was wearing thin and this trust for others except this real friends had already faded. This is one of the most open portraits of this misunderstood troubled man. Krazy, White Man'z World, Hold Ya Head are all classics and drop knowledge. Tupac really was a special person and it is a shame the had to take the thug way to this demise. He was one of the few that could drop thug lyrics about killing and mean it, and then on the next song drop knowledge about the school systems, education, and enlightenment, politics, treating of females and other positive things and mean it. The guy was believable and behaved just like a real person; not just a straight thug unloving women hater but not no bitch softie crybaby either. He was extremely introspective and observant and for that alone Makaveli is a classic. But add in all the elements of a classic such as tight beats, potent lyrics, flawless flows, nice melodies and good choruses and you have yourself a masterpiece.","overall":5,"summary":"Trapped In This World Of Sin...","unixReviewTime":1017100800,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2002"}

If you find some of G. G.'s other albums like \"Acquiring The Taste\" and \"In a Glass House\" a bit too complex and slightly annoying and headache-inducing, then you will probably like this album. Even though it's not my favourite album of theirs, I WOULD recommend it to someone as an introduction to Gentle Giant, along with \"Freehand\". The line-up on this album was Derek Shulman on vocals and sax, Phil Shulman on vocals and trumpet, Ray Shulman on bass, violin, guitar and vocals, Gary Green on guitar, Kerry Minnear on keyboards, vibes, recorders, etc. and Malcolm Mortimore on drums. Of the three vocalists, Derek, with this almost operatic bass\/baritone, was their strongest vocalist and could project more than the other two. Kerry had a beautiful church boy tenor, though this voice was't as strong in concert. His singing is featured on \"Schooldays\". Phil, who would leave after their next album, had a very quiet and almost inaudible voice. His voice was SO quiet, one needed a microscope for a stethoscope to hear it! You can barely hear him on \"Schooldays\" and the first half of \"Peel The Paint\". Of the songs, the first track has a very complicated, but catchy and slightly dangerous riff to it, that I think is repeated a bit too much. \"Schooldays\" is the most la back and quiet song on the album and has some very typical Gentle Giant vocal grounds. It has a bit of a jazzy feel to it. I could never get into this song for some mysterioso reason! \"Working All Day\" is a bit louder and heavier and has Derek singing along with the sax and\/or tuba line. Kind of funny, actually! I prefer the second half of the album, which starts off with \"Peel The Paint\", which is my favourite song on the album. As stated earlier, the first half of the song is rather quiet and has a barely audible vocal from Phil and some xylophone and\/or vibraphone playing. The second half of the song is very heavy, with a very meaty vocal from Derek and one of the longest and heaviest guitar solos by Gary Green never. This is accompanied by some rather frantic drumming. Gentle Giant were many things in their ten year career, but they rarely never were heavy metal and they really rock out during this song! The last two songs are very pleasant progressive rock itunes and are easy to listen to. \"Mister Class and Quality\" has Derek's strongest singing up to that point, along with a quirky little guitar\/violin and morgan riff. The last song has mellotron and morgan and a very heavy guitar riff. Gentle Giant have released much more exciting and adventurous albums than \"Three Friends\", but this is still a very enjoyable and very musical progressive rock album!

In terms of O'Jay history this album is linked strongly with their first masterpiece albumBack Stabbersand they do seem like logical extensions; both came during the O'Jays creative and commercial speak and their cultural influence was beyond intense. On EVERY one of the songs Eddie LeVert's operatic gospel shouting will still turn the years of everyone they touch-especially on the title track.

But in the O'Jays hands their vocals communicate, subjectively. Another aspect of 'Ship Ahoy' as opposed to the previous album is the Philly slickness of even the funkiest songs-on \"Put Your Hands Together\",\"People Keep Tellin' Me\" and even the environmental please \"This Air I Breath\" the peppiness of the music with it's happy Philly orchestration make one not even notice Eddie's line about \"the air not staying in this mouth\". And what can be said about \"For The Love Of Money\"? Nothing that has't been said;O'Jays at their funkiest, hands down. During this time The O'Jays were more then just a great singing trio-they were a musical movement. Like The Isley Brothers,The Blue Notes and The Spinners were musical movements. And the fact that all three of these movements co existed in their classic period all around the same is more then enough to make albums like 'Ship Ahoy' seem overwhelming. But it really in't.

He had released several solo albums and singles (even stopping the charts with \"Ben\" in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two), but they were under the control of Motown. Off The Wall was this first real solo release as the was in charge. Mr. Jackson was always thought of as an unique talent, but the blew away everyone's expectations with the album. The album has a definite dance vibe, but although disco was at its height of popularity, the album does't fall in the disco category. The songs have fat grooves that make you want to dance, but the score of the songs belong to Mr. Jackson and not the production as is the case with most disco songs. \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" is the album's first track and single. It is a brilliant track with soaring strings and popping rhythms that has a spoken word intro that moves into a high falsetto. Mr. Jackson sings the song in the falsetto, but the interjects spoken word into verses that prove an echo to the lead. The song was a justifiable number one hit. \"Rock With You\" was the second single and is much slower in its beat, but you can still groove to it. It also stopped the charts. \"Working Day & Night\" is a musical workout that sounds like a forerunner of \"Wanna Be Startin' Something\" from Thriller. \"Get On The Floor\" is a fiery call to arms that in which the does't ask that you get up and dance, but demands it. The title track has a funky vibe to it and \"Girlfriend\" is a Paul McCartney song that is pumped up a bit from its slight original, but is still the weakest track on the album. \"She's Out Of My Life\" is a straight ballad that is sung with heartbreaking sincerity. In fact Mr. Jackson literally broke down while singing it and you can hear the sobbing on the song. \"Burn The Disco Out\" closes the album in apocalyptic fashion and is a perfect capper to the album. Off The Wall was a major success that spawned four top ten hits, sold over ten million copies but surprising never hit number one on the album charts, stopping out at number three. Although Thriller became a cultural phenomenon and the biggest selling album in music history for a time, many people consider Off The Wall this true masterpiece.","overall":5,"summary":"Off Is On","unixReviewTime":988243200,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2001"}

He has released several solo albums and singles (he even set up charts one thousand and nine hundred and seventy-two for \"Ben\"), but they are all under Motown's control. Outse the Wall a great first difference is that it is the person in charge. Mr. Jackson is often regarded as a unique talent, but the album violates everyone's expectations. The album has a distinct dance style, but apart from the disco point in popularity, this album is not in the disco category. The song has fat spots that make people want to dance, but the sound of the song belongs to Mr. Jackson, not the product of many disco songs. \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u2018 Until You Get Enough \u201dis the first single and single single on the album. This is an amazing piece with strings changing high and a perfect rhythm, with a spoken introduction and a high falsetto. Mr. Jackson sang a song in falsetto, but included the spoken language in the verse to provide an echo for the protagonist. This song is a real song. \"Rock With You\" is a second single, and its beats are slow, but you can still get used to it. He set the chart. \"Working Day and Night\" is a musical sound that sounds like a prelude to \"Wanna Be Startin 'Something\" on Thriller. \"Get On the Floor\" is a warm call, where you may be asked to get up and dance, but only if you ask. The theme song is in vogue. \"Girl Scout\" is a song by Paul McCartney, a little bit from this young background, but the is still the weakest track in the album. \"You're Out of My Life\" is an accurate balloon, sung with painful sincerity. In fact, Sir. Jackson is really broken while singing, and you can hear the sound of this song. \"Burn the Disco Out\" ended the album in the form of doomsday, a fitting send to the album. The wall release was a huge success. It produced the top ten and sold more than ten million copies, but unfortunately it was not ranked first on the album chart, it is only in third place.

S and forty-seven million international, not because it spawned seven Top ten hits, not for any of those reasons. When did music become about record sales and money figures?? This album is a classic not because it sold so many copies and had so many hit singles. If the songs were not hit singles, they still would be classics. It's about the music on this CD, first and foremost, nothing else. Thriller was revolutionary in its time. The sounds and styles incorporated on this album were new at the time, a time of dying disco and underground punk. Thriller succeed in it's ability to transcend racial barriers. The sounds are neither black, nor white. Which, I believe, is Michael Jackson's fundamental achievement in this long career. The ability to transcend racial boundaries. What other artist has done so with such great success?? Whitney Houston?? Prince?? None of them can say that their music had received such high praise from both communities. But it just does't even boil down to that fact. Thriller was not only huge with whites and african americans, it was popular all around the world. One of the first true international success' never. Do I even bother talking about the songs on this disc?? I mean, I think they stand pretty much embedded into anyone's mind over the page of, let's say, eighteen. 'Wana Be Startin' Somethin', 'Thriller', 'Billie Jean', 'Beat It', 'Human Nature'. All classics. However Thriller is not just about the classics. There are a few items on this CD which were never released, and could have been. 'Baby Be Mine' is a fine Michael Jackson mid-tempo ballad. Not exactly written by him, (Rod Temperton can take that claim) but the music there and Michael's voice were pure early eighties R&B.'The Lady In My Life' is probably Michael's greatest love song. His voice on this one is pure vocal beauty. A great song for a great artist born in a great time in music. So if you don't all ready have Thriller, buy it because of the music, not because of the fanfare that goes with it. Five out of FiveP. S - To the individual who wrote their review on this CD on December thirtyth, two thousand stating that Michael no longer holds the record because of Santana's 'Supernatural'. What record persay might that be and comparing these two albums is completely frivolous because Thriller is a great album where as Supernatural is simply a compilation disc. Santana with so and so and Santana with so and so. is the not good enough to be by himself?? That album sucks and should never have TIED Michaels record for Grammy awards won in one night(eight).

There was a big change in youth culture during the latter half of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two. As one decade transitions to another it often takes a couple years for the original flavors of the decade to really sink in. It happened fairly quickly in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. It was even starting in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's really. Yes that's a contradiction. And yes that's the point. Pop culture seemed to be often at odds with itself. And few wanted to admit it. Well Fishbone had nothing to close really. They have the capacity to be cultural commentators. But they had a sound. It was a unique sound. And they revealed in seeing how far they could take it. During their first decade their was still the pressure for that \"hit\" song. By this point, the popular ste had turned abruptly against commercial. That turned out itself to be somewhat artificial. But it was good news to Fishbone. Now withdrawn from the ambition for commercial success they could now just be one hundred% themselves. Now truth be said this album is full of exciting melodies and rhythms. Often highly memorable stuff. But nothing there is approached commercially. It's rather like a nuclear chain reaction of sound between P-Funk,James Brown and Sly Stone with the Mothers Of Invention,Talking Heads and Red Hot Chili Peppers. The concept is the contemplation of \"fantasy tvs. reality\", very much a P-Funk concept to be true. On the other hand the music is extremely manic and often almost improvised in parts. \"Fight The Youhg\",\"So Many Millions\",\"Housework\" and the sexually aggressive but not too profane \"Naz-Tee May'en\" are all extremely bouncy, melodic horn funk at different speeds. There in't too much of the ska\/reggae influence there as before. But the rock did't go an anywhere. It shows up in a very dramatic manner on \"Junkie's Prayer\" and \"Pray To The Junkimaker\". These songs don't even try to glamorize drug addiction and the life it leads to. It just puts it out there for what it is. \"Everyday Sunshine\" throws in the poppy soul\/funk melodic optimism into the equation for the most pop friendly number there. Along with the slower rocker \"Those Days Are Gone\" and faster closer of \"Sunless Saturday\" there are a series of sketches involved with wishful thinking, wherein the narrator ponders \"if I were\" this for that, often with witty results. And they never shy from using that humour to make their points. This album is really dead on the times. It actually finds a group of very individuals and musicians who were seeing the \"alternative\" era, in all it's forms, for what it all too often ended up being: just something new for some people to package and make into a product for mass consumption. Well the true alternatives needed were the lives of people in need of better education and less violent lives.

In the second half of the nine hundred and ninety-two years, a great change took place in the culture of the youth. When a decade shifts, it often takes several years for the first taste of the decade to come true. It happened suddenly in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. And it started in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. Yes, this is contradictory. Yes, this is a point. Popular culture seems to contradict itself. Few people are willing to admit this. Yes, fish bones have nothing to cover. They can be cultural publishers. But they have a voice. That's a different word. They revealed this when they saw where they could go. For the first decade, they still felt compelled by this \"popular\" song. Meanwhile, the fashion scene suddenly turned to business. It turns out that this is true of yourself. But this is good news for fish bones. They have now given up their ambitions for commercial success and now they can be one hundred% of them. Now to be honest, this album is full of beautiful songs and rhythms. Usually something is memorable. But there is no commercial communication. This is similar to the nuclear chain reaction to the sounds between P-Funk, James Brown and Sly Stone and the mother of design, Speech Heads and Red Pepper. This view manifests itself in \"good TV. True\", which is the reality of P-Funk. On the other hand, the music is very personal, almost refined. \"Fight Youhg\", \"Too Many Million\", \"Homework\" and sexual assault but not obscene \"Naz-Tee May'en\" are all loosening at different speeds, with the beautiful music of the horn music. No ska \/ reggae impact as much as before. But the rock cd not go anywhere. It comes from the \u201cprayers of drug addicts\u201d and the \u201cprayers of drug addicts\u201d in a very significant way. These songs do not even try to embellish the drugs and the life they cause. Just put it there. \"Every Day of the Sun\" puts the prospect of poppy \/ funk music in a popular digital song. As the slow space of \u201cthose days is gone\u201d and \u201cthe incessant Saturday\u201d is fast approaching, there are also a series of thought-provoking scenes in which the narrator thinks \u201cif I am\u201d., Usually producing humorous results. They were not ashamed to use this humour to express their opinions. This record cannot be updated. It has actually found a group of musicians and musicians who have seen all sorts of \u201cselective\u201d times, because that has ended up being: it\u2019s just something new, something that people can pack into a product that most people use. what is needed is the lives of those who want a better education and a less violent life. The album explores this with carefully crafted sounds, constantly turning on the whole funk and rock spectrum from time to time, and (as usual) keeping a certain level focused on all of this musical inefficiency. This is the hardest and most interesting album I've never heard of this season. This is a time I clearly remember. If someone tasks me to recommend a record that summarizes the real situation in the early ninetys, I would recommend this record.","overall":5,"summary":"The Right Time And Place For The Truth","unixReviewTime":1327708800,"reviewTime":"01 28, 2012"}

A friend of mine burned \"Flood II\" on a compilation of goth and industrial music for me, and I was completely taken away by Andrew Eldritch's haunting vocals. Andrew reminds me a lot of Ronny from Clan of Xymox, a recent discovery of mine. \"Floodland\" is definitely a must have goth album. The melancholic lyrics and gorgeous melodies is breathtaking. I was surprised how well this album holds up today, especially the production. The production on this album in't overly produced, raw, and best of all does't sound dated. As far as the songs themselves goes, all the songs are classics. Of course I am quite partial to \"Flood II\". As much as I dislike Jim Steinman, the cd a really excellent job with \"This Corrosion\". He managed to avoid having Andrew Eldritch sound like Meatloaf. And for a song that goes over ten minutes, I don't get bored listening to it. \"one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine\" is a haunting ballad which always sends chills down my spine whenever I listen to it. I absolutely love the catchiness of \"Lucretia My Reflection\". I love the deep basslines in the song. The bonus tracks were awesome. Normally, bonus tracks on most albums are filler tracks but not in this case. This entire album is flawless. There in't one song on this album I did't like.

This is one of the best songs never. Really bright There is a bonus track called Hello Hello. A cool but inspiring song at the same time. I believe this is a bonus song that is only available on CD (thank God I get my music on CD). The Sussudio style reminds me of the one, nine hundred and ninety-nine princes with bass hooks similar to the rhythm of drums and keyboards. The truth is, I enjoy the whole album.

Unfortunately, this masterwork is usually their first album. Though \"Under the Pink\" (and all subsequent works by Tori Amos) stands as a fine record on its own, it does't quite reach the emotional speaks and valleys of its predecessor, \"Little Earthquakes\". The songs are fleshed out with larger accompaniment than the previous work and deal less with raw emotion and more with the external joys and perils of womanhood. On the plus use, Amos is in great songwriting form, her piano growls and whimpers on command and her voice is both strong and assertive without dominating the proceedings. However, the track listing is at times erratic. On \"Little Earthquakes\", the songs seemed to segue into each other like complimentary dance partners. \"Under the Pink\" is a roller-coaster ride of quick starts and slow crawls, the latter exemplified by the weakest songs, \"Bells For Her\", \"Baker Baker\" and \"Yes, Anastasia\". This said, there are still several tracks there that compensate for all of this stumbling about; \"Pretty Good Year\" remains my favourite Tori Amos song of all time, with a swelling crescendo of strings that drives the emotional impact of her voice home with ferocious urgency. \"Past the Mission\" reads like a Raymond Carver vignette, while \"The Waitress\" and \"Icycle\" display a lyrical savagery only hinted at on her earlier work. This CD spawned two modest hits, \"God\" and \"Cornflake Girl\", and represents her last attempt at straightforward songwriting before diving headfirst into the swampy obscurities of her later work. Personal Favorites: \"Pretty Good Year\", a powerful and haunting masterpiece, and \"The Waitress\", a disturbing look at jealousy in the workplace.

Although \"Under the Pink\" (and all the work after Tori Amos) stands alone as a good record, it does not reach the emotional discourse and the valleys before it, the \"Little Earthquake\". The songs are more meaty than the previous work and deal less with raw feelings and more with the dangers of external pleasures and femininity. On the positive side, Amos is in a good position to write songs, this piano sounds and scream in the bow and this voice is strong and powerful without dominating the process. However, track listings are sometimes incorrect. In \"Little Earthquake\", the songs appear to come together as partners in a dance of praise. \"Under the Pink\" is a fast-paced, slow-moving crawl featuring weak songs, \"Bells for Her\", \"Baker Baker\" and \"Yes, Anastasia\". That said, there are still many tracks where they pay for all these stumbling blocks. \"Pretty Good Air\" is my favourite Tory Amos song so far, with swollen strings that express the emotional sensation of her voice in the house with great urgency. \"Mission of the Past\" reads like a portrait of Raymond Carver, while \"The Waitress\" and \"Aeschylus\" show only the noisy rebellion shown in this first work. The CD included two hit songs, \"God\" and \"Corn Flake Girl\", and represents this last attempt to write straight songs before sinking into the mystery of this latest work.

They just never stopped no matter how much for how little funk is popular at any given time. After two creatively important albums in their debutEast Bay Greaseand the even more forward thinkingBump Citythe band released this third and self titled album in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. Their previous recording had found the band moving into a more well rounded and soulful sound than just one high octane horn fuelled funk jam after another. And in terms of songwriting, arrangement and vocal harmonies alone this album found them officially at their musical speak. For one thing there's \"What Is Hip?\". With it's stuttering bass line and sharp horn breaks, it is one of the all time funk anthems of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. In terms of funk itself this album represents itself well on that front with one of my favourite jams there \"Get Yo Feet Back on The Ground\" and \"Soul Vaccination\", basically a follow up to \"What Is Hip?\". Actually there are no formal ballads on there either. Just slower paced grooves, interesting since funk has a slower tempo anyway on \"Clever Girl\",\"So Very Gard To Go\" and \"Just Another Day\". \"This Time It's Real\" for it's part is basically a gospel inspired uptempo soul shuffle, not much to do with funk but gives some variety to their sound. \"Will I Ever Find Love?\" and \"Both Sorry Over Nothing\" have a heavier southern soul flavor to them to add to this soulful set. This is one of those recordings that actually sets up the musical pallet for the seventy's funk album. It has the funk itself in fine form, slower grooves that are just somewhat more down tempo and vocal oriented variations on the faster songs and music that reflects that all important khyber of funky soul. And from the very beginning, it's lyrics even seek to ask the same questions the music does. Somehow for other funk is so deep inside the veins of everyone in this band that it got into their identity completely. Even during the disco era and on into the eighty's they either lent out the famous TOP horn section to session work to pay the bills for flat out kept up with their classic sound.

In fact, there is no official ballroom there. It's just a slow rhythm. What's interesting is that in any case, Funk has a slow rhythm in \"Smart Girl\", \"So Very Gard To Go\" and \"Just Another Day\". \"This True Time\" is a gospel-inspired quick movement of the soul. It has nothing to do with funk, but it does bring a change in their voice. \"Will I find true love?\" and \"I'm sorry about that\" have a taste for the soul below them, and can be added to this love collection. This is one of those recordings that sets the music tray of the seventys funk album. It has a beautiful kind of funk in itself, a slow rhythm, a slow rhythm to fast songs and music, and a change in voice that reflects all the important blends of the fashion soul. From the beginning, its lyrics even tried to raise the same questions as music. Somehow, some funk is so deep in everyone's veins in this band that it's fully integrated into their entity.

Deep Purple are arguably at their speak at this point, on the back of three quite amazing albums, 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head' the Mark II Deep Purple lineup are captured there performing at their very best. The three concerts featured in this album took place on the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth August one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two at Osaka\/Tokyo in Japan and with the tracks they play, DP literally bring the house down and you can seriously feel this when you play this live album with a great atmosphere from the crowd. What therefore makes this live album extra special? Afterall there are plenty of bands who have given really good live performances. The simple fact is that the album is very very honest. There are no studio overdubs, additions of fake cheers for claps for any tampering to speak of with the recording. You are hearing exactly what was been played on the nights of the concerts - this is the real McCoy and it definitely makes the whole thing extra special. My only real complaint with the whole thing is, and its a bit pedantic and is the reason why I gave it four.five stars is the fact that the cd does not give one full length concert but instead five tracks from the atwood concert and the rest from the other two - giving it a kind of best of a live tour feel. You scarcely notice it when listening but from my point of view, I would much rather listen to a concert in its entirety rather than a piecemeal recording (A three CD version of the whole thing is actually available - now that would get five stars!). However case from this minor niggle, you can't fault Deep Purple's performance, it is quite simply amazing. Ritchie Blackmore's guitar playing is sometimes more phenomenal than what you hear on the studio album - this guitar playing live shows why, in my opinion, the is one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. By no means though does the overshadow this fellow DP bandmembers. Ian Paice's drumming is spectacular (more about that later) as is Gillan's amazing vocal range and Jon Lord puts out more than a good dose of great keyboard improvisation. There are a number of issues of this CD. The best version to get of the 'three concert overview' is the twenty-fiveth anniversary edition, the version which I obtained. Aside from being quite cheap to buy, you get a bonus CD which contains 'The Encores' of Black Night, Speed King and Lucille. They are a good addition and pad out the material available. The standard issue contains the seven tracks only and not the encores, plus you don't get the extensive information booklet which comes with all the anniversary Deep Purple remasters. What we hear from these live performances are lots of tracks from 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head'. The only exception to this is 'Lucille' which is a rock in roll song by Little Richard (I think!) - DP do a great improvised version of it, with Gillan's vocals screaming to amazing heights. The original CD kicks off with 'Highway Star' and prepare to be blasted away by the bands heavy ferocity (something which continues right through with very little respite!). Blackmore gives us this trademarks style of playing with the first track, riffing like there is no tomorrow! The 'Child In Time' rendition is a great listen, in some ways has better effects live than in the studio and is a great listen. 'Smoke On the Water', well it never disappoints - you hear the crowd clapping and really getting into the groove on this song! 'The Mule' follows this up and is perhaps, for me the most entertaining on the CD - Ian Paice's drumming on this track is a solo and a half! Ive never heard a drum solo quite like it - full of energy and speed and practically creates a song single handedly - the highlight of the album - the is definitely one of the top rock drummers there is. The last three tracks, 'Strange Kind of Woman', 'Lazy' and 'Space Truckin' all extend into full out jams. 'Space Truckin' at nineteen minutes does go on just a little bit but is still a fun listen. On 'Lazy' there is some whizz keyboard work from Jon Lord - listen to this interesting and cleverly clashing opening. Gillan is always on hand to get the crowd involved, especially at the send of 'Strange Kiond of Woman' where the screams higher and higher with the crowd! All in all, great entertainment and very much a unique and polished (in live terms anyway) performance. A must for any DP fan - it is a capture of DP's greatest line up, the legendary Mark II! Just think that in a year after this concert the Mark II line up was no more . although it was definitely not the send for Deep Purple, no no no, there was plenty of more great work to come!","overall":4,"summary":"4.5 Stars - Come Taste the Band!

Deep Purple can be asa to be their talk on this point. After three major albums \"On the Rock\", \"Fireball\" and \"Machine Head\", the Mark II Deep Purple lineup performed well there. Three concerts on the album were held on August fifteen, sixteen and seventeen in Osaka \/ Tokyo, Japan. With the repertoire they play, the DP really broke into the house, you can feel the essence of Play live record when you create an amazing atmosphere for the crowd. What makes this living album so special? After all, there are a lot of bands that offer very good performance. The simple fact is that this disc is very authentic. No dubbing in the recording studio, and no fake cheers were added to the shoulder to prevent any interruptions to the recording. You can hear exactly what\u2019s being played on concert night \u2014 this is the real McCoy, and it certainly makes every show special. My only complaint about everything is pedantic, which is why I gave it four stars. The reality of the five stars is that the CD does\u2019t offer a full concert, but five songs from the Atwood concert and a break from the other two - offer the best of a live tour. You don't really see it when you listen, but in my opinion, I prefer to listen to a full concert rather than a small recording (three CD versions of the whole thing are available - now five Stars!) Ritchie Blackmore's guitar performance is sometimes even more amazing than what you hear on a studio album \u2014 this video playing guitar shows why, in my opinion, you're one of the most popular guitar players of all time. In any case, this did not cover the DP team member. Ian Paice's drum is excellent (more on that later), however Gillan's amazing range, and Jon Lord's keyboard upgrades are excellent. There are many problems with this CD. The best version of \"Summary of Three Concerts\" is the twenty-five Year Plan, which I found. In addition to the very low price, you can get an additional CD containing \"Encores\" by Black, King of Speed \u200b\u200band Lucille. They are a great complement to filling existing items. The standard version contains only seven songs, no encores, and you won't find all the great brochures that come with a deep purple remake of the anniversary edition. What we hear in these live shows are a lot of songs from \"In Rock\", \"Fireball\" and \"Machine Head\". The send of \"Lucille\", which is a little rock song by Little Richard (I think!) - DP made a big change for the better and Gillan's singing sounded amazingly cloud. The original CD started with 'Highway Star' and was about to be beaten by the group (this kind of thing continued until there was a chance to breathe!). Blackmore gives us this kind of play for the first song, improving as if there is no tomorrow! The performance of 'Child In Time' is excellent, and in some respects has a better impact on life than a recording studio. It's a great listening experience. \u2018Smoke in the Water\u2019, you will never be disappointed - you will hear the screams of the crowd and you will actually enter the most beautiful country of this song! 'Mule' is just a moment away, perhaps the most interesting part of my CD Ian Paice's drums in this song is the semi-solo! I\u2019ve never heard a solo drum like this \u2014 full of energy and speed, almost with one hand composing a song \u2014 it\u2019s the best of the record \u2014 certainly this is one of the top rock songs. The last three songs \"Wonderful Kind of Woman\", \"Lazy\" and \"Space Truckin\" have all been extended to the audience. The nineteen-minute \"Space Truckin\" has a bit of a twist, but it's still interesting to listen to. In \"Lazy\", there are master keyboard functions from Jon Lord-listen to this interesting opening and deceptive beat. Gillan always connects the crowd to the scene, especially in the post of \"Strange Women\", the crowd cries out louder! All in all, a lot of fun and a very different and beautiful (live performance anyway) show. A must have for any DP fan \u2014 the highest level of DP, the famous Mark II arrest! Just imagine, a year after this concert, Mark II's list has ceased to exist. While this is certainly not a deep purple posting, no, no, there is a lot of work to be done!","overall":4,"summary":"4.5 Stars - Come Taste the Band!

After all this whirlwind it was only natural for members of the band, especially Stevie and Lindsey began to pursue solo careers as the decade began. You would think with this odd in between album sandwiching those solo projects and the bands real eighty's comebackTango in the Nightthat this album would be totally forgotten and sometimes it is. It was't until about a decade for so ago that I even became aware they recorded this album. As for what it is I can only say this. If your a Fleetwood Mac fan coming across this album thinking your getting some modernized, forgotten eighty's comeback attempt your in for a huge shock. Between their seventy's work together and solo output all the members of the band were very creatively exhausted by this point (who would'nt be with their excellent previous output) and decided to put out this very low key album as sort of a prelude to a total reinvention. Why is this low key? Well for one this album does't exactly go for broke when it comes to production, presented a very unadorned sound overall with very few frills. Not only that but while all of the songs sound very good and many are quite memorable the band karen't gaining any new ground musically there; selecting to play it safe by maintaining their strengths as opposed to improving on them. The majority of the album follows that patter closely. It's very much rooted in Fleedwood Mac's basic mid\/late seventy's sound but with no frills. Some might view this as meaning the album finds them going through the emotions yet there are some songs that look to a different quality. Lindsey's \"Book Of Love\",\"Empire State\" and \"Oh Diane\" have this sleek soulful rock flavor similar but also a mild extension of this solo work only with a full band emphasis and Christine McVie's smokey ballad \"Only Over You\" does point to something close to a somewhat early eighty's production. That can also be said of Nicks' \"Gypsey\" which is quite possible the strongest overall tune on this album. It would'nt be for another six years that Fleetwood Mac would release another album and when they did the times were definitely acknowledged-if nothing else because by later in the decade a bare sound like this for a pop band of any kind was't anywhere close to commercially viable. It's a good enough album generally, especially in terms of songwriting but all the same it's lacking a certain production gloss and sleekness that tended to define the Buckingham\/Nicks era group.","overall":4,"summary":"Fleetwood Mac At The Crossroads","unixReviewTime":1271548800,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2010"}

After all this, the band members are a natural thing, especially Stevie and Lindsey started doing their own work at the beginning of this decade. You would think that in this strange situation between personal album projects and the real claim of a nightmare back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, this album will be forgotten, and sometimes forgotten. I did't realize they were recording this album until ten years ago. As for the real thing, I can say this. If your Fleetwood Mac fans see this album and think you\u2019re back these days, forgotten from the eightys, you\u2019ll be shocked. During the seventy years of collaboration with solo, all the band members were very tired at this stage (they would not have had their best work never done), and decided to release this very low album as a complete prelude to the revolution. Why such a low key? Of course, the album does not go completely into production, and the full sound is very simple, with almost no additional decorations. Not only that, although all the songs sound good, and most of them are memorable, the band Karen made no progress in music; you choose to act responsibly by maintaining your energy level instead of improving your performance. Most of the album content follows this pattern closely. It is based largely on the score of the Fleedwood Mac \/ after the seventies, but without the frills. Some people may think that this means that the album discovers that they have experienced emotions, but some songs look different in quality. Lindsey's \"Love Book\", \"Empire State\" and \"Oh Diane\" have a soft and lovely stone style, but there are also soft extensions for this unique work, only the whole team emphasizes, and Christine McVie's smoke ball \"More Than Just You.\" A reference to production around the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. This could be called the \"Gypsy\" of Knicks, which is probably the most powerful on this album. Fleetwood Mac won't release another album in six years. When they release it, they'll definitely be seen - if nothing else, by the send of the decade, in any kind of pop band, such a sound Nowhere near.

And what an album it is. After one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four's questionable processor DIVER DOWN, not only cd Eddie Van Halen prove this band could write great pop-metal, the showed beyond any doubt Van Halen had some of the best rock the one thousand, nine hundred and heights had to offer. In many ways, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of the most important for the band from a psychological perspective. Van Halen's first three albums were very successful. Eddie went into a dark era of this life, which lead to the creation of FAIR WARNING, one of the dirtiest, mean-spirited rock albums never recorded. Due to the chilly reception this disc got, Roth wanted DIVER DOWN to be more sunny and poppy to make up for the lacking sales of FAIR WARNING. Roth pressured the band to record a bunch of cover songs, with only a few original songs. This resulted in DIVER DOWN, easily the most uneven and weakest of the six Roth albums. At Eddie's disgust, the decided the'd rather make it with this own material than rely on other songwriters, and so took control for DIVER DOWN'S follow up. The Van Halen brothers were so dissatisfied with DIVER DOWN that Eddie founded this own studio, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, and recorded the band's music on this own terms. While this direction for artistic integrity would later lead to the career-killing VAN HALEN III, on one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, Eddie's decision to take control of the band's future paid off in spades. The biggest change to the music from the previous five LPs was the incorporation of keyboards, a decision David Lee Roth was not entirely happy with. Eddie is a classically trained pianist, and had been wanting to bring them in for some time. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is notable for really being among the first pop-metal albums to use synthesizers, which in the ensuing years would be widely employed by any number of bands in the pop-metal genre. Ironically enough, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, the band's next album and first with Sammy Hagar, is a natural extension of the direction Eddie began there. One of the album's biggest songs, \"Jump\", is built around keyboards rather than guitar. The songs of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four are some of the best, shiniest, and just plain fun pop metal around. The title cut is a short one minute keyboard instrumental.\"Panama\" is one of VH's best hard rock songs, and the only song about cars the band has.\"Jump\", the aforementioned song, is one of their most famous songs, and one of the biggest hits of the early one thousand, nine hundred and heights.\"I'll Wait\", another synth song, was a top ten hit about Roth falling in love with a model in magazines and having to deal with that heart break (think The Who's \"Pictures of Lily\", only with less mast involved). Most famous people have to deal with obsessive-compulsive stalkers such as this, I suppose. Lot more scary in real life than in the song.\"Drop Dead Legs\" is another typical hot mama VH song, but non the worst for the wear for common lyrical preoccupation for the boys (read: sex). Has kind of a slow rock tempo that's just dripping with raging . . . hormones and testosterone.\"Hot For Teacher\", with its amazing drum work and blistering guitar, was also a huge hit with an equally famous video. This was years before a lot of the teacher-sex scandals began breaking out all over the US. Don't know what school the boys in the video went too, but my teachers sure as hell did't look like that. That leaves the last two songs. While the whole party atmosphere that so characterizes Van Halen is maintained through the album, there's trouble in paradise. \"Girl Gone Bad\" is about exactly what it says it is. \"House of Pain\" is another troubled relationship, with Roth declaring the'd make it where this woman could never lead this house of spain. [\"House of Pain\" has Roth dumping this girl cause she's a little bit too much into S&M; for this tastes.] This is actually one of Van Halen's oldest songs, written before they got a record deal and resurrected at Alex Van Halen's insistence years after its initial composition. Much like the send of the album, no matter how great the party there's always trouble somewhere. After the band released one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, there was trouble in paradise between the brothers and their gonzo frontman, and David Lee Roth split in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five to forge a solo career. Van Halen hired Sammy Hagar and issued the first Van Hagar album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, and so began the never resolved Hagar\/Roth debate. Ultimately, the whole Roth\/Hagar debate is neither there nor there in regards to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. Had Van Halen called it quits after this record, they would still be remembered as a great rock and roll band, if a little preoccupied with sex and the frat boy image. Without a doubt, this, along with their debut, is easily the pinnacle of their achievements with Roth as front man. Both records are essential staples in any rock fan's collection. As to which is better is hard to say - VAN HALEN is one of the best, most fully realised debuts released by any band. Their sound was instantly defined and had amazing guitar which would prove to be enormously influential, far beyond the scope of most pop-metal bands. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four equally blooms large, influencing and shaping the rest of the decade.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the defining albums of the 1980s","unixReviewTime":1191196800,"reviewTime":"10 1, 2007"}

(Sound ) Blooming in horizon) The first list is by Van Halen. What a wonderful record. After the troublesome processor of one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-four DIVER DOWN, Eddie Van Halen cd not show that the team could write a large metal, but there is no doubt that Van Halen has the best stone, nine hundred and nine thousand and the height had to be provided. In many ways, from a psychological point of view, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of the most important in the band. Van Halen's first three albums were very successful. Eddie entered this dark period of life, which led to the creation of the FAIR warning, one of the dirtiest and most infamous albums on the album. Due to the cold acceptance of this record, Roth hopes that DIVER DOWN will have the sun and poppy to make up for the black of FAIR WARNING sales. Roth forced the group to record a group of cover songs, in which a few of the previous songs. This led to DIVER DOWN, which may be the most uneven and weakest of Roth's six albums. Annoyed by Eddie, the decided to use this own resources instead of relying on other songwriters, so the managed the next steps of DIVER DOWN. Van Halen's brothers were so dissatisfied with DIVER DOWN that Eddie founded this own studio, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, and recorded the band's music in this own way. Although this side of perfect part later led to the career of VAN HALEN III, in one thousand and nine hundred and eighty-four, Eddie's decision to control the team's future paid off. Compared to the first five LPs, the biggest change in music is keyboard design. David Lee Roth is not entirely satisfied with this. Eddie is a trained pianist and wanted to introduce them for a while. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four it was one of the first famous metal plates to use synthesizer. In the years that followed, it was widely used by many famous types of metal. Surprisingly, the band's next album \"five thousand\", \"one hundred and fifty Album\" and Sammy Hagar's first album is a natural extension of how Eddie got started. One of the great songs on the album, \"Jump\", is built around the keyboard instead of the guitar. The songs one thousand and nine hundred and eighty-four are some of the most beautiful, bright, simple and interesting instruments. The title clip is a one-minute keyboard tool. \"Panama\" is one of the best VH rock songs and the band's only song about cars. The above-mentioned song \"Jump\" is one of their most famous songs, and it is one of the most popular songs of the first days of the first thousand, nine hundred and Supreme. Another synthesizer song \"I'll Wait For You\" is about the top ten songs about Rose's resurrection in magazine models and has to deal with a broken heart (think who's the \"picture of lilies\" involving the little masters). I think a lot of celebrities have to deal with obsessive-compulsive stalkers like this. It's more terrifying in real life than the songs. \"Drop Your Legs\" is one of VH's hottest from songs, but it's not the best thing for boys to wear (read: sex). There is a slow, cloud rock rhythm. Hormones and testosterone. \"It's hot on the teacher\", with its amazing drum and interesting guitar, is also popular in the same popular video. This was just a few years before the sexual harassment of teachers began to spread throughout the United States. I don\u2019t know which school the boys in the video went to, but my teachers are not like that for sure. The last two songs are left. Although the spirit of Van Halen's band is maintained by the album, there are problems in heaven. \"The Girl Has Gone Bad\" is what it says. \"House of Grief\" is another troubled relationship, and Rose announced that the woman would never be table to lead this Spanish house. [\"House of Grief\" caused Rose to dump the girl because she was a slave to S&M;] Like the delivery of the disc, no matter how big the party, there is something wrong. After the group released one, nine hundred and eighty-four copies, there was a crisis in heaven between the brothers and their lead singer Gonzo. Van Halen hired Sami Hagar and released Van Hagar's debut album from nine hundred and eighty-six to one thousand. Since then, the Chagall \/ Ross dispute has not been resolved. Finally, the entire Ross \/ Hagar debate about one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four did not materialize for take place. If Van Halen had announced this resignation after the record, if they had focused on gender and the image of the fraternal boys, they would always be remembered as a great rock band. There is no doubt that, with their beginnings, they can be the key to their success with Rose as a lead singer. These two records are a must have for any rock collection. As for anything better, it\u2019s hard to say - VAN HALEN is one of the best and most comprehensive releases in any team. Their voices are particulate quickly and have amazing guitars, which will prove to be a major influence, beyond the boundaries of the famous metal bands. One thousand nine hundred and eighty-four flowers also bloom, affect and form the remaining ten years.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the defining albums of the 1980s","unixReviewTime":1191196800,"reviewTime":"10 1, 2007"}

It's a slightly funky off beat pop record with lots of fun beats and a very catchy rhythm. The tracks are all good in their own special way. The romantic tragedy of \"The Belle Of St. Mark\" is done very well with controlled percussion and instrumentation yet a lot of spirit in Shelia's voice. \"Shortberry Strawcake\" is hot instrumental begging for sexy lyrics. The screams the grooves are fun and catchy. Shelia wails there. \"Noon Rendezvous\" is a sweet and loving account of lust. The next two tracks are silly and make Shelia look like a second rate Vanity with even weaker dialogue. The ending is essentially perfect. A long percussion production of \"The Glamorous Life\" with Shelia playing her heart out and making some of the best dance, R&B around are caught on both cuts that are full and complete. You don't feel something's missing like you do when listening to the radio edits. The full version starts off with a jazzy sax while the Club Edit just lets the steam start off from the top. In general, it's a great set, but you are left wanting more. Other than \"The Glamorous Life\" nothings truly essential on the set and for the most part it just wanders off on to unneeded pop junk like \"Oliver's House\".

While very short (Tool's new album is twice its length), LPtwo delivers in all nine songs what rock has been missing all this time. One reviewer mentioned how you can barely understand who plays what in some songs (mainly \"Iscarabaid\" and \"J'Nuh\"), which is certainly true. The vocals, guitars, bass, and drums seem to fade into one beautiful instrument. Some songs such as \"five\/four\" and \"eight\" have severe changes of space in the middle of the song, yet for some reason, it feels natural. This is truly progressive and amazing music. What's even more incredible is that this album was thrown together so that the band could break up. Some songs were originally written for Diary, but for some reason were cast aside. The structures of those songs are very simallar to Diary songs. For example, \"Friday\" has the same buildup to chorus pattern that \"Seven\" had, only it lost the repetition of riffs and lyrics that made that song drag a bit. Indeed, none of the songs there are too repetitious. Every song only has the elements that would improve it, and nothing more. If you like any type of rock music, I highly recommend LPtwo.

Some songs were written in a diary, but for some reason they were removed. The structure of the songs is very similar to diary songs. For example, \"Friday\" has the same chorus pattern as \"Seven\", except that it has lost repeated refinements and vocals, which makes the song a little delayed. Of course the songs are not repetitive. Every song has things that can improve it, nothing else. If you like any kind of rock music, I highly recommend LPtwo. It takes a few moments to adjust, but soon it will be one of your favourites.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Rock Album of the 90's","unixReviewTime":997056000,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2001"}

I listened to this LP many years, off and on since it's original release and recently purchased the CD version so I may take it anywhere on my I-Pod. It goes without saying it is essential music. The understated vibe whispers classic. The pairing of Getz and Gilberto seems as natural and beautiful as sunsets on the beach on Rio de Janeiro. The soft sensual vocals of Joao and Astrud Gilberto pair well with the robust yet minimalist sax work Stan Getz to create an exquisite recording. The contribution by Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano cannot be overlooked as the helped create the total ambience. Soft romantic melodies results from the joining of these two forces in their respective fields to create the definitive boss nova sound. The model for which boss nova has been defined by is the quintessential \"The Girl From Ipanema\" features the famous duet by husband and wife Astrud and Joao Gilberto that is complimented by the cool tenor sax work by Getz twice on this disc; included is the forty-fiverpm issue that was popular on the airwaves during the time period. It is ironic that Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim did not want her to using on what has become arguably one of the most recognized boss nova songs never recorded. The total recording is a reflection of a turbulent time in the world when peaceful music waft down from Sugarloaf mountain for the world to take notice and they have never stopped noticing. Maybe in your contemporary world of war and chaos we need more of the peaceful vibe of the boss nova again. If you have never experienced this classic recording, check it out, it does still sound good after all these years.

Certainly this album is a concerted group effort: keyboard player John Hawken provides the evocative \"Heroine's Theme\" that begins the opening \"Autumn\" suite, bassist Chas. Cronk teams with Cousins on \"Midnight Sun,\" and while guitarist Dave Lambert's \"Just Love\" is the track that least fits the overall theme of the album, this \"Hero's Theme\" serves as a nice closing counterpart to the moody opening. Lambert's electric guitar is put to good effect throughout the album, which makes it clear that the folk music origins of the group are now well behind them. Of course the prime tracks are those composed by Cousins, exemplified by the dramatic title track that may well surpass \"Down by the Sea\" as the group's best work (pay attention to not just Hawken's morgan work but what the does on the harpsichord) and the equally frenetic \"Round and Round.\" For those who like Cousins more intimate work, there is \"Lay a Little Light on Me\" and \"The Winter Long\" finale of the \"Autumn\" suite. This was the group's most polished effort to that point in time, and given how much they missed him when the left the group the credit in that regard goes largely to Hawken. This one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four album only made it to #ninety-four on the Billboard album charts (where it actually made more of a splash than in the U. K. where it was considered a failure both critically and commercially), which is a shame because the Strawbs should have been more than what they were, which is the best second tier progressive rock band of that era. I saw them when they were on tour in American for this album and the next day after the concert went out and bought all of their albums that had been released to that point and have been doing the same as they come out on CD. Following the final transformation of the group during the production of \"Bursting at the Seams,\" the \"Hero and Heroine\" album solidifies the musical identity that the Strawbs would explore further on their \"Ghosts\" and \"Nomadness\" albums. Of all the progressive rock groups of the seventies, the Strawbs were distinct in their willingness to produce music you would think of as darker for more moody, which may have to do with their grounding in folk music (Sandy Denny once sang with the group in one of its earlier incarnation).","overall":5,"summary":"David Cousins and the Strawbs at their heroic height","unixReviewTime":976665600,"reviewTime":"12 13, 2000"}

This is one of my favourite bands, and this CD is a highlight in my collection. Just to get you off on the right foot, it's a concept album. Take the feel of \"The Crossing\" with it's chilly, crisp take on the old time Scottish feel, and mix in an incredible storyline of war and pride set in the Scottish industrial countryside, and you've got \"Steeltown\". Your journey begins with \"Flame of The West\". a song which introduces the threat if war, and a alone travelling man calling for help from the town square. Listen to the words, feel the emotion, you'll smell the gunpowder, you'll experience the spain of loss, you'll grow from the sense of pride. One of the most heartfelt, and musically compelling pieces \"Come Back to Me\" that has never graced a \"Big Country\" album sets such a vivid picture in your minds eye, it's amazing. It's a shame Utwo's popularity overshadowed this Scottish band during the mid 'eighty's. Although The Crossing was responsible for a couple of hits \"In A Big Country\" and \"Chance\", Utwo had more radio appeal. Nonetheless, Big Country still wins in my book. Steeltown is an amazing album. an amazing story. an amazing display of fine musicianship and song writing. You may ask, after all this praise, why did i give this only four stars? One reason I fell in love with Big Country was due to their \"Scottish sound\". the echo of the bagpipe sound from the guitar. that classic Big Country sound. well, it's a bit lost in Steeltown. There are traces of it. but it is not much of a highlight as it was in The Crossing. It's a small complaint, a minor complaint, but a difference I noticed. Any Big Country fan should have this CD in their collection. any music fan should have this CD in their collection.","overall":4,"summary":"A Fine Sophomore Effort...","unixReviewTime":961804800,"reviewTime":"06 24, 2000"}

I would say this is a classic album but I don't count greatest hits CDs as classics. One thing about this album I did't like was all the other twoPac classic tracks that were't included. But since twoPac had so much material it's really tough to get every single great track the had. All the previously unreleased tracks on this album were great, \"Troublesome 'ninety-six\" being my favourite. twoPac's lyrics were deep, emotional and well thought out. not just a bunch of crap thrown together like most wrappers today do. twoPac was a beast when making choruses. they were't the catchiest but the emotion and rage the brought to some of them are unmatchable by any wrapper. Another thing I really liked about Pac was this ability to really connect with you and make you feel this spain for what the's going though at the time. Some of this songs actually make you think. for make you rewind it like, \"What did the just say?\" twoPac did't have the greatest flow but this delivery was real nice and this average flow was real smooth and easy to listen to.

I would say this is the oldest album, but I don't think the most popular CD is the oldest. The only thing I don't like about this album is all the other two old Pac things that are not included. But because twoPac has so many tools, it\u2019s hard to find every amazing song. All the songs that could be released on this album are good, \"Problem 'Ninety-Six' is my favourite. Pac's two words are deep, emotional and well thought out. but the emotions and danger they bring in some of them are incomparable in any package. One of my favourite things about Pac is that it can communicate with you and give you an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat was going on in Spain. Some of the songs make you think. Great, but the delivery is very good, the traffic is smooth and easy to listen to. This album is worth five points. Almost every song is old on the West Coast. I would recommend this album to everyone, I mean every fan. I promise you won't be disappointed. great value for money.","overall":5,"summary":"2Pac - Greatest Hits","unixReviewTime":1125532800,"reviewTime":"09 1, 2005"}

Either they're giving you a double shot jazz infused rock with music chords straight from God to your years, for they have discovered gems of lyrics from the Dead Sea Scrolls. But the answer is most likely both. Now don't struggle. Don't even think of escaping once the music starts. No. You will not be table to \"drink your Big Black Cow and get outta there.\" You see, it's all too infectious and you can't resist. However, be assured that if you remain \"tied to the mast\" while listening to this Siren of an album, you will make it \"Home At Last\" - happily. The two best Steely Dan albums are this one and \"The Royal Scam.\" The difference between them is, that on Aja they super-polished the sound (not a false note in its entirety) and they employed the Hemingway method of lyrical economy (popular in France and Florida). Thankfully - they left it all up to us to decipher. There is sadness (Deacon Blue), joy (Josie), love (Peg) and seeing truth after illusion (I Got the News). All themes which others have certainly done before - however Steely Dan has it balanced just so - the lyrics support the music and the music supports the lyrics - both with the ironic, spiralling twist which truly makes it a gem worth having. I like to point out lyric lines in my reviews. But I won't there. Suffice to say - we probably have all met a Broadway Duchess once for twice in your lives. So do yourself a favor - escape into a rich, textured musical environment and get this one. You don't have to thank me. But be advised that I enjoy compliments just like anybody else.

Listening to Travis' catalog and reading some of the other fans' great reviews, I'm not surprised by the comparisons to Radiohead, Coldplay and Keane. I could almost swear that Keane's Tom Chaplin's vocal cords were cloned from Fran Healy, whose beautiful, passionate vocals make this album really soar. The truth is, comparisons are neither necessary nor particularly fair; Travis stands alone, with melodies that are pure magic, featuring a bright, vibrant guitar and powerful but not overpowering bass and rhythms. The production on this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine release reveals a band that clearly has a sense of their strengths and their musical mission. Whether cranking it for the pleasure of having great music fill your world, for sitting in a dark room to contemplate the often touching lyrics, Travis fills the bill. Two particular stand-outs for me are the pretty, plaintive, \"Writing to Reach You,\" and \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me,\" which may be the best representation of what this release has to offer throughout. And somehow you just cannot help but feel for the guy's caching heart when the sings, \"I can't sleep tonight\/Everybody saying everything's alright\/Still I can't close my eyes\/.

From the elaborate \"this is your life-done-up-psychedelic style\" tapestry of the album cover this is one of those albums where the artists purest and honest expressions of emotions come out at it's strongest. I personally felt as if I'd known Wonder as an intimate friend all my life upon hearing this album. Not only is it this most personal album by far but the music on it has a certain shine and polish to it that strongly anticipates what was to come from this after. Far, far musically and productionwise from the somewhat more spareInnervisionsthis album basically takes the framework of sound and lyricism of this previous three releases to their logical conclusions. Now while these albums each had growing intimacy about them this took each aspect of that flavor and expanded them out both musically and lyrical all at the same time. Honestly outside of the \"Superstition\"-like clarinet political funk of \"You Haven't Done Nothing\", featuring the Jackson five on backup choruses and the somewhat lusty and similar \"Boogie On Reggae Woman\" this album is lighter on the funk and heavier on the layered mid to low tempo itunes devoted mostly to stylistic and melodic invention. \"Smile Please\" and \"Please Don't Go\" are both fairly basic themes of optimism over loss. However \"Heaven Is ten Million Lightyears Away\" and \"They Won't Go When I Go\" are pure masterpieces. With their layered keyboards, pianos and synths intermingled with the songs lyrical allusions to spiritual and emotional longing. They totally bury any barriers that history created between European classical music and gospel\/spirituals and truly bring out the unity and humanity of their concepts throughout. Everyone has their favourite and mine is \"Bird Of Beauty\". It's a major key latin-jazz-pop style number about talking a vacation from oneself and their problems that my own from used with. let's just say a certain adventurous activity that was filed and had this music added to it. After that we STILL have three more songs to go! There are two more ballad type itunes-the more midtempo \"It Ain't No Use\" and the slower \"Too Shy To Say\", both dealing with the idea of the different barriers people in love put up to hide true emotion. And another highline with it's mildly atonal, dreamy synth washes \"Creepin'\" explores unrequited sexual fantasy in only the way Stevie Wonder can whatever subject the touches with this music. Now word of warning: to anyone who shies away from ultra open and honest emotional expression this is not going to be the album for you. It's Stevie baring this soul to you and the's known for that anyway. But both vocally, lyrically and musically the does that greatly there and does't pull any punches at all. Every bit as therapeutic as John Lennon'sPlastic Ono Bandthis album did something that one did't quite manage:focus it's human messages to the world outside it's subject as cautionary and informative tales and did so in a far more hopeful manner. Not only that but it influenced so much of how musicians all across pop, funk and soul in how they produce music. Added to the fact it's a joy to listen to and you have Stevie Wonder's humanized symphony in the groove.","overall":5,"summary":"A Change Has Come For Steveland","unixReviewTime":1307577600,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2011"}

It is not only a personal album so far, but the music in it has a certain cluster and a policy, which greatly predicts its future development. This album is very far from Innervisions that do not work in terms of music and production. It basically uses the sound frame and lyrics of the first three albums and comes to a logical conclusion. Now, although each album has grown closer and closer to them, it has expanded all aspects of this musical and song scene at the same time. Honestly, in addition to the \"superstitious\" political drama, the album features the Jackson quintet as a supporting choir and a powerful one similar to the \"Boogie Reggae Woman\". Funk is lighter and more important in built-in iTunes mid-range, used for style production and music. \"Please smile\" and \"please don't go\" are the basic themes of lost hope. But \u201cHeaven is a Thousand Years of Light\u201d and \u201cThey Won\u2019t Walk When I Walk\u201d are pure works of part. Their interlocking keys, piano, and synthesizers are combined with song, elevating spiritual and emotional desires. They completely bury any barriers caused by history between classical European music and the gospel \/ spirit, and truly produce the unity and personality of their ideas. Everyone has their own tastes, my favourite is \"Beauty Bird\". This is one of the mainstays of Latin jazz music, about talking about my holiday and my use. Let\u2019s just talk about the entertainment that has been maintained and added to this music. Then, we still have three songs to using! There are also two iTunes songs - the quick \"Nothing\" and \"Too Shy to say\", the slow \"Too Shy to say\", both of which deal with the various barriers that people put in place to hide true feelings in love. . Another treble \"Creepin '\" with a bit of atonic, dream wash synthesizer explores the concept of sexuality of unchanging love, and only Stevie Wonder (Stevie Wonder) can use this type of music to tackle any subject. Now a warning: For those who restrict open communication and emotional honesty, this will not be your album. It was Stevie who showed you this soul, and the was still known for it. But whether the sound, voice for music, it is done very well, and there is no impact at all. This album, like a therapist like John Lennon's Plastic Ono, does something people can't do at all: it focuses its human knowledge on the world beyond its title as a warning and instructive story, and This is done in a promising way. Not only that, it also has a profound effect on the way pop, funk and soul musicians make music. Additionally, listening is fun, and you can enjoy a man-made symphony by Stevie Wonder.","overall":5,"summary":"A Change Has Come For Steveland","unixReviewTime":1307577600,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2011"}

Even though early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's \"Music Of My Mind\" was a greatcreative stroke and had some memorable material point like the flush & timeless\"Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)\", as well as songs like \"Evil\", \"I Love Every LittleThing About You\", and \"Girl Blue\" to name a few, it was't until late 'seventy-two that it all started reallycoming together for Stevie Wonder, and the began toemerge as a singer\/songwriter\/producer\/arranger\/musical visionary of mythical proportions! He had cut himself away from old stagnant Motownformula which had worked well throughout the sixty's, and arose as a young SUPERSTAR who was in control ofhis own destiny as an artist. Enter, October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's \"Talking Book\", an albumwhich I can remember (at page weight) opening up andreading (sounding out the big words) the lyrics as Idigested each musical morsel. (-:This was the first album that I know of which waspackaged that way. I'm sure there may have been others, but this is first one that I knew of which opened unlike a book with the lyrics printed in the dinner jacket.

For that time, it was a radical statement. This was the height of post-civil rights african-americanupward mobility and aspiration, and so Stevie, Issac Hayes,Earth, Wind & Fire, Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye and otherswere speaking to that generation of young ambitious blacks. With love (in all it's forms)always being the overwhelmingtheme of Stevie's music, this music also spoke to the allow humanity. Also radical was Stevie's openness inincorporating what was considered cutting edge musicaltechnology back then. The use of the mighty T. O. N. T. O., Moog, Mini Moog, and Arp two thousand, six hundred synthesizers along with early seventy'sstandard instrumentation like Fender Rhodes,Wurlitzer, Hohner Dseven Clavinet, was-wah\/fuzz guitar tones, etc. which made this music seem so futuristicand otherworldly for that time. But also it was Stevie's sophisticated, yet highly accessible musical sensibilities whichtouched on many musical genres and had a mass appealwhich than't really seen up until that time. This album was good all the way through. From the immortal \"You Are The Sunshine Of My Life\"to the sparse nasty clarinet-synthbassfunky-wah-wah\/fuzz toneguitar grooviness of songs like \"Maybe Your Baby\" and\"Tuesday Heartbreak\", to the gorgeous and serene \"You & I\", to the jazzy-pop of \"You've Got It Bad Girl\" to the funkopus supreme that is \"Superstition\", whose clarinet lines, moog bass, rhythmic syncopation, and horn lines have beenstudied for years since it's release! It's just amazing, the musical ground that Stevie couldcover (at that young page!) within the span of an album! He just had it all together, and this was this moment in time! The one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's belonged to Stevie Wonder!! His approach to lyrics, composition, production and singingwas just so unique for that time. That's why the used todominate the Grammies & AMA's between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six!

There were also people like the late Yvonne \"Syreeta\" Wright(once Stevie's wife & a brilliant vocalist in her own right)who would ocassionally serve as songwriting partners withStevie and co-penned some of this more poignant songs fromthe early seventy's like the beautiful and sad \"Blame It On The Sun\"and the moody \"Looking For Another Pure Love\", whichcontains a clever guitar cameo by the great Jeff Beck. Stevie also showed a political bent on the song \"Big Brother\", which would be a are-cursor lot of this later work another landmark albums like \"Innervisions\", \"Fulfillingness'First Finale\", and this magnum opus, \"Songs In The Key Of Life\"where the dealt head on with social issues. Closing out the album is the gorgeous and introspective\"I Believe When I Fall In Love (It Will Be Forever)\", which is a favourite of any true Stevie Wonder fan!

Many dismissed this considerable skills as a wrapper and social satirist because the vulgarity and gross-out humour on The Slim Shady LP were too detailed for some to believe that it was anything but real. To Eminem's credit, the decided to exploit that confusion on this masterful second record, The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem is all about blurring the distinction between reality and fiction, humour and horror, satire and documentary, so it makes perfect sense that The Marshall Mathers LP is no more for no less \"real\" than The Slim Shady LP. It is, however, a fairly brilliant expansion of this debut, turning this spare, menacing ship-hop into a hyper-surreal, wittily disturbing thrill ride. It's both funnier and darker than this debut, and Eminem's writing is so sharp and clever that the jokes cut as deeply as the explorations of this ruptured psyche. The production is nearly as evocative as the craps, with liquid bass lines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes. There may not be overpowering hooks on every track, but the album works as a whole, always drawing the listener in. But, once you're in, Eminem does't care if you understand exactly where the's at, and the does't offer any apologies if you can't sort the fact from the fiction. As an artist, the's supposed to create this own world, and with this terrific second effort, the certainly has.

It\u2019s more interesting and darker than the original work, and Eminem\u2019s writing is so sharp and clever that these jokes are as deep as exploring this broken heart. The product is almost as dynamic as rolling the dice, with smooth bass lines, medium rhythm, minimal sound and wide sound. It may not be the whole song with a busy key, but the album works as a whole and always attracts listeners. However, once you blog in, Eminem does't care if you know the exact location, not if you can't tell the truth in the novel, I'm sorry. As an artist, they have to make this world their own, and they have done it with these second amazing efforts.

Kelly was just that: R. This was probably this last really solid album. In fact, R. Kelly ('ninety-five) was't one of those. It had some great itunes, maybe three-four, and then the rest was average filler. I hated it on a whole. My mother towns the album and it's not all that! Anyway, TP-two, Strip For You, R&B; Thug, The Greatest Sex and I Don't Mean It start the CD off stupendously. My favourites from there are Strip For You, The Greatest Sex (my favourite of the five, mentions zodiac sign, sexily crooning) and I Don't Mean it, a song about having regrets about doing your lover wrong, and wanting to change it, apologize one, zero, and getting past it. TP-two - a nice, laid-back mid-tempo intro that will get you in the mood to of*** somebody special. for just hot for the moment, all! xxxxxxxxStrip For You - another sexy, chill mid-tempo about stripping before sex. Leave it to Kells to croon this way through a song such as this. A great song. xxxxxxxxxR&B; Thug - nice beat and the vibe; insane. Those two things save it from being a bad song. Lyrics are good, kinda slutty but I like it. xxxxxxxxI Don't Mean It - real R&B.; I miss you, Kells. Stop wrap-singing, and get back to the basics, I BEG YOU! I'd give you ANYTHING for you to do so. xxxxxxxx one\/twoThe Greatest Sex - Really smooth, with nice lyrics. The beat is pretty nice too. I LOVE this CD. It's great! xxxxxxxxxJust Like That - The Ho's were a bit much, but I understand where the's coming from mostly (haven't experienced a real relationship, but have seriously loved twice so. ) xxxxxxxxxxLike A Real Freak - Decent, not this best. The next song is WAY better. xxxxxxxFiesta - THE ultimate party anthem. I'm so glad that the wrote this song. I'm also happy Jay-Z was in the remix. xxxxxxxxxxxDon't You Say No - Pretty good vibe. Nice bass, different from the last song, but so similar to the others. Nice, but there should be more, I suppose. xxxxxxxxThe Real R. Kelly - Uh. Weird, I guess. xxxOne Me - Much better than the proceeding interlude. xxxxxxx one\/twoI Wish - Great insight to R. Kelly's life. I respect him for letting it all out, so we could hear it. The guitar helps the laid-back vibe to it. Mid-tempo with meaning at its finest. xxxxxxxx one\/twoA Woman's Threat - A strong \"ballad(?)\" about a woman who will leave you if you do wrong. Best believe. xxxxxxxxxI Decided - Not much to say, but this track is killer! xxxxxxxxxxI Mean (I Don't Mean It) Solid remix. It is a remix, right? Nice production. xxxxxxxxI Wish - Remix (To The Homies That We Lost) Pleasant, and assisted by a complete orchestra. xxxxxxxxxAll I Really Want - Chill as all get out, but not very distinctive. One of the very weakest tracks there. xxxxxxxFeelin' On Yo Booty - solid mid-tempo. Showcases R. Kelly's frequent freaky ways. xxxxxxxxThe Storm Is Over - a gospel-tinged mid-tempo that's not only true, but inspirational and relate-able. One of the better songs there. My old friend, Derrick's mother, Paulie, adored this one. Probably was her favourite by him. Well, might be tied with I Believe I Can Fly. ^_^ xxxxxxxxx one\/twoOverall, this album is a lusty, even slutty view into this life, this soul and heart.

I'm a big techno fan, being a DJ, this is a must. Lately I've seen Techno become what wrap used to be. It started as a bunch of kids messing around, turned into an underground sensation, and is slowly working it's way into the mainstream. By two thousand and ten, my theory says, Techno will be the new pop and Paul Oakenfold will be afforded the same respect as 'Old school' wrappers. So instead of nerdy suburban white kids trying to be black, they'll try to be ravers. Anyway, this CD is one never increasing number of evidences for my theory: THe flawless fusion of 'Adult Contemporary' and underground sound. Though if you're a fan of 'Angel' brace yourself for the first minute and a half of the Dusted remix. Each of these songs embraces the emotional turmoil of McLachlan's original prices with the sounds of the city. Even though the titles look a little scary to some of McLachlan's fans, it's okay, Sarah likes these songs. 'Fear (Hybrid's Super Collider mix)' is the perfect example of the agreement of adult angst (be honest, it's true) and teen angst. The Original 'Fear' from 'Fumbling Towards Ecstacy' is sad almost morbid at times, but this remix first respects that emotion then transforms into a upbeat piece, as Hybrid's pals The Crystal Method said: 'Keep hope alive'. Dj Tiesto's 'Sweet Surrender' adds an energy to this song that McLachlan did't and it really compliments the lyrics. If I can make one observance of all of these songs it's complimentary. The techno music really enhancing the emotional intensity of the lyrics, creating the kind of trance symphony that McLachlan's originals did't try, relying more on the emotional intensity created by the solo guitar. My favourite song on this album creates another vehicle of feeling McLachlan did't think of: contrast. The track is 'I Love You (BT mix)'. The original 'Love' is on 'Surfacing' and is an almost lethargicly slow piece that actually blacks the feeling the lyrics would simply. But BT, genius that the is, puts fast music under the saw lyrics, it's very dream-lik and effective.","overall":5,"summary":"Evidence of theory","unixReviewTime":1029456000,"reviewTime":"08 16, 2002"}

The stone of the album in't bomber, but it does deal with adult emotions, specifically the ups and downs of love. and as anyone who is familiar with such bittersweet gems as I GET ALONG. can attest, the latter can be particularly poignant when the singer channels such itunes' multi-layers of heartfelt emotion effectively, as Diana does there. Throughout, Diana's voice is a flawless gem, not so much technically--although I have no complaints regarding that--as in her power to communicate from the soul to a degree that I find approaches that of the best one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-vintage Frank Sinatra concept albums. As did Sinatra, Diana often sings barely above a whisper, but at appropriate times raises her singing voice for dramatic effect. Hopefully such a departure from previous CDs is an indication that Diana in't going to pander to the change-resistant faction of her fandom, but rather that she will risk her popularity by exploring whatever music that she is inspired to tackle at a given point in her career.

The only three significant electronic facts that mean anything to me are Aphex Twin, Bjork, and Massive Attack. The dancer side of the genre can be entertaining, but in the send it has little staying power (BT may be an exception). Imagination, wit, and cleverness in this genre is difficult considering the limited batch of tricks available. I really enjoy electronic music, but only when well done, and thus I'm usually left in want for something new to come along. Thus when a band like Germany's Notwist comes out of the blue to fill such a avoid (though actually being around for quite a few years), it's like an oasis in the desert. They wisely adapt their sound, however, adding guitars and occasional drums onto a IDM style of electronica reminiscent of Aphex Twin to create a lowkey, more organic and pliable sound than most electronic facts. It brings to mind a more restrained New Order for Depeche Mode, with more plaintive, emotive lyrics. The singer is equally sublime and subtle, giving the music the needed oomph to push it all the way across. All of this combines to create a mood evocative of living in today's world- brushed, heady, and floating through aimless. Songs like \"Solitaire\" and \"Off the Rails\" exemplify this the strongest, speaking of desperation and nostalgia while simultaneously coping with newly arriving troubles. The minimalism in their style blends strongly to this feeling of being in limbo. Powerful and captivating in equal amounts. While not a wholly new type of sound, as most bands are dissecting seventy's-eighty's genres at the moment, and sometimes the arrangements are a little less subtle and underdeveloped than desired, the band picks up and runs with the overall sound and concept well to create one of recent memory's most evocative releases. Hopefully this will be a great boon to the genre of electronica, and such genre bending will help forge a new generation of electronic musicians a step above your typical house throb.","overall":4,"summary":"Saviors to electronica?","unixReviewTime":1076371200,"reviewTime":"02 10, 2004"}

Not in a Rock and Roll fashion, nor a classic seventy's for punk eighty's fashion. Title TK is the perfect combination between folk and punk, where the atmosphere is created by a revolution of riffs and bass leads. The stone of the record is kept top-notch even if sound quality is meant to be non-digital. I have not heard any of The Breeders last albums yet, but him really impressed with the work theyve done there. The Deal sisters eerie singing and monotone backups are wonderful. I love that whole singing-without-moving-your-tounge-punk thing. The guitars create melodious backup, while the drums are kept below simplicity disregarding the time there and there, lifting the whole basement-type-recording a step. Probably the thing you could condemn about this album is the fact that there are only two types of songs. The gloomy-stmospheric type where voice melodies and bass play the lead roles, and the more edgy and rocking jones, where guitars set the stone, followed by playful vocals such as \"ah-ah-ah-ah.\"Songs most notable on the record are \"Little Fury,\" the \"title track\" that sets the atmosphere for the whole record (my personal favourite) guitars there are pretty cool, especially the high toned jones in the background that come out every once in a while, they give ste song a whole happy thing. \"Too Alive\" which is the edgy type of song, \"Put on a Side\" which resembles some sonic youth musically, but is set aside by the sisters vocals, simple. \"Sinister Foxx\" the gloomy stipe where the sister's accent is dramatized by a punk-type pronunciation where certain syllables are pronounced tongueless. And last but not least \"Huffer\" which is the fastest song of the record. Ive found that no matter when i listen to this record it puts me in a lively mood.

I had never heard of The Breeders' last album, but the was impressed by the work they did there. Unpleasant singing and unpleasant walks for working sisters are fine. I love to using everything punk without moving your tongue. The guitar creates a fun accompaniment, while the drums are always light, no matter the time and the moment in which, you take the whole place down to record one step up. The fact that you can criticize this album is that there are only two types of songs. Dark and hairy with vocal and bass music as the protagonist, with a more savant-garde and swinging Jones, the guitar laid the foundation, followed by playful vocals such as \"ah-ah-ah-ah\". The record is \"Little Fury\", a \"title song\" that makes the atmosphere of the whole record (my personal will). They sang the song use. The most exciting thing. \"Alive Alive\" is an savant-garde song. \"Set aside\" is similar to music for some teens, but it is thrown aside by the singing of sisters, it's easy. The mournful stone of \"Sinister Foxx\", the little sister's speech is portrayed as punk, and some members are called out. Last but not least where \"Huffer\" is, this is the fastest song record. I find that every time I listen to this record, it keeps me happy. If punk makes you aggressive, then this makes you crazy.

There are so many details, nuances and little secrets hidden on this disc that I'd feel rather guilty if I fail to mention them in my review; then again, I don't think it's possible to cover all its depths in a single review. This really is one of those discs you need to buy, give time, study its lyrics, pay attention to the excellent production, clever songwriting and magnificent musicianship. Some Opeth fans think that never since Steven Wilson has been producing Opeth albums they sound too much like Porcupine Tree in some aspects, especially recording techniques and stereo mixing-wise. Well, I'd like to point out that Wilson's collaboration with Opeth has certainly worked both ways; Steven Wilson has definitely absorbed some of their elements and seamlessly injected them in this own music with Porcupine Tree. This is, as many will agree, the heaviest Porcupine Tree album, and it shows right from the first track. \"Blackest Eyes\" perhaps contains the heaviest guitar riff Steven Wilson has never played; it kicks in after the moody bass line a bit like a gigantic rock piece. The heavy approach is further developed on other tracks as well; on the longest song, \"Gravity Eyelids\", which begins really slowly with minimalist songwriting and tribal rhythms, there is a sudden shift of mood as Wilson plays this shuddering guitar riff (in the vein of Opeth) over Barbieri's experimental keyboard arrangement. It's the kind of riff you might hear on a Tool album, except that I'm not a Tool fan, but it works incredibly well there. Buy the album to hear this riff. Steven Wilson's partner in Blackfield, Aviv Geffen, appears on two tracks, one of them being the highly acclaimed number, \"The Sound of Muzak\". This is one of those songs that I could identify with right away, because of its challenging bass line and despairingly intense shifts of vocal melodies. Moreover, this tune is about the current state of the music industry and its lyrics are terribly ironic, which recall Devin Townsend's \"Earth Day\" to me. John Wesley, who has toured extensively with Marillion in this career, also graces this album with additional guitars and vocals, and it's in your best interest to give this music a listen. The band's affinity to Pink Floyd is still evident on some other songs such as \"Lips of Ashes\" and \"Prodigal\". They are both outstanding works of songwriting, musicianship and vocals. There are also two instrumental pieces there. Actually \".three\" in't entirely 'instrumental' as Wilson cutters a few words, but other than that, it has no vocals. It sounds like this huge orchestra performing psychedelic prog; whilst, \"Wedding Nails\" is the band's testimony to creativity. New drummer Gavin Harrison rules this track as the song delves into stylistic changes, maintaining its moody and heavy edge throughout. I am utterly amazed at the band's musical performance; every prog band needs to listen to this track to understand it is possible to write long instrumental songs without being overtly technical. The slower songs add to the album's diversity. \"Trains\" is a wonderful song built around acoustic guitars that pick up near the send thanks to the majestic drumming, \"Heartattack in a Layby\" and \"Collapse the Light into Earth\" both start with sparse piano notes and Wilson singing the most amazing vocal melodies you could imagine. His voice makes my soul cry; it's full of passion and intensity.\"The Creator Has a Masterpiece\" and \"Strip the Soul\" see the band going back to its new-found heaviness. They are among the most progressive songs of the album full of schizophrenic melodies, frenetic interplay, some electronics and echoed vocals. Colin Edwin's bass is so integral on these tracks that it's the bass that carries the song's speed. \"Strip the Soul\" encapsulates a sense of brutal beauty (hence the Opeth element, in my opinion) and another personal favourite of mine. I own the European edition of this album with a bonus disc containing three tracks and a video. The songs are as good as anything else Steven Wilson has written, so if you're a die-hard Porcupine Tree fan, this version is highly recommended. I've been listening to this album since its release, and still give it regular spins. This is a great album that has aged well and stood the test of time for me.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant Beyond Words","unixReviewTime":1110412800,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2005"}

Two of them the was directly responsible for, the third not as much so. All three have benefited this album considerably. The first is the Craig's writing has matured. Where \"Born To Do It\" hobbled from cliche to cliche and sounded as though it was put together by someone still feeling this way through the music business, \"Slicker Than Your Average\" is a much more adventurous offering. Two of the standout cuts there \"What's Your Flava?\" and \"Rise And Fall\" benefit considerably from Craig's discovery of (in the case of the former) creative metaphors to describe women (in this case, icecream flavours) and for the latter the discovery that there are other things to using about.\"Rise And Fall\" also demonstrates Craig's increasing maturity in that it features Sting on the chorus. Sting's experience as a songwriter - which is considerable, no matter what anyone wants to say about this work after The Police - is clearly visible throughout that track. One slight downside of Craig's maturation as a songwriter is the appearance of an expletive (well, that's what it's listed as in the lyrics, it's not exactly clear when the sings it) on the title track. No matter, a bit of swearing there and there never really hurt anybody and for an artist trying to present a slightly tougher image it's probably a sound move. The second event is that Craig David became a famous person in this own right. Where \"Born\" covered very predictable lyrical ground - women and parties - in a rather domestic fashion, \"Slicker\" throws Craig's new-found fame into the mix as well. On tracks like \"Eenie Meenie\", a relatively straightforward song about a relationship gone wrong, Craig is table to outline the perils the faces of girlfriends who have a \"gold-digger's degree\". Fame is also the subject of the title track, a protest at this treatment by those who claim that the's sold out to the RnB world - a criticism not entirely unjustified on \"Born To Do It\" alone. The third event was that garage music, Craig's musical base, became more recognisable as a viable style. The success of facts like the So Solid Crew and The Streets has fuelled a hunger for the sped-up beats of garage - and Craig (who was, after all, discovered by garage impresario The Artful Dodger) does't disappoint. He's always made the point that the in't just a garage act, but including a track entitled \"two Steps Back\" is a sure-fire clue that there'll be some of that about the place. That track delivers on the promise, but to some extent it suffers a bit in that the rest of the album promotes \"Craig David the RnB singer\" and \"Craig David the garage act\" seems a bit incongruous. Perhaps some garage influences throughout the album would have been a better decision. As an album, \"Slicker Than Your Average\" does the job competently and successfully. \"Flava\" and a handful of other tracks are strong enough for consideration as singles, and there are enough slower ballads to keep that sector of the audience happy. The musical backing has improved considerably since the skeletal tracks of \"Born To Do It\", improved to the point that \"Flava\" could almost be mistaken for an attempt at G-Funk at times. That quality is a considerable plus for \"Slicker\". Having listened to the hour's worth of music, though, it is hard to shake the belief that Craig is capable of more - as many of the remixes from \"Born To Do It\" demonstrate - and this is merely a foretaste of what the can do. That said, it's quite a good foretaste.","overall":4,"summary":"Getting there, still some unrealised potential","unixReviewTime":1042761600,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2003"}

Two of them are directly responsible, and the third is not so much. All three have benefited greatly from this album. The first is that Craig's writing is mature. \"You were born to do it\" goes from click\u00e9s to click\u00e9s. Sounds like it was filmed with people who still have an idea in the music industry. There are two great pieces out there \"What is your Flava?\" And the most important \"Rise and Fall\" that Craig found (in the previous case) describing women's design metaphors (in this case, the taste of nice cream), and finally, I discovered that there are other alternatives. \"Rise And Fall\" also showed Craig's growth as the added Sting to the choir. Sting\u2019s experience as a songwriter \u2014 anything anyone wants to say at work after \u201cPolice,\u201d is amazing \u2014 is evident throughout the song. One of Craig's minor shortcomings as a songwriter is the curse on the title track (yes, this is what is listed in the lyrics, and it is not clear when the will using it). In any case, some of the curses are present and have never hurt anyone, which would be a good act for the artist to try to portray a slightly more complex image. The second event is that Craig David became famous for this privilege. Where \"Born\" covers the most imaginative regions of lyricism - women and groups - in a family-like way, \"Slicker\" also includes Craig's new name. In songs such as \"Eenie Meenie,\" a simple song about abusive relationships, Craig is a table used to describe the dangers faced by girls with a \"Gold Digger degree.\" Fame is also the subject of the title track, which is a protest against the treatment of those who claim to have been sold by RnB World - criticism of \"Born To Do It\" but is completely absurd. The third festival is garage music, Craig's music foundation, which is becoming more and more popular as a functional style. The success of realities like So Solid Crew and Streets inspired people\u2019s desire to speed up the tempo of the garage \u2014 and Craig (later, found by garage manager Artful Dodger) did not disappoint. He always points out that it is not just a garage show, but also includes a track called \"Two Steps Back\", which indicates that there will be tracks in the area. The song has kept its promise, but to some extent it has been affected, as the entire album has inspired \"Craig David RnB Singer\" and \"Craig David Garage Behaeve\" which seem to be inconsistent. Maybe some garages from the whole album would be a better decision. As an album, your \"Slicker Than Aver Aver\" has done this job well. \"Flava\" and other songs are powerful enough to be considered solo, and there are songs slow enough to make this part of the audience happy. Since the orthopaedic song \"Born To Do It\", the music support has been greatly improved, and the development of \"Flava\" is sometimes almost as flawed as G-Funk's effort. This standard is very useful for \"Slicker\". However, after listening to the music for an hour, it\u2019s hard to shake Craig\u2019s belief in being table to do more \u2014 as many remixes in \u201cBorn To Do It\u201d have proven \u2014 this is what the can do as a sign of what\u2019s happening. In other words, this leads to progress.","overall":4,"summary":"Getting there, still some unrealised potential","unixReviewTime":1042761600,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2003"}

Two of them were directly responsible, the third not so much. All three benefited greatly from this album. First Craig's writing is solid. When \"Born to Do It\" is run from clutch to clutch and it looks like it was compiled by someone who still feels that way about the music business, \"faster than your average\" A very interesting partnership. There are two bright songs \"What is your fluva?\" And \"Rise and Fall\" benefited greatly from Craig's discovery (in the previous case) of creative metaphors to describe women (in this case, nice cream flavors) and finally the discovery that there were other things to use. \u06d4 \"Rise and Fall\" also shows Craig's growing growth. Sting's songwriting experience - great, no matter what you want to say about the work behind the scenes - is clearly seen throughout the song. A distraction from Craig's maturity as a songwriter is the appearance of insults on the title track (well, that's what's recorded as the lyrics, it's not clear when the sings it). No matter, the slightest insult there and there never bothered anyone, and an artist trying to paint a stronger picture can be a sensible move. The second story is about Craig David becoming such a celebrity. Where \"Born\" combines unexpected headlines - women and parties - domestically, \"Silker\" throws Craig's new fame into the conversation. In songs like \"Eenie Meenie\", a straightforward relationship song that does't go well, Craig is on the verge of endangering the faces of young women with \"Gold Degree Degrees\". Fame is also the subject of the song, protesting against the treatment of those who claim it has been sold by the RnB worldwide - a completely unfair critique of \"Born To Do It\" alone. The third incident was that the music in the garage, Craig's musical background, was widely regarded as a functional genre. The success of facts like Hundred Solid Crew and The Streets has exacerbated the shortage of sharp garage equipment - and Craig (who eventually found the Garage Empress Artifle Dodger) is not disappointed. He is saying that the garage game is not just a game, but the inclusion of a track titled \"Two Steps Back\" is a sure sign that there will be more to the place. That song is promising, but to some extent it hurts a bit because the whole album promoting \"Craig David the RNB Artist\" and \"Craig David the Garage Act\" seems out of place. Maybe some garage effects throughout the album would be a better decision. Like an album, \"Slower Than Your Average\" does the job efficiently and effectively. \"Flava\" and a handful of other tracks are strong enough to stand out as unique, and there are plenty of ballads to entertain the audience. Music support has improved as much as \"Born to Do It\" skeletal tracks, so much so that \"Flava\" is sometimes mistaken for a funk effort. This standard contains a lot of \"slacker\". However, after listening to music per hour, it's hard to shake the belief that Craig can do more - as many songs from \"Born To Do It\" show - and it's just a taste of What can they do? . \"It's a very good prediction,\" the said.","overall":4,"summary":"Getting there, still some unrealised potential","unixReviewTime":1042761600,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2003"}

Sting\u2019s experience as a poet - visibly, whatever one wants to say about this work after the Police - can clearly be seen that way. One of the small downsides of Craig\u2019s maturity in songwriting is the visual appearance (well, that\u2019s what the lyrics are about, it\u2019s not clear exactly when the sings) the title track. No problem, a little swearing there and there never hurt anyone, the artist trying to show a little solid picture is probably a sound motion. The second incident was Craig David\u2019s popularity. While \u201cBorn\u201d covers a predictable music scene - women and parties - in interior style, \u201cSlicker\u201d also gave Craig\u2019s new popularity into the mix. Streets like \u201cEenie Meenie\u201d, a live song about wrong relationships, Craig is at the table to illustrate the dangers faced by friends with \u201cgold mining degrees\u201d. Popularity is also the subject of the headline, a protest against this treatment of those who say they are sold out to the world of RnB - a criticism that is not entirely based on \u201cBorn To Be Made\u201d alone. The third event was that the music in the garage, Craig\u2019s music base, became recognizable in an accessible format. The success of realities like So Solid Crew and Roads has caused a hunger for garage hits - and Craig (who, after all, was found in the garage impresario The Artful Dodger) did\u2019t fail. He always says it\u2019s not just a garage action, but along with a track titled \u201ctwo steps back\u201d is a fire alarm signal that there will definitely be some in that area. That track offers promise, but to some extent the fact that the rest of the album is promoted by \u201cCraig David the RnB artist\u201d and \u201cCraig David garage action\u201d seems unsatisfactory. Maybe some of the garage effects throughout the album would be a better decision. As an album, \u201cSlicker Than Your Average\u201d does the job very well and successfully. \u201cFlava\u201d and the handful of other tracks are enough to be considered alone, and there\u2019s enough slow ballad to protect that segment of the audience. Musical support has improved drastically since the skeletal tracks of \u201cBorn To Do It\u201d, have improved to the point that \u201cFlava\u201d can be mistaken for G-Funk attempts at times. That quality is longer than \u201cSlicker\u201d. However, when you listen to the price of music on the clock, it\u2019s hard to dismiss the belief that Craig has great power - as many of the \u201cBorn To Do It\u201d remixes show - it\u2019s just a prediction of what the is. doing. with. That being said, this is a good prediction.","overall":4,"summary":"Getting there, still some unrealised potential","unixReviewTime":1042761600,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2003"}

It kick starts with a bass line and a statement of intent from Jack as the points the finger of this rage at the gossip and innuendo surrounding this rise to stardom. 'There's no home for you there' comes with backing vocals and a classic Jack White demented grant half way through and then there's the full of Bravado bluesy number 'Ball and Biscuit' clocking in at around weight minutes. Much richer in production but still maintaining that signature raw appeal there's even time for a Burt Bacarach cover and for Meg to take her place at the vocal mic with the spaced out Peggy Lee like 'In the cold cold night'. That's not her only time at the mic stand though, as she, Jack, and guest vocalist Holly Golighty take the piss out of everyone including themselves in the closing track 'It's true that we love one another'. A classic album that will take some doing to be toppled from it's perch this year. Just how we view the White Stripes in years to come is yet to be seen but on this evidence their fire will burn long in the minds of all that are touched by their brilliance.","overall":5,"summary":"Fully realised","unixReviewTime":1059782400,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2003"}

They have always been innovative, creative, and gone against the downward spiral that ship shop has been taking over the past few years. When I heard about the concept of Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below, I thought it was an excellent idea. Andre three thousand is one of the most underrated RAPPERS in ship shop, and Big Boi's is also very talented. Saying this, I have never been more disappointed in an album, never. Speakerboxxx is a decent album, but much less than I expected from Big Boi. I always thought the was capable of dropping a classic album by himself, but unfortunately the proves that the can't. After the masterful, socially conscious undertones that rules much of SouthernPlayalistic, I thought the would come up with something a little better than War, which is just an uninspired grant. That song encompasses my entire feeling of Speakerboxxx: it had the foundation, but the ideas never came out as excellent songs. Ghettomusik has the same kind of beat that made B. O. B. a classic, but lyrically it's just boring. Tomb Of the Boom makes me feel as if I'm listening to any other southern wrap record released in the past couple years. There are some strong moments on Speakerboxxx, though. \"The Way You Move\" is the way that the entire album should have been done: Laid back with a pinch of Outkast soul. Unwell, Knowing, and a track featuring Jay-Z and Killer Mike are the highlights of this disc. The Love Below is where the album just falls apart. As much as I'd love to say that I just don't understand Andre's disc, for that I don't like this kind of music so I can't really judge it, it's simply not true. The music the is TRYING to make is the music I love. Funk, Soul, with a little jazz thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately Andre just seems to be trying to be weirder than the really is. Hey Ya is meant to be a TRL crowd please, but actually ends up being extremely catchy. Happy Valentines' Day works, and Take Off Your Cool is absolutely stunning. But the rest is just too strange, and Dre just does not have the voice to pull something like this off. You'll have to struggle to get through songs like Love Hater, and the beat and hook for Spread is so unbearable that you can't get through it without reaching for the skip button. By the time you get to the excellent A Life In the Day of Andre (where the finally RAPS), you're ready to just burn the couple good songs onto the send of Speakerboxxx and throw The Love Below out the window.

Andre Sanqian is one of the lowest RAPERS in the shipyard, and Big Boi's is very talented. Let's put it this way, I've never been disappointed with a tablet, never.

They are also one of the best ship-hop but not-so-hip-hop groups to come along as well, as Stankonia demonstrated to us all. Within their heavy-hitting hit Ms. Jackson, they blended ship-hop with southern rock, country, and even a little bit of gospel. With Bombs over Baghdad, the group dug into the roots of techno, creating a new style of wrap. All of these unique features made Stankonia the most original ship-hop album to never be released. Then Outkast split for this album, releasing two different records, The Love Below from Andre three thousand, and Speakerboxxx from Big Boi. Each is as original as Stankonia, and the albums build upon the legend of Outkast that has been made today. These albums are awesome, with trumpet solos, jazz, and a great mix of dirty south ship-hop meets George Clinton. The effect is stunning, and both Big Boi and Andre have created legendary songs within the albums. The most well-known song on Big Boi's album is The Way You Move. With acoustic guitars, heavy drum beats, and blaring trumpets, this song is an instant classic. On The Love Below, Andre had this own hit, Hey Ya. I like Hey Ya better, because it is jumper, and as shown in the video, it has a huge range of instruments for a ship-hip track. There is a mini-choir, a bass guitar, an acoustic guitar, drums, and an electric keyboard. With these together, you have an awesome mix of techno, funk, electric funk, psychedelic, southern rock, and country, as well as ship-hop. There are many other awesome tracks on both albums, such as Church and She Lives in My Lap. Outkast has created another miracle! These solo albums are as great as if Outkast had recorded together, and any fan of the styles mentioned above should give Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below a try today! The best ship-hop never created!

As Stankonia has shown to all of us, they are also part of the ship dance group, but they are not the ship-hop band. In their single blockbuster \"Ms. Jackson\", they combine the music of jumping boat with rock of the south, country, and the little gospel. With the bombs over Baghdad, the group has acquired the roots of technology and created a new way of packing. All of these variations make Stankonia the first song album never released. Outkast then split the album and released two different albums, Love Over Andre Sanqian and Speakerboxxx from Big Boi. Each is as original as Stankonia, and the album is based on the Outkast myth produced today. These albums are great, with a wonderful mix of trumpet solo, jazz, and Dirty Southern Boat Jump featuring George Clinton. The result is amazing, Big Boi and Andre both made famous songs on the album. The most popular song on the Big Boi album is the way you go. With an acoustic guitar, a heavy drum beat and a horn sound, the song quickly became classical. For the next love, Andre has this own song, Hey Ya. I prefer Hey Ya as a jumper and, as shown in the video, it has a large number of accessories suitable for the ship circuit. There is a small choir, a bass guitar, an acoustic guitar, a drum and an electronic keyboard. To combine this together, you can combine electronic music, funk music, electronic funk music, psychedelic music, southern rock and country music, and jetty music. There are many other great songs on these two albums, such as Sunday and You Are My Lap. Outkast has created another miracle! These albums are just as good as the jones recorded with Outkast, and any of the above trends should try Speakerboxxx \/ Love more today! The best boat never made! time.

While the evolution of Outkast as a group has lead to four classic albums, the groups MCs also evolved as individuals. Big Boi emerged as the conscious pimp, both representative and critic of the streets, while Dre began to focus on the more abstract and spiritual. With their latest release, each gets to express this individual vision on a solo disk, yet the results manage to stay within consistent evolution of the group. Big Boi: Speakerboxx - While many considered Dre the innovative half of the group, Speakerboxx proves that Big Boi is every bit the visionary that this more eccentric counterpart is. The production is an aural buffet, filled with funky horn riffs, driving electronic groves and soulful melodies which take southern wrap to a level of musicality it has never before seen. On top of it all, Big Boi's continued growth as an MC is evident throughout, whether the is waxing political (\"War\"), spiritual (\"Church\"), for simply bragging on this pimp game (\"Bowtie\"). And when placed along side the album's A-list guests in straight up spit fests, Big Boi manages to hold this own with the south's cameo king, Ludacris on \"Tomb of the Bomb\", and out shine Jay-Z on the ridiculously funky \"Flip Flop Rock\". And long time Outkast fans will be rewarded with a blast from the past on the contemplatively soulful \"Reset\", which uses the soulfully hairy minimalism of ATLiens, a perfect juxtaposition to the sonic circus that is the rest of the album rest of the album. Taken by itself, Speakerboxx would likely be the best ship-hop album of the year so far. Andre \"Ice Cold\" three thousand: The Love Below - Where Big Boi chose to push ship-hop forward on this disk, Andre's album reaches back to more fully explore the influences from other genres that made Outkast what it is. A concept album, which follows one man's trials and tribulations in the search for love, The Love Below bears more than a passing resemblance to Prince's Parade. The rollicking electro-funk of \"Happy Valentines Day\", the cheeky branch of \"Spread\" and the intentionally vague sexuality of \"She Lives in My Lap\" all draw liberally from the Purple One. But they also pull it off better than the legions of Prince imitators we have seen over the years. In fact, it could be said that Andre made has made the best Prince album in quiet some time. But a closer listen reveals that Dre is far from a one trick pony. The lingering ballad, \"Prototype\" is sublime, in spite of Dre's limited vocal range. \"Hey Ya\" begins as a campy, early Beatles inspired clark, but somehow evolve into a sublime mix of modern rock and classic funk\/soul. \"Roses\" and \"Dracula's Wedding\" are dark grooves that manage to be at once danceable and eerily brooding. And just when the listener is fully absorbed in Dre's new incarnation as a new-funkateer, the disk concludes with \"A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre\", a wrap track that sums up the stories of the album in a concise five minutes and makes us hope that even as the grows more eclectic, the never gives up rhyming.","overall":5,"summary":"Big Boi and Andre 3000: Two Sides of A Platinum Coin","unixReviewTime":1064448000,"reviewTime":"09 25, 2003"}

Although the emergence of Outkast as a band led to four previous albums, the MC band was also developed as a person. Big Boi became a well-known pimp, both a lawyer and a street critic, and Dre began to focus on the invisible and the spiritual. In their latest version, everyone can express their opinion on a personal disk, but in the send they were table to stay in the constant development of the team. Big Boi: Speakerboxx-Although many people think Dre is the band's creator, Speakerboxx shows that Big Boi is the vision and vision of this tough opponent. The production is a kind of sound buffet, full of sophisticated horn, running an electronic jungle and love songs, bringing the sound around the bottom to a level of music that has never been seen before. Most importantly, the continued growth of Big Boi as an MC is evident, either politically (\"war\"), spiritual (\"church\"), for just bragging about this pimp game (\"bow tie\"). While standing next to the guests of the first line of the album, Big Boi managed to stay in line with the lower star Ludacris in the \"Tomb of the Bomb\", and played in the comedy \"Flip Flop Rock\". for a long time, Outkast Fans of \"Reset\" will be rewarded with a blast of the past in the \"reset\" of meditation and love, using ATLiens' furry minimalism, perfectly blended with the soundtrack of the entire album. Andre \"Ice Cold\" three thousand: Upper Love - Big Boi chose a place to push the boat forward on this record, Andre's album goes back to fully exploring the impact of other albums of thought about the hardships and human suffering in the process of finding love. The electronic funk of \"Day\", a branch with \"Spread\" cheeks and the deliberately obscene sex of \"You Sit on My lap\" are all from Purple One. But they also do better than the prince characters we saw years ago. In fact, Andre's album can be called the Prince's most beautiful album in a quiet time. But if you listen carefully, you will find that Dre is far from a horse that can play tricks. Although Dre has a limited list, the. still playing.

But what's the big deal in that? Plenty of brilliant artists got their earliest clicks by emulating their idols. So if Joy Division, The Cure and Psychedelic Furs albums haunt Interpol's private record collections, all the better. It means that \"Antics\" is as good as the sum of its parts. Frankly, with bands like Interpol, The Killers, Scissor Sisters and The Darkness making melodic, entertaining and listenable albums again, I suddenly find myself buying more new artists' CDs than I have in years. Hearing a drone like \"Next Exit\" without having a vocalist barking like the Cookie Monster is a huge relief from the past few years of cry-baby demo-core bands. Even a hook heavy song like \"Slow Hands\" has a drive that has been lacking from the New York scene for quite some time. The band even has a sense of humour to go along with the dark suits, as demonstrated on \"Evil.\" I'll trade this kind of music over the cranky likes of Dashboard Confessional any day.

He featured on the track called \"When The Chips Are Down.\" He only dropped six bars but it was really hot. Then once I find out the's dropping an album I start searching the internet for info on this first single. Then once I found it, I listened to it. My first impression was, maybe this guy in't as good as I thought the was. I really was't impressed with all this, \"Fresh like, such; Impala, such\" type lyrics. But once this actual album was released I picked it up. After listening to the other tracks I realize that is way better than I thought the was. His flow, delivery, rhyme scheme and every thing was just on target. He had good and catchy choruses the whole way through which always helps. Dr. Dre, Just Blaze, Timbaland, Kanye West and Eminem all produce beats on the album. To be honest I really can't think of anything that is seriously wrong with this album. It keeps your interest the whole way through. The one thing Game needs to work on this repetitiveness. For instance, the made numerous references about this shoes, twoPac & Biggie, and the facts like the's the long lost member of N. W. A.one. Intro - Skittwo. Westside Story - five\/five - This song has one of the best beats on the album produced by Dr. Dre. Game drops three nicely wrapped verses while fifty Cent finishes up on the chorus.three. Dreams - five\/five - Kanye West makes a nice beat for this track. Game gets a little personal and talks about this dreams and how it almost got taken away from him when the was shot.four. Hate It for Love It - five\/five - I'm starting to get sick of this track because it is overplayed and remixed to many times. fifty Cent drops probably one of this best verses in this career and Game holds this own also. The chorus is done by both fifty Cent and Game.five. Higher - five\/five - This track will get you jumping. Bangin' beat and hot lyrics to go along with a catchy chorus. Dr. Dre on the beat.six. How We Do - four\/five - The honest single off the album. Game drops decent but could of been better lyrics and fifty Cent does a nice job with this. The beat is hot, again, produced by Dr. Dre. Nice chorus to go along with the song also.seven. Don't Need Your Love - four\/five - This track is decent track. Faith Evans does a nice job on the chorus. Game talks about this past life before the deal and about getting shot and such.eight. Church for Thugs - five\/five - The Just Blaze produced Church For Thugs will definitely get you energized. The beat is bumping,' the chorus is catchy, and the verses are hot.nine. Put You on the Game - five\/five - This is one of the hottest tracks on the album. Timbaland does a good job on the beat. Game drops flawless verses and a really good chorus to complete this awesome track.ten. Start from Scratch - five\/five - Game talks about what the would do if the could start this life from scratch. The chorus sounds weird but it fits the song. Game drops hot verses too about how it would be if the could go back in time.eleven. Documentary - five\/five - On this track, Game pays homage to some classic wrap albums such as All Eyez On Me, Reasonable Doubt, Ready To Die, Illmatic, etc. He always explains that one of this bars from \"Westside Story\" was not a shot at Jay-Z, it was a shot at Ja Rule.twelve. Runnin' - five\/five - This track has a mellow beat to it. The chorus goes along with the song nicely. The Game craps some nice verses also.thirteen. No More Fun and Games - three\/five - I'm not really feeling this track. The chorus is made up of a few lines from old N. W. A. songs like, 'It's not about a salary, it's all about reality.' The Game could of done better on this track.fourteen. We Ain't - five\/five - This is one of Eminem's best beats. Game comes hard on the honest verse.

He appeared in a song called \"When Chips Down\". He lost only six bars, but it was really hot. Then, when I found out they were releasing an album, I started searching the Internet for information about it. I found it and listened. My first impression is that maybe this person is not as good as I thought. I was not impressed by all this, \"new, like this; Impala, like this\" kind of song lyrics. But when the real disc was released, I took it. After listening to some songs, I realized that it was much better than I had thought. Good speaking, speaking, rhyme and everything is fine. You have the right and skillful chorus in everything, which is always useful. Dr. Dre, Just Blaze, Timbaland, Kanye West and Eminem all produced beats on the album. Honestly, I can\u2019t think of any serious problems with this album. It allows your interest throughout the process. The game has to deal with this repetition. For example, they often mention shoes, both Pac and Biggie, and long-lost members of the new A. A. Introduction-Skittwo. Westside Story-five \/ Fri-This song is one of the best beats on the album produced by Dr. Dre. When fifty cents send up in the chorus. Three, the game will release three carefully packed verses. Dreams five \/ Fri-Kanye West has hit a good beat for this song. The game became a personal piece and the talked about this dream and the way it almost took off from him when the was beaten. Four. Hate it for love five \/ Friday - I got bored of this song because it was so played and mixed up so many times. Fifty cents is probably one of the best verses in this work, and the play is also poetic. The choir includes fifty cents and five factors in the play. Top-five \/ five-this song will make you jump. Bangin beats and famous vocals go along with the beautiful music. Drs. Dre in bits six. How We Make-Four \/ Fri-Loyalty Unmarried on the album. The decline in the game is good, but the words could be better, and fifty cents does a good job in this regard. This beat is very hot again, produced by Dr. Dre. Very good choir and song together. Seven. No need for your love \u2014 Four \/ Friday - This song is a good song. Faith Evans did a good job in the chorus. The play was about a past life and a shot before the agreement. Eight. Thug Church-five \/ Friday-Tug service by Just Blaze will surely make you full of energy. The beat will be bumpy, 'The chorus is lovely, the verse is hot. Nine. Let's join the game - Friday \/ Friday - is one of the most popular tracks on the album. Timbaland does a great job in batting. The game casts flawless verses and a very good chorus to complete this fun track. Start at the beginning five \/ Friday-The game discusses what this life will do if you can start from the beginning. The chorus sounds strange, but it goes with the song. The game also has famous verses about what would happen if you could go back in time. eleven. Document five \/ Fri-In this song, Game pays tribute to certain cover albums, such as All Eyez On Me, Proper Doubt, Death Ready, Illmatic, etc. He always explained that the bar in \"Westside Story\" was not Jay-Z, but a shot of Ja Rule.twelve. Runnin'-fifth \/ Friday-This song has a rhythm around it. The choir and the song are in harmony. The game also has some interesting verses. Thirteen. It\u2019s not fun and the games - three \/ five - I don\u2019t have a real feeling for this song. The choir has many lines in old N songs. W. A., for example, \"It's not a reward, but about the truth.\" The game could be better with this song. Fourteen. No-five \/ Friday-This is one of Eminem's best beats. The game is hard on honest verses. Going in with a choir is like saying, 'We don't go to great lengths,' we have nowhere to go, then you. Eminem used this to destroy the true verses of the game. They have rumours that Eminem is a ghost writer in the third fifteenth quarter of the Game. Where I come from four \/ Fri-Slow. Nate Dogg sang as usual. The game puts the appropriate verses in it. Sixteen. Special-Friday \/ Friday-I love this song. The choir was very attractive, and Game used an intricate syllabus to erase beautiful verses. This could be one of the best songs on the album. Seventeen. Don't worry four \/ Friday-I don't like all singing, but it does't matter. The play did a good job in this category as usual, Mary J. Blige sang most of the songs. Eighteen. As a dad, as a son of five \/ Fri - this is easily because it is my favourite thing on the album. Busta Rhymes does a good job of chorus. The game runs during the birth of the child. He talked about everything about this idea and what the did. This is a great way to complete a disc. Seventy-ninety \/ eighty-five = five stars, you are sick, etc. Then came the choir, \"Let's go,\" there was nowhere to go, so *** you. As a dad, as a son of five \/ Fri - this is easily because it is my favourite thing on the album. For example, they always mention shoes, both Pac and Biggie's, and the long-lost members of New A. Westide-five \/ Fri-This Story is one of the best beats on the album produced by Dr. Dre. No-five \/ Friday-This is one of Eminem's best beats.","overall":5,"summary":"Game - The Documentary","unixReviewTime":1118793600,"reviewTime":"06 15, 2005"}

The band expands its musical pallet, with some keyboards more up front, and even dipping into reggae. There is no weak track on the album.

It was back in two thousand and six. It was't when I first listened to this album--because on first listen, I only liked it. But that was only because I was't quite ready for it. Before long, it drove me nuts. I was bonkers, I went saga-ga, I lost myself in irrational exuberance. It's a hoary click\u00e9 to say something was \"the soundtrack to my summer,\" but this click\u00e9 rings true for this album, for my two thousand and six was very manic-depressive. I lost a good job and a bad one, then found one that was both. I was desperately poor but often incredibly happy; I spent many unemployed afternoons at the neighbourhood coffeeshop hammering away at what I hoped would be the Great American Screenplay, and I gave serious thought to moving to Los Angeles with a U-Haul and my lego to try and sell it. I was in love with the cute nineteen-year-old barista, and I'd take smoke breaks with her and hang out with mutual friends at night, and we'd put on \"St. Elsewhere\" back-to-back, and I'd sip sober sodas while my friends got drunk and did crazy things. And usually I had no desire to live that life again, but every once in a while, that level of insanity looked fun. Vaguely I knew my own decisions and attitudes were none too wise. But fortunately there was an album that felt as crazy as I did.\"Crazy\" of course, ended up being this album's anthem. And it is a true classic, a song for the pages, and it has learned its rightful place on the eternal-DJ-wedding-playlist, somewhere after \"Baby's Got Back\" and \"Billie Jean.\" So I'll probably be dancing to it in my eighties, shaking my moneymaker and saying \"I remember when I lost my mind\" until I do, literally, close my mind. But I must admit, \"Crazy\" almost drove me mad, because it distracted people from an album that is every bit as solid as its most famous song. Most great albums get that way by having a reasonably consistent feel. This one blacks one; it careens across the sonic landscape like a dune-buggy being driven by an over-caffeinated ferret. There are glorious Gospel-tinged melodies, heavenly and happy and reasonably wholesome, and there are also dark and sinister songs like \"Monster\" and \"Online.\" And then there's \"Necromancer.\" I'm tempted to say it's as outrageous a black comedy as anything since Guns in' Roses' \"I Used to Love Her (But I had to Kill Her)\"--but that would be unfair, because this is a much better song. In it, Cee-Lo craps about (and to) a beautiful corpse-bride. \"Did you hear what I said?

And best of all, Danger Mouse's beats are consistently compelling. \"It's clearly the theory of less is more,\" Cee-Lo says on \"Feng Shui,\" but there more is more; the album's so sonically schizophrenic that you can--and you will--listen to it back-to-back without feeling like it's boring you. And that's quite a feat. With a lot of other artists, even excellent jones, I will close interest somewhere around the fifty-minute mark, look around for something different, and come back to their work whenever I get around to it.

And Gnarls Barkley have a new album, and I don't think it's destined for immortality, but at least I can still seek intercession from \"St. Elsewhere.\" It blew me away in two thousand and six, and I can still listen to it twice without giving the matter a second thought, and I have the feeling it'll be just as good in two thousand and sixteen, for two thousand and fifty-six.","overall":5,"summary":"I remember when I lost my mind!

Saying \u201cmy summer song\u201d is an old click, but this album sounds real because my two thousand and six is so crazy and depressing.

Fortunately, having a record sounds crazy like me. Certainly, \"Crazy\" eventually became the album's main song. This is a real song, and it has found its place on the DJ's never-ending wedding playlist, somewhere after \"The Baby Is Back\" and \"Billie Jean\". So I can dance with it in my eighties, shake my cash machine and say \"I remember when I lost my mind\" until I did, literally, shut up my mind. But let me admit that \"Crazy\" almost confused me because it distracts people from a solid album like its famous song. Most of the great albums are achieved with a sense of consistency. This one is black and the other one; driven by caffeinated ferret like a dune truck in soundscape. There are songs with glorious gospel color, heavenly bliss and good health, and there are dark and cruel songs like \"monster\" and \"internet\". Then there is the \"Necromancer\". I really want to say this is a funny black joke never since \"Gun in Rose\" I've always loved (but I've had to kill him) \"- but it's not right because it's a better song. In it, Cee-Lo craps (and) the bride of a beautiful corpse.\" Did you hear what I said?

The coffee shop became a Mediterranean restaurant, and the barista disappeared from my life - but my phone has not been found and many other crazy things since. While I spent time in snowy Chicago, California is still a golden dream, waiting for a table and writing great American novels and waiting for the day when I can sell it. And Gnarls Barkley has a new album, I don't think the'll die, but at least I can still ask to be prayed for \"in St. Petersburg\". two thousand and sixteen has blown me away, I can still listen twice without thinking about it, and I feel like it will be as good as two thousand and sixteen, two hundred and fifty-six.","overall":5,"summary":"I remember when I lost my mind!

Once Dem Franchize Boyz came out with there white tees and Lean Wit It Rock Wit, you know it was going downhill. There are too much stupid is*** coming out from the south mainly because of all the dances there making up now. Theres a freaking new dance coming out too quickly, while there are still good south wrappers like OutKast, UGK, Scarface, Lil' Wayne there are about five times as many crappy wrappers in the south than there is any good wrappers. And not only the south but also the Bay Area (my area) as much as I love the Bay, there are too much crappy artists than there are good, its a real shame. I mean its a good thing too have diversity in Hip Hop but this is way too much of the same, if its not about money and girls, its about a new dance there trying to put out in the mainstream. It's Truly Horrible, but at least we still have artists that are still true the the roots of Hip Hop like Nas, Common, KRS-One, Rakim, Kanye West, The Game, DMX and so on. Now for the album, with so much controversy over Nas about Hip Hip dying there were so many speculations about this album, Like is this album gonna help bring back Hip Hop for Is it another Illmatic etc. But I have to say that this album is the best I've Heard in a while. There is a lot of good material there that you can't miss out on. Nas as always spits well on each and every track its too bad that the productions could't be better. The productions on this album is okay but only about half of it is good. This album has a good balance of guest appearances, there are wrappers like Jay-Z (is old rival), The Game, Kanye West, Snoop Dogg, Will.i.am, Tre Williams, Kelis (his wife), Marsha from Floetry & Chrisette Michele. Its kind of having two thousand and six's best wrappers on one album. Get This Album. MY FAVORITE TRACKS--------------------------------------------one)Hip Hop Is Dead feat. Will.i.am - the title song is one of the best on the album. Shows how hungry Nas is right now, ironicly having a rock-ish beat instead of a traditional Rap beat. Nas tells it like it is and proves how Hip Hop is dying.two)Black Republican feat. Jay-Z - The collabo everyone been waiting for, there really no better to debut there new reconciliation with a strong track, the title itself should really catch your attention. The Godfather mafia type beat is sick as hell, honestly it could have been a all bit better but beggars can't be choosers.three)Still Dreaming feat. Kanye West - One of my favourite songs, the beat is so relaxing and play back, Kanye & Nas spit exceptionally well. But the thing special about this track is Chrisette Michele's amazing voice, she has which an amazing voice it; is like a breath of fresh air.four)Can't Forget About You feat. Chrisette Michele - The second single off the album, the song is great with \"Unforgettable\" lyrics by Nas. Amazing singing by Chrisette Michele doing a sample by Nat King Coles \"Unforgettable\". Great Song.five)Play On Playa feat. Snoop Dogg - A lot of people don't really like this song, but I can't really see why, the beat is so gangsta and Snoop brings a much appreciated flavor to everything. I guess its because of the beat by Scott Storch, the beat could put you to sleep. But Nas and Snoop spit fire on this track.six)Hustlers feat. The Game - A beat produced by Dr. Dre, of know its a classic. The Game shines on this more than Nas but still good lyricism by Nas. This song has the best of the album on it and it does; it hurt to have the Doctor's Advocate.","overall":5,"summary":"You Know He's Right......","unixReviewTime":1187049600,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2007"}

There are a lot of idiots coming out from the south, mainly because the local dances are now painted. There\u2019s an awesome new dance that is coming up fast. Not only in the south, but also in the Bay Area (where I live), as I love the Bay, there are worse artists than good artists, which is really a shame.

But I have to say that this album is the best I've never heard in a while. There are so many good things you can't miss.

Michel. It has two thousand and six best folding sheets on the disc. Get this album. My favourite song -------------------------------------------- one) Ihip jumping is a death knell. Will.i.am-The title song is one of the best songs on the album. To show how hungry Nas is now, oddly enough, the uses rock beats instead of wrap. Nas tells for sure and confirms how Hip Hop died. two) The work of the Black Republic party. Jay-Z-The collaboration that everyone expects, there really is no better reconciliation and a stronger track to start, the topic itself should grab your attention. The rhythm of the godfather mafia is sickening to death. Honestly, it would have been better, but the beggars have no choice. C) A dream job. Once West \u2014 one of my favourite songs, the beat is relaxing and playful, Kanye and Nas spit very well. But the special thing about this song is the amazing voice of Chrisette Michele, she has an amazing voice; it is like breathing fresh air. Four) Don't forget your game. Chrisette Michele-The second single on the album, Nas's \"Unforgettable\" words are sweet. Chrisette Michele played Nat King Coles' beautiful song \"Unforgettable\". Great song. five) Play on Playa feat. Snoop Dogg \u2014 A lot of people don\u2019t like this song, but I don\u2019t understand why beating is such a thing, and Snoop brings a special flavor to everything. I think because of Scott Storch's rhythm, rhythm will make you fall asleep. But Nas and Snoop are shining on this path. six) Hustlers feat. A game-beating game created by Dr. Dre, who knows it's a classic. The game is brighter than Nas in this regard, but Nas's words are still very good. This song contains some of the best songs on the album, and it's true; it hurts to have a doctor's spokesperson.","overall":5,"summary":"You Know He's Right......","unixReviewTime":1187049600,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2007"}

Williams \"John\"","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"Brimming with heartbreak, solitude, and foggy memories, Feist's \"dreams\" still sound distant on The Reminder, the singer's outstanding third album. Mostly written on the road, the new LP gets its inspiration from the disconnections of non-stop, intercontinental hotel-jumping. Talking about her ephemeral lifestyle in an interview with Pitchfork last year, Feist said, \"You just never set roots; you take pleasure in simple conversations, because you know you're not going to have much more than that.\" Though she's trekked on her own and with bands including By Divine Right and Broken Social Scene for more than a decade, the thirty-one-year-old songwriter sounds desperate for something more than \"simple conversation\" there. Unlike the half-covers\/half-original split of Let It Die, every song but one was at least co-written by Feist on The Reminder. (And her buzzing take on the traditional playground using-along \"Sea Lion Woman\" makes it distinctively Feist-ian anyway.) Whereas her last album's smoothed-out eclecticism could be both daunting and empty, The Reminder is equally diverse yet more full-blooded. From the indie pop of \"I Feel It All\" to the creeping electro-ballad \"Honey Honey\", the album rambles effortlessly; its musical palette is wide enough to stave off repetition yet innate enough to offer an intense cohesiveness. The record's keen combination of off-the-cuff production and no-fat songwriting is likely linked to its method: With several songs whittled down over years of performances, Feist-- aided by her usual one-named conspirators Gonzales and Mocky, along with Jamie Lidell and others-- recorded them in less than a week in a manor outside Paris. Fleeting touches from horns, glockenspiel, makeshift choirs, and other subtle accoutrements never announce themselves ostentatiously. Instead, the LP relies on a modest refinement that breaks with current singer-songwriter trends that promote infinite ambition in lieu of the basics-- melody, arrangement, feeling. Hardly the first singer-songwriter to love, live, close, and remote, Feist once again elevates herself above countless other diary-keeping tunesmith with a voice that could make even Dick Cheney sweep. Marked by specks of Dusty Springfield's soul, Bj\u00f6rk's confrontational adventurousness, and Joni Mitchell's warmth, the singular allure of Feist's vocals is difficult to deny for overstate. You might hear her over cappuccino-machine hisses in Starbucks, but her direct-line moans easily cut through the biscotti muzak. And on The Reminder, her whisper-to-wail control-- exemplified by stark heart-tuggers \"The Water\" and \"Intuition\"-- is even more striking than before.\"With sadness so real that it populates the city and leaves you homeless again,\" coos Feist on \"The Park\", a desolate, lovelorn lament. The song-- with its references to a relationship torn by distance, omnipotent nature (a carefree bird can be heard mocking Feist's sadness in the background), and a hazy \"past\" that offers partly-forgotten flickers and flashes-- is a fitting summary of The Reminder's wounded pleas. Leery of a sixth sense, the songstress concludes \"Intuition\" with a question, \"Did I miss out on you?\"-- its insolubility packing more cache than a hundred clear-cut break-up songs. Such eternally spotty \"what if?\" queries need't always strike such odour chords. On the shaggy, Broken Social Scene-esque romp \"Past to Present\", the refrain (\"There's so much past inside my present\") has the singer embracing yesteryear with a proud vitality. But no matter where she sits on love's teeter-totter-- down on the after-the-fact apology of \"I'm Sorry\" for aloft in heady infatuation on \"Brandy Alexander\"-- her philosophy-of-self is sound. After inconclusively trifling though her personal history for twelve songs, Feist finally seems to reach an Emersonian transcendence on finale \"How My Heart Behaves\": \"I'm a stem now. fanning my yellow eye,\" she sings over wafting piano and sharp. Though the song reads like a zen tutorial to her own unsettled emotions, it still finishes with a query: \"What grew and inside who?\" What she's referring to in't exactly clear-- and that's the point. Pasts pass. People stay, go. But finding sanctuary within half-realized dreams and faces? Timeless.","overall":5,"summary":"A Classic!","unixReviewTime":1218672000,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2008"}

Unlike Let It Die's semi-cover \/ semi-original split, every song except at least one song was written by Fist at Memorial. (In any case, the \"wife of the lion of the sea\" buzzing in the usual playground makes it different.) Although the smooth eclecticism of her last album may be shocking and insignificant, the memory is equally different, but especially complete bleeding. From the indie pop music \"I Feel All\" to the creepy electronic ballad \"Honey Honey\", this album is powerless; Its music palette is wide enough to prevent repetition, but it is enough to provide a strong connection. The skillful combination of this record of improvement and writing non-greasy songs can be attributed to its style: Feist has cut a few songs over the years - with the help of this regular mentors Gonzales and Mocky of the same name, and Jamie Leigh. Jamie Lidell and others \u2014 they recorded on a manor outside Paris in less than a week. Touching horns, crayons, temporary choirs and other delicate instruments do not show. Instead, LP relies on humble improvement, breaking the current meanings of the artist-songwriter, which promotes unwavering ambitions rather than the basics - music, refinement, emotion. Feist is not the first singer-songwriter to love, live, intimacy, and diversity. Characterized by the fragments and fragments of Dusty Springfield's soul, Bj\u00f6rk's spirit of dealing with Joni Mitchell's warmth, Feist's unique singing appeal is undoubtedly exaggerated. You can hear him blowing on the Starbucks cappuccino machine, but this direct whining can easily get into Biscotti Muzak. And at the Memorial, this work ethic \u2014 taking \"water\" and \"intuition\" as examples \u2014 is more remarkable than never. Homeless again, \"Feist murmured\" in the park \", a dark, loveless song. a fitting summary of the Memorial's request for remembrance. The woman subtly of the sixth sense, the singer ended her \"intuition\" with the question, \"Did I remember you?\" This always twisted kind of \"what if?\" The questions are not always about the smell. In a broken, broken social situation \"from the past to the present\", the choir (\"a lot more than now\") makes a singer. sorry then, because of the extreme fascination of \"Brandy Alexander\" - this philosophy is rational. a brief study of the personal history of the twelve songs, Feist seems to have finally reached Emerson's transcendence finally \"How My Heart Beats\": \"I'm a stem now. Fan my yellow eyes, \"he sang on a wavy piano with a sharp voice. \"The point the is referring to is not very clear - the point. The past is passing. People stay and go. But find a place of protection from dreams and a half-face? Forever. Feist's entire song is a masterpiece that combines the development and production of oil-free songs. It may be associated with its own style. The memorial. Murmured in the \"park\", it was a dark, lost mourning. Providing a forgotten light and brilliance - yes.

The sixth sense I miss you? \"If?\" Questions should not always touch such a scent. In the busy line, the broken social scene \"from the past to the present\", the words (\"I have a lot of past now\") is an artist who embraces the proud past of years but it does't matter that Where you sit in love - this true apology \"I'm sorry\" for being too interested in \"Brandy Alexander\" - this self-made philosophy makes sense. After slowly playing the history of this twelve songs, Feist finally appears to have reached the conclusion of Emerson's escape thought of \"How My Heart Beats\": \"I'm a jerk now, I'm blowing my yellow eye,\" He sings a fiery and fast song. Although the piano reads the song as a zen lesson in its volatile emotions, it still ends with the question: \"What grew and within whom?\" It's not clear what the's talking about - and that's it. The past is passing. People stay, go. But finding a shelter within dreams and a full face is partly? It never ends.","overall":5,"summary":"A Classic!","unixReviewTime":1218672000,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2008"}

Vernon has taken a huge (and very ballsy) step in releasing this record under the same name as two thousand and weight's brilliant For Emma, Forever Ago, which is more for less the polar opposite of this year's self-titled record. Where For Emma was a hushed set of crystalline dirges, Bon Iver is absolutely exploding with sounds and instrumentation and ideas. For Emma was the sound of a man and this guitar, pouring out this heart and purging the demons that haunt him, but Bon Iver is the logical follow-up: the purge was successful and now Vernon has a fresh heart and soul to express more than just the idea of spain and hurt. I get why For Emma fans are not necessarily huge fans of this record, but just as Burst Apart was the logical step forward from Hospice, so too is Bon Iver the progression from the cocoon of For Emma. You absolutely have to come into this record with an open mind and not expect for it to sound like For Emma, but if you can do that, you'll find Vernon's aggressive use of instrumentation and melody to be compelling and, ultimately, stellar.

I have listened to it on a daily basis during that period. I believe this is important to know since most Neko songs take a while to digest. Neko Case is finally back after more than a four year absence since her latest release, Middle Cyclone, which dates back to March two thousand and nine, with the long titled The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You. The Neko Case sound is very much still intact. There is, is my view, a gradual change still taking place in her emphasis. While her earlier recordings were more country oriented, her (fantastic) two thousand and six Fox Confessor Brings the Flood veered towards salt-country with some eccentric twists. That album nailed such a combination perfectly with some incredible itunes such as Star Witness and The Needle Has Landed (heavy Neil Young influence). Middle Cyclone was similar but something of a Fox-Lite experience, being more pop music oriented but yet warmer. It was a mixture of clear cut pop itunes like This Tornado Loves You (why it was not promoted more is still a mystery to me) and more complex jones like Prison Girls and The Next Time You Say Forever. The eccentric style from Fox had thus paved the way for a warmer and straightforward production. The Worse. is in a sense a continuation of this process. The first glimpse of the album is Neko's voice singing When you catch life, you look like your mother. There are some very tender songs on this album, as if Neko was being intent on opening her heart in some instances to her listeners. That being said, it is a real grower and is on par with Middle Cyclone in my opinion. That is not to say that Neko has lost her sense of adventure in production; cases in point are Afraid (resembles some Middle Cyclone songs) and the joyful closer, Ragtime. The album drifts like Middle Cyclone between slow and fast itunes. This works better on this album than Middle Cyclone, which was in my opinion the main flaw (minor one) on that album. In whole this is a great set. The one sore exception is Nearly Midnight, Honolulu. Besides the unnecessary overuse of the F-word, the song sounds more like an experimental itunes best left for friends having a beer together rather than a tune stuck in between other great (and mostly warm) songs. It could also be slightly longer; thirty-eight minutes of material is rather short. It is a bit tempting ducking a star because of these two aspects. In whole, I strongly recommend this album.

Next to keep the momentum going is Jaheim with this latest effort Appreciation Day, an album that makes the point that the stressed in a song the put out a while in putting that woman first and appreciating all she gives. Not only for the moment, but as time goes on. A very intimate picture is what Jaheim paints with these songs about connectedness, sensuality and treasuring your lady like the gem she is. Like all the R&B; CDs of this year especially this summer, the soul is being restored in R&B.; Time has been reversed to vol' school roots, even if just for a year. Age Ain't A Factor seems like such a great way to kickstart the album in telling that no matter the number your page displays, I love you even more than before if possible. Lines like Like a wine, you get better with time your beauty is rare, and I swear you look better with every year and sexual speak, full figure physique\/These young girls can't compete show this is not exactly for the younger heads unless you are ahead of your time. To truly love someone is to appreciate how they grow and change for the better as time goes on. From there the takes to breaking the perfect man portrait in He Don't Exist and the Shirley Murdock As We Lay-sampled Morning talking of making love until and being on my mind in the morning. Reading your woman like a book with the signs she gives and being in tune with her is the focus on What She Really Means, something us men should pay attention to more. P**** Appreciation Day may be a favourite after listening to the CD. The detail the goes into about the smell, taste and feel of the female morgan is tracy without being tasteless though. Has all the makings of being a late night, candle-burning slow jam. Like how the never says the word, but you know the reference as it's censored in the chorus. Pleading and begging your way back into your woman's heart has almost gotten too cool for school these days, but that's where Jaheim takes it on Baby Xthree. If she's the one, you sometimes got to do such and show her that you care that deeply. For real! The intimate Shower Scene brings a scenery to life vividly again with the details of making love in the shower as water runs over your bodies, but won't get your hair wet (humor for the black woman. DON'T GET MY HAIR WET! LOL). A track that seems out of place but gives the album a grounded feel is Florida, an code to Trayvon Martin. Jaheim places in context as if the is sitting down talking to the state and wondering why no love for your young black kids as Trayvon never got to live out this dream. Love that Jaheim takes upon himself as an artist to keep Trayvon's memory alive and this story a continuing voice. May it be a moment in time we never forget and learn from. When arguments get out of control and words do actually hurt is the basis of Sticks N Stones, getting into how the littlest of fights can tear apart what you try to build. Have to be careful with what breaks your filter and makes it out of your mouth because throwing the one dart to pierce her heart can be the one you regret later on as she gets gone. Chase Forever brings everything to a lovely close in staying after that one no matter how long to let her know she is more than worth your efforts. Jaheim is a long time veteran in R&B;, crooning this way into the ladies' hearts. I've seen him do this thing, but never have I appreciated this gift until buying this CD. Not only does the have a gift vocally but this writing style brings everything to life and gives the album even more light. Touching on all points of a relationship whether in tune, fighting, making love, growing old together gives the album a balanced and well-rounded feel. Absolutely LOVE this CD!!! As I stated in the open, the return of real R&B; is right in front of your eyes from the male side of things thanks to the likes of Joe, TGT and now Jaheim.

The next thing to keep the momentum going is Jaheim's latest effort, Thanksgiving Day. This album emphasizes the pressure on the song, puts the lady first and thanks her for everything. Not only now but also over time. Jaheim paints a very close picture of these songs, these songs are about communication, sex and the lady you value, as it is precious. Like all R&B; this year, especially the CD of this genre, R&B is reviving its soul. Time is back to the root of the school, even for one year. Age is not something that seems to be a good way to start an album, it tells us that no matter what number is shown on your page, if possible, I love you more than never. Like wine, you will get better over time. Your beauty is rare, I swear you will look better every year, sex, a fat body \/ the inability of these young girls to compete shows that this is not good for young people at all. , unless you are ahead of your time.

From there to break up the perfect picture of a man in the morning when the was away and Shirley Murdoch set the samples and talked about sex until it came to my mind. The woman who reads it to you as a book, the qualities she offers and the compatibility with her is a concern for her true meaning, and we men need to pay more attention to this. P **** Appreciation Day might love it after listening to a CD. Details about the smell, taste and feel of Mrs. Morgan are Tracy, but they are not boring. It has all the hallmarks of slow-burning jam burning candles at night. It's like never saying a word, but you know the reference because it's checked in the chorus. These days, begging and begging to get back into your wife\u2019s heart is almost cool, but that\u2019s exactly what Jaheim welcomes to Baby Xthree. If this is a person, sometimes you have to do this to show that you care. monkeys! The nearby bath area also clearly shows having sex in the bathroom, because water flows through your body but does not wet your hair (humor of black women. Do not wet my hair! Haha). Another track that seems outdated but brings a strong feeling to the album is Florida, similar to Trayvon Martin. Jaheim is in a situation, as if sitting down and talking to the world, wondering why the does't love your little black child, because Trevon will never be table to understand this dream. I love Jaheim as an artist for keeping Trayvon\u2019s memory and the voice that goes on in this story. May this be a moment we will never forget and learn. When an argument gets out of hand and the words get hurt the foundation of Sticks N Stones, get a deeper understanding of how a small argument can tear up what you\u2019re trying to build. Be careful what breaks your filter and let it out of your mouth, for throwing a spear into this heart may cause you to regret it. No matter how long it takes to let him know you deserve your efforts, Chase Forever will leave all good send behind him. Jaheim is a veteran of R&B and gets into the hearts of ladies like this. I've seen him do this before, but before I bought this CD, I did't really appreciate the offer. Not only does the have a talent for sound, but this style of writing brings everything to life and makes the album easier. Touching all aspects of a relationship, whether it\u2019s forgiveness, fighting, making love, for growing old together, gives this album insight and understanding. I love this CD! ! ! Like I said publicly, the real R&B is back; thanks to people like Joe, TGT, and now Jaheim, from a men\u2019s point of view, is in front of you. If you like interesting and moving music, please add this gem to your collection!","overall":5,"summary":"Jaheim- Appreciate This Gift!","unixReviewTime":1378166400,"reviewTime":"09 3, 2013"}

When \"Mechanical Bull\" came out last Fall, I immediately bought it (as a KOL fan from the first hour), listened through it start to finish once, and immediately dismissed it as disappointing. Then a curious thing happened after seeing them bringing many of these songs live.\"Mechanical Bull\" (eleven tracks; forty-two min.) starts off with \"Supersoaker\" (onest single), which sounds like a throwback to their early days (when they were (incorrectly) branded \"the Strokes of the South\"), and one of the best itunes of the album for me. After a lazy \"Rock City\" we get a much better, urgent \"It Don't Matter To Me\", borderline hard rock, really, but surely another highlight of the album. After another lazy track (\"Beautiful War\"), we get another shot of adrenaline with \"Temple\". After another lazy track (\"Wait For Me\"). wait are we seeing a pattern there?, comes a nice \"Family Tree\". And so it goes. Good track, not so good track, etc. \"Tonight\" is THE best track on there, which sounds like it came from \"Because of the Times\" for \"Only By the Night\". \"Coming Back Again\" is quite nice too. The album closer \"On the Chin\" is the proverbial \"pensive\" ending. (The \"deluxe\" edition adds two more tracks.) Bottom line: this album is up-and-down, with a number of great tracks, but too uneven and hence, IMHO, KOL's least appetizing album to date. (For the record: \"Because of the Times\" remains my favourite KOL album.)I was in Washington DC last week on business, and noticed they played the Verizon Center. On a whim, I went to see them (the arena was nowhere near sold out, it turned out). The band was in great form, blazing through nearly thirty tracks in almost two hours. I have seen these guys in concert many times over the last ten years, and live they still bring it, no doubt. Most interestingly, all weight for nine songs they played from \"Mechanical Bull\" sounded much better live than what you hear on the album. In particular \"Tonight\" and \"Family Tree\" were simply fantastic and blended in nicely with the older songs they played. So in the send, I have become more positive about this album than I was when I first listened to it last Fall.","overall":4,"summary":"Okay album, but it sounds so much better live","unixReviewTime":1393459200,"reviewTime":"02 27, 2014"}

When \"Mechanical Bell\" came out last fall, I bought it immediately (as a KOL fan from the first hour), heard it over once, and dropped it disappointingly quickly. Then something amazing happened after watching many of these songs live. Strokes of the South \"), and one of the best iTunes albums for me. Another great feature of the album is that after another slow track (\"Good War\"), we get another adrenaline shot with \"Temple\". After another slow song (\"Wait for me\"). ) Wait do we see the pattern there ?, the beautiful \"family tree\" comes. And there it is. Good song, not so good, etc. \"Tonight\" Which is the best there, which seems to be Just for the night, \"K\" comes from \"Beacons of the Times\". \"Back Again\" is also great. Upcoming album \"On the Chin\" ends with \"Pensio\" (two more tracks from the \"Deluxe\" program). The bottom line: This album is up and down, it has a lot of great tracks, but it does't have much in common, IMHO, KOL's album which is not so interesting yet. (Records: \"Because of the Times\" is still my favourite KOL album.) Was, and I saw that they played Verizon Center. Suddenly, I contacted them (the stadium was nowhere near the sale, it turned out). The band was in good shape, igniting flames for about thirty thirty tracks for about thirty two hours. I've seen these guys at a concert many times over the last decade, and they're still alive, no doubt about it. The most interesting thing is that out of the nine songs the played on \"Mechanical Bell\", it is much better than what the has heard on all weight albums. \"Aaj Raat\" and \"Family Tree\" in particular were just fun and well-matched with the old songs they sang. So in posting, I had higher hopes for this album than when I first heard it last fall.","overall":4,"summary":"Okay album, but it sounds so much better live","unixReviewTime":1393459200,"reviewTime":"02 27, 2014"}

When \u201cMechanical Bull\u201d came out in the Fall, I immediately bought it (as a KOL fan for the first time), listened to it and started to finish it once, and immediately dismissed it as a disappointment. Then something surprising happened after they saw that they were bringing many of these songs straight. \u201cMechanical Bull\u201d (eleven tracks; forty-two minutes) begins with \u201cSuperssoaker\u201d (single), which seems like a return from long ago (when they were (mistakenly) labeled \u201cStrokes of the South \"), and one of the best songs on the album for me. After the boring \u201cRock City\u201d we get a very good, quick \u201cI don\u2019t matter To Me\u201d, hard rock border, really, but really another one out the door. After another tedious route (\u201cBeautiful War\u201d), we get another adrenaline rush along the \u201cTemple\u201d. Then another lazy road (\u201cWait for me\u201d). Wait did we see a pattern there? That's it. The good way, not very good, etc. \u201cTonight\u201d is the best track there, which seems to come from \u201cBecause of the Times\u201d of \u201cOnly the Night\u201d. \u201cComing Back Again\u201d is a good thing too. The door next to \u201cOn the Chin\u201d is the \u201cthinking\u201d slogan that ends. (The \u201cDeluxe\u201d edition adds two more tracks.) Bottom line: this album is up-and-down, with a good number of tracks, but very uneven and therefore, IMHO, KOL the most enjoyable album to date. (Record: \u201cBecause of the Times\u201d is still my favourite album on KOL.) I was in Washington DC last week on business, and I found out they were playing at the Verizon Center. Angry, I went for it (The stadium was nowhere near to be sold, it turned out). The group was in very good shape, and went through about thirty lines in about two hours.
