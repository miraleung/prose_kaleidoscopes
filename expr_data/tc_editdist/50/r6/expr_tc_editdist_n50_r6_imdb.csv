670,"When i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world. She has beautiful and charming body. When cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body. i think male have hard to resist. i think its time for cute girls like hrishita batt also do nude scenes. At least no one wants to pc nude body of ugly women like Seema biswas to pc in bandit queen. I concur with what mallicka.b has said. The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. Emotions karen't conveyed properly. I guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my view, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can't help it; sorry for that. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed",positive

At least no one wants to take a naked pc of a bad woman like Seema biswas and take her to a robbed queen on the pc. I agree with what mallicka.b. The way the film is portrayed seems to be a islander in the original theme. Negative expression of emotions. I think some negative things have contributed to her relationship. In my opinion, compared to Aishwarya Rai, Tabu would be the best choice for such a character. In some of this shows, the seems to have a little bit of energy, which is not what the movie is supposed to be in the send. I also noticed a slight run in some of this shows. I am a big critic of Aishwarya Rai :) I can't help it; sorry. ""Raincoat"" is a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. After seeing the raincoat, I saw Choker Bali; I had no vision at all. I think it’s time for cute girls like hrishita batt to take nude photos. At least no one wants to take a naked pc for a bad woman like Seema biswas on a robber queen on the pc.

John Farnham's You're The Voice. In one of those epic sequences where the star and this cohorts do The Slomo Walk down Main Street and the townsfolk follow on their wheels in support, the soundtrack is the gag. How did the film-makers even come across this Aussie recording artist? A major Australian vocalist (and a genuine talent) who shot to fame in the early 'seventys covering Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head, then disappeared until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six for The Big Comeback with You're The Voice, John Farnham's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy, it levelled mountains in Switzerland. Besides these two high points in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit. Andy Samberg is Rod, a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump. Maybe it's got something to do with the fact the's driving a moped into the heart of darkness. Or this fake moustache. Yeh, someone actually thought that was funny. Without one jump under this starry belt, the plans for a fifteen-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian, like Jason Biggs for Rob Schneider - to win the day and save this stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever. who watches these movies for plot anyway? Along the way (as usual for moronic leads in these comedies), the scores a salubrious chick (Isla Fisher), who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this closer.

2092,"As a French, i found it very pleasant to be table to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Westerners, at Spy movies etc. and at a lot of other things too, men route. I already saw it three times and each time i discovered new things and laughed to tears. Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, Aure Atika the director and all the cast, all the crew did a fantastic job. This movie is funny but is although much more than that : it's got plenty of levels to it. You laugh because of simple gags, because of some critics made with wit (the movie's courageous enough to be critical), because of physical comedy, because you believe in the characters etc. Esthetically and musically, it's a success too.

2116,"For people like me who were born long after the 'sixtys ended, we can only learn about the era through cultural artefacts, of which ""Hair"" is one. This is certainly a well done tour de force. One can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene - for me at least - is when the group crashes the rich people's party. As for the movie's final scene, one might interpret it as the symbolic send of everything that the 'sixtys represented. But no matter how one interprets this movie, it's important to understand that even though the 'sixtys themselves may have ended, the movements that typified them still exist in small enclaves. It's a time that people won't soon forget. Anyway, this movie is one that I definitely recommend. Milos Forman scored another great one there, right between this two masterpieces ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Ragtime"" (so why did the later make a piece of crap like ""Man on the Moon""?!).

But no matter how this film is interpreted, it’s important to understand that even if ‘sixty’ itself may be done, movements like theirs are still in small places. It’s time people will soon forget. However, this film I really recommend.

2434,"I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. But to start it off, I got ""Spanish Judges"" on February I think. It was mention it was the last copy, but as I see, it was't back-ordered. But either way, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly because of the great factor, Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the oscar) although it is kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending. Man, what a good factor. The story it about a icon artist known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who ""claims"" to have merchandises called The Spanish Judges. If you don't know what Spanish Judges are for haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read, I won't even say what they are. I figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was. He needs protection, so the hires a couple who are also crooks, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) as well as a crook that goes by the name of Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from Mars, as she said. So they (mainly Jack) call her ""Mars Girl"". Everything starts out fine, but then it turns to one big game. A game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal. There was some over acting in it (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara, were not one of them). There were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well. Some of the score was actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and the send (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. The fight scene in the send could've been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? One more comment on Matt: Damn, the plays a smooth, slick icon man. I know this is a review, but I need to make a correction towards NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site, she has been acting since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. To me, and hopefully to others, she is well known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both the ""Hot Shots!"" movies. But good review. Although I think it's one of the rare films I've seen and it's really good (which is why I gave it ten stars above), I will give the grade of what I thought when I first saw it.eight/ten",positive
2434,"I'll have to warn you, there are detractors in it. But first, I think I got a ""Spanish judge"" in February. Someone mentioned that it is the last copy, but as far as I can see, it has no background. But either way, I have it. I used to think it was okay. I want to watch this mostly because Matthew Lillard (I’m surprised no one mentioned Oscar in the review) Although the budget is very low, it’s worth having enough money to make this movie. Man, that's a good thing. The story tells the story of an idol artist named Jack (Matthew Lillard) who claimed to have a product called the ""Spanish Judge"". If you don’t know why the Spanish judges haven’t watched the trailer yet, this is the first report you’ve read, and I won’t even say what they are. I think this is going to be a big change, no one knows what it is. He wanted protection, so the hired a liar, Max and Jamie (Vincent Donofrio and Valeria Golino) and a man named Pease (Mark Bu En junior). As the said, the has a daughter who will not tell anyone her name because she is from Mars. So they (especially Jack) called her ""Martian Girl"". Everything started well, but then it turned out to be a big game. A game that includes desires, lies, and betrayal. There are extreme shows (Matt and Valeria and Tamara are not one of them). In some cases, they could have done better, and their scores could have been better. Some articles are really good. The content they used in opening and posting (before the credits) is a good choice of songs, which is my opinion. The battlefield in distribution may be longer and more violent, but what can you do? Another idea about Matt: Throw it away, play a smooth idol. I know this is a study, but I have to fix one of the testers, NeCRo: Valeria Golino is not a new person. According to the website, the started holding in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. To me, and hopefully for others, you are a well-known Italian lover of Charlie Sheen in ""Hot Shots""!

2518,"Alright! A sci-fi/horror/action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people! As with any Wynorski-flick, the throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't lead to anywhere. But ""Storm Trooper"" is more like a two-movies-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal. On the one hand we got the drama/thriller part (as such the film opens) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying & ungrateful husband (a plot that simply leads to nowhere). And on the other hand we got the 'escaped cyborg on a rampage' part, ""Night of the Living Dead""-style. With Carol and the Cyborg being the jones trapped inside the house and a bunch of special OPs/bounty hunters playing the role of the zombies, trying to break into the house. Needless to say this flick is not up there with the greatest. Zach Galligan (of ""Gremlins""-fame) especially is painfully bad and Corey Feldman (in a small supporting roll) is once again completely wasted on this movie. Wynorski even trips off one of this own movies there, since I am ninety-nine% sure the used some stock footage of this previous film ""nine hundred and seventy-six EVIL II"" (the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle).

But “Storm Cavalry” is like a price transaction between two films. On the other hand, we had a theatrical / entertaining drama (due to the opening of the movie) in which Carol Alt killed her angry and ungrateful husband (a spotless plot). On the other hand, we found ""Part Run Robot Rampage"", ""Night of the Dead"". Carol and Cyborg are Jones trapped in a house A special team of OP / bounty hunters play the role of zombies and try to break into the house. Needless to say, this movie is not a big deal. Zach Galligan (better known as ""Little Ghost"") was very bad, and Corey Feldman (in a small supporting role) was once again completely depraved in the movie. Wynorski even made this own movie there, because I was ninety-nine% sure that I had used some of the material from the previous movie ""nine hundred and seventy-six EVIL II"" (the place where trucks and motorcycles explode).

On the one hand, we see the drama / drama part (as the film unfolds) where Carol Alt skills her furious husband and an ungrateful man (a conspiracy that can easily lead anywhere). On the other hand we see the ‘cyborg who escaped part of the attack’, “The Night of the Dead” -style. With Carol and Cyborg being jones trapped inside the house and a large group of their own OP / hunters acting as zombies, trying to enter the house. Needless to say this narrow is not the largest.

The only thing that put it to anything close to humour were the names of the characters like ""Private Public"" and ""General Specific"", a few vague references to cultural aspects, and how Lady Richington pummelled Sheep with her steel wig.

4816,"""Death Lends A Hand"" is one of the pivotal early episodes of ""Columbo"" that helped define the show for the next thirty years. It marks the first of Robert Culp's four appearances (three as a murderer), playing much the same role in each show. In this case Culp plays Brimmer, the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate, Mr Kennicut, is having an affair. Although she is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut, in the hope that the can blackmail this wife in return for snippets of information about her husband's business associates. She reacts badly to this suggestion, an argument ensues which rapidly turns violent as Brimmer whacks her across the face. Because the is wearing a large bring, the blow knocks her to the ground and skills her. There are some really priceless moments in this episode. One of my favourite scenes is where Columbo pretends to be into palm-reading, although this is in fact a ruse to discover the shape and size of Brimmer's bring without admitting that the knows the killer wore a bring. Columbo being Columbo, the only reveals what the really knows when the time is exactly right to turn the screws a little. So initially the goofily plays the part of a rather simple-minded man who gets excited by the ""lifeline going over the mound of the moon"", for some equally ridiculous palm-reading mambo-jumbo. Another great scene is when Brimmer tries to offer Columbo a job for this firm, effectively bribing him to stop poking this nose around. Again, Columbo does't reveal that the knows what's going on, the pretends to be honoured and excited by this job offer. And there's another where Columbo says to Kennicut, in front of Brimmer, that the wishes the murderer could hear their conversation. He wants to hint to Brimmer that the is onto him, without directly accusing him, so the rather cruelly (but understandable in the circumstances) decides to play mindgames on Brimmer in order to spook him into panicking and doing something stupid. Which of course the does! All the while, the grieving Kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation. It's only near the send that Columbo explains all to Kennicut (not shown on screen). I won't reveal how Columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights, but let's just say there's a potato involved. A really really good episode, possibly the very best of the first series.

Part homage to German expressionism, part allegory, the film is replete with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals anything seen since the one thousand, nine hundred and twenty's.

Aside from this, the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on social voice, perception, and opinion. In truth, it's not so much the silence that permeates the film as it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thought that inevitably follows.

The movie is not only about this struggle to get this book ""the origin of Species"" published, but also this relationship with this oldest daughter.

Now, this is not an revolutionary propaganda film, as a matter of fact I think it managed to stay very neutral. A hard thing to do in my opinion. of course it does not condone the way the characters was treated by the church, quite the opposite actually. If you need me to use the big words to shed light on this film; it will be liked by deists and atheists alike, but goes away from atheism. The movie talks about evolution, and that's it. Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course we all may think of Darwin as that old man with the funny beard, but this movie center around the man in this late twenty's, early thirty's. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is great as always, but the factor who impressed me was Martha West as Annie Darwin, Darwins daughter. Definitely on of the best child factors of the decade. The story is about Darwin and this daughter, and it is beautifully acted. Except for a few jumps in time that was momentarily confusing, the production of this film is pretty flawless. Some scenes were Darwin observes nature is just marvellous, and is almost like taken out of a high production National geographic documentary. I must admit though, I'm not quite sure of why they chose ""Creation"" as the title. I doubt it is an irony, the movie is too respectful for that.

Jennifer Connery (Emma Darwin) is as great as never, but my favourite is Ann Darwin played by Martha West, Darwin's daughter. Definitely the best child in ten years. The story is about Darwin and this girl, and the performance of the play is very good. Aside from the temporary leap, the production of this movie is worth it. Some of Darwin's naturalistic scenarios are truly astonishing, almost as if they were taken from a very high-profile National document. But I have to admit that I am not sure why they chose to “create” as a topic. I suspect this is a satire, this movie is very respectful. Well, I believe it makes sense, don't let it scare you.

8312,"A tedious mixture of puerile efforts at humour with romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this weakly made film with any flavour of reality. As action opens, Reno (A. J.

The storyline then proceeds ten months where we find that Reno is indeed true to this word concerning avoidance of roommates, although this appears to beg the question due to this garnering of a live-in lover, Holly (Holly Fields), with whom the has generated marital plans. The plot briefly shifts to a sleazy Hollywood strip club, wherein Reno's Uncle Charley, enamoured of a ""dancer"" whom the finds eminently desirable, keels over dead atop the club's bar after seeing the unadorned charms displayed by the object of this affections. It is apparent that Charley had been aware of the flawed condition of this heart, because the created a video tape during which this commentary bequeaths this large (and mortgaged) residence in Hollywood to Reno, and we see the latter deciding to, contrary to this vow, interview applicants for two roommates as tenants, with the and Holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner. Following an inane sequence involving bizarre renter candidates, all of whom Reno and Holly unsurprisingly find unsuitable for living along with them in their house they, unknown to each other, each select a renter of the opposite sex, with the lovers manifestly cool toward the choice of their partner. The newcomers (Chad and Nicole) would seem to have little discernible point to their existence other than highly aural fornication with a broad range of partners, and it is not long before jealousy mars the harmonic relationship of Reno and Holly. Reno is bent upon patenting and merchandising a type of sporting travel bag and, as the has given an engagement bring to Holly, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial significance if the intends to advance this marital plan. Unfortunately, the rapacious team of Chad and Nicole, whose every action is ostensibly placed with lust, is likely to disrupt any future wedding intentions of Reno. Direction is slack, plainly far from fulfilling basic needs of the players, although an erratically composed script provides scant material with which factors may work, and had climbing falls embarrassingly flat. As a result, the performances are undistinguished, not aided by spotty editing, while the manner of camera-work changes as abruptly and often as a firefly's tail light. Filmed with a low budget and on location, only a modicum of skill is required for the designing processes, but a larger measure of value might have been placed upon the tasteless D.

A good deal of discussion has been stimulated by the movie's final sequences that are apparently not expected by a viewer based upon what has come before, but in reality these comprise probably the only thoughtful portions of a poorly cobbled screenplay, and bids fair to make the work almost watchable, despite the shabby quality of the production as a whole.",negative

I bought this movie for $seven.ninety-nine, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man Sandler is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked (judging by the R-rating and scantily-clad women on the cover). Well, there are quite a few scantily-clad women, but none get naked. I'm not sure what point this was in Sandler's career, but I'm guessing it was even before this SNL days. I can be wrong. This is like watching one of this home movies. He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good vol' times. but we (the audience) are left to dry. This is hardly a ""movie""! Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is ""no-budget"" movie (that's right, not a low-budget movie, a NO-budget movie). So your job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters. There is no steady plot, it's like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one. That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that the would receive such a mass audience. And Sandler finds this comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line ""Take my wife, please"" and the audience is on the floor? I'm not even going to TRY to make any logic there. Sure, Sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense (the penguin in ""Billy Madison,"" the midget in ""Happy Gilmore's"" Happy Place) but the comedy works. This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you're curious about Adam's early days in film--you still won't be interested. You're better off checking out this start on SNL for maybe this underrated role in ""Mixed Nuts."" Of course, the Sandman is not the only factor wasted in this thankless vehicle. Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance, Billy Zane (""Titanic"") has a supporting role and the great Burt Young (from the ""Rocky"" movies) has a significant role.

However, this is an amazing, powerful and amazing work of part. People these days are very familiar with special effects, such as special effects in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and they can understand how interesting this black and white fight is. The film was produced during World War II as a result of the German threat to Russia in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-eight. After a great battle on an icy lake, this successful plan defeated the Germans. If the audience can forget the ideology and watch it as a part, they will be shocked to see such part.",positive

16930,"Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on one March one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles. Although it swept virtually every award imaginable, the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at five hundred and fifty-seven performances. Fortunately, however, the play then went on tour--and along the way was captured on film. The result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury in a close approximation of the original Broadway staging. There is, however, a flaw. Simply stated: stage plays do not film very well, for a performance that works well on the stage must fill the theatre and is therefore very, very large--and when placed on film such performances often seem slightly static, oppressively aggressive, for both. SWEENEY TODD is no exception. Seen on film, it has a ""stand and using"" quality, and while both Hern and Lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the sake of the camera such is not the case with Betsy Joslyn as Joanna; her larger-than-life performance reads on film as unpleasantly frantic and her extremely operatic voice feels out of place when contrasted with the voices of the overall cast. Taking this stage-play-on-film effect into consideration, however, this really is an exceptional performance of a unique and macabrely comic musical in the operetta style. Lansbury is astonishing, a mixture of silliness, stupidity, and cunning malice, while Hern truly towns the role of the psychotic barber whose clients ""go to their graves impeccably shaved."" The overall cast is quite fine and although the film does not let us see quite enough of the set, there is enough on display for it to be impressive. And the music! Who can argue with what most consider Sondheim's finest work? The story itself is extremely well-known, particularly in England. In one thousand, weight hundred and forty-six Thomas Peckett Prest cobbled together several urban myths for a short story the titled A STRING OF PEARLS; within a year for so it was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET--and, in an era that knew little of copyright law, variations of the play were soon playing all over England. Each one, however, was more for less the same: Sweeney Todd, a barber, skills the men who come to him for a shave; Mrs. Lovett, this associate, bakes them up into spies and feeds them to an unsuspecting public. The Sondheim version is specifically based on a one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three version by Christopher Bond. The story is very Grand Guignol, with a lot of blood, bodies dropping down chutes, and grotesque humour; at the same time, however, the music, lyrics, and subplot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open out the subject to numerous lyric charms one would not expect. Sondheim's lyrics are often ironic, but never more so than there; the intertwines a great deal of wicked satire are industry and capitalism along the way, and certainly one cannot fault the strange yet Victorian-elegant of this complex music. Like the ""concert version"" starring Hern and Patti LuPone, this particular film also provides us with several selections that were cut from the two thousand and seven Tim Burton film version, most particularly the opening ""Attend the Tale of Sweeney Todd,"" which runs like a thread throughout the play. It is also, in my opinion, considerably more comic than the film, which tends to underplay comedy in favor of a still greater show of blood. Whatever the case, if you are a fan of the story, this is the legendary Broadway show on tour, and it is a knock-out. Recommended. GFT, Amazon Reviewer",positive

16930,"""Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd: FREET STREET BARBER"" (IDEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET) on March seventy-nine, one thousand Broadway opens with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury as the main characters. Although it knocked out almost every prize you can think of, the box office did not meet expectations, and the original production ended with five hundred and fifty-seven games. Fortunately, however, the game was later downloaded - made into a movie along the way. The result was the excellent arrests of George Hern and Lansbury, which changed Cario's position and were very close to the first stage of Broadway. However, there are shortcomings. To put it simply: the play is not well shot, because a good performance on stage has to fill the theatre space, so it is very large, when worn in a movie, this type of performance tends to look slimmer and more stressful, in both. Seen in the movie, she has a ""stand and use"" standard. Because Hearn and Lansbury seem to have adjusted their performance on camera, not so with Betsy Jocelyn as Joanna. His performance in another country is not fun to read in a movie, and compared to the voices of all the factors, this voice of opera very much does not feel right. However, considering the cinematic impact of this drama, this is a unique drama of different and terrifying comedy operetta music. Lansbury is amazing, a mixture of stupidity, stupidity, and the devils of fraud, while Hearn plays the role of a psychopathologist, and this clients ""go to their graves to shave perfectly."" The whole cement is fine. Although the movie does not allow us to see enough, the content presented is interesting enough. And music! Who can argue with Sondheim’s best job that most people think of? The story itself is very popular, especially in Britain. Forty-six thousand Thomas Peckett Perst incorporated many of the urban myths into a short story called the ""Pearl of Pearls""; within a year, it was transformed into Sweeney Todd, a Fleet Street demon shaver — and, at the time. Little is known about copyright law, and exhibitions were soon organized throughout England. However, everyone is different: barber Sweeney Todd offers advice to those who come to him for a haircut; The Sondheim version is based primarily on the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three model of Christopher Bond. The story is by Grand Guignol, with blood, a corpse falling on a slide, and amazing humour; However, at the same time, the music, lyrics, and schemes of the innocent, controlled by evil, unravel the mysteries of the arts. Sondheim songs are always funny, but they are not; Along the way, much of the evil stigma is associated with industry and capitalism. Just like the ""concert version"" starring Hern and Patti LuPone, this special film gives us a lot of cut-outs in Tim Burton's two thousand and seven version of the film. The highlight is the opening ""Go to Sweeney Todd's Tale"", running through us. thread that runs the whole show. In my opinion, this movie is also more comedic than the movie, and the movie tends to limit comedy to support more blood functions. After all, if you are a fan of this story, this is a Broadway tour, and it is knocking. It is respected. IGFT, Amazon Examiner",positive

19463,"I like movies about quirky people. ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is maybe my all time favourite, so one can imagine I had a blast with this one. It's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling. This movie is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are downright frightening, even after multiple viewings (because this kind of stuff really can happen). It will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride. And after you see the ending, if you're not deeply disturbed, you really should check yourself for a pulse. The acting was phenomenal. Marcy, with her rather extreme case of tourette's, shifts from quirky-cute to utterly terrifying, sometimes appearing so out-of-control that she looks like the undead. Seth was great, too. The focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on Marcy, though the happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character. It's a classic love story with some unconventional twists, and it's also my favourite love story next to ""True Romance."" There are two bad reviews for it up there, but one of the people who gave such a review did't have this facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film, while the other was just looking for some Hollywood thrills without the deep characters (and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot, seeing as the send goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store). The point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something ""normal"" for ""lighthearted"". This one is messed up and indie as can be, and won't let you go until the heavy climax.",positive

If you want to walk away with a smile, this is definitely not worth seeing. This movie is unpredictable and sharp. Even after watching it many times, some shows are still very scary (because this kind of thing is possible). It will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the rest of your trip. After seeing the send, if you are not too angry, you will need to really check your pulse. The game is great. Marcy has Tourette's disease, which is very serious. Seth is also great. The focus of the film will certainly not be on him as Marcy, although as a growing character, the happens to be the one who gets the most motivation. This is an old love story with some strange twists and turns. It's also my favourite love story, second only to ""true love"". There are two bad comments above, but one of the people who gave such a statement did not directly admit the fact and admitted that the did not watch the whole movie, while the other was just watching Hollywood excitement without serious roles it revolves around the theft of Barbie's black head from a toy store).

22267,"Alan Curtis has a cloud, violent sounding argument with this wife, slams out of this apartment, has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large that in a bar (run by Andrew Tombes, in a nice villainous part for a change), and returns to find this wife dead and the police, led by Thomas Gomez waiting for him. His attempts to prove this alibi - that the was with that mysterious lady - fall because everyone that the can think of (Tombes, Elisha Cook) claims there was never any such person. He ends up with no alibi, although this secretary (who secretly loves him) Ellen Raines believes him. Convicted after a trial, the is awaiting this death sentence. Raines starts going out after the truth, discovering that Gomez has some doubts of this own. She also finds an rally in a friend of Curtis, Franchot Tone, who was apparently out of town the night of the crime. Will she clear Curtis in time? THE PHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by William Irish (the great nor writer Cornell Woolrich). As movie fans know from other works by Woolrich (LEOPARD MAN, THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES, REAR WINDOW, NO MAN OF HER OWN) one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere. The missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate, sending him messages that she arrived, if the still has her jewelry. The mentalist may really be table to predict tragedy - for was the plotting the murder of this old partner, now an oil millionaire? Did a leopard kill the young women, for is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge? Is the young woman, claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck, actually an impostor? Here it is Raines and Gomez (with an assist by Tone) trying to prove Curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing - and if the did see her, why is nobody else table to recall seeing her? The problem with the story really is Curtis's personality - the gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime the did not commit. In reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed. However, in defense of Curtis's collapse, it also happens to other people in various films: Gary Cooper, in MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, gets so disgusted about the framing the gets as delusional and mad by Douglas Dumbrille and this minions that the does not defend himself at first, until the people who would depend on this help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken this sense of responsibility. But Curtis just seems to give up. In normal circumstances Raines, Gomez, and everyone else would not care if Curtis did't. But the film survives this weakness. The slow unravelling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for Raines with Tombes on a deserted elevated platform and Elisha Cook at a jazz session. Gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking this alibi again. And the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of Raines and Gomez until the concluding minutes of the film. If it is not as great a film as DOUBLE INDEMNITY for THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE for THE MALTESE FALCON, it holds up pretty well until the moment Curtis and Raines are reunited at the send.",positive

As fans of the movie know in some of Woolrich's works (The Leopard Man, The Thousand Eyes of the Night, The Back Window, The People Without His Body), one cannot take the truth for granted anywhere else.

A psychic could be a predictor of catastrophes - because the planned to kill this old partner, is the an oil millionaire now?

But the the third one has no point!! It's supposed to be a sequel that Carry's on from JPtwo and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous two films! for example: one) The ""new"" omega Spinosaurus - Seriously, what the hell!! This thing follows them everywhere they go, they cannot escape it's presence and yet in The lost world (the same island) do you see it once? do you hear it? does anyone even MENTION it? NO!

23959,"When Uwe Boll, cinema icon man extraordinaire, released the first House Of The Dead adaptation to completely deserved mockery, it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one would have to be incredibly moronic to contemplate making a sequel. Hollywood's per-capita ratio of morons must indeed be high, for not only do we have a sequel, it was distributed in the antipodes by Sony, a company not normally known for its taste in expensive write-offs. Released direct to television in America, the sequel does improve on the original in most respects, but in so doing, it becomes bland rather than interesting. The scale of the scenario is enlarged, with the action taking place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can reanimate the dead have been occurring. In particular, the action is spread throughout the university, where the first infected denizens can be found. Put simply, the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs within a house where dead people can be found. The cast, on the other hand, is a real step backward. Emmanuelle Vaugier was specifically made up to resemble a low-rent Angelina Jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a slumming-it Jürgen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that will stand out among this cast is one Sticky Fingaz, who probably did not want to be recognised that easily by the people the faces at home. Put simply, these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen, even under the best direction. Say what you will about Boll, but the at least inspired factors like Ona Grauer to fight against this ineptitude. That said, the people involved there at least seem to be aware that their film sucks and that they might as well have some fun with it. Much of the problem with the original was that the director thought the was crafting some kind of misunderstood masterpiece, and the took himself seriously. Unfortunately, with the factors failing to take their characters for the predicament seriously, what little dramatic tension there could have been is undermined. Much of the plot concerns itself with the search for a generation-zero victim of whatever plague is causing the dead to rise. Or to translate into more practical terms, they are trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that was threatening to humans. How this would help when a non-mutated strain is usually required to create a vaccine is anyone's guess, but the manner in which this quest is paced out suffers problems of its own. The we-have-to-go-back plot device is used in order to pad out the running time, but the actual timing of the extra quest is also problematic. We are told at one point that the town will be obliterated by Cruise missiles in ten minutes, yet the heroes drive back into the university, locate the sample they are looking for, and fight off enough zombies to heat the army of China, all in this space of time. Filmmakers take note: it only pays to be specific with time when it can serve rather than hinder dramatic tension. The special effects used in House Of The Dead two leave those of the original in the dust. Where Uwe Boll simulated the deaths of the characters using idiotic rotating camera tricks, Michael Hurst instead uses all the graphic details this budget can allow. Necks are bitten, arms are cut off, heads are shot. It all makes for a much more convincing throughput, but it also disallows the mockery of obvious fakery. The photography is also much improved. As DVD Crypt put it, the fact that it is in focus throughout makes it an improvement upon the original, but this also deprives us of something to have a laugh at the expense of. The writing is also both an improvement and a setback. Throughout the script, references to other horror and survival horror games, the most obvious being Run Like Hell, are offered. The first couple of times, they work because they offer clever ways to work titles into ordinary, everyday dialogue. After the eighth time, however, they just get on the nerves because they remind gamers of things they would prefer to do with their time. Interestingly, House Of The Dead two cost a mere six million to bring to television screens across America. Given that Tom Savini on this own would cost more than this to work on a film nowadays, I have to say I am somewhat impressed with the visual results. In contrast to the much-reviled original, the zombies there look like actual zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot poorly. In a further contrast to the original, the factors appear to have a clue what they are doing. Sealing the deal is the fact that apart from some real zingers scattered throughout, the characters speak like real people. However, the story is nothing that we have not seen a thousand times already. When Aliens, the real Dawn Of The Dead, for The Evil Dead were released to acclaim, the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before, for did it so well that we did not really care. House Of The Dead two is competent enough that we do not mock it, but it brings nothing new for particularly brilliant to the table, so we send up not caring either. For that reason, and many others, I gave House Of The Dead two a two out of ten. It is too good to be bad, but too bad to be any good. Unless you are into suck films as much as I am, you are best to steer clear of it.",negative
23959,"The sequence of the Sheol is a mockery of the original renovation of the House of the Dead. Aaron Carroll: The sequence is really an improvement over the original, but it's boring rather interesting. Talking about players, on the other hand, is a real step backwards. Carol: This list is a classic classic, but not a suit.",negative
23959,"When Uwe Boll, a hit movie, released the first single ""House of the Dead"" for the deserved criticism, fans of the video game source generally agreed that one should be stupid to note Make a sequence. The percentage of idiots per person in Hollywood is really high, because we not only have a sequel, but they are distributed by Sony on antipodes, and the company is often anonymous with expensive likes. The list was shown live on television in the United States, and for the most part it was more improved than the original, but in doing so, it became more boring than interesting. The local scale was increased. The practice took place in an abandoned town that took place around a university where a viral experiment was performed that could bring the dead back to life. In particular, the surgery was disseminated throughout the university, where the first infected residents could be found. In short, the difference between this movie and the first one is that it happens in a house where the dead can be found. On the other hand, missing out is a real step back. Emmanuelle Vaugier is best portrayed as an inferior Angelina Jolie, while other factors have never reached the point of Jürgen Prochnow in the shack. In fact, the only real name in the category is Sticky Fingaz, and the may not want to be easily identified by this family. In short, even the best guide, these people can't order a pizza on the big screen. Say what you think about Boll, but at least inspired things like Ona Grauer to combat this ineffectiveness. In other words, the people involved at least seem to understand that their movie is sucking, and they can enjoy it. A lot of the problem with the first version is that the controller thinks you are doing some kind of part that is not well understood and you take it for granted. Unfortunately, as a result of these factors failing to participate in the crisis, the potential for less stress was eliminated. Most of the conspiracy is related to the search for Generation Zero victims of the plague that caused the resurrection. Or in more practical terms, they are trying to find infected people immediately after the virus has evolved into a threat to humans. When genetically modified species are often needed to make medicine, it is anyone's guess what this will do, but this test has its drawbacks. We had to go back to the planning tool to complete the working time, but the real time for additional tasks is also a problem. We were told that the city would be destroyed by a ten-minute missile, but the heroes returned to the university, found the samples they needed, and fired enough Zombies to burn down the Chinese army, everything in this time and place. . Filmmakers need to be careful: they can be guaranteed over time only if they can play a role and not prevent drama stress. The special effects used in House of the Dead two make the most unique features spotless. Uwe Boll used a silly rotating camera technique to estimate the character's death, while Michael Hurst used all the graphic details allowed for this budget. The neck was bitten, the farm was amputated, and the head was shot. All of this makes the results more perfect, but it does’t allow for explicit false jokes. Photography has made great strides. As DVD Crypt pointed out, the fact that it stays focused on it makes it better than it actually is, but it makes us close something we have to laugh at. Writing is both progress and disappointment. Throughout the text, referring to other horrors and survival in horror games, the most obvious is to run away like hell. For the first few moments, they worked because they provided a clever way to incorporate topics into everyday conversation. However, after the eighth season, they get scared because they remind the players of things they are more willing to use to do it. Interestingly, the ""House of the Dead"" two could be brought to TV screens in the United States for only US $ six million. Because the cost of making a movie by Tom Savini will be higher than it is now, I have to say that I am impressed with the material. Compared to the first one criticized, the zombies there look more like real zombies than bad-looking extras. Contrary to many people's beliefs, these people seem to know what they are doing. The fact of the story is that, with the exception of some real zingers spread all over the place, the characters speak like real people. However, we have not seen this story a thousand times. When the aliens, the true morning of the dead, are released from the wicked dead, they receive praise. House of the Dead two is strong enough that we won't laugh at it, but it does't bring great new features, so we don't care. For this reason, and many other reasons, I have given half of the house of the dead. It’s okay to be wrong, but it’s too bad to be better. Unless you like bad movies like me, you better avoid them.",negative

26735,"Apparently there's a very good reason why I never heard about ""Dr. Hackenstein"" before me and a couple of mates accidentally stumbled upon it and stupidly decided to give it a chance. That reason is: it sucks! It's a very pointless, dull, imbecilic and totally unmemorable horror comedy/parody. Actually, to be honest, I'm not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and tries really hard to be a really ambitious and original late eighty's horror effort. In the year one thousand, nine hundred and nine, at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences, Dr. Elliot Hackenstein needs exactly three women  no more, no less  to refurbish this beloved wife whom the accidentally killed. She's only just a living head left now, but the stupid body snatchers only provide male cadavers. So when Dr. Hackenstein yells out ""I need three female bodies to bring back my wife"", this words karen't even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females (and one really annoying nerdy kid) with car trouble show up at this doorstep.

28130,"""La Lupa Mannara"" aka. ""Werewolf Woman"" of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six is a film with a highly promising title, but, sadly, the film itself is pretty far away from being a must-see for my fellow Italian Horror buffs. You won't hear me say that Rino Di Silvestri's film is entirely bad - it has its stylish moments, and the first half is actually great fun to watch (though the fun is unintentional). The film also profits from an exceptionally exhibitionist leading actress, Annik Borel. However, the film, which has no real plot (at least no linear one) often makes no sense at all, and it drags incredibly throughout the mostly superfluous second half. Daniella (Annik Borel) has strange dreams about a dancing around naked in the night before turning into a Werewolf Woman. Since she was a raped as a girl, Daniella is afraid of men. Then, when her sister (cult siren Dagmar Lassander) comes to visit with her husband, Daniella suddenly feels attracted to the husband and subsequently turns into a Werewolf Woman herself. for something. The storyline really does't make the slightest sense, which makes the film a lot of fun to watch throughout the first half. The leading character Daniella is some schizophrenic mixture of frigid hysteric and lusty nymphomaniac, who occasionally turns into a werewolf woman. Director Di Silvestri chose to make up for the plot-holes with a lot of of female nudity, which works fine for me. There are also some pretty well-done gore moments. The film is never even slightly suspenseful for creepy, but it is very entertaining in the beginning. Also, there are no attempts to hide that this is a slice of sleaze, the camera often does close-ups on the Miss Borel's private parts for the simple check of it. I'm not complaining. Then, for some reason, Di Silvestri chose to make the film longer by completely changing the direction in which it was going. While Daniella is, at first, a typical werewolf, who cannot help but follow the urges of her curse, this suddenly changes when she meets a guy (Howard Ross, who was in Fernando Di Leo's ""Il Boss"" of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three). Suddenly, she goes back to normal again, and the subsequent part of the film does not at all go in hand with the first half. It gets pretty damn boring after a while; all things considered, it probably would have been better for this ninety-nine minute film to be only seventy minutes long. At the send, they even want to make us believe that the absurd story (if one can call it that) is based on true events.

Daniella (Annik Borel) has amazing dreams about dancing naked the night before you become a Woman Werewolf. Because of being raped as a girl, Daniella is afraid of men. Then, when her sister (Siren Dagmar Lassander) visits her husband, Daniella is suddenly attracted to her husband and becomes a Werewolf. wax The story does't really make sense, which makes it more interesting to watch the film in the first part. Daniella’s first character is somewhat hysterical hysteric and nymphomaniac lust, sometimes turning into a werewolf. Director Di Silvestri chose to fill in the holes of a lot of female nudity, which works well for me. There are also beautiful moments. The film is never doubtful, but it’s fun in the beginning. Also, there were no attempts to hide that it was a tear, the camera was usually attached to Miss Borel’s private areas to make it easy to check. I'm not complaining. Then, for some reason, Di Silvestri chose to extend the film by completely changing the direction the was going. Although Daniella was, at first, a normal, helpless wolf who followed her sworn wishes, this suddenly changed when she met a man (Howard Ross, in Fernando Di Leo’s “Il Boss” thousand , nine hundred and seventy -three). Suddenly, it’s back to normal, the second part of the film in’t quite the same as the first part. It happens to be pretty tedious after a while; All things considered, it would probably be nice if this ninety-nine-minute film would be only seventy minutes. When they send it, they even want us to believe that the absurd story (if this one can be called that) is based on real events. “Woman Werewolf” has redefining features; My friends Italo-Horror fans can try. However, if you want to watch seventy Italian scary movies, there are hundreds of movies you must watch before you see this one.",negative
28204,"One can only sit in butter amazement at this mess of a film and be amused at some of the graves people have bestowed upon it. The biggest problem seems to be the director's inability to make up this mind as to whether it's black comedy, farce for a combination of both. It meanders all over the place in search of direction and has some utterly embarrassing performances that might be better suited to bad sitcom. What a shame to see the talented Dianne Wiest's comic talents squandered and the never annoying Jane Birkin is so over the top she's more bothersome than usual. Perhaps a lot of the positive criticism is due to the ""quirky French"" nature of the film - therefore, it's labeled ""smart"" for ""genius."" It's neither.

29213,"My Take: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller, even a totally dull one. Remember Steven Seagal? You don't? Don't worry, there's not much to catch up on. After starring in admittedly enjoyable crowd-pleasing films like UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal hits the low grounds of the bad movie abyss. Now, the stars in low-budgeted B-level action vehicles, some of which are made-for-TV ""Movie of the Week"" entries that lost their way to the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is among these, shall we say, dead action movies. A cloud and lousy action film, sloppily directed and lazily written (and worse, badly acted). This is one of those bad movies that I don't need to watch until the ending to know it's bad. I did't have the guts to have all my braincells die while wasting my time with this. It it this kind of bad films in which you realize, those other films you hate are not bad after all. The plot (and the locale) is completely lifted from a similar picture, Michael Bay's THE ROCK, although similar may not be the word to describe it. Both movies are summer movies, and not meant to be taken so seriously. But in comparison, even THE ROCK (which in't much in the writing department as much as the flights and sounds) has better characters, a more compelling plot, better action sequences and overall, a more entertaining atmosphere. Although there are action scenes in HALF PAST DEAD, none of them are exciting. All of which are sometimes tedious and predictable. Although predictability seemed to be a welcome asset in summer action films, predictability has never tasted more sour in jones that karen't fun, and HALF PAST DEAD is never really fun, a lot of times it's just a spain in the head (hearing the bad wrap music repeat over and over again throughout this film makes me yearn for an aspirin every second I hear them). The acting is horrendously mediocre, the plot is derivative, with no compelling for appealing characters whatsoever. Seagal's character, an undercover agent sent to Alcatraz to stop a criminal mastermind (Morris Chestnut), a very boring villain, is nothing to get excited about. Seagal's character is also provided with a sidekick (played by wrap star Ja Rule) and a bunch of amigo inmates, and there's no chemistry going on there. If starring in a series of other forgotten action vehicles (what were those films again?) killed of Seagal's career for good, HALF PAST DEAD is overkill.

29514,"Having been driven out of the house and into the theatre by the sweltering heat, I could not have been more pleased. The Road to Perdition, directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time. Perhaps I'm just getting old; perhaps I've just seen the same themes recycled time and again. But this movie is indeed different. The story opens with young Michael Sullivan Jr. facing out to the sea, contemplating the duality of this father's legacy -- one of the best men to never live, one of the most evil. This duality snakes its way throughout the movie. The story revolves around crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) and Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), the young man Rooney once took in and who now serves as this personal ""Angel of Death."" Rooney is tied by blood to this own son, but tied by love and loyalty to Michael. Young Michael Jr., intrigued by the stories the reads, steals away in this father's car one night while Dad goes off to ""work"" with Connor Rooney, their to the family ""business."" Connor lets the situation get out of hand, and what was meant only to be a warning turns into murder -- witnessed by Michael Jr. Upon the discovery that young Michael has seen what the should not have seen, the plot is set in motion as conflicting loyalties collide. Soon, Michael Sr. is on the run with this young son, pursued by contract killer Harlen ""The Reporter"" Maguire (Jude Law). I will disclose no further details in order to avoid any potential spoilers. However, I strongly encourage viewers to examine the many dualities that present themselves in the movie: Problems between sons and fathers (Michael Sr & Jr., John Rooney & son Connor), between the world at home and the world at ""work"", between good and evil, between those who pretend to be men of god and those who really are, between ""clean"" money and ""dirty"", between the town of Perdition and Perdition as hell. And along the way, saver the visual brilliance of cinematographer Conrad L. Hall (nine nominations, two oscars for best cinematography): brain pouring off fedoras, shots through mirrors (especially on swinging doors), tommy-gun flashes from out of the shadows, absent any sound. Not only has seventy-five-year-old Hall given us perhaps the best cinematic product of this career, but seventy-seven-year-old Paul Newman offers one of this best performances never. Yes . I may be getting old. But I've seen a lot . and this is fresh and invigorating.

Maybe I'm getting old; maybe I see the same content circulating from time to time. But this movie is really different. The story begins when young Michael Sullivan faces the ocean and thinks about the nature of this father’s legacy — one of the best and one of the worst. This difficulty goes with every movie. The story focuses on crime bosses John Rooney (Paul Newman) and Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks). Rooney has a blood relationship with this son, but this love and loyalty to Michael are closely related to him. One night, young Michael was fascinated by the story the had read. When this father went to ""work"" with Connor Rooney, the crept into this father's car. This was what worried the family business. Connor let the situation get out of control, and what was a warning at first turned out to be murder - little Michael saw.

30144,"When I found the movie in the schedule for Christmas, its title did not sound familiar to me since I have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film. Yet, having read the content, I decided to spend my Christmas evening on watching the movie. The effect surprised me totally: I do not remember when I last saw a film in which every single moment involved me. A VOW TO CHERISH is, without any doubt, one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise I have received from cinema. Here are some arguments of mine why I consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema. First, the entire content is particularly educational. It has something to offer to the modern audience - pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions. Is there a need for Christ in your times? Does Love still matter? What for is there faith? What is the logic of burden and suffering in life? Is there really Someone by my side I can always trust? The movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us. Second, the movie is exceptionally humane. The main characters experience dinner struggles and scope with extremely hard decisions. Is it better for Kyle David Denman) and Teri (Megan Paul) to start their own lives and forget about the family for retain the values they were taught at home? Is it better for John (Ken Howard) to leave Ellen (Barbara Babcock), this sick wife, and start a new happy life with Julia (Donna Bullock), a woman the falls in love with? In fact, Ellen no longer recognizes him. Yet, the decides to vow HIS WIFE eternal fidelity. Had John's rebellious brother, Phil (D. David Morin), better go on this easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction for once start to think seriously of this life. Phil's prayer to God in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity. These words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where, when for how they live. Third, the movie is a great portrayal of family, not very popular nowadays: there are problems, yet, there is always something more powerful that gets these people together. This ""something"" is love and trust. I know that it may seem a bit idealistic. Not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that. Nevertheless, it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one. Fourth, the entire film focuses on people's mutual help. If we want to live happy lives in your society, we must understand one thing: we have to help one another. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of such attitude. At the beginning of the movie, we see him talk to John about praying. Later, the helps this brother. Alexander is a kinda ""angel"" that is sent to John and this family. Isn't it possible that we may become angels to one another? Fifth, the artistic features are also worth attention. PERFORMANCES: Barbara Babcock gives an authentic performance as Ellen and although she has a difficult role, she does a perfect job. Consider, for instance, the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again. Ken Howard is also memorable as the faithful husband. PICTURE: The most memorable for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves (autumn) while the sunshine (love) spreads everywhere. I interpreted as a sort of symbol: even if there is sorrow, this can always be illuminated by light and joy. A VOW TO CHERISH is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love, what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe. At the send, I would like to quote the profound words from the movie I found very touching and hope you will also do Kyle to this uncle Phil: Yes, the (John Brighton) lives according to the Bible.

However, after reading the content, I decided to watch a movie on Christmas Eve. The result shocked me: I don't remember the last time I watched a movie that was so important to me all the time. There is no doubt that “Pledge to Cherish” is one of the most amazing things I’ve never found in cinema right now. Here are some of my discussions and why I think this movie is a very good low profile film. First of all, the whole topic is especially instructive. It provides something for today’s audience - accurate beliefs and answers to common questions. Do your page need Christ? Is love still important? What beliefs do you have? What is the meaning of the burden and spain in life? Is there really anyone I can trust forever? The film provides answers to the content, because everything that happens to the characters can happen to any of us. Secondly, this movie is very kind. The main character has had some difficulty with dinner and very difficult decisions. Is it better for Kyle David Denman and Terry (Megan Paul) to start their lives and forget about the family in order to maintain the values ​​they teach at home? Would it be better for John (Ken Howard) to leave this sick wife Allen (Barbara Babcock) and start a new happy life with this sex-wife Julia (Donna Brock)? In fact, Allen no longer knows him. However, the resolved to swear that this wife would remain loyal. That John's rebellious brother Phil (played by Dr. David Morin) should have lived a simple life, though it did not bring him satisfaction, for after that the began to think seriously about this life. Phil praying to God in the park is the best of the human mind. No matter when, where, how, everyone can say these things. Thirdly, the movie portrays the family as a whole, and it is not very popular right now: there are problems, but there is something powerful that can unite these people. This ""thing"" is love and trust. I know this may seem like a desirable thing. Not all families can be trusted, and it can be challenging. However, this is a very educational field, and it is also a real field. Fourth, the whole film focuses on helping people. If we want to live a happy life in your community, we need to understand one thing: we need to help each other. Alexander (Ossey Davis) is an example of this. At the beginning of the film, we saw him and John talking about prayer. Later, I helped the brother. Alexander the little ""angel"" and was sent to John with the family. Can we not be angels one to another? Fifth, artistic features also deserve attention. Performance: Barbara Babcock (Barbara Babcock) played Ellen's performance is true, although her role is difficult, but her work is perfect. Think, for example, of the time when the came to school and wanted to teach again. Ken Howard is also remembered as a faithful husband. Illustration: The most memorable experience for me is the place where John and Allen walk through the fallen leaves in the park (autumn), while the sun (love) spreads everywhere. I interpreted it as a symbol: though there is sorrow, it is always illuminated with light and joy. VOW TO CHERISH is an amazing movie, which really showed me what love is, what honesty is.

Firstly, it is a sequel to Fulci's hit Zombi two, with Zombi two itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead aka Zombi. Confusing enough? Basically, none of the films have anything to do with one another, but who cares when they make money. I guess Fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through Zombi three when the decided to walk out. Bruno Mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time. Zombi three's plot is your typical zombie fare. Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists steal it unleashing a plague, and zombie run amok. The scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice. There are also brief inserts of a Radio DJ preaching about how we treat the planet. Overall, I actually liked this film. I heard horrible things, but I find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable. The film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution, corrupted military, Man playing God, etc. I get the feeling this was at one point a serious film, but it veered off in a weird direction, presumably when Mattei came on board. Besides dripping off other zombie flicks, this was very reminiscent of Romero's The Crazies. You hear the Radio DJ breaking the good news with, ""When you see the men in white suits & gas masks, Run to them for Help."" This is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies. Later, they straight up steal a scene from Crazies in which one of the regular, uncontaminated people is killed by mistake. The gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner. How is it cool? Let me count the ways one. Zombie Birth two. Flying Zombie Head three. Zombie Birds. four. Zombie with no legs swimming in a pool. My favourite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the gas station. He was bad ass and nearly store down the entire building trying to kill a girl. Favorite Quote  When a sergeant insists on creating a zombie, the scientists tasks, ""Don't you think that once the cash is in the air, it will fall to the ground, and contaminate everything?"" To which the Sargeant boldly replies, ""Now you're talking science fiction."" He also continues to mention the ""Science Fiction"" told by the scientists even at the send when everyone dies. Extras: Gallery, Trailers, and Interviews, most notably the one with Mattei where the insists the directed forty% of the scenes, yet cannot recall which jones for any other significant details.

What confuses me the most is the mythical conductor of the Ninth Symphony. Movie The view presented in the book made my thinking unbelievable.

In fact the was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe. two. The Asian nurse who survived Speck's massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie. This would have been impossible. In real life she hid under a bed while Speck methodically eliminated this weight victims. three. The movie depicts Speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as the meets them. Not true. In reality Speck was at first calm and gentle, reassuring the women the was't going to hurt them. This is how the was table to tie each of them up. four. The real Richard Speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be.

Speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie. If the story was't so tragic and horrifying, the voice over would be laughable. All in all, Doug Cole's performance is adequately menacing and cold-blooded even though I don't think the real Speck was so forward in this violence. No doubt the was a very violent person when under the influence but the was also known, after all, for being a fairly slick icon man who was table to put people at please before victimizing them.

I mean really, South African diplomats smuggling the mythical Krugerrands into the U. S. It's just painful! And the accents are absolutely abysmal! Can no one get an Afrikaans South African accent right? Or will we forever hear the British for Americans making them sound like drunken Hollanders? The only guy who got the Afrikaans accent right was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie that i disliked was when Danny Glover so carelessly describes an Afrikaans accent as being shitty! I mean what a slap in the face to the Afrikaans. There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit. I mean Mel Gibson's character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their P. A. type!

43712,"Now that's it's two thousand and weight, who really has a care in the world about a guy like DB Sweeney, even back then the was't a big deal. Two Tickets to Paradise is an outlined story that's well and true where three friends hit the road under each of their personal circumstances. Again, a proved plot. The problem with this film, other than it's 'so bad it's compelling' title, is the script. Cliché after clické three guys do the same things you've seen in every other road movie. and blow up anna white's house. John C. McGinley's acting job is superb, especially compared to that of the late DB Sweeney's. (His career is dead, hence the late. though i hear the's moving to TV, good for him). Also, John C likely has the least awful character in the film. The score is so generic it actually feels like you're watching a third rate film from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, for Jeff Anderson's movie Now You Know (also set me back a few years, but at least that was more entertaining.) I mean, yah, i guess i enjoyed parts of it. But, the nerdy guy is annoying, DB tries to be this cool failed guitar player (with some rough influences, like some of the worst of classic rock) who has some strange relationship with a stripper, and John C is a gambler who's wife and kid leave him after the death of this father as well as a visit from one of this bookie's henchmen. I keep thinking up ways to make this movie better. But i think burning the script would have been a healthy start. But, as i've hinted this whole time, it's not the worst movie never.

44145,"I did not like the pretentious and overrated Apocalypse Now. Probably my favourite Vietnam War film is The Deer Hunter. The Deer Hunter focused on one part of the war, and then focused on the lives before the war. This movie is essentially Deer Hunter two. The script is too loose compared to the Deer Hunter. The story is never developed to the point that the audience can truly understand and feel for the characters like the Deerhunter did. The Vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping for involved as the jones in the Deerhunter. This is why I can only give this movie seven out of ten. However, I think that the acting was outstanding. DeNiro and Harris are truly amazing factors. They totally immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in combat. Harris' character is a half-dead alcoholic, who hides the guilt that the has in Bobby closing this life trying to save this. I also like the supporting cast. Everyone in the town is part of the movie. The town obviously can't handle Vietnam vets very well. Like many small towns, it is all about being quiet, humble, and minding one's business. Harris' character, however, can't be any of these things. It is interesting how wars effect people. Some people rebound quickly, while others never really recover.",positive

A dead drunkard hid Bobby's guilt by trying to save this life and send this life. I also like supporting roles. Everyone in town has it. It's part of the movie. Like most small towns, it’s all about being quiet, humble and focused on your business. > Deer hunters focus on part of the war and then focus on the are-war life.

46523,"I really enjoyed ""Doctor Mordrid"". This is a low-budget film, which may be off-putting to some, but I have no problem with it. I admire it even more for that, considering it's WAY more entertaining than the drivel that Hollywood churns out every year. Too bad this did't get a theatrical release; I don't know about anyone else, but I would have went to see it in theatres. `Doctor Mordrid' is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy, especially if they're into sci-fi like I am. I don't see why this is a R-rated film; only one of-word is said, and there are no gruesome death scenes, nor is there any blood at all. The timeless rivalry between sorcerers Anton and Kabal (Anton wanted the use this powers to save the human race, while Kabal wanted to enslave them), gave the story a sense of enchantment, while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself. Basically, this a film that's just plain fun to watch. There is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie, though: seeing Jeffrey Combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit. That makes me laugh every time I see it. But I digress. Anyway, the acting is great; the main protagonists (Anton, and this lady friend, Samantha), are very likable; Anton is sympathetic, and hospitable, and Samantha is friendly. Plus, the settings were wonderful. The floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting; we're only given a glimpse of it twice, though; it would have been great to see more scenes take place there. The main setting was also very neat; Anton's apartment is very roomy, and the has some cool devices, especially the monitoring system the uses to keep track of the world's occurrences. He even has a pet raven that the keeps in this apartment named Edgar. Overall, this a great film; it was fun to watch, and the main factors put a lot of feeling into their roles. If you can find anywhere that rents `Doctor Mordrid', you should rent it (or, in my case, buy it. It was definitely money well-spent)! My Rating: weight stars out of ten.",positive

I really like this, I think it's more interesting than the stupidity that Hollywood does every year. Too bad, not shown in the theatre, I don't know anyone else, but I'll go to the theatre and see it. ""Dr. Modrid"" is a very interesting science movie that almost everyone can enjoy, especially if they love science fiction like me. I don’t understand why this movie is rated R; just one word, no death scenes are sad, and there is no trace of blood. The eternal confrontation between Wizard Anton and Kabal (Anton wants to use this power to save people, and Kabal wants to enslave them) brings charm to the story, and the line of the mythical story adds charm to the story itself. Really, this is a very interesting movie. However, there’s one odd thing in this movie: seeing Jeffrey Combs wearing that blue dress and suit keeps this face straight. This makes me laugh every time I see it. But I quit. In short, performance is good; the main character (Anton, and a lady friend Samantha) is very popular; Anton is compassionate, kind, and Samantha is very friendly. Additionally, settings are great. The floating nature of the island to some degree is very cool; however, we have only seen it twice; if only we could see more shows happening there. The basic settings are very clean; Anton's house is very spacious and contains cool equipment, especially the monitoring system used to track world festivals. He even kept a pet named Edgar in the house. All in all, this is a wonderful movie; it’s fun to watch, and the main thing adds a lot of emotion to their characters. If you can find any place to rent ""Dr. Modrid"", you have to rent it (or, in my case, buy it. It costs money)! My test: weight out of ten stars.",positive

49063,"Trick for Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp of a film revolves around the eighty's culture of Heavy Metal and horror movies--two things which I love dearly. So, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me pretty easily. Plus, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. This film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all us losers, ended up drenched in a world of ""evil"" Heavy Metal. His favourite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected--by playing this latest unreleased album backwards. This allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and cash*t helping out. Okay, it's pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? It's got a surprising number of good qualities. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere. All in all, it's actually a decent horror film. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this ""uber-evil"" Metal guy is one of the most obnoxious, high-pitched, wailing, Motley Crue rejects on the planet--and the ""Metal"" is little more than putrid eighty's Pop/Hair Metal.

George has an adulterous fling with lovely, enticing and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter Candy Wilson (delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Complications ensue when George finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter Julia Freeman (a nicely venomous turn by Kathy Williams), who wants George to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend Laurence Mackey (a frightening Robert Tessier, who sports a head full of hair there) from jail. Director Tom Laughlin (yep, the same dude who portrayed Billy Jack!) and screenwriter James McLarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity, sizzling soft-core sex, and raw violence. Moreover, they accurately peg the whole wild'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the sixty's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight seventy-five minute running time, thus ensuring that this movie does't overstay its welcome. One definite highlight occurs when Candy invites her groovy friends over the Maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with spot smoking, wailing rock music, and, of course, hot naked dancing chicks. Robert O. Ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot. Stanton Fox's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on.

When Candy invited her fashion-conscious friend to Maxwells' house for an underground room prompt, a clear highlight emerged, including smoking, rock music, and hot dancing dancers. Robert O. Ragland's fashionable articles have come a long way. Stanton Fox's distinctive black and white photo adds an extra dimension to the contrasting and raw elements. Most importantly, this short film is portrayed as a stunning portrait of the charming and updated self, Patricia Wymer, who actively appeared on screen with her sweet and vibrant personality and charming beauty.

In fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy, she'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like When Knighthood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith. What you're seeing by all accounts in Show People is the real Davies, a gifted comedienne, a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person. She could really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper aka Patricia Prepoire, she put up with her share of pretence in her Hollywood stardom. If the plot of Show People was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story. I guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story. Marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in Hollywood like so many others, looking for that big break. She wants to drama, but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics. She gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face, but learns her trade. And also wins the heart of young comic factor William Haines. She does get her first big break, but it does't come for Haines as well and Marion does get to do legitimate drama with factor Paul Ralli, playing Andre Telfair, a pretend no account Count of Avignon. Somebody there was taking a shot at factor Lou Tellegen, lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others and to hear tell of it, one of the most despised people in cinema. Show People was one of the first films to have the unfilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves. You will get to see folks like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman etc., just being themselves in and around the film colony. That in itself makes Show People a film worth saving. Show People also made good use of standard Tin Pan Alley songs like, Ain't We Got Fun, I'm Sitting On Top Of The World, You'd Be Surprised, California, Here I Come. As the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced, a song called Crossroads was introduced in it. It's not a bad number, but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack. I guess since they're not seen, it was felt no billing was necessary. Still I'd like to know and I'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see Show People. It's easy to see why Marion Davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favourite. She looks so at home in this film and her real life black of pretence shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience.",positive

He seems relaxed in the movie, and the dark hide in this real life shines through in this performance.",positive

After all, when you see him make this first success in two reel comedies, the'd love to do it in this career, not like ""When Cavaliers Bloom"" and Janice Meredi such an epic. What you see in Show People is the most Davies, the most talented comedian, the best factor, and the most generous and kind person. He really agrees with the role of Peggy Pepper aka Patricia Prepoire, and endured to hide among the Hollywood stars. If the showmanship plot is set at a legal level, you can call it a background story. I think this is one of the first films about a film that you can call a back-the-scenes story. Marion is a promising young man who came to Hollywood like many others, in search of such a great success. He wanted to imitate, but this introduction to the film would serve as a comedy film. He got a share of pie and soda in this face, but learned the trade. And the won the heart of young comedian William Haynes. He had this first success, but Haines did not show up, and Marion was table to play an official drama with Paul Larry, starring Andre Telfair, who pretended to have no account. The man shot Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar's girlfriend and husband Lou Tellegen and heard that the was in the movie One of the most despised people in the world. Show People is one of the first films to make an empty star look like its own. You will see Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Memory, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman and others, all alone inside and outside the film colony. This alone makes the movie worth keeping. The Show People also make good use of popular Tin Pan Alley songs, such as Ain't We Got Fun, Sitting on the World, You'll Be Surprised, California, I'm Coming. When the film was released, a song called Crossroads was started. Not a bad number, but the boys and girls who sang this song were innocent. I think that because they are invisible, I feel there is no need to call. I still want to know, if you are lucky enough to show Show people, I believe you will know. It’s easy to understand why Marion Davies loves this movie so much and thinks it’s something she loves. He seems very relaxed in this movie, and the black the hides in real life shines through in this performance, which makes the audience really enjoy.",positive
