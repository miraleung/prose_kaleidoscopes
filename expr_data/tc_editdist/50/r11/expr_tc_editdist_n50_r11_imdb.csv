42678,"This movie was funny from START to FINISH. Everyone in the cinema was laughing out cloud throughout the film!! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the girl from Will and Grace) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters were't as funny even though the movie focused around them. All in all, this is a great movie to go and see with your girls (yes guys, it's a girlie movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!",positive
42678,"This movie is very interesting from beginning to send. Throughout the movie, everyone in the cinema is laughing in the cloud! ! The main characters are Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edy Cohen (Debra Messing, Will and Grace's daughter) and Manicurist Tanya (Di Bi Bi Mazar). They have good lines, the best attitude, and so on. Jada Pinkett is really fun to play lesbian, good and convincing. The only downside to this movie is that some of the main characters are not interested, even though the movie is around them. All in all, this is a wonderful movie you can watch with your girlfriend (yes, guys, this is the perfect girls movie!). Enjoy it! ! !",positive
21704,"This movie was way too slow and predictable. I wish i could say more but i can't. If you enjoy action/adventure films, this is not one to see. I'd suggest you go see movies like;Behind Enemy Lines with Owen Wilson and Iron Eagle with Louis Gossett Jr.",negative

21239,"This film got roasted by the boys at MSTthreeK, but it's actually a neat and nasty piece of low-budget film nor. The plot is tight, the characters are believable (within the good-boy-gets-obsessed-with-bad-girl genre), the spacing is solid, the climax is well-handled, and the cast is bolstered by several fine character factors. True, most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but the's actually quite effectively creepy when the plays the mastermind. The scenes between him and this dad are quite powerful, in a minimalist kind of way. Sure it's depressing, but that's the point. Good movie.",positive
21239,"This movie was impressed by the MSTthreeK boys, but it is actually a clean and unflattering movie, and it is not. The content is coherent, the characters are believable (for a good boy obsessed with the kind of bad girl), the space is solid, the climax is well managed, and the cement is supported by many great features. I want to hit the main character with bricks, but when the main character plays skilfully, this is a scary thing. The space between him and this dad is very strong, in a small way. Sure it's annoying, but the point is. An ideal movie to watch.",positive

True, most of the time you want to hit the main character with a brick, but it actually crawls when the genius plays. The scenes between him and her became very powerful, in a small way.

3423,"Without Kirsten Miller this project need't have been completed. However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it. It looked as if the other factors were only playing to her strong performance. Wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but this few scenes did't detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen but alas I was fortunate to rent it before it was lost.",positive
3423,"Without Kirsten Miller, this project would not have been completed. However, with the amazing beauty and talent of Miss Miller, I would definitely recommend it. It seems that some things play into this solid performance. Wagner's disturbing attempt to remember the movie is disappointing, but these places did not interfere with the entertainment. My criticism is mainly focused on writing and plot lines. Miller's lovely delivery and timing were vague and convincing. He shows a delicate line between self-confidence and control, but never annoys him, the’s actually the built engineer the claims. I wish I could see this on the big screen, but unfortunately I was lucky enough to rent it before it got lost.",positive

Other things seem to be playing out with this solid performance. Wagner's attempt to glorify the film was a bit disappointing, but these few scenes did not stop people from entertaining. Basically my critique goes hand in hand with the line of writing and conspiracy theories, the joint talent team did a brave job of saving what should have been a disaster. Miller's decent delivery and timing was vague and unbelievable. He plays a good line between arrogance and arrogance, but the never gets angry. He is actually the building engineer the claims.

3423,"Without Kirsten Miller this project would not have been completed. However beautiful and wonderful gift of Miss Miller I would definitely recommend. He seems to be playing other roles in this strong performance. Wagner’s ugly attempt to honor this film is a bit frustrating, but these little scenes karen’t that entertaining. Much of my criticism has to do with writing and drawing a plan, and the talented team mobilized did a hard job to save what should have been a disaster. Miller’s charming presentation and timing are incredible and convincing. He strikes the fine line between persistence and leadership but it does’t annoy him the is actually a building engineer and the claims that. I wanted to see it on the big screen but how lucky I was to rent it before it disappeared.",positive
32729,"I watched this film because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would give their sister a try, Rain Phoenix. I regret checking it out. She was embarrassing and the film just has this weird plot if that what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? I have never been so unsatisfied in my life. It was just total rubbish. I can't believe that the factors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. Have Sissy being 'beautiful' didst get to me. I thought she was everything but that. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHATS THE POINT??? zero out of ten, shame the poll doesnt have a zero, doesnt even deserve a one. Hopefully, Rain is better in other films, I forgive her for this one performance, I mean I would't do much better with that film.",negative

Shame, if you want to call it that, this movie has this strange plot. Sister is surprised little Doudou sits in the toilet and sleeps with an old man on the mountain what's the problem? I have never been so satisfied with my life. This is just rubbish. I don’t believe, I agree to make such a waste on film, money, time and place. Making Sissi ""beautiful"" did't affect me. I thought the was everything. The thumbs are just stupid. Why should we care if the can ride a hitch? What is an article? ? ?

It's just rubbish. I don’t believe that consensus points are made a waste of film, time and space. Let Sissy be beautiful she came to me. I thought the was everything but that. Those thumbs are just stupid, and why would we care if it could be whipped? WHAT ARE INSTRUCTIONS ??? at ten, the embarrassment of voting is zero, even if not worth one.

21995,"This was a very nice soft-core movie for both men and women. Plenty of nudity/sex, but without the overall branch you'll usually find. They could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning. Trust me guys, if you want to get your woman in the mood, get something with Bobby Johnston in it! And I'm sure lovely Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please PM me! I'd love to know. The photography was much better than usual. So was the story. Predictable, but nice, sweet natured and romantic. At the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts. I give this seven/ten!",positive

Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique will not share a location together, if you know what movies they have, please send me! I really want to know. Photography is better than usual. The story is the same.

31378,"There are certain scenes in this film (like the hero's first meeting with super-villainess Shirley Eaton) where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and doing its premise (females want to rule the world by making men slaves) justice, but it never dares to.

13860,"This has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films I have never seen. Merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence, sex, and a minimalist retelling of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and thick player of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times, but the use of texture, combined with the extreme contrast, create an incredible viewing experience. This film is not for everyone. I think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content, which if extremely rough, but does make a fairly important statement about creation, god and humanity.

If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film. unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes I know, bad writing. but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film.

37658,"A bad Quentin Tarantino trip off, at least I hope that's what they were going for because at least then I could respect the director for admiring Tarantino. One scene a ""singing"" scene with Rose McGowan is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director. So besides this Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and her one good scene this film sucked. Some of the crappiest dialogue I have never heard, I'm willing to bet why McGowan does't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been. Tries to be funny, never is, tries to be dark and in't, tries to be stylish and is just bland.

Trying to be interesting, never, trying to be black instead, trying to be fashionable and clear.

A video of Rose McGowan’s “song” is very good and clever for this film and it can only be a mistake for this director. Aside from the inspiration Quinton and Rose McGowan and a beautiful scene sucked up by this film. Some of the most interesting conversations I’ve heard, I’m willing to bet the reason McGowan does’t speak much is because this conversation is so ugly. He tries to be funny, never, the tries to be black without it, the tries to be elegant and obvious. Who prepares money to make films like this, hopefully it’s all the directors so no one else’s money is wasted. If not McGowan the whole cast is bad and when McGowan is your best hmm, I should be surprised.",negative

Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham, and Kirsten Storms around out the main cast, and they are all exceptional. This show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen.

The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well paired together. The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks. In a way it's curious how carson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right there in New York.

He was matched earnestly by a young Nick Robinson, who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with this mother. The script and music made it worth the buy, and you also see Thaw playing the morgan. Amazing!

However, I felt that there was a need for more authenticity in this part, focusing more on the character rather than the development of the character. Don't expect the black jokes and unexpected twists in this movie that you will find in ""Toto the Hero"" because you will be disappointed. However, the film still works as a decent film, if there are no flaws in it.",positive
32582,"Although the elements of the ""Eighth Day"" story seem to have been completed many times, the movie still has many sparks, mysteries, and the pattern portrayed by Jaco Van Dormal's first film. Although not as good as “Toto the Hero”, which will always be on my favourite list, this movie leaves us with a lot of emotions. Daniel Auteil, played this part from the unpopular ""cabinet"" of the two thousand and one song, which is feared to be tolerated (yes, if this is too important, the character could easily be ruined). However, I think this section should be realistic and more focused on the character itself rather than just growing up. Don’t expect the dark humour and unexpected things you get from the “Highes” to enter this movie, because you will be disappointed. However, this movie is still a good movie, even if it has no flaws",positive

While not as good as “Toto the Hero”, which will always remain on my list of favourites, the film still leaves us with a lot of emotion. Daniel Auteil, out of two, zero people with no taste in “The Closet” downplaying this part, fears that it is too much (actually, the paper can easily break if the issue is too tense). However, I felt that the part needed a little more realism, with an emphasis on nature rather than on the growth of nature. Don’t enter this movie relying on black jokes and unexpected rotations from “Toto the Hero” because you will fail. However, the film still serves as a transparent, if not mistaken, film",positive
47780,"With Harry Callahan getting up in years, the inevitable `old man with a chip on this shoulder' story had to come into play eventually. Callahan, looking fragile sometimes and out of place, this demeanour still was unwavering.

And I thought it was a really fun, great movie that makes you want to get up and dance. Alright, it was cheesy at times. but it's still a great movie. I can't believe Jennifer Grey was twenty-seven in this movie - my friend and I thought she looked about eighteen for nineteen - twenty at the most. I guess this is attributed to her acting talent. And she did really look awkward at times. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can tell the is in this thirties and seems a bit old. Nevertheless, still very good.

The characters are vague representations of the most disturbing people that any of us know. If the filmmakers tried to sell the film as a ""moving picture"", a lawsuit could be filed. No movement I tell the same ""story"" to couples who still have captions. The script is a joke. It's just bad. I doubt that any script doctor in the world can save him. My biggest regret is not that I spent sixty minutes of my life watching ""Money in Love"", but that I missed out on a great opportunity to be a leader. I may come out first, but I wait a long time.

Baby products should not be like this. Children’s movies can be as rocking and engaging as adult jones. The reason, “hey, for the kids,” is bullshit. I’ll take “Sword of the Stone” every day.

The performance is solid, no one can expect otherwise from McGanley's Morse, and the steering is fast and expensive. Personally, I find it difficult to link the comments from the previous post to the movie I saw. AWOL is aptly written by Shane Blake, it is a common occurrence to play this genre in honor of pulp legends, while at the same time blinding the audience and not taking them too seriously. Overall, AWO L is a very well made and entertaining film.",positive
25006,"The first ten minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and mpg-thirteen movies. These are the two reasons the movie is so bad. They constantly reference a movie called ""Get Leo"" which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty. Every time they do this, you will be really angry. Travolta in't very cool, neither is Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious. They karen't the kind of funny you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie though. If you haven't seen get shorty, you will probably like be cool. If you liked get shorty, you will leave the theatre wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.",negative

I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie was't nothing close to good, but it manages to keep you interested. What really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the factors. The movie is overlong, has't no ""nice"" shots and no scares, the dialog are dumb and the special effects are crap. The only things good are that, as i said, it keeps you interested ( i guess the book must be good) without using much horror cliches. My Vote four/ten.",negative

9987,"RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt all warm and tingly when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. To me, she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him. However, I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. In addition, I thought that Lurky (voiec of Pat Fraley) and Murky (voiec of Peter Cullen) were diabolical. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit.

11075,"I give this movie a three as it is worse than the cult movies that deserve a proper two. It does not make sense to you? Well, it does't have to. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase, incredibly idiotic plot, where space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) battle a space race of moron vampires. Does it get any uglier than this? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her stunning Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice!

The only help in this movie is Natassia Malthe, she has an amazing Norwegian beauty. God, I hope the brothers Michael Ironside and De Louis stop welcoming the stupid characters in the stupid movies!

7381,"Not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about 'Annie'. The characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production. It was very clearly made for TV, yet if I found it on my television, I would flick it straight over. The children in the film do an alright job, yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in. This film lacked the music/dance numbers that made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the Annie we all love. Johnson, as Annie is at times annoying and over acted. you cannot convince yourself that she truly is Annie. The differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film. Sad to say this sequel was a total flop.",negative

The kids in the movie have done a great job, but the performance of the adults is amazing, so this movie is not looking for you. The film has no music / dance figures that make the first work beautiful, and plays in the light of Annie, which we all love. Johnson, because Annie is sometimes annoying and does too much.
