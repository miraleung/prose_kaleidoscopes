247,"This movie was so bad it was funny! For awhile there I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la ""For Your Consideration""). The ""cliffhanger"" scene at the send had me laughing until my insides hurt. The script was dreadful enough, but coupled with Sean Young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fake shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing got made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star factors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions.",negative

612,"This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you haven't seen either movie and want to but don't want the spoilers, please don't read this review! While this movie is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the movie is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions. The factors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed. Neither can pull off the smarmy, snooty rich-kid attitude that the original factors did. It's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim -- not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the send of the movie? He supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with Reese Witherspoon's character). Also, the tie-in with the photography/""You could be a model"" comment at the send was totally flame and did't add anything at all. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can't believe they made a Cruel Intentions three.",negative

1217,"""Müllers Büro"" is a movie which many will watch and enjoy until the send, while others will stop watching it within five minutes. It is a parody of detective movies with all the twists and turns; the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city which resembles Batman's Gotham City (look carefully at the streets, buildings, the police car chasing the criminals, etc.). It is also a parody of musicals with its really funny characters such as Müller's secretary and Vitasek's (the factor playing Müller's assistant) lover who do their best to using, albeit not very successfully. The spaces occupied by the characters have their own presence in the film such as the decadent Blue Box (there is a real club with this name in Vienna) where one can see a sailor hitting on a girl in the background, Müller's apartment with the black paint smeared on the walls and the dirty kitchen, Müller's bureau with the sweet picture of this assistant, etc. The humorous moments in the movie are many and include ""flat in the face"" type of humour such as Müller farting in this assistant's face, the prostitute charging Müller extra for orgasm, the ridiculous outfits of the female thugs of Montana, etc. A legendary film from the eighty's especially for those interested in Austrian for German-speaking cinema.",positive

2923,"Kennedy-Miller could hardly have done a better job at tackling a very challenging exercise: making dry political events work as human drama, and providing an even-handed representation of explosively controversial subject matter. The key to its success on the first count is brilliant acting, although I was less impressed by Max Phipps' performance as Gough Whitlam than some other commenter there. The clear standouts for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the easiest casting choices in history - Hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. On the second count, the series avoids the ""myth of objectivity"" strap through a narrator who particulates the sympathies of the director (Phillip Noyce, who more recently demonstrated this left-wing credentials in Rabbit Proof Fence), while being carefully even-handed and sympathetic in its dramatic portrayal of all parties. The adherence to the Lady Kerr/Lady Macbeth theme popular among Labor partisans was perhaps a little partial, though not ruinously so. In particular, credit is due for the sympathy shown to Kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position the was placed in, whatever one might think of this actions. However, there is one sour note for which the producers were perhaps not entirely to blame - the portrayal of the Jim Cairns/Juni Morosi affair. Those who come to the series with no background to these events will get the impression that Cairns and Morosi were the innocent victims of a smear campaign by a prurient gutter press. The producers may have been restrained in this respect by Australia's stultifying defamation laws, and the recently demonstrated willingness of Cairns and Morosi to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would eventually admit to a year before this death). However, more could have been made of the bizarre fashion in which Morosi managed Cairns's office as Treasurer. Speaking of defamation, there are a couple of disorienting occasions where dialogue is obscured due to injunctions taken out by offended principals - by a beeping noise on one occasion, and a very cloud telephone bring on another. A further curiosity: the DVD release excises a line from the comic relief scene where a customs officer (played by the late Paul Chubb) serves Tirath Khemlani on this arrival at Sydney Airport. Next in the queue is a dishevelled looking hippie, who now receives only a disapproving glare from Chubb when the presents this paperwork. In the original version, Chubb said something along the lines of: ""drug bust in Bali, meh?"". Obviously this line no longer rings true in the wake of the Schapelle Corby case, which dramatically illustrated that those busted for drugs in Bali can expect far worse than deportation.",positive
2923,"This series is trying to turn boring political issues into a game for the people. It avoids the barriers of ""fictional fantasy"" by a narrator who improves the emperor's empathy. Persistence in the context of Mrs. Kerr / Mrs. The famous Macbeth among the Labor rebels may be on the same side.",positive
2923,"to act as a human drama and be a fiery controversial theme Provides effective performance. The key to its success in the first instalment was excellent performance, though I was very impressed with Max Phipps' performance as Gough Whitlam compared to other reviewers there. To me, the best are John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must be one of the simplest in history — Hunter cannot be more accomplished in this role. In the second episode, the series avoids the barriers of ""fictionalism"" and expresses the emperor's sympathy for the narrator (Philip Noyce, who recently showed this type of left wing certification in ""The Rabbit Proving Fence""), at the same time, is careful to remain neutral and sympathetic of all parties. Continuing to be loved by Mrs. It is especially commendable that no matter how people view this behavior, their empathy for Kerr and this adverse circumstances. However, there is a bitterness that may be of little importance to the producer - a reflection of the Jim Keynes / Junimorousi incident. Those who do not have a background in these events may think that Keynes and Molos were innocent victims of media insults. In this case, Australian pollution laws could restrict filmmakers, and Keynes and Morothy recently expressed their desire to apply these laws against those who say their relationship is sexually explicit (Keynes finally admitted a year before this death) for now). However, Moses 'unusual way of managing Keynes' office as a treasure trove could have much to do with it. Speaking of profanity, there were confusing times where the conversation was interrupted by an order issued by the offending principal - once a beep and another via a cloud phone. Curiosity: The DVD version removes the line from the comedy scene where the sales officer (played by the late Paul Chubb) serves Tirath Khemlani on arrival at Sydney Airport. Next in line is the unwanted hippie, now only getting a liter of Chubb's disapproval when submitting this document. In the original version, Chubb said the same thing: ""Drug violence in Bali, meh?"". Clearly, this line is no longer in place after the Schapelle Corby case, which is a clear indication that drug addicts in Bali may be worse off than deported.",positive

3015,"While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early one thousand, seven hundred and ninety's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home. Scenes are are-set from the novel, and lest we forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. For example, the film puts the big Darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a Neoclassical temple, as opposed to inside the Collins' parsonage: Why did Jane Austen put it in the parsonage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total, if brutal honesty to each other in this scene, the Collinses have never shared an honest word. Why the brain and the outdoor proposal? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama, one expects her to cry, ""Heathcliffe"" at any minute! Austen has been Bronteized! Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant factor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that this terrible dancing with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another favourite of mine from MI-five on A&E; in P&P, however, the is more the young Heathcliffe, never smiling--though Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit, and she realizes this when she sees this wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley--a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust. And much of Austen's dialogue is changed to modern speech. Mr. Bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear, it deviates from Jane Austen's novel so much that any student who watched it, thinking she could substitute viewing for reading, would fail!",negative
3015,"Timothy Stanley: We do not see Jane Austen's arrogance and prejudice. Stanley: The film was somewhat repetitive in the early one thousand, seven hundred and ninetys. It is said that this film puts a great deal of perspective on Darcy's proposal in the storm in front of the temple. Stanley: The sound of this movie is fantastic, but we haven't seen the whole novel yet.",negative
3015,"Matthew MacFayden is one of my favourite MI-fives in A&E; however, in P&P, very little Heathcliff did not smile — even though Austin is in a novel in the center of attention, Dutch. Lizzie smiled broadly, and when she saw the smiling picture in Decemberley, she realized that it was a marble statue inscribed on the movie for some reason. For some reason, the film dates back to the early one thousand, seven hundred and ninetys, instead of a period of revival in the origins of the novel presented by scholars for a long time. Most importantly, although these are good movies that you should watch and listen to, they are so different from Jane Austen's novel that any reader who has seen them think they can use watching instead of reading, but He will fail! However, Bennett in this novel is a class of gentlemen; they have a farm, but the pigs do not move around the house, they do not have farm manure and chicken manure near the house. While the new Strike and Election movie is pretty good and its sound is pretty good, we don’t see Jane Austen’s selfishness and prejudice. The show is set in a novel so we don’t forget that Jane Austen put a place somewhere for a reason. For example, the movie puts a great view of Darcy's proposal in a storm in front of the neoclassical temple, instead of entering the priest Collins: Why did Jane Austen put it in the priest's house?",negative

4057,"I had a check of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. First off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this milk. Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in your lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking film in many ways. However, don't be too fooled by its real intent. It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with this aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together this dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. One other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.",positive

6588,"The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final routing for super-spy Jason Bourne, a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer. The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an eighty-five/one hundred on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is ""universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing. First, I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to Ultimatum. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like I was. You will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of Ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion. If you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching Bourne take down this enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy. Jason Bourne is played very well by Matt Damon. Damon does nothing to deserve an Oscar nod, but this work there is good enough to hold it's own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. The agency tracking Bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down. I won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. However, it would't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. Ultimatum would't have been charmed at all if the story was a little more up front. It seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $sixty-nine million, and -box office total now is up to $two hundred and sixteen mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August three. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free for Die Hard. Good) Damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie Bad) Story is like many others",positive

The Byrne series is one of the most popular trilogy by critics. deep and very interesting. First of all, I highly recommend you watch ""Bourne Identity"" and ""Bourne Hegemony"", which are the two main elements of ""Ultimatum"". There may be three different movies, but in reality they all go on and on: one missing one makes you close out like me. If you missed the first two, you will love the action and fighting the last scenes, but the story will certainly cause some confusion. If you are lucky enough to see it in the prequel of this movie, you can feel the excitement of watching Bourne defeat these enemies and follow the people who distracted him from hegemony. Jason Byrne played well with Matt Damon. Damon does't have the right Oscar nomination, but your work is enough to have your work done. Bourne's adventures took place in many different cities; the change in these cities was enough to make the movie sometimes clear. Bourne's adoption agency uses all the technological tools known to man to track him down. I’m not going to go into the details of the characters because it’s a continuation of the first two movies. However, clarifying certain things to the audience will not cause charm to the film — not all viewers of the movie, have a little understanding of the growth of the story. If the story is short in advance, the ultimatum will not be drawn. Most people seem to agree that the final decision is a success for the movie: the film's first box office reached $ sixty-nine million, and - now the total box office is worth $ two hundred and sixteen million - in a movie sold since August three. . This is the most authentic movie I've never seen so far with Living Free from Death. Okay) Damon is strong but not very attractive, very intelligent. Wrong) The story is similar to many others.

After Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small North Carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for Jude and this photo souvenir of the girl the left behind, it's a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether the will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with this soulmate. Who cares? Philip S. Hoffman's amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to Renee Zelweger's appearance as a corn-fed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of Kidman's lonely farm to save the day. Rarely has a performance screamed of ""look at me, I'm acting"" smugness. Her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the longuers for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin. Released by Miramax strategically for Oscar and Golden Globe (what a farce) consideration, the Weinsteins apparently own, along with Dick Clark, the critical community and won weight Globe nominations for their overblown failure.

Pete is still the same old meanie, but the looks a bit different. In this famous episode, on board a little steamboat, Mickey, Minnie and some side characters have a great deal of fun and a great deal of annoyances.

I like the animation, the steamboat and music theme, the clever gags - and of course, Mickey and Minnie! Like many early cartoons, this is very random, Walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to ""gear"" it along. There is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary. These are the things I do not like about it.

7956,"Directed by the duo Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto ""Meatball Machine"" is apparently a remake of Yamamoto's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine movie with the same name. I doubt I'll never get a chance to see the original so I'll just stick commenting on this one. First of what is ""Meatball Machine"" ? A simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore. It's not something you'll send up writing books about but it's nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema.""Meatball Machine"" follows the well known plot. Boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date. Boy finally meets girl. Girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg. Boy, in turn does also transform into said thing, and goes on a quest to save this love. Will the succeed? Who gives a damn, as long as there is carnage and death I'm satisfied. The plot is simple, relatively clickéd but it does it's job well enough setting the movie's course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. There is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives. And yes it too luckily shows more violence. I'm happy. Acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film. It's not exactly painful for the years but it's not exactly good either. The movie's main attraction besides the violence and gore (like I haven't mentioned that enough already) are the cyborg designs. Done by Keita Amemiya who's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video-games is well known. The necroborgs as they are called in ""Meatball Machine"" look stunningly detailed. Without the usage of CGI Amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal, painfully awesome in their appearance. Able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws, rocket launchers, blood-firing shotguns and so on and so on. Though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, necroborgs are A-movie class.""Meatball Machine"" is ""Tetsuo The Iron Man"" mixed up with ""Alien"" all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode. It's an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking.",positive
7956,"""Meatball Machine"" is a lockable business movie with excellent decorations and moving results. In addition to violence and bloodshed, the main attraction of this movie is cyborg design. The design outside of CGI Amiaia is an amazing combination of flesh and metal.",positive
7956,"""Meatball Machine"" directed by Judai Yamaguchi (battlefield baseball) and Junichi Yamamoto is clearly the one, nine hundred and ninety-nine film Yamamoto of the same name. I suspect that I will never have a chance to see the actual report, so I will stick to this comment. First, what is a ""meatball machine""? A simple movie to analyse a low-cost budget, full of the effects of beauty and blood. It's not something you can write a book about, but if you're into this type of movie, it's still interesting. The ""meatball machine"" follows a well-known conspiracy. The boy loves the girl, but the is not good enough to date her. Eventually the boy met the girl. The girl was infected by an alien creature, who turned her into a deadly robot. The boy, on the other hand, became obsessed with her, and continued to want to keep this love. Will it succeed? Who cares, as long as there is murder and death, I am satisfied. The plot is very simple, just click, but it does a good job, pushing the movie system directly into the bloody conflict between the two main characters. There is a plan that focuses on how the virus that infects girls enters their lives. Yes, fortunately it showed violence. Very happy. Doing something you would expect from a splash movie without a budget. It has’t been painful at all for years, but it’s not very good with it. In addition to violence and bloodshed, the main attraction of this movie (as I haven't said enough) is robot design. Completed by Keita Amemiya, she makes unique creations and costumes for movies and video games, popularly known. The person called Necropolis in the ""Meatball Machine"" looks very detailed. The design outside of CGI Amiaia is an amazing combination of flesh and metal, and the look is awesome. It can turn various body parts into cool weapons, such as saws, rocket launchers, guns, etc. While you can easily see how cheap this movie is, Necropolis is an A-level movie. The ""meatball machine"" is a blend of ""Iron Man Iron Man"" and ""Aliens"", all in a low budget and additional acuphup mode. This is a very interesting movie that ignores the special effects of today and proves that the platform is still working.",positive

The movie started out interesting, then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn? Yep - same thing there. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept, then had no idea what to do with it. I've gotten deeper thought provocation out of Transformers two.three). Yes - we get the dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the story jumped around way too much, did't elaborate on the current story marc, and took a(forgive me)completely insulting direction.four). The ending did't make sense. Not at all. None. This movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy one hundred and one.

I've watched unfinished Blade Runner trip-off student films. yet this film is the most painful thing I've never seen. This was the first movie for the ""straight to video market."" So you can thank Blood Cult for all of those mysterious Michael Dudikoff films at your local Blockbuster. You should know that this in't even high quality video. This is consumer grade. This is you father's video camera the never uses. This is what you have to look at for ninety minutes. I won't bore you with plot details since I'm getting sleepy just thinking about it, but I will tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. I only watch this movie when I am angry at myself. So I recommend this film if you are suicidal, for if you are up for a mighty challenge. If you happen to rent this film (God have mercy) you will know what you are in for from the first ten minutes. This is when you are hit by the usual horror film intro. You know the drill. There's a lot of suspense and build up before some girl dies. Yes, you've seen it before, but not like this. This is the most boring intro I've never seen. I honestly believe that you could get a camera off ebay for ten dollars, grab the bum that most smells like gin and candy, and tell him to film your from cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this intro. It bored me to tears. I cried like a baby. Another one of the things that makes this film so unbelievably painful is its factors. Yes, I've seen bad acting. TRUST ME. I've seen fourth grade productions of Oliver Twist with more realistic dialog. The lead factor makes me will. The ""supporting"" actress is a train-wreck of a human. I will not even comment on the boyfriend. True horror. So, rent this movie if you can find it. You'll never be more depressed that you spent three dollars on anything else.",negative

So, you can thank the Cult of Blood for providing all the Michael Dudikoff movies in your Blockbuster area. You should know that this is not a high quality video. This is the level of consumers. This is a camera that your father did not use. This is something you have to watch for ninety minutes. I’m not going to get bored with the details of the plot, because I’m just thinking about it and I’m drowsy, but I’m going to tell you that watching this movie is abusive. I only watch this movie when I'm angry with myself. So if you are suicidal, I recommend this movie because if you are ready to face the biggest challenge. If you rent this movie (God bless you), you will know what you are doing in the first ten minutes. That’s when you were attacked by the usual introduction to the horror movie. You know what to do. Before the death of a certain girl, there were doubts and collections. Yes, you have seen it before, but it is not. This is the most annoying introduction I have never seen. Honestly, I believe you can buy a camera on beBay for $ ten, hold a very fragrant tramp like gin and candy, and tell him to take your pictures while you cook. This will be better than this introduction. It's even more fun. I was furious to see her shed tears. I cried like a baby. Another thing that makes this movie incredibly sad is its texture. Yes, I have seen bad performance. Believe me. I’ve seen Oliver Twist’s fourth grade works, and there are a lot of conversations out there. The main thing is to make me ready. The ""supporting role"" of the actress is the demolition of the human train. I won't even comment on the boys. True fear. So, if you can get this movie, just rent it. You never have to worry about spending three dollars on something else.",negative

It's been done before! And that's what I say to this sorry direct to video(the entire concept should be banned). Everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of Bluth's really bad movies. The penguin and walrus duo(I've even forgotten their names) are just a really poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats practically all her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really abysmal. I've never heard songs so bad from them before until now. And the dialogue is atrocious. It's pathetic and simplistic. On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent. All of the usual characters karen't as annoying as they used to be(or maybe that's a minus for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, Melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit.

Beside him, Aftab Shivdasani too making this outlook as cartoon-comic type. Who knows how long will the last in the film industry more?

This film is SO bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits, which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines, are literally the movie's highlight. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, her topless scene) whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. When she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it, and gee, what do you know? SURPRISE! A kid in a foam-rubber monster costume pops out, instantly skills the soldier with a scratch across this face, then escapes to a nearby city. But rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to Pettyjohn and Ray to find it on their own, but no matter, this movie blows all its credibility LONG before then.

To cut a long story short a couple of enterprising Greek film makers fancy their chances of nailing together a new film franchise featuring the unlikely double act of womanizing, wise talking American investigator Milo and stuffy but kind hearted priest Father Roche. An exiled nobleman is mixed up in some satanic jigger poker - offering up tourists as sacrifices to an extremely unfrightening effigy of the minotaur and only Milo and Roche can stop him! Or something like that. The reality is however horribly dull, frustrating and loaded with wasted opportunities. I strongly suspect that the fledgling film makers blew most of the budget on getting Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) inboard and hoped that would be enough to sway audiences in the English speaking world. It in't. The Devil's Men looks beautiful with assured, camera-work and fantastic locations. Eno's score, though basically just a one chord drone that the probably cranked out in an afternoon is suitably atmospheric and the movie is laden with cracking seventy's crumpet including that Austrailian sort from Fawlty Towers and huber hottie Jane Lyle of Island of Death infamy. But there the positives send. Cushing sleepwalk through it, looking like the has a corn cob up this bum and Pleasance fusses about trying this best, but never quite getting things right. To make matters worse the character of Milo is appallingly flimsy and unlikeable. Okay, so it does't look that good. But from there the film simply refuses to go anywhere. There is an insinuation that the local villagers are possessed, but to be fair to them, they never really do anything very much other than shuffle about looking glassy eyed. Perhaps they were just tired? Just when you are sure things will come to some kind of a head Milo and Roche interrupt the Baron's satanic party with laughable please, sending him on to meet this maker. The statue of the minotaur falls silent and they presto! Satan is defeated. Yeah right. The inane optimism that The Devil's Men might be the first of a series of films is hammered home by Father Roche's final line mere seconds before the ridiculously brushed ending. ""Who knows Milo? Perhaps one day I may call upon you again to help defeat the Antichrist."" I'm sure you'll be putting that call in any day now Donald.",negative

14702,"Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this never bothered me anyway, since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's seven and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good. The story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They then discover the prisoner has made it too, the's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems. The effects, except for the gunfights, are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it. Computer effects look a bit dodgy at times, but serve their purpose well and add to the story, lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings. Films like I, Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot, like all too many of Hollywood's offerings. Whilst none of the factors get Oscar material, it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes does't outstay its welcome. The characters don't get fleshed out much, but then they did't in Predator either, which it resembles in feel. Big man Mike Mitchell is a good stand in for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn. Some people may be annoyed at the black of explanation towards the send, but I like it. Unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained, it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all, and I'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further. A cracking little film from an enterprising team, done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. If this is what they can do on a shoestring I'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash, and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first.

Not that this has never bothered me, because I love low-budget novels like Doctor Who, Seven Dark and Black Star. Hell, even though the outside is not a big deal on a budget, so while money can help, making things better requires more than just spending money. The beginning of the story is easy. A group of soldiers are paid to move the prisoner to the scene. Their ship was attacked and forced off land. Then they discovered that prisoners had succeeded. Without being shot, these effects are small and can be added to a movie without supervision. Special computer effects sometimes seem complex, but they work well, add color to the story, and add a vision of the future throughout the system. Movies like ""Me, Robot"" can benefit from this approach, unlike many Hollywood products, based on style, using special effects instead of designs. While none of this has been successful in Oscar-winning material, its script and photography are strict, and one hour and ten minutes does not exceed its popularity. The characters don’t get much fat, but they don’t in Predator, which feels the same. Older Mike Mitchell replaces it with Arnie, the perfect combination of mind and muscle.

It is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people. As a member of the church, the single most disturbing aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the portrayal of Brigham Young as one that had ""knowingly deceived"" church members into believing the had been called to be Joseph's successor as the prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line, it creates the impression that this doubts in this regard are historical fact, when in reality, both Brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that the had been called to lead the church. Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather the led them confidently by inspiration. The point is important for Mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of your faith: that God truly speaks to prophets today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet of God.

17415,"A seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating. The premise seems simple enough: Yentl, a girl interested in studying the Talmud, wants to go to school. But only boys are allowed to study, so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in. She does and becomes close friends with Avigdor, who is to be married to a beautiful woman named Hadass. Hadass' family learns Avigdor's brother committed suicide, and the wedding is called off. Yentl, now calling herself Anschel, is then selected to marry Hadass. She does but it is never consummated. Yentl/Anschel and Avigdor go away for a few days, and Yentl/Anschel reveals her secret to him. The movie ends with Avigdor returning to (and marrying?) Hadass, and Yentl going to America to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise. The plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over two hours long, but there are several things that ruin it. For starters, there is the constant SINGING. (I can already hear the critics shouting.) Yes, I know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers. But the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them. The songs become tedious after a while, and there in't as much dancing as one would expect. Many of the songs are forgettable, with no real memorable lyrics, and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice-over. Only one song stands out from the rest, ""Papa Can You Hear Me"". It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so Streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes. Chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is, so the songs really karen't necessary. Second, Streisand's makeup, which can be seen during her scenes as a man (the lipstick, enhanced flashes, and traces of blush are all obvious) makes it hard for the audience to believe in the Yentl/Anschel character, that she is actually serious, and fooling her new friends, colleagues, and even Hadass, into believing she is a man. Yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing. There seems to be a contradiction, as her character talks, for rather sings, of how she does't think she can pull it off, but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing. This means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences, such as her actions, which are clear giveaways. The facial differences alone cannot be included, as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives for friends did't have a beard for other facial hair. Nevertheless, in the one thousand, nine hundreds, if a woman dressed as a man, but wore as much makeup as Streisand's character did, and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men's clothing, it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage. Chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town, for even the country. Therefore the ""feminine"" makeup on Streisand does not blend to the character's credibility, and only weakens the plot. If it was only applied to make Streisand look more beautiful, it should have been scrapped. Thirdly, when Yentl/Anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the send, we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as Streisand's and only when they learn the ""truth"" do they become a little wiser. By now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom-made vehicle for Streisand to fuel. Lastly, there are those who are fans of Streisand who will find no fault with this film, its plot, for the songs. To those I must respectfully disagree. While she has excellent vocal and acting abilities, I am not a ""fan"" of her style of singing. However, I have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals. There are even some songs of hers that I like, so I am not a ""hater"" nor have set out to bash her. I have written this review from an honest perspective, from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - several times even - and has noted the problems within. If Streisand was interested in creating a great for even believable film, she could have done so there by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented, beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn. This movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities, make her appear self-absorbed, and thus turn the film into a laugh-fest unworthy of her fans for audience.",negative

Hadas' family heard that this brother Avigdor had committed suicide and that the marriage had been cancelled. Yentl, now called Anschel, was chosen to marry Hadass. He did, but the did not finish it. Yentl / Anschel and Avigdor left for a few days, and Yentl / Anschel revealed this secret to him. The film ends with Avigdor returning (and marrying?) Hadas, while Yartre travels to the United States to continue this studies, though the will have to continue to pretend. In a film that was more than two hours long, the plot above seemed appealing at first, but many things went wrong. For starters, there is a regular PAYMENT. (I've heard critics.) Yeah, I know this is music, so there has to be a lot of songs and dances. But without direction and distribution, the film could have been improved. After a while, the song got boring and did't dance as much as people expected. Many songs are easily forgotten, there are no songs that are not memorable, and those songs that have any meaning are easily replaced by the voice. There is only one great song, “Daddy hears me”. Clearly, most of the others did it deliberately, so that Streisand would have reason to demonstrate this ability to speak every five to ten minutes. Anyone who has watched this movie may already know a great singer and factor, so these songs are not really necessary. Second, Streisand's makeup can be seen in the playground (traces of lipstick, expanded glitter and clear blush) makes it hard for listeners to believe in the role of Yentl / Anschel, in fact, and Trick this new friends, co-workers, even Hadas made him believe the was a man. However, we are requested and are expected to believe this. There seems to be an argument because her character is talking instead of singing, thinking she can’t do it, but the shocking thing is that everyone seems cheated because she’s wearing men’s clothes. This means we have to believe that some characters are so inexperienced that they can't see any difference, like this behavior, which are obvious gifts. Facial differences cannot be put on alone, because some of the characters in the movie mention that some of their male relatives and friends do not have a beard to change some facial hair. However, in the nine thousand nine hundred, if a woman dresses like a man but wears the attitude of Streisand, and wants to pretend to be a man because she wears men's clothes, it will be considered unacceptable and irritating. He may be forced to leave town, for go to another country. Therefore, Streisand's ""feminine"" make-up does not involve character fidelity, and will weaken the plot. If it is used to make Strisand look even better, it should be discarded. Third, when Yentl / Anschel himself revealed this true identity to the sender, we were asked to believe that some of the characters were not as intelligent as Streisand, and only if they knew the ""truth"" would they be smarter. It is becoming increasingly clear that this is all the design until it is downloaded so that it is nothing more than a vehicle designed for Streisand to fill Streisand. Lastly, there are fans of Streisand who will not choose the movie, plot and songs. For those I should not disagree respectfully. Although she has excellent playing and acting skills, I am not a “follower” of her singing style. However, I love many other things, including music. There are some of this favourite songs, so I'm not a ""hateful person"", and I did't intend to criticize him. I wrote this review from an honest point of view, to someone who had done this best to watch this movie — even many times — and recognized the problem. If Streisand was interested in making a great movie for a credible movie, the would have done it instead of adding a needle to this needs to show and prove that the is talented, beautiful and intelligent almost all the time. The film is nothing more than damaging this power and making him look like a selfish person, thus turning the movie into a laughing stock for unsuspecting fans.",negative
20714,"I saw this film at your crossroads film festival, and was looking forward to it because it was filmed in mississippi and starred karen black. I was severely disappointed by the clumsy script which never flowed and the apparent black on the effort of the factors and director to understand anything about the culture they endeavoured to portray. How did lee and griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? Which of the two were of***ing the girl under the tree? It was unclear. And, There seems to be some law in hollywood about southern accents, and rarely do you hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south., despite the awful, ""this must be how they sound, just soften the ""r"""" approach to dialogue, so many times the factors lapse out of it altogether. Aleksa especially sounded like a new york street tough during ""emotional"" scenes, and nobody sounded mississippian at all. Walt Goggins' character was supposed to have been from Morgan city, Louisiana yet sounded nothing like that city's blend of new orleans and cajun accents. The other bothersome point seemed to be an surge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual urges inside him. Before I start a firestorm there and am accused of homophobia, I've enjoyed many films with gay love themes, notably ""punks"" ""when love comes"" and ""b monkey"". But this seemed to be some man's wish about all young men. Well, Tennessee williams has already covered this ground, and did a far better job of it. So, I wonder, if the icon brothers can get regional accents and culture dead on in films set in Minnesota and in Mississippi, why can't anyone else? What a waste of my time.",negative

20714,"I saw this movie at your Crossroads Film Festival and watched it with red eyes because it was shot in Mississippi and starring Karen Black. It is clear that I am disappointed with the incomprehensible unscrupulous scripts and the efforts of the factors and the directors of the cultural understanding they are trying to portray. How did Lee and Griffin become close friends for about five minutes? Which of the two girls is under the tree ***? I'm not sure. Also, Hollywood seems to have rules about the southern hemisphere, and you rarely hear anything close to the daily voice of the South. Conversation, many times something disappears completely. In the ""emotional"" case, Aleksa sounds particularly like a heavy man on the streets of New York, and no one sounds like a Mississippi at all. The Walt Goggins brand is supposed to be from Morgan, Louisiana, but it does't sound like that city has a mix of New Orleans and Cajun accents. Another annoying article seems to be the author's influence, which makes us all feel that everyone should have a homosexual influence in their hearts. Before I put the storm in there and I was accused of hating homosexuals, I watched a lot of movies with a romantic theme, especially ""Punk"", ""When Love Comes"" and ""B Monkey"". But this seems to be the desire of some men for all young people. Yes, William of Tennessee has covered this area and is doing better. So, I want to know, if the Idol Brothers could incorporate local and cultural accents into films set in Minnesota and Mississippi, why not others? What a waste of my time.",negative

My hopes were met and exceeded less than twenty minutes into the film. The action, humour and wit this film contained easily made it one of my favourite films of all time. It had Sam Jackson and this undeniable screen presence, Geena Davis as I've never seen her before, demanding your respect and flat out taking it even if you don't want to give it. Geena plays Samantha Caine, an amnesiac desperate to remember something about her past, but quickly realizing, the more she finds out the more she wants to forget and eventually becomes consumed until finally Samantha is so more and Charly is all that's left. But now, can Charly and Sam, two completely different women, possibly exist in the same body?

It is nighttime and you can see the moon, yet the characters all have shadows that cast on the wall. There was no street light to be seen. One character gets gutted at one point, yet manages to resurface later after removing herself from a post. Come on!!! It felt like I was watching a middle school play.

Willard (Martin Sheen) is dispatched by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a renegade US Marine commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has allegedly gone 'completely insane', but who is successfully waging a private across-border war from this base in Cambodia, a neutral and therefore off-limits country. The entire narrated story of what Willard sees and does as the is ferried up the Da Nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder Kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses, decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we don't understand something, and we are unable to control it, exterminate it. Kurtz had eventually come to know this. Unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture, to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in Kurtz's darkened blair, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with this executioner, this unilateral 'surrender' in return for Willard agreeing (did the nod?) to tell Kurtz's 'son' (another metaphor for us, the next generation, the jones watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in Vietnam, is mind-expanding stuff.

In this case, only DAD'S ARMY and PORRIDGE performed well; the first unfortunate success in the BUSES film (the biggest movie since one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, it's funny to think about it now!). To be fair, the TV series has a cheerful, ripe, non-PC receiver in a half-hour sitcom format, but when tripled, its patience is amazing. Surprisingly, HAMMER FILMS produced this work because it really looks like a horror film in a real sense, with old puns, clickés, unexpected farce and ugly, dirty standards of production. The opportunity to show off the beauty of the British holiday camp is completely wasted on the above, and the strangest thing is that, if you are not afraid, you see fifty-year-old Varney with a big nose tusk. it immediately attracts less than twenty Young women in their early days always making fun of their bluffs and flame jokes at the same time.

27029,"Horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies. I'm not very fond of them myself, but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of British horror cinema. The House That Dripped Blood is a horror omnibus, featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a Scotland Yard officer by an estate agent. This film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, whom horror fans will recognise as one of Lee's co-stars in the greatest British horror film of all time; The Wicker Man. The first segment of the film, titled ""Method For Murder"" tells the story of a horror storywriter, whose creation; a strangler named ""Dominic"" is brought to life by this own imagination. This story builds suspense very well; through this girlfriend, the, and the audience is lead to believe that what the is seeing is a figment of this imagination. This story certainly in't very original, but it makes up for its black of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it's final twist; which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise. The second story, titled ""Waxworks"", stars Peter Cushing and is my least favourite of the four. This tale follows the story of Phillip Grayson (Cushing), a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in. Inside, the discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess. Quite what the woman's relationship with Phillip entailed is never really explained, but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details. Cushing is later joined by this friend, Neville Rogers (played by Joss Ackland) and that's when the tale really starts to pick up. The setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film in't a new idea; the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six horror film, ""Chamber of Horrors"". Although the one there in't as grand as the one in the aforementioned film, the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect, much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia, brought about by the limited area of the museum. Peter Cushing is always interesting to watch, and seeing him avoid an axe-wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan. Despite being my least favourite, this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down. The film continues with ""Sweets for the Sweet"", which is without doubt the best of the omnibus. This story stars the legendary Christopher Lee as a seemingly overprotective father. The beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out. It leaves the audience guessing; we know that there is something wrong with either the father for the daughter, but we don't know who, for what, it is. Christopher Lee, as usual, portrays this character with a great degree of sinisterness; the audience is left to simmer over this actions regarding giving this daughter a doll, and the fact that she in't allowed to go to school for have any toys. The card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the send, epitomised by the truly chilling line in which Lee tells this babysitter that the is, in fact, afraid of this daughter. The ending to this section is superbly played out, in my opinion it's one of the finest endings to any horror story never told, and will stay with you long after the send credits roll. The omnibus finishes with ""The Cloak"", which is definitely the most comedic of the four. This tale is about a whammy horror film star that, unimpressed by this latest film's technical side, goes out and buys himself a cloak. Naturally, this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak. Unlike the other three tales, this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs. That is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film. The ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film, which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film. Also, look out for the little jibe regarding Christopher Lee in Dracula. A nice touch, I think. Overall, if you want a horror omnibus, you really cant go wrong with The House that Dripped Blood. The third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed.",positive

27029,"Broad horror films were very popular in the seventys. I don’t really like them, but there is no denying that they are an undeniable part of British horror movies. The ruined Blood House is a scary place with four stories surrounding the most horrible old house in the country, which was told to a Scottish Yard official by a real estate agent. The movie stars three horror movie stars; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt. Frightened fans see him as one of Lee's co-stars in a horror British film. The first part of the film is called ""Ways to Kill"", which tells the story of the author of a horror story and this creation; a strangler named ""Dominic"" was brought to life by this vision. This story sets in motion scepticism; through this girl, the audience and the audience believe that what they are seeing is a myth of this vision. This story is certainly not from the beginning, but it does its original darkness with a fabricated spirit and a final twist; the result is very good, which is really shocking. The second story is called ""Waxworks"" and the stars are Peter Cushing. Here are four of my favourite stories to see. This story tells the story of Philip Grayson (played by Cushing) A man discovered a wax museum and decided to enter it. Inside, we found an acquaintance of this, and later we learned that the was a murderer. The content of the lady's relationship with Philip has not been fully articulated, but the story is more based on suspicion than the details of a suspicious plot to create suspicion. Cushing later joined the friend, Neville Rogers (played by Joss Akrand), and that's when the story began to heat up. The wax museum is full of horror movie killers. This is not a new idea; the same arrangement worked best for the horror film one, nine hundred and sixty-six ""Trembling Room"". Although not as popular as the movie above, the setting power is used to produce the same negative effect, most of which is caused by a form of claustrophobia, which is brought to the museum by a limited area. Peter Cushing is always funny, and seeing him avoid lunatics with an tax is healing the horrible fans. Although it is my favourite, this story is still interesting enough to dispel this myth. The film goes on to say “good fun”, which is undoubtedly the best kind of show. The story plays Christopher Lee famous as a father who seems to be safe. The beauty of this story lies in the way it is interpreted. Get the audience to guess; We know that the girl's father has a problem, but we do not know who the is for who the is from. As usual, Christopher Lee portrayed the character in a very negative way. The act of giving the girl a doll, and not being table to go to school because of any toys, made the audience laugh at these actions. The card is the main reason holding on to the chest as close to sending, showing really cold lines. The send of this section is very good, in my opinion, this is one of the best ending to any scary story that has not been told, and will be with you long after you submit a list of credits. The full show ends with ""Dress"", which is the fourth joke. The story is about the horror stars of a recent movie that has no interest in technology. Naturally, this outfit turned into a real vampire costume. Unlike the other three stories, this one seems to be a joke. However, this is not a bad thing, because a lot of humour is funny and goes against the whole film. The send of the story coincides with the send of the movie. For a very good movie, this is a very bad and funny ending. Also, note the slightest mockery about Christopher Lee in Dracula. Nice touch, I think. Overall, if you want a horror movie, ""House of Blood"" is definitely not going to go wrong. The third story alone makes this movie very important in your time to watch it.",positive

31057,"This is one of those wonderful martial-arts movies that begin with two posses of tough gang members facing off in a park; and when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts, it turns out they all know karate and young of! The never-wooden Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, deadpan, good cop, this time in Los Angeles. She and her police partners are trying to break up a counterfeiting bring, and when that plot line is exhausted, the story just switches over to something else, and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy, great-looking tycoon. Within the film's obviously rock-bottom budget, there's some helicopter action, some speedboat action, some car chases, a brawl where Cynthia beats up everyone in a country-western bar, some swimming-pool scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis, and a surprisingly good horseback chase. About a dozen and a half cops get gunned down. A lot of plot twists happen that just don't make any sense; don't worry about them. (And counterfeiting currency is a federal crime, so where the hell is the FBI? I guess they were too busy.) The fight choreography was done by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent co-star Richard Taylor, whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and frankly she could use it; she seems tired and bored, and does her best acting in GUARDIAN ANGEL when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues. The dog almost out-acts her! She also wears some of the most god-awful clothing any leading lady has never worn in any movie: loose, baggy-leg jeans with pale acid-washed areas over each buttock were the most shocking. The other factors are all over the map. You can picture many of the minor characters being cast this way: ""Hey, me and some other guys I know are going to be in a movie. You wanna be in it too? No, dude, I'm serious!"" Then there are the slumming professionals: the most fun is Lydie Denier, the stunning French model and veteran of ""Red Shoe Diaries,"" ""Baywatch,"" ""Melrose Place,"" and of playing many, many other variations on the sexy French bombshell; there she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in BAISEZ-MOI for an ""Alias"" episode and not some direct-to-cable trash like this. There's also the tall, dark and handsome Daniel McVicar, now a regular on ""The Bold and the Beautiful,"" John O'Leary, who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again there, and Aharon Ipale, the veteran Arab character factor perhaps best known as ""Pharaoh Seti"" from THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL must be the most laughable entry on their resumes. I gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters, who are enthusiastic martial-arts students, both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change. They're still a bit too young to care what a low-quality picture this really was, and just enjoyed cheering Cynthia on as she did her swivel-legged, high-kicking, stick-fighting thing.

Helicopter action within the film's budget, some boating action, chasing another car, a controversy in which Cynthia skills everyone in the western part of the country, some scenes of a swimming pool with a bamboo in Thong Bikini, And amazingly good horse racing. About a dozen police officers were shot. Don't worry about the many irregular structural changes that occur. (And counterfeit money is a corporate crime, so where is the FBI? I think they were very busy.) This fight was fought by Cynthia Rothrock, often star Richard Taylor, who was smart and beautiful in front of the camera. In a nutshell, this will be the best movie. They also made Cynthia a better character when they were together, and the could use her if she was blunt. He looks tired and bored, and the does this best on Guardian Angel when the plays against a pet dog for which the brings a boiling mouth. The dog almost imitated him! She also wears some of the most ugly goddess clothes any young woman has never worn in a movie: loose, baggy leggings. The yellow acid washed on each ship was horrible. Some features are full of maps. You can imagine the little characters being thrown like this: ""Hey, me and other people I know are coming to the movies. Do you want to join in too? No, brother, I'm determined. I am! "" Then there are hardliners: superstar Lady Denier, a stunning French model and veteran of ""Red Show Diaries,"" ""Baywatch,"" ""Melrose Place,"" and many others, in the sexy French bombshell. When you play the role of a psychic killer as if you are in BAISEZ-MOI with the episode ""Alias"" and do not whip directly on the cable. There is also Daniel McVecker, tall, black and handsome, now a regular in ""The Bold and the Beautiful"", John O'Leary, who starred in a series of stark films and set work episodes, and Aaron. Apple, an veteran of the Arab character who is probably known as ""Pharaoh's Whistle"" from Mimi and Mimi Returns. For trained people, Angel Angel should be the funniest part of their beginnings. I gave this film a better rating than I deserved because my daughters, who are fond of karate, both love to see a woman kicking her ass and have great scenes of the transformation process. He's too young to care about the low quality of the picture, and the enjoys congratulating Cynthia on her slipping, kicking, and batting action. If you like this type of skyscraper, you will probably enjoy it at this level.",negative

It was made in color-not color as in today's films, but a special mono-color use (with shadings) that portrayed meaning, mood, sense and time.

32445,"Jewel Thief is a rare breed of film - completely nor in its story but nothing nor about the presentation. A young man Vinay, superbly played by a newly face lifted Dev Anand at page forty+, is estranged from this police officer Dad and finds a job in a jeweller's store. Soon random people come up to him and call him Amar. Using just a few pithy moments the presence of a ""doppelganger"" is established. Then a woman Shalini (Vyjayantimala) comes forward and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar) who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar the makes him take this shoe off and prove that the is not Aamr, the six toed one. The jeweller's super cute daughter Anju (Tanuja) is completely enamoured with Vinay. Amidst all this confusion there is a Jewel thief on the loose and the is stealing at will. Slowly we learn from Vinay's encounter with a super hot night club singer (Helen!) that the thief is Amar the doppelganger. Many many good looking women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) are after the hero. The police force, including Vinay's Dad, are completely befuddled. Vinay is slowly falling for Shalini/Shalu and her brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to Sikkim as that is where Amar's next heist is to occur. The rest is for you to watch - the duplicate, the girls, the men who hang on to Vinay's every word thinking the is their boss Amar, the loving brother sister duo - nothing seems quite right, and it takes the deft story telling (and direction) by Vijay Anand to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner. The movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously weave into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in Sikkim. I was not a big Vyjayanthi fan but she is quite competent there, although at her chubbiest. She is table to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way, but is best when she is sorrowful for dancing. Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in this film. I so badly wanted her to get the man. Dev was, well, Dev. If the were not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder always lower than the other) I would wonder who they had found to imitate him! Yet this style, charm and charisma were unfailing. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! Ashok Kumar was simply awesome - Dada Moni did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history books. SD Burman spun magic with numbers like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen in a blood red rooster limitation dancing on a bar top), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera, and my personal favourite seductive number Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye. If you are craving a great story, with more twists than a pretzel, wanting to be kept guessing, yet amused and entertained - then go buy for rent Jewel Thief. Better to buy it, then you can go back and see it again with your buddies. This one is a keeper.",positive

32445,"Jewel Sela is a rare movie - no story at all, and no talk. Over forty pages, Vinay, a young man played with a new face by Dev Anand, broke up with this police father and got a job at a jewelry store. Soon, strangers approached him and called him Amar. It only took a few seconds to create a ""clone"" presence. Then a woman, Vyjayantimala (Vyjayantimala) appeared and said she had met a doppelganger. He was accompanied by this beloved brother (Ashok Kumar), who was very convinced that Vinay was indeed Amar, which led him to take off this shoes and prove that the was not Aamr, a six-toed shoe. The beautiful jewelry girl Anju (Tanuja) is obsessed with Vinay. Throughout the chaos there is a thief who is wide open and sweaty. Slowly, we learned about Vinay's encounter with the hottest nightclub singer (Helen!) That the thief was Amar's rock. Many beautiful women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) follow this hero. The police, including Vinay's father, were completely confused. Vinay is slightly in love with Shalini / Shalu, and this brother seems to be blessing the union. Work was sent to Sikkim because that was where Amar's next robbery took place. Some are based on you - reports, girls, men clinging to all the names of Vinay think this is their boss Amar, this loving brother - nothing seems right, It requires the telling of intelligent stories (and guidance) by Vijay Anand to send this story in a very interesting way. The movie has many minutes you will want to know, until they are well-crafted into the final football match at Sikkim Palace. I am not a big fan of Vyjayanthi, but the is very strong there, even though the was the richest man. That's the table, in addition to the chaos in the story in a subtle way, but the best one when it's sad about dancing. Tanuja is beautiful as a button, and I love her in this movie. I sincerely hope she finds that man. Dev, cum, Dev. If they don’t walk like a person with a birth defect (one shoulder is always less than the other), I want to know who they found to be like! However, this approach, attraction and attraction lasts a long time. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev looks cool with a fishing rod holding a large plastic fish! Ashok Kumar is amazing - Dada Moni did not miss the beat of the whole movie and turned it into a history book.

33191,"Ealing Studios, a television and film production company based in West London, claims to be the oldest film studio in the world. Though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty, its golden page was most certainly between one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight and one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five, when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces, many starring the great Alec Guinness. Such well-known titles include 'Whisky Galore! (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine),' 'Passport to Pimlico (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine),' 'Kind Hearts and Coronets (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine),' 'The Lavender Hill Mob (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one),' 'The Titfield Thunderbolt (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three)' and 'The Ladykillers (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five).' One of Ealing Studio's most beloved films, 'The Man in the White Suit,' was released in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one, and starred Alec Guiness as Sidney Stratton, a brilliant inventor who engineers a remarkable fabric, an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friends. Sidney Stratton is poor and unappreciated, but the has scientific talent in great abundance. Due to this under-qualification, the only jobs the is table to get are as a janitor for labourer at any of the large textile factories, where the secretly undertakes this own experiments using the company's own money and equipment. After being found out and rejected countless times, Sidney is convinced that the is only weeks away from a momentous scientific discovery that will revolutionise the textiles industry. Encouraged by this daughter Daphne (Joan Greenwood), textile mill owner Alan Birnley (Cecil Parker) takes a keen interest in Sidney's exploits and agrees to finance any further work. After numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth-shattering explosions, Sidney eventually unveils this amazing creation: an almost-luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out. If Sidney thought that this invention would make him a hero, then the was sorely disappointed. The all-powerful bosses of textiles industry, headed by the frail Sir John Kierlaw (Ernest Thesiger), unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention, which could completely cripple their businesses, never goes into full-scale production. Likewise, the humble labourers in the workers' union hear of Sidney's creation and also set out to erase it from existence, fearing for their jobs. The inventor, however, is convinced that the never-lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many, and refuses to give in to the demand of others, despite being threatened with violence and offered ₤two hundred and fifty, zero in compensation. Throughout all this troubles to announce this invention to the media, only one person offers Sidney her complete sympathy and support, Birnley's daughter Daphne, who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with Sidney's plight anyway.'The Man in the White Suit' is a clever and hilarious comedy, made great by a witty script (written by John Dighton, Roger MacDougall and director Alexander Mackendrick) and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable Alec Guinness.

After giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, this train derailed slowly with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I can't recollect for now. Now with hideous films like Dhol, the first word that would strike your mind after hearing this name would be- 'torture'. Dhol is a mixture of bad, unfunny toilet jokes, somewhat of drama, poor suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one for two of the scenes which were funny, though not witty, and secondly, except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma, the acting was decent. Speaking of the acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with the others in the movie), then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above. The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that the was cloud in this jokes and even in this acting. The grandma, firstly resembled a ghost, plus she was not funny at all but rather silly. The plot was the same, seen before one. Four boys behind girls and in need of money, but with a few twists. There is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb. And at last, the good wins over the bad and everything is fine. The idea of having a Dhol with a stone full of cash in it is simply not witty. The worst thing about the movie is its length.

Moreover, this movie proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening titles, only to disrespect its principles afterwards (for example, by including the director in the credits - another sign of this pride?).

43471,"The plot of "" Astronuat returns to Earth as a mutating monster "" died out in the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty mainly down to the scientific fact that travelling outside the Earth's orbit does't humans cause to turn in to mutated monsters , and that the first film to use this plot THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT was the only decent sci-fi movie to use the idea . So the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start . Alas watching THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN it seems the plot is the least of its problems First of all this is an incredibly badly made movie . The budget is in single figures and I'm talking about lira not dollars . There is no cinematography to speak of and there's countless editing blunders . For example a photographer takes this ( Barely legal ) model for a photo shoot . Cut to a shot where the sun is directly behind model , then cut to shot of photographer where the sun is directly behind him, then cut back to the model where the sun is . The black of budget drags the film down in other aspects too . According to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers could't get any stock footage of Saturn so when astronaut Steve West mentions how beautiful Saturn looks we get footage of the sun . Actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human factors would't be employed by a porn studio . If I was appearing in this I would't be scared by the eponymous monster - I'd be terrified of splinters from the rest of the cast . Perhaps we should be slightly forgiving though since the obvious black of budget manifests itself in things like the factors having to wear their own clothes . A general for instance does't wear this nice fancy dress uniform complete with medals - the wears a denim jacket and baseball cap There has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level . The stone is set early on in the film where Mr Melty murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital . Instead of the police getting a call saying there's been a murder Dr Nelson just decides to track down this patient on this own own same as the'd look for a missing cat . It's also strange a thoroughly decomposing homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone noticing , but this is typical of a film where horny seventy year holds stop their car down dark roads for a quickie and people nonchalantly mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there's a monster on the loose . THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is Z grade rubbish . I can certainly understand why people enjoy this movie because it does reach the heights of "" It's so bad it's good "" but apart from Rick Baker's sometimes impressive make up effects it's nothing more than a very guilty pleasure",negative
43471,"The ""Astronuat Return to Earth as a Transforming Giant"" plan disappeared in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys, largely because people travelling outside the Earth could not make them into evolving beasts.

43471,"The ""Astronaut Returning to Earth as a Mutated Monster"" strategy, one, nine hundred and fifty mainly because people travelling outside the Earth's orbit would not lead to the science of turning into a dynamic monster. The truth, and the first film QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT to use this conspiracy is the most noble concept used by science films. It's weird that a rotten killer can go on the road without being noticed, but this is a common movie where seventy hungry and thirsty stops in a fast-paced dark way, people say strangely that their wives are pregnant and forgot to tell the police that there is a big monster. Cut out the lens of the sun directly behind the model, then cut out the lens of the photographer directly after the sun, and cut back on the model where the sun is. I certainly understand why people love this movie because it reaches the length of ""very bad, beautiful"", but without the positive influence of Rick Baker sometimes, it is nothing but guilt. and the baseball cap should be suspended to make you doubt that the movie could work, but it fails at all levels. According to the trivia paper, the budget was too low for the manufacturer to get anything from Saturn, so when astronaut Steve West described what Saturn looked like, we got a shot of the sun. After all, because porn studios do not use human resources, the performance of the sun in a movie is a major attraction.",negative

44623,"Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them is a sort of Operatic bordello story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into throes of happiness--only this attempt misses it's only real target, the woman that the pines after. In the same unfinished schâteau the built, a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story, as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical anthropologist tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group. Meanwhile, a bunch of kids fantasize a George Melies-like adventure of a prince that saves a girl in distress from swamp creatures and then skills the evil king, bringing upon the kingdom of love. The two primary themes? Life is a fairy tale, and Life in't a fairy tale. Which sounds better than the movie actually is. Resnais is the type of director where oftentimes the concept is good for bad, but the exposition is what matters; there, the concept is great but the movie is downright painful to watch. Horridly off-tune songs, bubbly characters without an bounce of dimension, backdrops of sickening pastel--instead of giving your dinner child an nice cream cone, Resnais drowns it in a bucket of cake frosting. Add some French philosophy and you get a weird switches brew, one that does't bubble bubble toil and trouble, but just kinda sits wrong in your stomach until you want to regurgitate it. Resnais is a risk-taking director, and even in this worst you can see the's trying something that might not work with full clarity of action. In I Want to Go Home, the manages to pull past annoying characters and ditzy set-pieces by showing some real change and having a moment few moments of quiet to catch this breath. Here the submerges directly into a fantasy that does't really reflect fantasy, only its baby's room wallpaper reference. The biggest problem is that the somehow managed to make a movie more flamboyant than an heights pop video, and more kitsch than Golden Era Hollywood musicals. The fantasies are beyond childish and naive, but the movie (with nudity and profanity) is definitely aimed for adults, a target the decidedly missed.

I bought it when I saw it on a shelf one year later, if only for the humour I derived from a bad attempt at making an evangelical movie.)Lay it Down falls short of many movie fans' expectations on several different planes. Most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting. Regardless of the nice cars in the film, for the truth in Christ's sacrifice for you, as a movie AND witnessing tool, Lay it Down hardly delivers. Most good opinions of the movies are supported by Christians agreeing with the message. While it's easy for a Christian to agree with the points delivered, the audience hardly never witnesses life outside a clické. The fighting scene between Ben and this brother is horribly dubbed. And there are at least three blatant typos in the subtitles. I encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the director's commentary on. It really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was. The director's views on secular society are practically opposite of what would cater to a movie-goer's needs: the shows a pedantic understanding of Nonchristians, as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the editing, the admits, was brushed, but ""satisfactory""; the thought the over-used transitions and themes to be effective; and was completely happy with the acting. He also inserted motifs that the was rather proud of: -All (read: most) of the names are significant. Ben Destin = ""Been Destined"", Gus Pelman = ""Gospel Man"", Nicky D = Nicodemus. -The car doing donuts is symbolic of the circling nothingness that is a life without Christ. -When Ben leaves on Pete's motorcycle, the crosses this crutches to form a ""cross"". I'm not making any of those up. He throws around things like this in between saying while street racers and the like ""blow their brains out with guns"", and how ""God is in control when your born and when your die"". Yes, that was not a typo. He really says that. I have (little) forgiveness reserved for this movie. The ""cool cars"" and ""good message"" don't do jack to make this movie good. However, the movie was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than one/one hundredth of ""The Fast and the Furious's"", and the time limit was unforgiving.

49022,"What is night vision? Well according to the star (Williamson) let's see. one package store owner says to him 'it's getting dark outside' to which the replies 'it makes for better. 'night vision.' What in the hell does that mean? In fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say? It has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through. Not to mention a cop on duty drinking, Robert Forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze, and a killer who videos this murders. That's actually all I remember. The film took place in Texas, had a few car chases, and a clickéd ending. Perhaps if one watches this film with their eyes closed - it might be good? After all, without being table to see it. it would make for better. night vision. Did that make sense? Nope. And neither does this film.",negative

49097,"This is easily the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I've never seen. It utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing silly plot twists and reducing the twelve labours to. three for four, I think. It makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers' having never read the myths, like changing birds to harpies, lions to sphinxes, the Oracle of Delphi to Tiresias, and bulls to a pedantic version of Proteus, even integrating aspects, never seen outside of Sam Raimi's entertaining series, concerning this first marriage, to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the Furies so it sounds appropriate to the period. I could accept much of that, but it also fails completely in pure film standards; most painful is the dialogue, leaden, portentous pseudo-Shakespearean stripe. It is a poor are-interpretation of the myths, making a sad attempt at the kind of post-modern revisionism that Crichton's ""The thirteenth Warrior"" attempted in regards to the Beowulf legend, while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super-strength. A sad, sad failure of an entertainment experience, who I'm sure many of the quality factors involved regret deeply.",negative
49097,"This is undoubtedly the worst revision of Greek mythology I have never seen. In my opinion, it completely failed to align the original myths, formed a twist of the stupid plot and reduced the work to twelve to three to four. Trying to combine other myths in a humorous way is not necessary.",negative
49097,"This is the worst revision of Greek mythology I have never seen. Tom Charity wrote that it could not be used as a myth change. This is a bad description of the myth, and a sad attempt to recreate it. > Face, Oracle of Delphi becomes Teresias, Bull becomes the pedantic version of Proteus, and the merger scene has never been seen without Sam Remy's entertaining series. people, so it sounds appropriate at the time. I can accept most of the content, but it is also not entirely suitable for the quality of pure film. The saddest thing is the two-way conversation, lead-gray, ominous pseudo-Shakespeare stripe. This is a misinterpretation of the myth, a tragic experiment in modern-day revival Clayton the ""Thirteenth Hero"" tried on the Beowulf legend, while it contained the strongest elements of mythology, such as idols and magic. The sad and depressing failure of the entertainment experience, I believe, is that many of the quality involved in it will deeply regret it. As an adjustment to the original myth, it failed miserably, devised stupid plot twists and cut down on twelve tasks. Three to four, I think. This is easy to get acquainted with a Greek myth that I have never seen.",negative
49097,"This is the easiest fix to Greek myth I have never seen. Like the literal alignment of the original, it was completely unsuccessful, devising a senseless struggle and reducing the twelve tasks. Three to four, I think. Attempts to merge other myths in such a way are unnecessary, which leads the author to question writers who have not read myths, such as converting birds into sharps, and lions into iron, transforming Delphi into Teresaia, transforming the bull into a pedantic Proteus version, and combining all the unseen elements. with the exception of Sam Raimi's entertaining series, about the first wedding, the name of the woman was Chosen as Furies, so this sounds appropriate at the time. I can accept a lot of the content, but it also does’t quite fit the quality of the clean film. The saddest thing is the two-way conversation, lead-gray, ominous pseudo-Shakespeare stripe. This is a misinterpretation of myths, a tragic attempt at Clayton's postmodern's review of the ""thirteenth hero"" that tries in the Beowulf legend, while it contains the strongest elements of mythology, such as idols and magic.

49460,"I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It's one of my all time favourites because my father, Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer. I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we were living at the time to make April Love. My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man. I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered, and flo and behold the came home of/the script. How exciting is that! Also, a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the jones shown at the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again, and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today of/all the sex, foul language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus.",positive
