1705,"Yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you'll thank me for it. This is the worst film I've seen in quite some time. I came to this board expecting to see the same response I had, but inexplicably, there are several people who love this film and Spacey's performance in particular. Some will chastise me for saying it, but I find Kevin Spacey's acting quite limited despite the world's admiration for him. I felt like I was watching a meaner version of Kevin's ""American Beauty"" role. His character in this film is ridiculously overacted, all the way down to this laughable insults the throws at this assistant. There are all-world trite and boring scenes like when Spacey is tearing into Whaley about bringing him Equal instead of Sweat and Low. Somehow, I suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny, but by this time I was ready to hit the stop button (this is approximately twenty minutes into the film). What about the faux-homage to ""Resevoir Dogs""? Whaley proclaims, ""I think I saw this in a movie once,"" as if the's going to cut off Spacey's year. But what does the use to cut him? An envelope! That's right, the's going to give him paper cuts! That has to be one of Hollywood's all-time worst scenes, and the fact that the factors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling. I will admit that I did't see the send of this film (my DVD mercifully locked up about a half hour before the send), but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that I missed a great twist and everything would have made sense. Well, I don't care what happened in the send, because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue. I even got the feeling that the factors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as I did.",negative
1705,"Posting is the worst movie I've never seen. A lot of people love this movie, especially Spacey’s performance. There are old and boring scenes around the world, such as when Spacy store Hyeri.",negative
1705,"Whaley announced, ""I think I saw this movie"", as if it would mark the send of Spacey's year. Coming to this board, I hope to see the same response as me, but it is shocking that few people like this movie, especially the performance of Spacey. Somehow, I suspect this show should be interesting, but for now I'm ready to press the stop button (about twenty minutes for a movie). I admit that I did not see this movie when it was sent (my DVD was kindly locked about half an hour before it was posted), but anyone who wants to say this can save me from having missed a great opportunity, everything will make sense. Well, I don’t even care what happens during shipping, because it can never do all the bad work and endless conversations. Some people will blame me for saying this, but I find that Kevin Spacey’s performance is very limited, even though the whole world praises him. This is supposed to be one of the worst events in Hollywood's history, and the fact that things and the director have tried so hard to make it even more frightening.",negative

2623,"Hi, Everyone, Oh, Boy. This one is a lulu. It has really bad background music whenever they can squeeze it in. There are three bad guys who, I guess, are the stars of this. They beat people up and chop people up and crash trucks and bulldozers into people. Usual stuff. The woman who is sending them on their emissions is unable to move her mouth when she speaks. It's sort of like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own dummy. She walks like she is balancing an egg on her head. The wardrobe is seventy leisure style for the men and blah for the female lead who is supposed to be a good nurse. The bad novocain mouth woman wears red. A silk frock perhaps, for maybe just a poplin windbreaker that is too big. I actually liked the ending even though it did not make a lot of sense. It lets us in on what happened earlier in the film. The police officers are OK. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. The two bright jones could have worked again in Hollywood. The movie starts interestingly enough and ends with a surprise. The middle sucks. The guy in the diner who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job. He is like a one thousand, nine hundred and forty character factor. Great voice. This one is a bit too long. The lady with marbles in her mouth could have had just a couple of lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. Her scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker. Tom Willett",negative

I love this ending, though it makes no sense. It allows us to understand what happened in the early days of the film. The police are doing well. Some are bad, some are good, except two are stupid. The two brilliant Jonathan could also work in Hollywood. The start of the movie is very interesting, and the ending is amazing. It sucks in the middle. The man in the restaurant who gave the star a free hamburger did a great job. He is like a thousand and forty-something. a good word. This is too long.

2931,"It's easy to see how this below-average screenplay got by in the early sales-pitch meetings at Regency Films (and later with Fox): across the superhero genre with a comedic take on ""Fatal Attraction"". oilà! I don't know how on earth a talented director like Ivan Reitman got involved, unless the pay was just too tempting. A dateless employee at an architectural design firm in N. Y.

This is the kind of worthless movie that can't let an insult slip by. Our introduction to leading man Luke Wilson, talking with Rainn Wilson on the train, is accompanied by a sour dig at gays (it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies' men). After being approached by G-Girl's nemesis, who wants to zap her powers, Wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned. and in't that better after all? Thurman's early performances in films like ""Henry & June"" and ""Jennifer weight"" showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise; her films with Quentin Tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity, but that came at a price (the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch). The picture is exceedingly well-produced and shot, with expensive-seeming special effects, yet nobody bothered to find the humour in this scenario. It's pushy, leering, ugly, and badly-cast. Bloated, frozen-faced Wilson can't tell any of this co-workers that the's dating G-Girl because she made him swear the'd rather have a chainsaw stuck up this rectum.

3430,"It's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film. Most early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German Romantics like E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In Fritz Lang's ""Der Mude Tod"" (also from one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-one) Death personified takes a young man away from this sweetheart, but in Lang's film the characters' destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior. Neither of the young lovers deserves to die, but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death. In Victor Seastrom's ""Korkarlen,"" however, repentance is always an option. Destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters' choices. Although scenes of the Phantom Carriage collecting souls are genuinely eerie, these horrific images of Death as the great leveller are compromised by Death's offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale, David Holm, a brutal drunk who, because of a perverse hatred of humanity, spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone the comes in contact with. One New Year's Eve Holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion. As the first person to die on the stroke of midnight Holm must become the driver of the Phantom Carriage and collect souls during the new year. The Phantom Carriage, driven by an old acquaintance who had started Holm on this road to ruin, comes for this soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery. Along the way Holm sees the horror the has inflicted on this family and the people who tried to help him. Perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the Selma Lagerlöf novel on which the film is based. But I would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape this destiny, and to see this repentance come too late to prevent this wife from poisoning this two children and herself, and to see Holm suffer for the consequences of this sins by being made to collect their souls. It would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse the inflicted on others. In the film, however, the unalterable nature of destiny in't the message; redemption is. The driver of the carriage allows Holm's spirit to return to this body, and the rescues this family in the nick of time. His repentance smacks of Scrooge's repentance in ""A Christmas Carol."" If the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the film's images. The special effects are astonishing when measured by the standards of the day, and still hold up, which is more miraculous when you consider that these double exposures were created inside a hand-cranked camera. Also, the restored film on Tartan's new DVD looks fabulous.",positive

Little lovers do not deserve to die, but are destined to be reunited after death. However, in Victor Seastrom's ""Korkarlen"", confession remains the norm. Destiny can be changed by character selection — and postponed to death. Although the place where the plane gathers souls is truly terrifying, these horrific images of death as a delicate one are saved by death from the real dragon of the story, David Holm, who is a drunkard, because of this personality, spreads tuberculosis and emotional spain to everyone the meets. On New Year's Eve, Holm was demolished while fighting with this drinking partner. As the first person to die at midnight, Holm has to be a pilot and collect souls in the new year. The phantom chariot is driven by an old man you know who put Holm on the path to destruction, and came to this soul to take him on a journey of discovery. Along the way, Holm saw the shock of the family and those trying to help him. Perhaps my disappointment at the send of the film is criticism of Selma Lagrove's novel in which the film is based.

His confession of sins is similar to Scrooge's in ""A Christmas Carol."" If the old ending and emotions don’t offend you, there is still a lot to appreciate in movies.

But when it was released, it played as a standard TV series of one, nine hundred and seventy episodes, with some nudity. This film is a product of the distribution of the ""author"" who is trying to make a commercial film only. There’s a bit of a twist in it, and the movie spends a lot of time chasing and acting. Apart from the game with the old man on the beach, MMBM has no fear for suspicion. The director knows a little bit about the horror films. Even if it leaves a lasting impression, it is worth seeing.",negative
6514,A bit slow (somehow like a Sofia Coppola movie) but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. The magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their page. The confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life. The music is perfect and the acting is amazing. The camera works beautifully also. I highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover your sexual impulses and your desires. I would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period. So many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities.,positive

7687,"Watched this as a late TV movie last night purely by chance. The blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey, as I tuned in there's the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot was immediately apparent. It turns out that eponymous mother's carpenter love interest is also the daughter's boyfriend, so there's trouble brewing and not too many surprises. But I'd been caught by Anne Reid's compelling performance and I was hooked. The direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves, when she exudes sadness. The sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking. Shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up? Not there and we're treated to a delicious reawakening in the Mother's sexuality. Even more startling are the drawings she's made that (SPOILER!) once discovered confirm her daughter's suspicion that something's going on there. Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter did't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast, but that could be me. With her waves of are-Raph blocks I kept expecting to see Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind. Bradshaw has a rounder happier face that did't carry the danger that emerges as the film progresses. The ending is weak. If the goodbyes for Mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons. Whatever she's done, she's a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for thirty years, and I found the black of sympathy jarring. For a film so full of emotion (and be warned it's like opening champagne, you'll never get the lid back on) the ending is a cold contradiction.",positive

7687,"Last night it was considered an accidental television movie. The film’s introduction talked about the influence of mother and daughter together as well as continuing the love journey, as I was transferred to a carpenter to work hard in a new heat - Daniel Craig also played a lot - so the strategy is clear. It turns out that a carpenter who loves a mother of the same name is also a girl's boyfriend, so the trouble grows and there karen't many surprises. But I was interested in Anne Reid's fun play, I was interested. When the expressed this frustration, the guide gave him enough space to look in the mirror and adjust the scarf. The sex scene is interesting and breaks the taboos. Shouldn't the bodies of older women be covered? Not only that, we enjoyed the wonderful awakening of your mother's sexual desires. What shocked her the most was that the pictures she had made (spoiled!) Once that confirmed her daughter's suspicion, were what happened there. Cathryn Bradshaw as a girl did’t reassure me like other players, but it could have been me. With the waves behind the are-Raph blocks, I was looking forward to seeing Julia Sawahla, her distressed face more fitting to face my eyebrows. Bradshaw has a around face and fun without the risk of appearing as the movie progresses. The send is too weak. If a mother does not seem to care when her husband leaves, we may be table to see people close to him nodding and understanding their reasons. No matter what she did, she was a widow who had recently lost a loved one in death, she left the lonely home where she had lived with her husband for thirty years, and I found a black sting of sympathy. In a film full of emotions (please note, this is like opening the champagne, you will never open the lid again) the ending is about cold.",positive

10064,"Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like ""The Shining""? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that the is truly one of the greatest directors and auteur of all time. So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and this family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered this wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as ""scary"". It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. Music has been a major part of Kubrick's movies (two thousand and one: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and the definitely does't disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the stone and this film would not be the same without it. Finally, I must comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, just this stare steals a few scenes of this movie. This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe. There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. R. I. P.

His personality goes well with the special research team assigned to him. There is really no stupid character that will make you roll your eyes and just despise who is the best. Another advantage is that it takes some time to identify the killer. But when I found out, I was not shocked. OK then. Another good thing is the Los Angeles area.

12791,"Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, center around three ""couples"" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start as far as I'm concerned. Interesting. The couples break down into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being ""harmlessly"" stalked by a gay man. The ""het"" couple really don't have much of a role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex for playing around with each other, but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized. My assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sex/violence are integrated in a couples life. The couple karen't very aggressive and it's not even shot in any kind of erotic way. As characters, they don't add much to the theme for plot. The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an valley. This escalates into violence. And the violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence it release grows as the film progresses. The main problem I had is the violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger. It just does't work. Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters' relationships with violence, this is a major problem. Unfortunately, the make-up does't help either. Sometimes, it's okay, other times it is very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on this face. Confusing. The more interesting pair of the characters is the ""stalker couple."" Here Calson seemed to have more to say and was table to develop a more coherent storyline. Perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the send. Shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two. I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It is admirable. Most low budget flicks don't aspire to much. I don't think Calson achieved want the was aiming for. Myself, I found nothing particularly controversial for unsettling. Shiner was unconvincing. This does't mean, however, that the director can't achieve something with this next film. He seems to have something to say.",negative

The couple split up and became a romantic couple, two friends of the opposite sex and a “safe” opposite sex, which is being manipulated by homosexual men. This ""het"" couple does't have many roles in the movie. There are shows where they like to be violent when they make love because they are looked down upon, but they don't seem to have a real purpose. My hypothesis is that they represent everyday examples of how sex / violence enters a couple's life. Karen is not violent, and she does not take any photographs. As characters, they did not add much to the plot. These two male friends form the score of the conspiracy. They engage in some form of sexual assault by forcing gay men to have sex with them in the valley. This is increasing violence. Violence has changed them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. As the film progressed, their demand for violence also increased. One of the biggest problems I have never faced is that violence is rampant. It seems that none of this characters are in real danger. It does't work at all. Because the whole content of a movie is about the relationship between characters and violence, this is a key issue. Unfortunately, make-up does not help. Sometimes it’s okay, sometimes it’s too bad. In one place, I want to know why one of the characters puts a rouge on this face. It's confusing. The most interesting character is ""Stalker Couple"". Here, Carlson seems to have a lot to say and is ready to develop a coherent story. Maybe it’s because the character seems to be more developed and determined when you post. If you insist on using these two, Shiner could be much better. I love Carlson’s hope of finding out more about this film. It's touching. Most low-budget movies don't require much. I don't think Carlson achieved this goal. Personally, I did not find any disturbing arguments. Hina was not convinced.

The high point is clearly John Wayne's measured and methodical well photographed walk across the desert after the fleeing and stumbling Zanti with those fantastic basalt cliffs of Red Rock Canyon (seen in countless serials, westerns and science fiction 'moon' movies) framed behind him. No final gun duel at fifty spaces with the heroine running from the wooden steps of the bar to embrace and kiss the conquering hero in this movie!

Upon this death, the show did drop off a bit, but the producers did't give up on the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast from two thousand and three to two thousand and five. The show center around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, may the rest in peace), this wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson), and their son, Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was on the show, I would shriek in laughter (and proud to admit it, I am), but now that the's gone, I'll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh. I'm very glad that I fell for this show's trance after Ritter's untimely death, because it made the reps with Ritter so much better. Ritter's character is just so well acted and well rounded, that you can't help but love him. He is always bossing the girls around about dating, but the really wants them to be happy. It's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment. Katey Sagal is great as well, and she too is a likable character. After Ritter's death, her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids, but I believe Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson, and Spanjers, because she and Ritter had been friends for a long time. The funniest person on the show would have to be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She is the ultimate blonde: gorgeous, slow, dim-witted, yet she is a smart person. She is off the wall hilarious with her innocent 'blonde' humour and how conceited she is. Amy Davidson can get a tad annoying as Kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. The only fault of the show is that the show never really gives Kerry anything to be happy about. She's always after Bridget, and her character feels like it's just thrown in there. Martin Spanjers as the alone Hennessy son is hysterical, and when Ritter is on the show, the's mostly comic material. Upon the death of Ritter, the show does provide some story lines for Rory.

The most interesting person in the game should be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. He is the most white: the is lovable, slow, and cunning, but the is a very intelligent man. Her pure ""blonde"" humour no matter how proud she is, makes her very funny. Amy Davidson may be as annoying as Kerry, but that’s the point of her character. The only flaw in the show is that the show did't really make Kerry happy. He always chases Bridget, and this character feels like the is being thrown there. Martin Spanjers was as angry as Hennessy's only child, and when Ritter appeared on the show, it was funny. After Ritter's death, the show provided the content of the story to Rory. David Spade and James Garner just laughed, sometimes there will be a side story of Spade character CJ. Garner plays this father Kate as background information. All in all, I’m giving this show a good test because it’s a great show, and a tragic event happened to disable it. you will love it. nine / ten - check out",positive
15371,"""The sweet is never as sweet without the sour."" This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in this life. He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist. This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break. Its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour). The theme will really get you to ""open your eyes"". Only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand. I think the send is perfect though. I recommend you watch it and see for yourself.",positive

It is a movie that allows you to take a step back and watch movies of your life and lifestyle. You cannot value the good (sweet) things in life, such as love, until you have a bad (sour) experience.

And I was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film. He was extremely good at this too although I have never seen him deliver a comic line before. The film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance but I think she did rather well.

I've rarely seen factors better table to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey,Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply outdo themselves. Masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable.

Fox, and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made. It's not superbly written - be.g., the characters' lines are not particularly memorable. Yet it's executed to perfection. The romantic yearnings are truly palpable, the ""feeling"" of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated, love's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection, are so touchingly delivered.

Maybe that's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape. The village itself, such as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male, the consort of the dead girl. Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible. Most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles don't include the songs and laments of the crones. Don't go to this movie unless you're fluent in Russian.",negative

19311,"This film is the story of a Russian prostitute returning to her hometown to attend the funeral of her sister / friend. There are a few small stories that may be more interesting than the stories filmed, but they have not been fully explored. The sound of the film is funerals, wake-ups, and later debates about the future of society for older women who make dolls and sell them to buy vodka, but are now thrown by an artist who puts their dolls on the market. Obviously, this film is not edited. The prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an unbearable train journey and a muddy journey. Perhaps this should make us impressed by the beauty of Russia. The village itself, just in this way, was occupied by a large group of widows and a man, the wife of a dead girl. Continuing to play the doll industry is a challenge for all involved, and it seems unlikely at the send. Most movies are shot with a hand-held camera, which can cause nausea. Another problem that Western audiences face is that the subheadings do not include adult women's songs and lamentations. Unless you speak Russian fluently, don't go to this movie.",negative
19732,"San Franpyscho: one out of ten: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from Different Strokes. There are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. The Quiroz brothers have no clue. First of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliper thespians. Really how hard is it to play a priest for an overbearing mother? Certainly a city the size of San Francisco has a few professional factors willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit. Clearly Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger who play these roles have other talents such as landscaper for waitress they bought to be fine tuning. Joe Rosete as the killer (yes the serial killer is simply known as ""The Killer"") is also pretty awful in a mentally will method kind of way but I am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as this character is written with zero style for personality. A boring almost laughable serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. In addition the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as an ABC Family movie of the week. There is no nudity for violence to speak of and the R rating clearly is for the adult style spacing. This move meanders like an eighty-five year old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and her turn signal on. The only occasional horror comes from lighting Estevez's face with a glare that makes it look like this lower jaw was removed.

24995,"This movie was a real torture fest to sit through. Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self-evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it. When it does stoop to putting in its argument, it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts ; all that's missing is someone crying ""when is someone going to think of the children!"". While watching this movie, I kept thinking ""where'd you hear that?"" for ""that can't possibly be true"" - yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources. And bless 'em, the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and icons of nuclear power; to be fair, that might be the fault of the film-makers, but equally fairly, it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars. As for the performers. Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I've enjoyed, and I'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause. But they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over, now that the sixty have passed them by. Particularly embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor. Nash seems to be trying too hard - the looks like the can't possibly believe the things the's being told (not that I blame him), but desperate to feel noticed and included. James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest ""anthem"" never, ""Stand and Fight"", in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine. In fact, most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being patronizing. Nobody seems worked up by this event, as if it really does't mean much to them at all. It's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be John Hall, of the band Orleans, and responsible for some of the wimpiest MOR pop of the seventy. (Remember, if you dare, ""Dance With Me"" and ""Still the One"".) It's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause there fails to inspire any real passion in the music. The cause is supposedly life-or-death, but everybody sleepwalk through their numbers like they're playing the Catskills. Except maybe Gil-Scott Heron - this protest number ""We Almost Lost Detroit"" is on topic at least, but delivered with all the smugness of a high-schooler impressed with how 'controversial' the's being. Only Bruce Springsteen's performance raises a pulse; I've never been a big fan of the Boss, but the absolutely smokes, no question. Part of me thinks the was taped separately, at another event, and edited into this movie to give wake the audience. Compared to the general blandness and air of self-satisfaction there, it's no wonder Bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll. But even this performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting. I don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a 'seventys film, but the shots are unnecessarily static, broken up only by split-second cutaways to a back-up singer's tonsils. Now, some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with; and *maybe* the film-makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage - but all you have to do is watch ""Rust Never Sleeps"" for ""The Last Waltz"" to see a movie like this done with more skill.

My part is that it was filmed separately for another event, and the film was edited to awaken the audience. Compared to the enthusiasm and contentment there, it is not surprising that Bruce was hailed as the savior of Rock in Roll. But this drama is also played with unhealthy concert shooting. I don't expect the film's much-anticipated camera movement from the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, but the shot is unnecessarily stagnant, with only a second's difference in the supporting artist's stone. Now, some of this may be because the players are not alive. And * maybe * the filmmakers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert videos - but all you have to do is watch ""The Last Waltz"" ""Ring Never Sleeps"" in order to make a film with such skill.

It’s worth noting that the driving force behind the event seems to be John Hall of Orleans, who was in charge of MOR’s pop music in the seventys.

Nash looks very hardworking-it seems unbelievable what is being said to him (not to blame him), but the closes hope in feeling and being included. James Taylor does what should be the most vocal protest “song” never, “stand up and fight”, as the most painful and fun you can imagine. In fact, most shows are very good when they are not watched. No one worked on this incident, as if it did’t really make sense. It’s worth noting that the driving force behind this whole incident seems to be John Hall, of the Orleans team, who was responsible for some of MOR’s dream pop of the seventies.

Only Bruce Springsteen’s performance boosts the heart rate; I haven’t been a big fan of Boss yet, but the drinks heavily, no question. Part of me thinks it was especially shot, another stage, edited by this film to wake up the audience. Compared to the overall tip and the air of fun there, it’s no surprise that Bruce is praised as a rock’n’roll savior. But even this performance is holed with lifeless drama shooting. I did’t expect a lot of camera movement to illuminate a ‘seventy film’, but the shots were static and unnecessary, only divided into two second sections divided by the factor’s chin. Now, some of this may be because the factors have no life to begin with; and * perhaps * filmmakers are more proactive in shooting documents than drama scenes - but all you have to do is watch Rust Never Sleeps on “The Last Waltz” to see a film like the one made with additional skills. And interesting factors. So really, there are only two things to watch in this film: Springsteen’s starring show, and a sad picture of anti-depressant culture.",negative

25435,"First of all I thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until this talent faded and the retired. However, it was't the Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story ""The Bottle Imp"". A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell. That's fine. Nobody said screenwriters had to be original. The factors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the ending. The hero thinks the has discovered a way out of this dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film, they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very send of the film. This is a stupid convention. The older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the send. There is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think. You can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the send. In fact, I think it's preferable.",negative

I still think this movie has an obscene video look, and the picture I just took is clear and vivid. you must be affected. and in the final minutes of the movie, this movie is nothing special. Why this is currently rated five.three and popular with critics is beyond my comprehension- this movie is ninety-nine.forty-four% stupid. Gordon Lewis. one hundred thousand, nine hundred and sixty And by one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, Lewis was known for producing an astonishing series of low-cost abusive films, such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER AG YIYA. However, over the years, there have been many fans who have been called ""the father of blood"" - fans who don't care about the functionality of the show and are aware of the groundbreaking in some of the films. But in addition to the huge use of fake blood and real courage, this movie is a waste — you can’t believe the movie’s scores are nine points and ten scores. It’s like putting a velvet Elvis painting on the Louvre! ! The film tells the story of a series of murders that took place in a robbery. When I said it was horrible, it was very bloody and disgusting to one thousand nine hundred and seventy-two people - although the special results seemed very hot by modern standards. So, even though there are some horrible and cruel murders in the movie (I would like to be the narrators — they come from a very sick mind, showing a sickly disregard for women), but at least they won’t make you feel sick. ., For they have acted ruinously on their own part; Obviously, in most cases, they cut rubber dolls and mannequins. But letting them do horrible truths, even if it is not true, is irritating and proves to be immoral. Because the police are stupid, the only hope for this movie is a man named Abraham Gentry - this style and style of speech are very close to the stock of John Waters' first films, David Lokari. Although this performance was good, it was so good and interesting that it rekindled my interest. You can still laugh, and it's amazing that this is the only movie that has never been made! ! It is also strange that many women want him — especially because they do not look that way. The other people in the movie are stupid and stupid. In fact, I hope that more people will be killed — they are there! Their performance is unbelievable at all, and it is clear that the director did not make the film — because most of the scenes in the film are worse than any of Edwood's artistic films ""The ninth project from the outside world."" After all, for most women in a film, the only thing that matters is that they want to appear in the film, so they are willing to release their clothes. Now I know this sounds disgusting, but most of them are unattractive and look like drug addicts, they take off their clothes to prepare for the next one. When the ladies take off their clothes, the men in the crowd will give them money to put it on again (wow-Henny Youngman you should have said it in a movie)! However, considering Lewis's budget, these could be the ""best"" player. In general, a bucket of dirty bile is worse than other movies controlled by a director. It said a lot! It is violent (but stupid), anti-feminist (treats them like meat and things that need to be cut) and is not good at all from start to finish.",negative

26548,"twentyth Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight) is not only quite a silly nor but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie. Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more. Miscast is Ida Lupino in the leading role! Lupino, a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is there under the illusion she is Rita Hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar-room Torch Singer. Handsome Cornel Wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented Celeste Holm who's role is little more than a bit part. Then we have Richard Widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture! When we first see him the is a nice O. K. guy who runs a thriving Road House. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear - the becomes insanely jealous of this manager (Wilde) when the latter tells him that the is about to marry Lupino. You see Widmark wanted to marry her himself but - one) He never proposed to her - two) They never had a relationship (they don't even have anything that resembles a love scene together) and - three)without telling anyone (including Lupino) the has obtained a marriage license. Wow! So how Widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with Lupino after such a ""courtship"" is anybody's guess. Huh? Well, when Widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie I am sorry to say. From there on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical! His closing this marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing. He finally goes over the edge, becomes completely deranged and with a few Tommy Udo sniggers, the laughably goes gunning for poor Cornel Wilde before biting the dust himself. And if that in't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. There's not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie! Added to this - ninety-five% of the film takes place at night. Besides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette ""Widmark & Lupino At Fox"". Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me! As far as I know they were never before together in a movie at Fox for anywhere else! However this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter know-alls as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and a few others who amazingly cheap praise on this wearisome and cringe - inducing affair. All I can say then it must be me I guess. But ""Road House"" up to now was a forgotten and buried Noir and as far as I am concerned it should have remained so.

27372,"Ok, after reading a couple of reviews on Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct trip off from Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water. The only part that was a ripoff from Nadia is that the pendant from Nadia and the pendant from Atlantis bear so much resemblance in terms of how it's used, origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied. If you want to consider how Kida and Nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against Disney too(It was kind of weird for Nadia and Kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi, not to mention they both move in a similar style too). As an anime fan I have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in Laputa, the ancient mask from Princess Mononoke, the resemblance of the vehicles to the Garfish submarine in Nadia, etc). The plot itself I believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that Disney can pull it off without the use of Captain Nemo(the main character in Jules Verne's twenty Leagues Under the Sea which is also the main character in Nadia). As for Mylo and Jean wearing similar style glasses. As shown in the novel ""Lord of the Flies"", glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. I think Mylo, Jean, the main character from Stargate and a dozen of other ""INTELLIGENT"" characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses. As for the submarines, and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedo which really resembles what Nautilius does), I want to state that it's a required element for either one if Atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters). As for the crew having some charactistical resemblance with the crew from Nautilius in Nadia, it might be the artwork but I don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me. As an anime fan that rated Nadia as the #one best anime I never watched even now today. I do have my doubts about Atlantis when I first saw the preview. But now that I watched the movie, I once again regained my confidence with Disney and have high hopes for their future movies after Atlantis. Overall, the best Disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better. Also, it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (I was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how Disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing)",positive

27372,"Well, after reading a few comments about Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I just want to clarify the misunderstanding because it starts directly from Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water. The main feature released by Nadia is that Nadia's handle and Atlantis circle are similar in the way they are used, how they originated, and how they were created from the source of life. There is no doubt that it has been released. If you want to think about how Kida and Nadia dress, then you can use it against Disney. style). As an anime lover, I will have to admit that there is a certain level of copying, but this is in the smallest detail, even if there are not many real ideas (such as intricate design on the wall of Laputa, old Princess Mononoke Cover, similar Garfish marine vehicles in Nadia, etc.). The plot itself I believe is a superhero, and Disney can breed without using Captain Nemo (protagonist for Jules Verne ""Twenty under the Sea"" and Nadia's protagonist), This is truly amazing. As for Mylo and Jean they wear the same glasses. In the book The Lord of the Flies, glasses are a symbol of wisdom and wisdom. I think the main characters of ""Stargate"" Mylo, Jean and other ""smart"" characters don't seem to fit in this role if they don't wear glasses. As for the submarine, and the way the sea fights (using those large torpedoes that break out like Nautilus), I want to make it clear that if Atlantis is involved in this conspiracy (after all, it is a sinking city) the important thing is under water). As for the staff with the same characteristics as Nadia's Nautilius, this may be a work of part, but I don't think there is any crime, because the character's personality is very real to me. As an anime fan, rating Nadia as #one of the best anime, I haven't watched it until today. When I first saw the vision, I had questions about Atlantis. But now that I’m watching this movie, I’ve regained my confidence in Disney and have high hopes for future films after Atlantis. All in all, this is the best Disney movie, but I was not shocked to hear their singing in the middle of the movie, and they changed the cheese script to make it better, more engaging.

That was copied. If you want to see how Kedah and Nadia dress the same, you can put the same on Disney (it was weird that Nadia and Kedah wore these motorcycle styles in sci-fi adventure Not that they both fit in the same way again).

I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with ""Miracle"" and ""Cinderella Man""), but some how this film was enthralling all the same.

Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (I loved the brain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further for add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed this family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive there. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century. You know how this is going to send not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over, but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than the never had in front of it.

The messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in China. He starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so the's trying to figure out who's receiving the messages (and who's also sending out messages in space). He and this wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent. They visit it. Everything looks normal, including the priest played by a bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent. So the and this wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens, disguised as priests and nuns. They are held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet. Once the alien get the special element, the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform. Lee, being the last alien left, tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens. Lee walks in the transporter and the's gone. The couple, looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world, decide to follow the aliens. Because earth is doomed, the couple does't see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear. The last shot of the movie is a paper cache planet earth exploding. The send. That's it. I've never seen such a dull movie in my life. It's the most underwhelming movie I've never experienced. The scientist and this wife are two of worst heroes for protagonists never put on screen. They don't care about anything. They see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide ""what the check, who needs earth anyway?"" They don't even try to stop them for do something to make things better. This kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent. The factors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their spaces, so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work. I was't expecting much with this movie because it IS a Charles Band production, but I did't expect it to be this bad. Christopher Lee was once asked what was this worst film the never made and the mentioned STARSHIP INVASIONS. Well, I'm sorry Chris but STARSHIP INVASIONS was actually goofy fun. STARSHIP INVASIONS is terrible but terribly entertaining. END OF THE WORLD is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH worst: it's beyond dull and inert, with NO entertainment value whatsoever.",negative

Take the High Ground was not anything like I remember basic training. But one has to remember at the time this was post Korea which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew them. It was not Vietnam, a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit. The draft at that time was an unwelcome, but accepted as still necessary for the country's defense. Richard Widmark is a veteran of Korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas. The film is about one of this training cycles and the men of the platoon the has to train. They're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade. One thing I will praise Take The High Ground for is the fact that MGM recognized your army was now an integrated one with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the platoon. It was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing. But I will say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured of this smart mouth from day one. Richard Widmark would have not risked death for becoming a eunuch in order to give Jerome Courtland confidence with a weapon. And no way would have the worried so much about Robert Arthur deserting. He's have just let the MPs deal with him. Of course being shot in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas did give Take the High Ground good authenticity. But view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day. I do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you were't worried about them getting on your case for something which was ninety-five% of the time. But there main't no way that Karl Malden would have slugged Widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits. Both would have realized that would have undermined authority, something the military just does't let happen. I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like its talented cast, it's talented director Richard Brooks, even the silly theme by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh from their Oscar a year before for High Noon. The film actually got an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and story by Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufman's vivid imagination.",negative

Both will realize that this will weaken their authority, something the military does not allow. But people should remember that this was after North Korea, which ended in the latter, but as we know, this was a normal war. The draft at the time was unpopular, but accepted as it was still necessary for national security. Another thing I want to commend for staying on high ground is that MGM recognizes that your army is now a combined force, and that William Hazzard exists as a black worker on the platoon. I remember the sergeant drill had their minor disputes. You can resolve these disputes if you don't worry about handling your situation ninety-five% of the time.",negative

The High Court was not something I remember as basic training. But then one has to remember that it was Korea that ended in a crisis, but it was a normal war as we know it. It was't Vietnam, it was a rebellious wild war in which we were constantly throwing drafts. The draft was not acceptable at the time, but it was adopted because it is still necessary to protect the country. Richard Weedmark is a Korean veteran who has now been assigned by the state to train troops abroad. The film is about one of these training cycles and the men in the team have to train themselves. This is the most common genre you can find in almost any war movie of the last decade. One thing I would recommend Tech the High Ground is the fact that MGM has seen that your army is now linked to the presence of William Hazard as a black man employed by the party. It was in the spirit of the changing times. But I would say that a hired man like Russell Timblin must have recovered from this clever mouth from day one. Richard Weedmark will not risk this life to become an eunuch in order to give Jerome Courtland confidence in arms. And there's no way the's more worried about Robert Arthur's departure. He recently allowed MPs to confront him. Yes, shooting in and around Fort Blaise and El Paso, Texas has given the Tech the High Ground great authenticity. But look at it as a film that brings people together in the army and you can understand why the government offered so much support in those days. I remember drill sergeants having their own little fights that you could deal with when you did't care that they would deal with your case for something that was ninety-five percent of the time. But there is no way that Carl Maldon has exposed Weedmark to the public during this training in front of many of the recruits' witnesses. Both will realize that this will be a small thing, which the army will not allow.

Also, early in the film, Tom Cruise shows this girlfriend a painting done by Monet--an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is. Cruise mentions that the painting has a ""vanilla sky"". I believe this is a hint to the moviegoer. This movie is like that impressionist painting. It's impressionist filmmaking! And it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting. This is not your typical linear plot. It requires more thought. There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you're not always going to be sure what's going on.

They did not only cut ""gore-shots"" - they have cut entire sequences, sparing only glimpses. Like: ""WE have to attack THEM"" - one five second shot of explosions in the camp - protagonist running away.

36420,"There are sample ideas about the film itself. I just want to talk about the kind of German I saw on TV recently. It was badly cut. From one hundred and thirty-three minutes to seventy-six minutes! It is not uncommon for German television stations to cut out areas with blood. I understand the reason, but this movie is another matter. They did't just cut the ""bloody shot"" - they cut the whole sequence, leaving a small impression. Example: ""We have to attack them"" - a five-second shot at the camp - the protagonist fled. When the invasion of the island began, it was difficult to follow the story. The whole set creates something the size of a series of weird, intermediate and meaningless shows. After spending sixty minutes on this kind of nonsense, I could’t bear to watch the post.

Immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children starring in the movie. The movie helped them better understand their own circumstances. For the first time, also, the oldest of the sibling group (seven year old/female) decided to open up to me a little bit about her past and the trauma she had experienced. She has been fighting the entire trust issue. This is also the first time I had seen her cry. After watching the film, I asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted.

37674,"I just saw Mar Ardentro and felt that I had to comment on this film. Euthanasia is a difficult topic in any field and unfortunately is can sometimes distort the true value of a movie. Many people have craved about the excellent cast and it's beautiful imagery/camera-work. Certainly Javier Bardem is an factor that brings something extra to each film the makes. To say that the encompasses the real Sampredo is a little silly since I don't think that any of the reviewers have known Sampredo personally. To lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed does't constitute a 'perfect' performance. Bardem just does what the does well. and that's it. The camera-work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself blacks to deliver. Sampredo there is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that the leaves this loving family behind and marries a woman that the only seeks out when the other will not help him in this quest for a dignified death. Now I'm not there to say anything about the right for for against euthanasia. The problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it. The movie's subject is so strong that you're almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter. I find it a weakness for the movie -unintentionally- portrays Sampredo as a unsymphatetic character. Someone who is much smarter then this family as portrayed in the simple cousin that does't ""get"" the double layered poem directed towards him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because HE thinks this life is undignified. A scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the ""wrong"" choice ending up in a far state of dementia thus indicating that Sampredo's choice was the right one. The woman that constantly seeks him out is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by Sampredo when she agrees to help him die. These choices make Sampredo into a calculated figure no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. Argumentive I would say it does't convince fully and I kinda think that Amenabar did't intend on adding this unbalanced element in this film. For a young director it's still an impressive film and it certainly has it's strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo for instance). The camera-work IS impressive and the film is well acted. But ten out of ten. no the movie does't reach that excellence.",positive

37674,"I just looked at Mar Ardentro and thought I should comment on this movie. Euthanasia is a deceptive topic in any field and, unfortunately, sometimes distorts the movie True Value. Most people want the best cast and beautiful pictures / photos. Yes, Javier Bardem is an important factor in the production of each film. It is absurd to say that it involves the real Sampredo, because I don't think anyone who comments knows Sampredo. It’s the kind of show to show off your attraction without walking away, even though it’s not the best thing to do. Bardem did only what the was good at. That's it. The photographic works are beautiful and revoke the emotions and ideas expressed by the darkness of the film itself. Sampredo is described as a man who longed for death so much that the left this loving family and married a woman. Now I am not talking about the right to oppose euthanasia. The problem is, it's hard to run away when you comment on such a movie. The content of this movie is so powerful that you can even discuss a movie with such a powerful theme. I found out that the weakness of the movie-misunderstood - portrayed Sampredo as an uninteresting person. Someone smarter than this family, as the simple cousin described, did not “find” a double poem aimed at him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because they believe that this kind of life is degrading. The combined show with a female lawyer who made the ""wrong"" choice in the movie eventually led to a difficult mental state, thus showing that Sampredo's choice was correct. The woman who continued to look for him was almost ignored by this beautiful lawyer, but when Sampredo agreed to help her die, the suddenly married her. No matter how attractive Baden portrays him, this choice makes Sampredo a well-thought-out person. On the contrary, I would say that it is not entirely convincing. I think Amenabar has no intention of adding to this inequality in this movie. For a young director, this is still an interesting movie, and so there are some fun times (like a conversation between a priest and Sampredo). The photographic works are amazing, and the film is well done. But ten to ten. No, this movie did not reach the level of excellence.",positive
37992,"Let me be clear. I've used IMDb for years. But only today I went through the trouble of registering on the site, just so I could give this movie the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of films, some of them bad, a few awful. Never, though, have i seen such a contrast of pretence and incompetence, of high intentions and failure. Mira Sorvino is horribly cast as the princess, but entirely unbelievable as Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even, than in the insipid French play that is the source (Marivaux never reached Hollywood until now, and we should keep it that way). To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker, shouting out names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is played even sillier. For this, the pair should receive a joint 'Clair Danes' award, which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired are-interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). Aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming. For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the principal characters. The Director wants us to realize she's adapted a play. I get it. But it does't happen at all until far into the film. At that point, seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is creepy and distracting. They're like some sort of sun-scary zombie crowd, appearing through the mists, filling us with dread. When you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie, you'll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustice of poisoning your mind for one hundred and twelve minutes.-Matthew McGuire",negative

Meanwhile, seeing a group of people sitting on chairs for a while, then disappearing, was cruel and disturbing.

There is nothing wrong with having ideas, as long as you use them to cool things. Boy do, Roddenberry and company are doing great things for this. The story begins when the Romulans broke the treaty a hundred years ago and crossed a neutral zone and destroyed a series of external coupons in the area, apparently testing their main weapons and invisible screens (and the transfer of power coordination). . Kirk has to decide whether it is worth the risk to try to stop the Romulan ship, because in reality the biggest risk is to let them go after the invaders have destroyed four military bases. Kirk chose the latter wisely. This is the first time you have seen the enemy of the Federation, the Romulans, a war-like nation but glorious in their own way. They are distant relatives of the Vulcans. However, unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romanians did not abandon their emotions and the violence and imperialist ways, even though they had made advances in technology. All of this is irrelevant to Mr. The most important thing to him - the hatred that Romulans and Spock look like one. Spock saved lives until the was sent (naturally). This is in stark contrast to Captain Kirk and the Romulan Emperor, neither of whom has a desire to do this will. They both just do their jobs. After all, it is mutual respect. This is the first series of Trek to deal directly with discrimination, and it is very clever (as opposed to ""Let it be your last battle"" in Season three). Just like the enemy below, we played an old game of chess between two captains of two very similar ships. You will soon find out that the two managers are very good. very good. If you are going to fight, you will want both of these people to be your leader. They are both respectable and dignified people with a sense of responsibility. However, even though Emperor Romulan is responsible for this homeland, the still finds himself wanting to destroy it before the returns to this hometown, rather than start another war between the stars. However, the will still make every effort to bring it home, just as Kirk tried this best to stop him. In my opinion, this is one of the five Trek. It has it all: lots of movement, scepticism, fun dialogue, great shows (I still think Romulan Director is the best Trek character of Mark Lenard), and the is table to make social comments without over-preaching. It is unfortunate that Roddenberry forgot the last part when making TNG. Look at this article, and look at the enemies below.",negative

In the final sequence, the similarities between the crimes committed by the convicted Poncelet and this murder are significant. No, what about the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon? It makes you breathe, they are two giants, and their performance has reached the highest level of emotion. Tim Robbins made it clear that this is not only a good thing, but also a good director. * My rating: nine / ten",positive
