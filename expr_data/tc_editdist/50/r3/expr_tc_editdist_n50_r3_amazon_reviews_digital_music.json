While I can see why they'd think this(Bun B is always hungry when the craps, leading one to believe the's trying to make an impact on the industry - despite the fact the already has made a significant one), Bun B has been in the biz for well over a decade, alongside this partner in rhyme(although, 'in crime' maybe more appropriate for Pimp C than it is for most), Pimp C.

Unfortunately the Kingz' publicity still does't compare to their skills, and only true heads have been table to check out their undeniably dope music. Hailing from Port Author, they may not be Houstonians, but they still possess the love of flossing', and grinding', as well as slow hypnotic beats, and equally entrancing flows. On Ridin' Dirty, UGK provide one of the most revered music to never come from the South; and for good reason. While one may criticise them for their admittedly limited subject matter(whips, drips, chips, tips, and tricks), they deliver their craps with so much finesse, and style that you can't help but overlook these issues. No matter how much these things are wrapped about, UGK always provide an interesting take on them, complete with captivating rhymes, and superb flows. Their production? Just as bomber, yet hypnotic as their flows. Highlights? I'd say this album has gems, but in all honesty, it's a complete gold mine. Every single track on this album is a five-star cut, and even the outdo has a dope enough beat to warrant it that label, despite the fact it's all shout-outs. Whether it's the smoothed out, Isley-sampled \"One Day,\" the gritty \"Murder,\" the Southern anthem \"Diamonds & Wood,\" for the impressive showing of wordplay on \"Touched\"(which Jay-Z lifted a verse from on \"ninety-nine Problems\"), this album has something for every ship-hop head.

I, along with a legion of long-time fans, grieved the loss of this incredible singer and performer. Initially, this death at that particular time in this career seemed terribly unfair. After stagnating during the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy and early one thousand, nine hundred and heights, Orbison was back and perhaps even better than never in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. His collaboration with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, George Harrison, and Jeff Lynne in the form of The Traveling Wilburys had put him back in the national spotlight, and many of us longed for the new album soon to be released, an album we had heard nothing but incredibly good things about. Then, suddenly, the and the voice that touched your hearts for so many years, was gone. We, the fans, should have been rewarding Roy Orbison for all of the memories the gave us in song, yet, never the selfless and humble man the was, Orbison actually presented all of us with a final, precious gift in the form of the album Mystery Girl. Roy's wow Barbara deserves your heartfelt thanks for bravely putting the finishing touches on this album after her husband's death. Mystery Girl is simply an incredible album featuring a reenergize Roy Orbison easily uniting this unique voice to a modern sound that appealed to any number of years; the released tracks from this album found sample playing time on both pop rock and country radio stations. Perhaps the first single, You Got It, got too much attention, as it was nearly played to death over the course of the first half of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, but that is just a tribute to the wonderful beauty and infectious beat and rhythm of this song co-written by Orbison and Wilbury buddies Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty. The second track on the album, In the Real World, marks an abrupt change in stone; bringing to mind Roy's classic song In Dreams; Orbison captures your heard on the first note and soars with it through the clouds that only the possessed the means of exploring. This haunting track is, in my opinion, the best song on the album. Roy decides to rock a little bit on (All I Can Do Is) Dream You before stopping to wax poetic and heartbreaking on the slow ballad A Love So Beautiful, a song featuring a little musical support from co-writer Jeff Lynne and George Harrison. California Blue (another Orbison-Lynne-Petty venture), The Only One, and Windsurfer are great songs in their own right, but special attention must be shown the remaining three tracks. Careless Heart is a beautiful song of love and loss that seems to convey a sense of the type of feelings we felt over the loss of this man taken much too soon from your midst. She's a Mystery To Me, written by Utwo's Bono and The Edge, presents Roy with a slightly different type of song that the easily makes this own, hitting the high notes perfectly on the choruses. Then there is The Comedians, a song written by Elvis Costello; this is vintage Roy Orbison, delivering a strikingly visual display of betrayal and loss, the very subjects Roy seemed to understand more than any other singer out there. Mystery Girl is a very special album that Roy Orbison fans will treasure and play often for the rest of your lives. I wish Roy would have lived to see the incredible reception this album received from fans, but one can take comfort in the fact that Orbison left this world on top where the always belonged.","overall":5,"summary":"A final, precious gift from Roy to his fans","unixReviewTime":1055376000,"reviewTime":"06 12, 2003"}

Roy decided to rock a little (All I can do is dream), then stopped being poetry and heartbroken at a slow ballad Very good love, songwriters Jeff Lynn and George Harrison A little musical help was provided. California Blue (another Orbison-Lynne-Petty affiliate program), the only one, and Windsurfer are great songs in themselves, but should pay more attention to the remaining three tracks. Indifference is a beautiful song of love and loss, which seems to convey the feeling of closing the person, because the person has been taken from you right away. It's a mystery to me made by Bono aka Utwo and Edge, and showed Roy a different kind of song. This song is easy to make yourself and hit the high notes in the choir.

For instance, \"MATW\"'s two opening tracks, \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Levon\", both display a vibrant orchestral fluidity (especially the latter selection), as well as a unique, melancholic autobiographical charm (moreso prevalent in \"Levon\"). \"Tiny Dancer\" was written about Taupin's girlfriend at the time, a dancer named Maxine Feibelman. What makes \"Madman. \" a musician's clinic, are the percussive guitar and mandolin skills, which are craftfully provided by the likes of drummer Roger Pope and axeman extraordinaire Davey Johnstone - whose talents on the mandolin are quite exceptional on the road-heavy \"Holiday Inn\". Johnstone would become a full-fledged member of The Elton John Band by the time EJ's next LP, \"Honky Chateau\", was released the following year in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. Adding to this standout array of musicianship, is guest Rick Wakeman, whose playing on a majority of \"MATW\"'s tracks is sometimes barely audible, and on selections such as \"Razor Face\", the pulls it off in spades. Wakeman would soon leave the Strawbs and join Yes after working on this album. Also introduced to the band are bassist Dee Murray and drummer Nigel Olsson, both of whom appear on one track, the impeccably overwrought \"All The Nasties\". Both Murray and Olsson would become prime-time EJ Band members also by the release of \"Honky Chateau\". The CD's title track is sure to give even the most casual Elton John fan \"suspensful down your spine chills and thrills\", courtesy of \"Madman's. \" intense lyrical and orchestral vinegar. EJ and BT both paint a rich, textured Native American cultural landscape and soundscape in \"Indian Sunset\", as if they realistically transported themselves back in time and dweller amongst the natives (not bad for a couple of Brits, would't you say?).

For these two songbirds, that is a very good thing, for fans of these two compositional wonders would't have it any other way, including yours truly. \"Goodbye\" is a fitting send to the CD's macabre, storybook-like novella. \"Madman Across The Water\" is an absolute must for all die-hard Eltonians to have in their CD collection(s).

Artists gave each song their full attention and talent, and that's why artists could get so many hit singles off of each album. Michael Jackson took that to an extreme with this album Thriller, which is the bestselling album of all time. The recognition it got was amazing. weight Grammy Awards. seven Top Ten singles. MTV has even picked Michael Jackson's Thriller over as the best video of all time at some point for another. This CD was more than just great music: it revolutionized everything. Beat It will probably be remembered most. There was a guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen in the song, and in the video Michael brought two real life street gangs together for a huge dance scene. The song Thriller revolutionized videos. While the song itself was't as huge as others, the video stood out. It was seventeen+ minutes of special effects, dance scenes and good old campy horror fun. Michael turned into both a zombie and a werewolf in the video, and it is safe to say this video changed the music video industry forever. After it there were no more clips of artists singing onstage in microphones. More special effects and dance sequences were brought in. Billie Jean is another album masterpiece with another great video. One of my personal favourites is Track #one, Wanna Be Startin Something, which has infectious opening that will be stuck in your head for a very long time. The duet The Girl Is Mine probably inspired Brandy & Monica's song The Boy Is Mine, and is a great song that is both humorous and serious at the same time. This song does't get a lot of recognition as being one of this best, but it actually made it to No.two on the charts. Even the two non top ten singles are exceptionally good. This album is the best in history. Period. Michael Jackson has revolutionized so much and created a lot of controversy. This artist is perhaps one of the best of all time.

This album is very old to me, sounds very new, and today I enjoy it more than when I first heard it. This map version is a fan month because it has the right sound quality, and the map design is one of the best I've never seen, using the highest quality cardboard and assembly. There is also a twenty-two-page glossy booklet containing all the words and photos of Thai dancers in the over of Michael and \"White Dark\", Eddie Murphy and Iman in the \"Remember Time\" video, along with sixteen other factors. A black and white booklet with all the words in Japanese. It\u2019s like I\u2019m listening to a brand new album, and I can see that this album has finally replaced \u201cBad\u201d as my favourite Michael Jackson album. This version of the \"Accident\" map may be the best version of the current album, and it deserves to be improved, even if the map design is good in itself. Excellent map design, excellent sound quality and excellent classic content make this genre \"dangerous\" highly recommended!","overall":5,"summary":"Ahead Of It's Time, Brilliant Jackson Album Has Just Gotten Even Better!","unixReviewTime":1250985600,"reviewTime":"08 23, 2009"}

This version of \"Dangerous\" Maps is probably the best version of the album currently available and is really worth the upgrade even if it is designed just for good map design. The beautiful design of the maps, excellent sound quality, and excellent content that you have created so well is highly recommended in this version of \"Dangerous\"!","overall":5,"summary":"Ahead Of It's Time, Brilliant Jackson Album Has Just Gotten Even Better!","unixReviewTime":1250985600,"reviewTime":"08 23, 2009"}

In the course of this life the released exactly one album; it could have been the first of a stunning catalogue, and there's no telling what the might have done if the than't drowned in a boating accent. Oh sure, there are a couple other releases to give some hints; a live album for two, one compilation of unreleased tracks-in-progress, and one disc of assorted early demos. (I guess the never made quite the same posthumous-productivity deal with the devil that Jimi Hendrix did.) But this is the only finished product we have to listen to, and as much of a treasure as it is, to me it seems simply a warmup for some future masterpiece we'll never hear. Grace is hard to describe easily. At heart it's basically rock and roll, but. it's rock with one foot in the blues, one foot in the folk tradition, its hands reaching out to space and its voice in the heavens. Ahhhh. Jeff does things with this vocal cords that seem to push the boundaries of what's humanly possible. It's undeniably distinct from the first time the eerie wails of \"Mojo Pin\" slowly bloom into existence, eventually giving way to a slow-burning verse full of raw emotion. His high register may take some getting used to, but Jeff's singing does tricks and turns I've rarely heard from anyone. reaching its speak midway through the album in the lonely desolation of this most well-known cover, \"Hallelujah.\"Like many others, I'm particularly partial to that one. (Hey: if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best, and lyricists don't come better than Leonard Cohen.) This track best demonstrates just how special this talent was - with just a guitar and voice the pours this entire heart out for the world to hear, managing to sound soul-weary, powerfully spirited and nervously frail all at once. I could easily imagine the wistful \"Lilac Wine\" being an exceptional standout ballad on an album from anyone else, but there it has to take second place. Even the half-cliched lyric of \"Lover, You Should've Come Over\" sounds nothing but compelling just due to Jeff's soul-baring vocal performance. Incidentally, that tune has one of the most fitting uses of an morgan I've heard in a rock song; it starts with a creepy Phantom-of-the-Opera stone, but mellows out into something that sounds almost like an accordion. Perfect. Only four stars, then? Well, as much as I'm tempted to give a perfect rating because so much of Grace still blows me away (and considering the special rating usually reserved for talented artists who die young), I still can't call this one perfect. \"So Real\" drags with repetition at times, and the degree of contrast between the whisper-quiet verse and the crashing drum-filled chorus can grate on my nerves. \"Corpus Christi Carol\" is too much like a church hymn for my taste. (Go figure, meh?)Jeff and crew liven things up now and then amid all the easy-paced ballads. \"Last Goodbye\" is surprisingly sunny, jogging along with a bouncy beat and a happy string arrangement, though the major-keyed melody in't enough to hide the sadness in the words. \"Eternal Life\" can be a downer, but it's a downer with a lot of lively singing, mad kicking drums and some killer guitar hooks. True to form, it slides into something slower and almost spooky with \"Dream Brother.\" Like the rest of the disc, that one leaves me with an unshakable sense of something almost foreboding, yet hopeful in the middle of it all. There's something otherworldly about it all. OK, looks like I've been long-winded enough. Grace in't an album I can wholeheartedly recommend to anyone at all, but I can state that if you've got an year for a fine musical performance and a real feeling for soul-stirring music, you'll probably be well-served there.

Having purged himself of this heroin habit that had so negatively effected this playing, the had assembled from the ashes of this first great quintet a working band that was capable of flexing with him, the was a year since this first collaborative big band effort with Gil Evans that was such an artistic triumph and this first true masterpiece (\"Miles Ahead\"), and the was a year away from this second, this time in a small group setting (\"Kind of Blue\"). It is into this that the and Gil Evans reconvened for a big band session of material from Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\". While it is the weakest of the three principle albums the pair cd together, it is still a fine record filled with extraordinary material, and certainly for a lesser artist, would have been the highlight of their career. The big band, similar in formation to \"Miles Ahead\" (twelve brass, four breeds bass and drums), performed shifting backing tracks, adding color, texture and mood in a fashion only Evans was table to capture, on top of which Davis would solo, largely on flugelhorn. Perhaps moreno than \"Miles Ahead\", the backing on these sessions is full of subtlety and cleverness, and in virtuosity on its own, Miles' own soloing is remarkably overshadowed at times, in particular by Philly Joe Jones' inimitable brilliant drumming on \"Gone\" (which also has a brilliant and nearly inaudible bass clarinet line) and Bill Barber's monster tuba playing on several tracks (\"Buzzard Song\", \"Bess, You Is My Woman Now\"). Mind you, this in't to say Miles in't totally absorbed by and feeding back into the music-- Evans is remarkably inspiring to Davis, and this playing is unbelievable nearly throughout, passionate and punctuated on \"Gone, Gone, Gone\", speechlike and completely invested on \"Prayer (Oh Doctor Jesus)\" (conceivably one of the most powerful solos Davis never took), melancholy and nearly overpowering on \"My Man's Gone Now\", and just completely enjoyable on \"There's a Boat Leaving Soon From New York\". If all of this was't quite enough, the album ranks in perhaps the best version of the seemingly endlessly performed \"Summertime\"-- Davis is light, bouncy, excited, and yet with that sense of haunting that is so hard to capture as the solos on trumpet. The remaster gives nice, crisp sound, good balance between instruments, and a handful of bonus tracks that provide for interesting listening. Still, for all this, the album in't quite the perfection of \"Miles Ahead\" for \"Sketches of Spain\"-- I'm not sure what it is, it could be that I just don't like \"Fishermen, Strawberry and Devil Crab\", for it could be something else, but there's a bit missing. But even with this caveat, this is a really wonderful recording, and certainly has a good place in everyone's collection.

Perhaps moreno than \"Miles Ahead\", the backing on these sessions is full of subtlety and cleverness, and in virtuosity on its own, Miles' own soloing is remarkably overshadowed at times, in particular by Philly Joe Jones' inimitable brilliant drumming on \"Gone\" (which also has a brilliant and nearly inaudible bass clarinet line) and Bill Barber's monster tuba playing on several tracks (\"Buzzard Song\", \"Bess, You Is My Woman Now\"). The big band, similar in formation to \"Miles Ahead\" (twelve brass, four breeds bass and drums), performed shifting backing tracks, adding color, texture and mood in a fashion only Evans was table to capture, on top of which Davis would solo, largely on flugelhorn. Still, for all this, the album in't quite the perfection of \"Miles Ahead\" for \"Sketches of Spain\"-- I'm not sure what it is, it could be that I just don't like \"Fishermen, Strawberry and Devil Crab\", for it could be something else, but there's a bit missing. Having purged himself of this heroin habit that had so negatively effected this playing, the had assembled from the ashes of this first great quintet a working band that was capable of flexing with him, the was a year since this first collaborative big band effort with Gil Evans that was such an artistic triumph and this first true masterpiece (\"Miles Ahead\"), and the was a year away from this second, this time in a small group setting (\"Kind of Blue\"). If all of this was't quite enough, the album ranks in perhaps the best version of the seemingly endlessly performed \"Summertime\"-- Davis is light, bouncy, excited, and yet with that sense of haunting that is so hard to capture as the solos on trumpet. While it is the weakest of the three principle albums the pair cd together, it is still a fine record filled with extraordinary material, and certainly for a lesser artist, would have been the highlight of their career.","overall":4,"summary":"The weakest Miles & Gil still yields high.","unixReviewTime":1119830400,"reviewTime":"06 27, 2005"}

The production team of Gamble and Huff may not get the acclaim they deserve today, but they were one of the very best of the era, and \"Back Stabbers\" shows why. Too many producers use the studio merely to \"sweeten\" an artist's sound, removing any rough edges in the hope of producing something palatable to the general listener. The O'Jays and Gamble and Huff were not para of playing plenty of sounds on top of the band's gritty vocals, but the goal was always to make the sound more rich and interesting. A good case in point is \"nine hundred and ninety-two Arguments,\" which spices excellent lead singing with soaring backup vocals, strings, slightly jazzy vibes and tasty guitar clicks. As the song slowly moves out, the band's vocals slowly dissolve into the swirl of instrumentation. It's a beautifully crafted pop tune. The O'Jays were masters of soul balladry, as \"Listen to the Clock on the Wall\" demonstrates. Again, the care taken in production is evidenced by the song's opening notes, when the bass slowly tolls a repetitive pattern -- the clock sticking on the wall. The chant-like opening chorus gives way to the heartfelt vocal -- like the best soul singing, the sentiments are simple, but the absolute conviction of the vocal elevates the tune far beyond mere sentiment. And, of course, a few hits are thrown in, including the marvellously cynical title cut, the rock-influenced \"For the Love of Money,\" and the bright \"Love Train.\"If the album contains any missteps in the vocals for the productions that encase them, they are hard to find.

The Stooges were known as the west version of The Doors during their first run through a self-titled debut (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) and Fun House (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy), before imploding due to many demons found outside the band's home of Ann Arbor, Michigan. David Bowie's MainMan Management signed the group, which was initially down to Iggy Pop and new guitarist James Williamson. The duo eventually added former Stooges Ron Asheton (switching from guitar to bass) and Scott Asheton (drums). Produced by Pop, this initial mix was deemed inferior by MainMan and - under the threat that the album was not going to be released - agreed to have Bowie remix seven of the weight tracks (Pop's \"Search and Destroy\" remained), which was done in one day. The original Pop mix has been released (\"Rough Power\"), along with this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven remix, but the fast work by Bowie to salvage the project is superior. Though marred by technical difficulties, the October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three gig in Atlanta, Georgia, features a motivated Pop and Ron Asheton proving beyond any doubt that the was one of the best bassists during this wild decade for rock music. That the tape languished in a vault and not cleaned up through studio overdubs is an incredible upside, since there is minimal quality recordings which capture The Stooges in their performance part glory. An outtake from the \"Raw Power\" sessions - the cool jam \"Doojiman\" - and a rehearsal of \"Head On\" conclude this second disc.

Of course, if you are a fan, then you probably already have heard this album a thousand times and agree with me, but if you are the latter, you will be surprised at how intense and how artistic this album is. Up until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine Phil dominated both TV and radio airwaves with this suave and cool music videos and songs, ranging from the sweet rock coolness of In The Air Tonight to the bubbly pop of Two Hearts. But Seriously gave Phil a new credibility. Here the is more than just that, the is a perfectionist artist. The first single showed, for the first time, Phil Collins singing a different tune from this past hits, a song about the poor and homeless, Another Day In Paradise. The song became a worldwide anthem that year sparking repeated airplay and learning the grammy for best song. For many, this song is the highlight of the album. But in truth, its just one of a lot of highlights. Actually, the entire album was the highlight of the moment. The maturity of That's Just The Way It Is, Father To Son, and All Of My Life can easily cast over Another Day In Paradise. The sweet love ballad Do You Remember?, which appears in the soundtrack of Nicholas Cage's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety bomb Fire Birds, is deliciously good. The chilling rock epic I Wish It Would Rain Down that features guitar work from Eric Clapton dawns as a remarkable highlight on the album. Colors follows in the theme of Another Day In Paradise as a moment to give a thought to the poor and homeless. The album's closer Find A Way To My Heart, another track that was featured in the soundtrack to the Nicholas Cage flop Fire Birds, is an excellent pick for the closing of such a genuine album. The song opens up with some really cool electronic sounds and then slowly escalates and progresses into one big bang of a song. Phil Collins still is around today, still making music but nothing as good as But Seriously.

But deep down, it gave Phil a new please of life. Here's more, a perfect artist. The first show of its kind, for the first time, Phil Collins sang a different song from the previous one, a song about the poor and homeless, another day in heaven.

The upcoming song Find the Way My Heart, another song featuring Nicholas Cage Flop Firebirds, is a great way to close out a real album. The song opens with really cool electric sounds and then slowly rises to the cloud sound of the song. Phil Collins still exists today, still making music but not as good as but deeply. You may still think that these old things from the early eighties were amazing, but deep down, this is Phil Collins' best album!

It's maybe Tori's best lyrically! Tori branches out and uses the Bosendorfer instead of the piano. It's very interesting the creativity in her music on this album.'Pele' offers us eighteen songs, all captivating and unique. I cd't know about Tori until about three years ago so I bought all her previous albums at once. thing is, this used to be my least favourite. I gave it ONE listen (stupid, I know) and I was so wrapped up in 'Little Earthquakes' and 'From the Choirgirl Hotel' that I never picked it up again. Until earlier this year and I discovered how amazingly beautiful and harsh this album really is. The album opens with the short \"intro\" 'Beauty Queen', showcasing Tori's vocal range and depth. 'Horses' is beautifully written, it's a slower song and sucks you in to the rest of the album. 'Blood Roses' is lyrically my favourite. It is absolutely different and Tori's vocals are amazing: 'I shaved every place where you've been boy' - pooh. 'Father Lucifer' is another slower song featuring some controversial lyrics. 'Professional Widow' - what to say about this - everyone knows 'Widow', it's a downright raw emotional song that is perfect for after the breakup. Get your danger out. 'Mr. Zebra' is a short, sweet sounding song but I haven't actually grasped the true meaning of it. yet. 'Marianne' is slow, a tragic sounding song. 'Caught A Lite Sneeze' is absolute brilliance! Her voice will capture you 'beauty, stumbling down, did't know your love was so small, could't stand at all, Mr. St. John just bring your son'. 'Muhammad My Friend' has always been a favourite of mine, it's beautiful lyrically and pleasant musically. This one tells a story unlike any other. 'Hey Jupiter' is probably one of the best songs I've heard in years. It's gorgeous and this song could ONLY be done by Tori, nobody can match her vocals. No one. 'Way Down' is another short song like 'Mr. Zebra', nothing bad there. 'Little Amsterdam' is another one of my favourites, her voice again 'Mama, it was't my bullet' her presence is felt through her voice and lyrics. Chills! 'Talula' has got this crazy Harpsichord going on, very strange musically but nothing blacks lyrically. 'Not The Red Baron' is a quiet, slow song and tragic, when Tori sings 'just another pilot down' - it sends chills down your tickling spine. 'Agent Orange' is a weird song, I must confess. It's a short song, again but unique and fun to listen to. 'Doughnut Song' is ridiculously good. These are the kind of songs you get warmth from and you just want to tell the world about it. 'In The Springtime of this Voodoo' is fun to listen to, it's upbeat and extremely different. 'Putting The Damage On' is like 'Doughnut Song' - it's beautiful but this one is more tragic, 'boy you still look pretty when you're putting the damage on' . pooh. Lastly, 'Twinkle' a nice song and the perfect ending to a great, powerful and music breaking record. Tori Amos has become my favourite female performer, she's the most talented woman on this planet and I've loved everything she's done. Don't put this on and NOT pay attention like I did . when you put this on for the first time, LISTEN and it'll never leave your CD player.","overall":5,"summary":"A different yet pleasant album","unixReviewTime":1089849600,"reviewTime":"07 15, 2004"}

'No Red Baron' is a quiet, slow and sad song, when Tori sings \"Another pilot\" - it will make your back pitch. \"Little Amsterdam\" is one of my favourites, her voice saying \"Mama, this is not my bullet\", and her presence can be heard with her voice and voice. \u2018Trained Wow\u2019 \u2014 how to put it - everyone knows\u2018 Widow \u2019, this is a real emotional song, perfect for a song after a breakup.

'Horses' are well written, a slow song that will immerse you in another album. \u2018Blood Roses\u2019 is my favourite wording. This is completely different. Tori's singing is amazing: \"I shaved all over the place where the boy was born\" - Bah. \"Father Lucifer\" is another slow-moving song that contains conflicting lyrics. \u2018Professional Widow\u2019 \u2014 how to put it - everyone knows\u2018 Widow \u2019, this is the first emotional song, most suitable for a song after a breakup. Discard your risk. Manene. Zebra 'is a short and sweet song, but I have yet to discover its true meaning. Even thought. 'Marianne' is very slow, a song that sounds sad. 'Lite Sneezing Catch' is so fun! His voice will catch you beautiful, you will stumble, I don't know if your love is small, I can't stand it at all, Mr. John is taking your son '.

Cold! 'Talula' performed this crazy harpsichord game. It's very unusual in music, but it's not dark in song. 'No Raron Baron' is a quiet, slow and scary song, as Tori sings \"Just another pilot\" - it will make you pitch. 'Agent Orange' is a strange song, I have to admit. This is a short song, but it's also unique and interesting. \"Donuts Song\" is very fun. These are songs that you get warm to, you just want to tell the world. \u2018During the Voodoo Spring\u2019 season sounds exciting, hopeful, and very different. 'Putting Damage On' is like a 'Doughnut Song' - nice, but this is even sadder, 'boy, when you do damage, you still look good'. Phoh. Ultimately, \u2018Twinkle\u2019 is a fun, big, powerful song with the perfect ending to breaking music records.

It's a shame that Fireball has been kind of forgotten about, it clearly holds up against In Rock and Who Do We Think We Are. If you're just starting to collect their albums, maybe you already have Machine Head, this one won't disappoint you. It is one of the great rock albums of the seventies. The diverse highlights include: Fireball, Strange Kind of Woman, Anyone's Daughter, Fools and No One Came. (The twenty-fiveth anniversary edition also includes additional highlights: Demon's Eye, I'm Alone and Freedom) I'd easily take this album over any Sabbath for Zeppelin album. Gillan sings far superior to Ozzy for Plant, Ritchie Blackmore plays a more classically tinged and intense guitar, Roger Glover plays a more hard driving aggressive bass, Ian Paice plays a more sophisticated style of drumming, that swings and Jon Lord brings keyboards to the table, which puts them miles ahead of their rivals. One last note, This is the thinking persons rock music, raw and powerful. Blackmore, Gillan, Glover, Lord and Paice are probably the best Deep Purple line-up of the seventies.

Only Guns N' Roses debut, \"Appetite for Destruction\" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) can possibly compete with \"Van Halen\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight) in terms of greatness in the hard rock genre. \"Van Halen\" is the definitive rock album that set the stage for almost every hard-rock band from the one thousand, nine hundred and heights. Poison, RATT, Quiet Riot, Warrant, Cinderella, Dokken, LA Guns, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, and many more, all took their cue from Van Halen.\"Van Halen,\" is the prototype that set the stage for the decade to follow. Every singer wanted to be like Dav Lee Roth, and every guitar player wanted to be Eddie Van Halen. Dave and Eddie were gods, truly rock in' roll icons if never there were any. Van Halen's debut introduced the world to Diamond David Lee Roth. Roth is truly a maverick in the annals of rock. As journalist Malcolm Dome writes \"Roth was not merely a frontman, not just a vocalist, but a volcanic eruption of cabaret, Vaudeville, rock in roll and Las Vegas\" (Excess All Areas, Castle Communications, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four). While the band and the songs on Van Halen's debut are top notch, it is Roth that gives them the magic touch. If Sammy Hagar had been Van Halen's vocalist in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight \"Van Halen\" would have been a great album, no doubt, but not the masterpiece that it is. Without Dave, Vince Neil, Brett Michaels, Sebastian Bach, Kid Rock, Anthony Kiedis, among others would have had to look elsewhere for inspiration. Van Halen's debut showcased Eddie Van Halen. With \"Van Halen,\" Eddie reinvented the language of guitar. His trademark tapping and laser-fast hammer-ons became the blueprint for a generation of future guitar players. Steve Vai, George Lynch, Zack Wylde, Jerry Cantrell and Billy Corgan among others were all heavily influenced by Eddie Van Halen. Drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony provided a stunning rhythm section. Alex Van Halen's drumming was intense, without being bombastic. While Michael Anthony in't the most famous member of VH, this playing was the glue the bound the sound together. And with Eddie Van Halen on guitar, a flashy bass player may have been too much. Most importantly, Anthony's signature high-pitched background vocals and harmonies were the perfect counterpart to Roth's bluesy baritone delivery. Together, the four members were an unstoppable, rock in' roll machine that bulldozed over all competitors and created six of the best albums in the history of rock. As Roth once commented, if you put a Van Halen album in your shelf, it will melt all the other records in your collection. Roth has commented in this autobiography, \"Crazy from the Heat,\" (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven) the band sounded as good as it did because they played live in the studio without a lot of overdubs. He points out that while the band would record a song three for four times, the first take was usually the best, because it was \"distraction fee, fear free\" and the band was not self-conscious. Roth notes how with classic Van Halen, you can hear and make out each individual instrument-guitar, bass, drums, vocals, very clear and separate. Nowhere is this more apparent than on Van Halen's debut. Roth also notes in this book that the two major albums popular at the time of the recording of \"Van Halen\" were \"Saturday Night Fever\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven) and \"Nevermind the Bullocks, there's the Sex Pistols\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven). Roth notes that \"Van Halen\" was somewhere in between both albums. It was danceable, celebratory, and polished, yet intense, fast, and furious. Every song on \"Van Halen\" is a winner. Every song is a highlight. Every song is catchy and melodic with a good hook and groove. It's no small wonder why almost every song from \"Van Halen\" is a staple on any classic rock station. The mid-tempo, bluesy, \"Runnin' with the Devil\" gets the album off to a great start. The backwards car horn intro, pounding bass, high-pitched screams, and killer solos were the perfect way to introduce to the world to the mighty Van Halen. With \"Eruption\" Eddie shows this chops in this mold-breaking solo. A cover of the Kinks \"You Really Got Me\" proves to be better than the original. The opening riff of \"Ain't Talkin' `Bout Love\" is one of the most well known intros of all-time. From the classic opening, to Dave's cocky delivery, to Eddie's killer solos, this remains an all time classic. They don't make songs like this anymore. The rapid-fire \"I'm the One\" takes \"Van Halen\" into warp-speed. Alex's jazzy drumming, Michael Anthony's background harmonies, and Dave's bohemian delivery over Eddie's full-throttle assault makes this song head straight for the jugular. The do-wop ending right before the grand finale is the perfect touch. The album slows down a notch for the cocky-but-sensitive \"Jamie's Cryin.\" High on melody, no one could using this song like Dave. This song is so catchy you'll be singing it in the shower after just one listen. The sci-fi themed \"Atomic Punk\" grabs you by the collar and refuses to let go. It has a crazed, paranoid, chaotic feel, without loosing structure. The triumphant \"Feel Your Love Tonight\" is a celebration of the splendour and naivety of youth. No matter how old you are for where you are in life, this song will make you feel good. The album slows down for the subdued \"Little Dreamer,\" which is one of the only real cheerless song on the album. An code to a closer with lost dreams, Roth seems to pity the protagonist. This song, with its eerie background vocals is haunting and submissive yet powerful and edgy. The mood lightens up a bit for the tongue-in-cheek \"Ice Cream Man\" which adds a bit of humour to the album.\"On Fire\" is one of Van Halen's most underrated songs. It's one of the heaviest, most rocking songs they have never recorded. But in an album chock-full of classics, it's easy to see why it has been overlooked. I have listened to \"Van Halen\" hundreds of times and have never grown tired of hearing it. In addition, there are a lot of subtleties going on, so whenever I do listen to it, I often hear something new that I haven't heard before.\"Van Halen\" is flawless and sounds as good today as it did in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. In terms of instrumental firepower, showmanship, tight compositions, melody, and overall memorable songs, few albums can compete. While every rock fan should own the first six Van Halen albums, \"Van Halen\" is absolutely essential to any good collection. The two thousand remaster addition of \"Van Halen\" is an improvement over the original CD release. Now every nook and cranny can be made out and enjoyed for years to come. In the years to come, the universe will continue to expand, suns will die and turn into black holes, politicians will lie and be embedded in scandal, trends will come and go, bands will rise and fall, but \"Van Halen\" will never be outshone.","overall":5,"summary":"The album that broke the mold","unixReviewTime":1130544000,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2005"}

Also, the album cover is instantly recognizable; it's now a classic album cover (I've always liked it, not sure why but the smoking angel painting always looked amazing to me). As you probably know by now, \"Jump\" was the huge hit from this album. \"Jump\" relied heavily on synths, a catchy chorus and a dose of metal. Perhaps I've heard it too many times by now but it's still an amazing song and I can't deny it's a classic. \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" the song is just a one minute synths intro to \"Jump\" and does't have much significance besides being an introduction, nothing great about it either but it does set the listener up for the next song. Sounds kinda futuristic. \"Panama\" is one of my favourite Van Halen songs, this is quintessential Van Halen with the band at its very best. The intro gets you right into it and the breakdown at the send is fantastic with the engine noise and all, I can't say enough good things about this song. If you think \"Jump\" is a bit two commercial \"Panama\" will be right in your valley. \"Top Jimmy\" is another one that is loved by fans, an excellent song what can I say? \"Drop Dead Legs\" sounds like it was influenced by Led Zeppelin which I suspect was the case since the band are after all, fans of Zeppelin! Listen to that riff and drum beat and tell me it does't sound even a little like LZ, good track. \"Hot For Teacher\" is pure VH, fast, dirty, upbeat and sexual, how can you not like it and be a Van Halen fan? After all these years I'm willing to bet they're still \"for teacher\", Dave sounds amazing there. \"I'll Wait\" is another synth-driven song and being slower-paced has some characteristics of a ballad but it's a really a great slow rocker with some excellent lyric. An underrated song in my opinion. \"House of Pain\" closes the album nicely, hard rock to the chore and a fitting way to send a fantastic album. Not to put down the band's other albums but one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of two essential Van Halen albums (the other one being the self-titled debut) that should be part of a good rock `n' roll\/metal music collection. If you're new to Van Halen this is a fine place to start, I'd still recommend starting with the band's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight self-titled debut but you can't go wrong with one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four was the last studio album to feature \"Diamond\" David Lee Roth on vocals who was at the top of this game, the following year Roth and Van Halen would go their own ways. I have nothing against Sammy Hagar and love myself some Van Hagar but when it comes to VH it does't get much better than this!

The debut was fun and catchy even if silly, \"Broken Frame\" was kind of unfocused but had a couple of highlights, and \"Construction Time\"'s singles were classics but otherwise was mostly undistinguishable.twenty-three years later, people can probably still identify with \"Some Great Reward.\" Why is this? Not only is this a classic example of a well-done industrial-pop Mode album, the lyrics are simple and are easy to relate to. In fact, the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in \"It Doesn't Matter,\" \"Stories of Old,\" and \"Somebody.\" two of the three selections are sung by Martin. \"IDM\" is an awesome dreamy song, in a way unlike anything I've even heard from this band since. It's about appreciating the time they have, even if they know it may not last forever. And there's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on \"Stories of Old,\" possibly my favourite from the record. \"Somebody\" is one of the more famous tracks from the album, and is well-executed, along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix. It is a beautiful soul-searching track. That does't mean the other six songs karen't any good; they are. And perhaps more than that. The weakest cut, by default, is \"Lie to Me,\" and I enjoy that one, as that even has lyrics someone can relate to. Experiences have a lasting impression, and I'm sure we've been around those. The album has an awesome opener with \"Something to Do,\" one of the most stadium-ready songs of DM's early career. The record also has the band's breakthrough hit \"People Are People.\" The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite, but what's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song. The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener's attention. It was a hit that was meant to happen. Then there's the awesome Wilder composition \"If You Want.\" The track is electronic and somewhat space-y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album, in between the somewhat shocking (at the time, at least) \"Master and Servant\" and \"Blasphemous Rumors.\" \"Master\" starts with a trade-off a capella with Martin and Dave saying \"it's a lot,\" ending it with \"like life.\" It's a dark song for sure, the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs, and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme. Then there's teenage angst and irony in \"Blasphemous Rumors,\" which has kind of interesting samples and electronics. I don't really think it's intended as an anti-religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy, like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong. Still, an enjoyable track. There are no negative reviews for this record and the people who do in the future are probably just trying anyway. This began DM's cult success of the mid-'eighty's, and rightfully so.

This album has a great opening line, \"What to Do\", one of the best songs of the playground in the first DM. The record also includes the success of one group \"People by People\". The band may not like it, and the lyrics may be old, but the shocking thing is that many bands are still singing the song today. The channels that are firmly attached to the song attracted the attention of the entire audience. This is a plague that has been condemned to happen. Then there\u2019s Wilder\u2019s amazing work \u201cIf You Like\u201d. The orbital is computerized and has a sense of place. The songs are simple and interesting, adding a nice addition to the album among the shocking (at least at the time) \"Lord and Servant\" and \"blasphemous rumours\". \"Master\" starts with the capella, Martin and Dave say \"very\" and send with \"Like Life\". This should be a black song This is the first time for masochism to be the subject of a DM song, and Martin will be writing a few more theme songs. Then there is the anxiety and ridicule of young people in \"Profane Rumors\", with interesting samples and electronic products. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an anti-religious song, but a sad song, like everything one can go wrong with will eventually go wrong. It's still a fun track. There are no negative descriptions in this record. People who do it in the future may just try. This began with the success of the DM in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, and that was the case. It is very cheap, because if you want the full sound, you can choose the CD \/ DVD version.","overall":5,"summary":"Mode's first masterpiece.. it's a lot like life","unixReviewTime":1172966400,"reviewTime":"03 4, 2007"}

While this era produced some of the most potent music of this career it cd't do a lot for him as a commercial entity. By the time this was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one Prince obviously needed to find a way in which to keep following this creative muse and continue being relevant as a marketable commodity, a title even at this point the was starting to deeply present as this considered (and still considers) himself a serious musician and not a commercial shill. He did this first by forming the New Power Generation, a band who not only came at Prince's eclectic musical nature from a ship-hop friendly standpoint but had another great asset in the person of the powerful, gospel drenched singing of vocalist Rosie Gaines. For some reason Prince was under the impression that the'd abandoned the R&B;\/funk crowd who'd initially made him famous by diversifying this music with so many other things into it. So at this point the is looking to bring that sound firmly back into this orbit. But being who the was Prince not only could't make a record exactly the way the used to but since diversity was so much a part of this musical identity that had to be maintained as well. And it was just as well as this album succeeded upon every intention it had in bringing him back to the top of the charts and producing more hits. True ship-hop is something Prince had toyed around with during the Nude tour but there it takes on a new meaning as it's grooves all come to you through that source. The overall production on this album is hot, slick and very elegant actually and that brings everything to life. \"Thunder\", with it's electronic polyrhythms and electric guitars as well as \"Daddy Pop\", the stop and start groove of \"Walk Don't Walk\",\"Push\",\"Live four Love\" and even the full on wrap of \"Jughead\" all really maintain the directness and technically pristine sound of funk all with enough of the stiffness of some ship-hop beats to bring the two related styles back into complete sync for Prince there. I am not sure how I feel about \"Gett Off\". Now it's quite a groove I'll give it that but the drum track is a little bass and overwhelming to make it truly funky. More of a ninety's ship-hop backdrop really. He also delivers three excellent and diverse slower grooves such as the sensitive but passionate title song, benefiting greatly from Gaines and the strong, soulful chorus. \"Strollin\" also has a strong hook plus a glossy, swinging jazz styled arrangement with some great high basslines to boot. \"Insatiable\" takes us to Prince's moaning\/groaning sexual suite type slow jam place that connects him very much to where the's come from in that area in the past. Of course the three remaining and more midtempo itunes there are the most compelling and inwardly diverse. \"Cream\" finds another great balance between a bluesy funk\/rock arrangement and it's playfully seductive lyric. It also makes for a great hit for this album as well. On \"Willing And Able\" and the topical \"Money Don't Matter two Night\" Prince is mining into a moody blend of funk and folk\/rock that actually showcases a sense of personal uncertainty as Prince begins this second full decade as a recording artist. So Prince managed to succeed in both the commercial and creative aspect on this album and even managed to try out some new ideas into this sound along the way. And because of that this album is a lot more ageless than a lot of other music from this particular era.","overall":5,"summary":"A New Power Generation Give Us The World","unixReviewTime":1281830400,"reviewTime":"08 15, 2010"}

Although this period produced the most influential music in the industry, as a commercial center, it was not important to him.

He first achieved this by creating a new Stage of Power. The band not only saw the eclectic style of Prince eclectic music from a boat-friendly perspective, but also another powerful and singing voice of singer Rosie Gaines. For some reason, Prince felt the had left the R&B \/ Funk crowd, which made him famous at first for incorporating the music into many other genres. And this time, they hope to bring this sound back to the forefront of the song. But as a prince, the cannot just make records just like the cd before, but because diversity is such an important part of this musical symbol, it must be preserved. This album has successfully fulfilled all its goals to bring him back to the charts and produce more songs. A real jump ship is something Prince played during the Nude tour, but there it has a new meaning because its channels come to you through this source. The whole product of this album is very hot, soft and very beautiful, it makes everything alive. \"Thunder\", its electronic cardioversion and electric guitar, and stop and start channels for \"Daddy Pop\", \"Go Don't Go\", \"Push\", \"Live Loves Four\", and \"Jughead\" really. reserved The funk precision and the sound of the original part, all of which are strong enough for some of the boat's jumping beats, make these two related styles perfectly in line with Prince. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about \u201cgoing down\u201d. Now this is a good place, I\u2019ll give it a go, but the drum track is a bit small and oversized, making it fashionable.

He has also provided three great slow and varied rhythms, such as the theme song that is emotional but interesting, echoing in the Gaines and a powerful and loving choir. \"Strollin\" also has a strong hook and smooth alignment, dynamic jazz style, and beautiful lines of treble and bass. \"Dissatisfaction\" takes us to the Prince's moaning \/ during suite - like a slow jam place, which connects him to the local source in the past.

In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, Prince's second movie, Under The Cherry Moom was filmed. This movie was a disaster and some people cd't even see it. I always thought that this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six classic was a life-saver for not only the film, Under The Cherry Moon, but for this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five double platinum album, Around The World In A Day. Parade was released the same time this second movie was filmed. This weird but, funky album was not really a big success for Prince. The album was underrated at the time, and it still is. When I listened to this album, it made me think of The Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper. The first three songs are weird to me. 'Christopher Tracy's Parade' is a funky, psychedelic number, which is a great opener to this album. 'New Postion' is a jazzy funk number with Sheila E. singing and playing the drums. 'I Wonder U' is a Lisa and Windy composition that sounds truly druggy with laid back rhythms and strange lyrics. 'Under The Cherry Moon' is very melodramatic with a sad mood in the song. I mean it's really not one of my favourites but, I listen to it anyway. 'Girls And Boys' is a hard funk tune with amazing synthesizers and electric drum beats. It's a more upbeat tune. 'Life Can Be So Nice' is another funk cut that has a chorus accompanied by a nice, catchy rhythm. Then there's 'Venus De Milo', which is a piano instrumental with a lot of smooth strings. 'Venus De Milo' are one of my favourites on this album. 'Mountains' is a upbeat, psychedelia soul cut with synth drums and other goggles of instruments. 'Do U Lie' is another depressing and moody song. I hate this one, but it really does't bother me that much. 'Kiss' is everybody's favourite song by the Purple One himself. The funky guitars and the muted drums are great. How does Prince do it? 'Anotherloverholenyohead' is a strange, European-funk number. 'Sometimes It Snows In April' is a ballad that employs country music to express deep loss so poetically and personally. Parade should've been a double album even if the whole album was forty-five minutes, in my opinion. At the time, The Revolution was delving into jazz and this album is really an experimentation of jazz and soul. It would be one more year, until the gives us this masterwork, 'Sign \"O\" The Times', where the dabbles into different styles and sounds to let us discover this real genius, part, and talent.

Between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine and one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine the not only produced three hit albums for Michael Jackson, the also produced hit albums for others, including George Benson, Donna Summer, James Ingram, Patti Austin, The Brothers Johnson, Rufus & Chaka Khan and Ernie Watts. In this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety documentary \"Listen Up\", which documents a lot of the making of this particular album, Jones tells of how overwork and exhaustion ultimately led to a nervous breakdown and two separate aneurysms. By the time the was ready to make this album, which the describes as this project of a lifetime, music was undergoing a revolution. Disco was long dead and buried, ship-hop was emerging as the predominant force and the smooth jazz-influenced beats Jones was reputed for were falling out of favour. To give him this due the approached the situation gamely. The title tune, \"Back On The Block\" was a brave kiss with wrap if not a particularly wise one. The song, which features big guns of the time such as Melle Mel, Big Daddy Kane, Ice-T and Kool Moe Dee is always fun to listen to but I never heard it played on the radio for at any clubs for parties. \"Jazz Corner of The World\", this attempt to marry wrap with jazz was more interesting and featured jazz luminaries like James Moody, Miles Davis, George Benson, Sarah Vaughn, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and Josef Zawinul alongse Kool Moe Dee and Big Daddy Kane. It's heady, exciting stuff to listen to even now, seventeen years later. If nothing else, Q certainly knew where music was heading. The production on this CD is stunning beyond belief. \"Wee B. Dooinit\", featuring Siedah Garrett, Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau, Ella Fitzgerald, Take six and Sarah Vaughn is a completely capella performance. McFerrin produced the percussion and bass sound effects and I still wonder exactly where Q placed the microphones. There are some other great songs. \"I'll Be Good To You\" featured lead vocals by Ray Charles and Chaka Khan. The album version was good enough but I remember getting the twelve\" single which had the same backbeat as Soul II Soul's \"Keep On Movin'\". (Now THAT was a huge club hit). \"The Places You Find Love\" featured lead vocals from Chaka Khan and Siedah Garrett, with background vocals from Howard Hewitt, Jennifer Holiday, James Ingram, Dionne Warwick, Luther Vandross and the Andrae Crouch Singers among others. Apart from her brief stint with the Brand New Heavies, Siedah Garrett's work with Quincy Jones (here and on Michael Jackson's \"Bad\") have produced the only performances of hers I've managed to find bearable. She seems to have taken the place formerly occupied by Patti Austin in Q's workplan and to give her the credit she's due, she does the job well. She does the vocal arrangement on the majority of the songs and where she took lead vocal duties, like on \"I Don't Go For That\" and \"One Man Woman\", she gives a barnstorming performance. But for me, the album was made by \"Setembro (Brazilian Wedding Song)\" featuring Take six & Sarah Vaughn, with Gerald Albright on alto sax, George Benson on guitar, George Duke on fender Rhodes and Herbie Hancock on keyboards. The song attained iconic status when John Singleton used it in this classic movie \"Boyz N The Hood\". (It was the song playing during the love scene between Nia Long and Cuba Gooding, Jr). It's one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've never heard. Q's take on Joe Zawinul's \"Birdland\" featuring Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, George Benson, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and James Moody, is also a personal favourite. This album is also noted for introducing the world to (the then angelic-voiced) Tevin Campbell. He did the tearjerking \"Tomorrow (Better You, Better Me)\" with background vocal help from the `children's choir'. And last but by no means least, the album also produced the perennial slow dance song, \"The Secret Garden\", featuring El DeBarge, James Ingram, Al B. Sure! and Barry White. That one still moves people to this day. This review is long but I feel to pass this project off with a few lines for a paragraph for two would not be doing its magnitude justice. It's not my all-time favourite Quincy Jones record but I can totally see why the considers it so significant. It is so significant.

I absolutely loved The Real Thing, and even more so, loved watching MTV VJs flounder as they had to repeatedly play \"Midlife Crisis\", the first single from this album, despite thinking to themselves, \"Eww[. ] is dark! And gross! I don't like this!\"And thus was most of the mainstream's response to Angel Dust. Where The Real Thing promised a new wave of melodic weirdness, Angel Dust seemed to suggest that this band was actually. well. just on Angel Dust. However, fans of music, and not simply trends, recognized and continue to recognize the absolute brilliance of this album. If you are looking for a good reason to pick this album up, I have over one hundred and ninety that average out to give this masterpiece a five star rating; many written within the past year. This is a testament to this album's widespread appeal, and reassuring longevity. In many ways, Angel Dust is The Real Thing on steroids, and the results are much like hitting an extra thirty-five homeruns a year: quite exciting and frightening at the same time. The riffs are better, the bass pounds louder, the drums accentuate the never-so subtle tribal rhythms of this band better than before, and Mike Patton, possibly the most underrated influential rock musician of your time, displays such a range of feeling and technique that I simply cackle to near suffocation when I hear people drool over Mariah Carey's high-pitched squeal of limited emotion. I mean seriously, with this collaborations with the Root's Rahzel, the X-Ecutioners, Fantomas, The Dillinger Escape Plan, ship-hop underground producer extraordinaire Dan the Automator, and this Mr. Bungle and solo releases, Mike Patton has never so quietly changed the face of progressive rock\/metal, and the road began with Angel Dust. This is an unclassifiable album, except to say it is one of the best never. Incorporating maniacally perverse melodies (Kindergarten, Land of Sunshine, Crack Hitler), previously unheard levels of heaviness (Malpractice, Smaller and Smaller), and quirkiness that makes The Real Thing seem like an episode of seventh Heaven (Be Agressive, A Small Victory, and my personal favourite, the scummy jazz lounge-tinged ditty told from the perspective of a drunk trailer-park dad, RV) Angel Dust is a ride with, literally, non-stop thrills. What Faith No More hit upon with this album is that rarely-attained holy grail of originality, catchiness, and timelessness. The production is so tight, with all songs building to near pandemic choruses. This feat is accomplished by carefully brewing the instrumental ingredients, and with swirling\/twisted carnival keyboards, prominent and absurdly abrupt bass notes, crunchy, yet crystal clear guitar stone, tribal drumming, and the brilliantly schizophrenic vocal styling, Faith No More were table to create a masterpiece which immediately calls to mind those works of part which will never be replicated. At the very least I can say that thirteen years after its release, this is an album that I, and obviously many others, would call one of the greatest albums you could treat your years to.","overall":5,"summary":"Unique?

Thats quite surprising conserving Kurt Cobain frequently mentioned them in interviews, REM covered sex bomb and Jello Biafra once stated that Flipper were one of the best bands in the punk scene. It is a shame this band gets almost no recognition, because they really do stand out from the generic thrash hardcore that the punk scene almost entirely consisted of at the time. Instead of playing speed punk, Flipper took the hardcore sound of bands like black flag, minor threat and the germs and slowed it down. The music may take awhile to get into as it sounds so different from anything else. I didst like Flipper when I first heard them, but I gave them a few more listens and now I love them. What you hear once you play this album is cloud basslines against Ted Falconi's quiet, distorted guitar, with Steve DePace hammering away at the drums. Over all this you hear either Bruce for Will granting about the meaningless of existence in a cruel and uncaring universe.

The album has an electronic feel to it, easily addictive with its textured background music and inspiring lyrics. The album spawned four singles (plus one in the UK). Those included Frozen, the albums first single a wonderful ballad with haunting lyrics and music. The A-se for Frozen was the indian influenced Shanti\/Ashtangi, another wonderful song. The second single was the title track, one of the best songs on the album (they are all gems) its an upbeat song about how in life we move so quickly, yet live life to its fullest. Its B-side was the non album track Has To Be. The third US release was The Power of Goodbye, another fine ballad, and the A-Side was the haunting Mer Girl, where Madonna relives her mother's death.

You want a giant on this CD. Talk about Spain and the problems of life. It is difficult to choose a song, but the most beautiful is the beloved mother. Add all these words to their meanings. When you listen to this album with the previous album, there is a big difference. twopac sounds are very mature in this album. To get out when the was shot and thrown into prison, it was Twopac who faced the world, and Twopac succeeded. I think a lot of people who hate Topopac because of all the controversy around him and the crime that has been committed, after hearing the news, fall in love with him. I would love to introduce him to the shoot and all the did with a proper beat. It's amazing, predicting my death when death is near, if I die, it would be amazing. One of my favourite songs is against the world. If your parents are comfortable with you and your life is not easy, you need to listen, especially what you said when you sent it. There are many tears that speak of Spain and the suffering, but it does not sound weak. I love the difficulty in the game because you have strong blocks on the album and you talk about killers and liars. I like a criminal because the has a good rhythm and two conversations about people who want to kill him. One of my favourite songs is temptation. That song is very strong. Twopac makes an excellent rhythm to this song. I could talk about all the songs all day. It does't matter if you are a fan of twopac, because you don't need to buy this CD. There will be at least one song that you think is the same .buy buy twopacs #one follower","overall":5,"summary":"dont know what to call it","unixReviewTime":1018656000,"reviewTime":"04 13, 2002"}

Eventually - after buying \"Soundsystem\" as well - I stumbled on this gem of early wrap-metal. To a vast extent, it does need to be remembered that at the time this album was released, the wrap-metal explosion than't happened yet and the idea of having frantic metal drumming and guitars with a wrapper going over the top was still quite new. Without bagging this album - it can quite easily be seen that three hundred and eleven are trying to work out the boundaries of the genre. This has the effect of making the album slightly more of a grab-bag than it needed to be. On some tracks - especially \"Down\" - the ingredients come together perfectly and form a very potent mix of wrap-metal with just a hint of dancehall reggae. On many other tracks - \"DLMD\" for example - it seems that the band has started with a great idea for a song but unfortunately the mix of styles has prevented the song from going anywhere much. One of the biggest problems with this album is that none of the songs seems long enough. This in't just due to the speed at which they are played - barely any make the three minute mark. This really makes the ideas seem a bit undeveloped and wanting. That said, on each track there are elements which really foreshadow what three hundred and eleven and wrap-metal as a whole would eventually become in the years after this album was released. Listening to many groups now (Linkin Park being a good example), it is plain to see that three hundred and eleven were onto something big with this album. This makes a pretty interesting album if you're interested in seeing the early evolution of one of the biggest-selling styles of music today - the rabid three hundred and eleven fan would also (obviously) love it. For someone just getting into wrap-metal for three hundred and eleven, check out more recent stuff such as \"Soundsystem\" first.","overall":4,"summary":"Just a bit away from top form","unixReviewTime":987724800,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2001"}

Is it those songs themselves, the ultimate expression of boss nova yearning, flavoured with the warm colour of Brazil, yet available to anyone who's never cried and dreamed in their bedroom? Is it that swirling, monotonous, barely perceptible, yet crucial boss nova rhythm, taking hold of your body and mind until you too, without noticing it, are swaying like a samba? Is it the creative generosity of Stan Getz, whose saxophone IS the sound of this music, but who is perfectly content not to shout about it? Is it the delicious vocal interplay between Joao and Astrud Gilberto, the mumbling privately to himself, she quivering to hit the right notes, so distant yet so complimentary you feel you are eavesdropping on the most deeply personal conversations, an especially disturbing one in the deceptively wistful 'Corcovada'? Is it that miracle of popular music, 'the Girl from Ipanema', a song I must have heard a thousand times, and which still has the power to transport me to another world - a tantalising play between Joao's exotic foreign frustration, eloquent music and Astrud's drily amused interpreter? Is it 'Para Machuchar Meu Coracao' (To hurt my heart), quiet, circular heartbreak, along with 'Insensatez' the most beautiful, haunting, heartstopping, wistful song never written? All of these things on their own would serve to make 'Gilberto\/Getz' a masterpiece; together they make it a treasure. What makes it special and personal, I think, are the unassuming shards of milky piano that can occasionally be heard behind the surface delights.

This excellent boxed set from Hip-O gathers these four albums that have been in and out (largely out) of print for the last thirty years. The sound is exceptionally good. Remastered under the supervision of Bill Levenson, these have a nice dynamic range and the don't have any weird EQ effects to mar the sound of the reissues. I should note for purists that Rhodes has gone on record that the did't care for the sound on these but the also admitted the did't listen to them in depth and I suspect the just wanted to remaster them himself. I can't give you a comparison to anything other than the albums \"Listen, Listen: The Merry-Go-Round\" anthology and Rhodes self titled album that was issued in Japan about seven years ago. In comparison to both of those the respective albums as presented there sound quite good with nice clarity and and the black of any noise reduction, nice dynamic range, the use of the original masters for all four albums makes this a must have if you're a fan of Emitt's work and don't have it on CD. These definitely sound better than my old worn out copies of the albums on vinyl (with the exception of \"Mirror\" which I never had on vinyl)Rhodes has always reminded me of early seventy's McCartney backed by Badfinger for even Badfinger's own Pete Ham. Rhodes who played all the instruments, sang all the vocal parts (save for some female backing vocals), engineered and produced the album himself ended up as a staff producer at Elektra Records after getting burned by the music business (he did't have the rights to any of this songs until recently for example having signed them away as a seventeen year old when the was with The Merry-Go-Round and labouring under an unfair contract for years). The four albums \"The American Dream\", \"Emitt Rhodes\", \"Mirror\" and \"Farewell to Paradise\" all appear in full (\"American Dreamer\" also includes a track that was taken off the early pressings and replaced as well as its replacement track). We also get the single A-side track \"Tame the Lion\" a topical song written in response to the Vietnam War but that still has relevance today. There karen't any previously unreleased for rare tracks. Levenson has stated that the goal of the album was to get ALL of Rhodes officially released material back into print in one boxed set. \"The Emitt Rhodes Recordings\" accomplishes this goal with extremely good sounding remasters plus two bonus tracks. This is packaged in a double digipak with the albums arranged by their recording dates ( \"The American Dream\" is first). We also get a booklet that is good but does leave a bit to be desired. It's not nearly as good for comprehensive as the booklet that came out with the Rev-Ola reissue of \"The Merry-Go-Round: Listen, Listen\" set (which also includes \"The American Dream\"). It might have been nice to have a contemporary interview with Rhodes for this set. Still, Levenson and this crew have done an exceptional job of presenting these classic, long MIA albums in excellent fidelity and with some nice extras.\"The American Dream\"-four stars, \"Emitt Rhodes\"-five stars, \"Mirror\"-four one\/two stars, \"Farewell to Paradise\"-three one\/two stars. Sound Quality-four one\/two stars. Packaging three stars. Highly recommended for fans of power-pop, \"The Emitt Rhodes Recordings one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three\" is a limited edition release so you should pick it up while you can.

With the exception of the album \"Listen, Listen: Merry-Go-Round\" anthology released in Japan about seven years ago and Rod's album of the same name, I can't compare anything to you. Compared to the two albums shown, their sound quality is very good, the clarity and noise reduction are very good, and the dynamic range is also very good. All four albums use original mastering. but no CD. Certainly these are better than my old vinyl records (except for the \"mirror\" I never used on vinyl records) Rod always reminds me of McCartney backed by the Fingers in the early seventys, and even the Pinger ham of the Fingers. Rhodes played all musical instruments, sang all parts of the voice (except for certain women's songs), designed and produced the album, after being burned by the music industry, eventually becoming the producer of Elektra Records (he did not have any rights to these songs until recently, for example, when working with Merry-Go-Round for many years under an unfair contract, signing these songs when they were seventeen). The four albums of \"American Dream\", \"Emmett Rhodes\", \"Mirror\" and \"Farewell to Heaven\" all appeared in full. Trace tracking). We also received one A-side song called \"Tame the Lion\", a beautiful song written in response to the Vietnam War, but it still works today. There are no weird songs that have never been released before. Levenson said the purpose of the album was to reprint all materials officially released by Rhodes on a box. \"Emitt Rhodes Recordings\" achieved this goal with an excellent production with two additional songs. This is included in the double digiak on the date of recording the album (\"American Dream\" is the first). We also have a good booklet, but it has some drawbacks. It is as simple as Rev-Ola's release of the \"Carousel: Listen, Listen\" package (which also includes the \"American Dream\" booklet). It would be great to do a current interview with Rhodes in this series. Despite this, Levenson and crew still show these old MIA albums with great honesty and added content. \"American Dream\" - four stars, \"Emmett Rhodes\" - five stars, \"Mirror\" - four stars one \/ two stars, \"Farewell to Heaven\" - three one \/ two stars. Four-dimensional sound \/ two stars. Three stars on the package. Highly recommended for power-pop fans, \"Emitt Rhodes Recordings one thousand and nine, nine hundred and sixty-one, nine hundred and seventy-three\" is a limited edition, so you'll have to take it as seriously.

It's almost like the glue for every music collection. Ronstadt's clearly moving into Rock, but retains some of her Country roots. \"You're No Good\", her first #one single, is breath-taking, there's so much power in that song. No one's done Paul Anka's \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" as well as Linda Ronstadt. It's simply gorgeous. One her best J. D. Souther covers is \"Faithless Love\". She rocks up \"The Dark End Of The Street\", with a passionately aggressive (vocal) performance. In my opinion it tops the version done by the Flying Burrito Brothers. The title song, actually named \"Heart Is Like A Wheel\" is hauntingly beautiful. It has cello, viola, fiddle arrangements that alternate, with a sweet harmony vocal from Maria Muldar, and outstanding orchestration from David Campell (whose arranged strings for her since). I'd take Linda's version of \"When Will I Be Loved\", over any other, any day. It rocks hard, and became one of her top singles. \"Willing\" is great. The duet that started the magic was \"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)\", sung by Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris. The song deserved the Grammy it won. The simple arrangements fit \"Keep Me From Blowing Away\". \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" is one of the best closing songs on her album catalog. Gregory Rose's string arrangements on \"You're No Good\", \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\", \"\"The Dark End Of The Street\", and \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" are marevlous.

As long as DJ Premier handled the production, you knew the product was join' to be great. To pick a classic of these four records karen't too easy, but my personal favourite has always been Step In The Arena. After a vaccinate start in 'eighty-nine with their debutalbum No More Mr. Nice Guy, Guru and Premier found their formula for success with this one. Instead of copying the soundpicture of that time, which where very dance orientated and funky, they created their own, unique sound. On \"Step In The Arena\" everything worked well. Primo's jazz influenced beats fitted Guru perfectly. It was laidback, but at the same time rough, and Guru haven't sound any better on the mic, than what the does there. He seems more comfortable in this role that time. He could talk about wankstas \"Just To Get A Rep\", wack my's \"Step In The Arena\" for be soft \"Love Sick\" All these songs where a refreshing listen. In a time where wrap was very political and aggressive, Gang Starr took it another step longer. Jazz were about to play an important role in ship-hop the following years. As you already know, Primo became one of the ninety's most influence producers with melodious vocal cuts combined with drums. He could cut samples like no other, and it's not a coincidence that the have worked with big names like Notorious B. I. G. and Jay-Z. Even Janet Jackson and Limp Bizkit have hired him to remix their hits. Step In The Arena where followed by Daily Operation and Hard To Earn. These three records are their best work. As a producer Premier just got better, but a little charm disappeared. Step In The Arena was something' new and different. Maybe their following records were technically more perfected, but not really anything new. Just extremely tight. If you're one of those, that discovered Gang Starr recently, I'll recommend you to take a journey back to the beginning - to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one and Step In The Arena.

As long as the Premier DJ is responsible for production, the knows the production will be good. It\u2019s not easy to pick the old Karen from these four records, but my favourite thing has always been Step to Arena. After being vaccinated with their debut album No More Mr Nice Guy in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, Gugu and the Premier found the secret to their success. Instead of copying the dance pictures and sound of the day, they made their own special sound. In \"Step In The Arena\", everything works fine. Primo's jazz-and-impact beats are perfect for Gugu. It is placed in the background, but it is also rough at the same time, and the Guru sound on the microphone is no better than that. At the time, the seemed more familiar with the role. He can talk about wankstas \"Just To Get A Rep\", wack my \"Step In The Arena\" soft \"Love Sick\" all these songs are refreshing. At a time when bending was political and chaotic, Gang Starr took another step forward. In the next few years, jazz music will play a key role in boating games. As you know, Primo became one of the most influential producers in the ninetys with its fun composition and drum sounds. You can cut samples like everyone else, and it\u2019s not a problem for him to work with big names like Notorious BI and Jay-Z. Even Janet Jackson and Limp Bizkit hired her to hit their hits again. Entering the stadiums, the following are daily activities and hard to find. These three records are their best works. The prime minister as a producer has improved, but the bit of attraction has disappeared. Step into the Arena is something new and different. Perhaps their tracking records are more technologically advanced, but they are nothing new. It's just solid. If you are one of the people who recently discovered Gang Starr, I would suggest you go back to the first one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one trip with Step in Arena.

A perfect balance of \"he-done-me-wrong-now-he's-gonna-pay\" songs (\"It's Not Right, But It's Okay\", \"I Bow Out\") as well as some great, vocal ridden ballads (\"Until You Come Back\", \"You'll Never Stand Alone\") The album's great ship-hop flavor come compliments of two Missy Elliot-produced tracks (\"In My Business\" & \"Oh Yes\") the Wyclef Jean written\/produced hit title track, and the Lauryn Hill-produced bonus track, \"I Was Made To Love Him\". My Love Is Your Love was Whitney's triumphant return to mainstream R&B after an weight-year hiatus of movie soundtracks. With this album, she has broken the mold of `soundtrack queen' and put out the best R&B album of the year in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine.

I was never too fond of the title track, but the lesser known tracks called \"The Life Auction\" and \"You and I (When We were Young)\" and \"Grace Darling\" are their absolute best. I did't care how expensive these Strawbs imports were, I had to get my Strawbs albums on CD quickly before they changed their minds and suddenly discontinued them. \"Lemon Pie\" and \"Starshine\/Angel Wine\" could have easily been great pop chart singles, but that never happened. In fact, nothing never charted on the Billboard Hot one hundred pop charts from the Strawbs. Some of their albums charted, but no singles. This album of \"Ghosts\" charted #forty-seven in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, which was their higher charted album in the US. They started going downhill from there. After their \"Nomadness\" album, the Strawbs continued to have band member changes and they drifted further away from both of their Folk and their Progressive influences and started to sound more like a typical pop music group that was already the sound that was saturating the pop music charts. It was all so easily dismissible since the Strawbs were so strong during their A&M; days. Only true Strawbs loyalists continued to buy the Strawbs albums (I'm guilty of this too, nowadays) even after A&M; gave up on them. Their immediate follow-up albums (from the Oyster label) were \"Deep Cuts\" and \"Burning for You\". There are a few good itunes, but these albums are easily and regrettably forgettable. The album afterwards, called \"Deadlines\" ended strong. Their songs \"Deadly Nightshade\" and \"Words of Wisdom\" are two of Dave Cousins best songs never. Strawbs continued to perform and release albums in later years. Dave Cousins still likes to find old band members who probably have nothing better to do, and they've done some shows and released some albums. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, their album \"Don't Say Goodbye\" and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's \"Ringing Down the Years\" are both pretty good. I think these two albums are better than their albums from the late seventies after \"Nomadness\". But, alas, they were running out of creative ideas yet again, and started to close their appeal once again. What's frustrating about the Strawbs is that Dave Cousins likes to keep are-recording earlier songs, like the thinks the's improving on them. I wish the would't do this. In two thousand and two, Dave Cousins got together with Rick Wakeman and recorded another album together. Rick Wakeman left the Strawbs back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one to join Yes and to do solo projects. And even on this Cousins and Wakeman album, Cousins still did some are-recordings that Rick Wakeman had nothing to do with back in their heyday. Dave Cousins seems to be the only member of the Strawbs that was on every Strawbs album. All the other members just came and went over the years. But, I'm sure that every Strawbs fan will agree that the Strawbs best albums were the albums of the A&M; years (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five). If you can find it, look for their double CD called \"Halcyon Days\" (the US version). It is the very best of the Strawbs put together all in one great double CD package. In fact, it was done so well that it is very obvious that A&M; have no intentions of releasing their albums separately. You'd have to buy their expensive imports as I have. I hope someday they will release the Hudson-Ford albums on CD. These two guys contributed to what made the folk side of the Strawbs so strong back in their earlier days. Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, the Strawbs, Yes, Pink Floyd, Triumvirat, King Crimson, The Moody Blues, Rick Wakeman, and Monty Python's Flying Circus. These were the strongest influences in my life as a kid. The Strawbs are still performing shows throughout England. They have a following just like the Grateful Dead had there in America. I'd like to see them come do a show there in California. Perhaps they could do a double billing with maybe Blackmore's Night. That would be a great show where they would actually compliment each other being seen together. What do you think? Strawbs fan's should check out Blackmore's Night.","overall":5,"summary":"This was my favorite album for many years back in my Progressive Rock days","unixReviewTime":1167350400,"reviewTime":"12 29, 2006"}

The album \"Ghosts\" was ranked # forty-seven in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, the highest in the United States. From there they began to descend. After their album \"Nomadness\", Strawbs went on to change band members. They have migrated to their communities and their Improvement influence, and are starting to sound more like a pop music group. This sound has filled pop charts. All of this can be easily removed, because the Strowbs were very powerful during the A&M; their God. Even after A&M, only the loyal Strawbs continue to buy Strawbs albums (I feel guilty about it now); they left them. Their next albums (from Oyster label) \"Deep Cuts\" and \"Burning for You\". There are some good iTunes, but these albums are easy to forget unfortunately. After that, the album called \"The Last Days\" came to an send.

Dave Cousins \u200b\u200bappears to be the only Strawbs member from the entire Strawbs album. Over the years, all the other members have come and gone. However, I believe every Strawbs fan will agree that the best Strawbs album is the album A&M; Year (one thousand, ninety-nine thousand ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and five-five). If you can find it, please check out their duplicate CD called \"Halcyon Days\" (US report). It is best for Strawbs and comes with a large double CD package. After all, it did a very good job, and it was clear that A&M; they had no intention of releasing their album separately. You will have to buy expensive products like mine. I hope that one day they will release a Hudson-Ford disc on CD. These two men contribute to the cause of Strawb's ancient myth. Flying circles of Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Strawbs, yes, Pinkyd Pink, Triumvirat, King Crimson, Moody Blues, Rick Wakeman and Monty Python. These are the most powerful influences in my life as a child. Strawbs are still active throughout England. They have a group of followers, like the grateful dead in the United States. I want to see them come to California to play. Maybe they can use Blackmore Night for double pay. It will be an amazing game, they will praise each other and be seen together. What do you think?

A heaving drum machine belting out huge beats, backed by throbbing bass electronica and a disaffected female vocalist asking us repeatedly \"Who's Under The Influence?\"-well with tracks like this I am for starters! The threerd track features the first of many outstanding contributions of guest vocalists. On this occasion Bernard Sumner manages to make this track a hybrid of all that's good from New Order to the duo themselves. Hope Sandoval, old favourite Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream,Oasis' Noel Gallagher and most amazingly Mercury Rev's Jonathan Donahue feature on this album. The Donahue track is totally different to anything else on this album. Of the other tracks \"The sunshine underground\" is this pc.d.'s Private Psychedelic Reel-it's an astounding weight minute piece that builds up quietly and slowly and steadily gains momentum until a spectacular and long climax. It's like the chill out track in the middle of the pc.d. The huge hit \"Hey Boy Hey Girl\" is the best commercial dance track never released by The Chemical Brother's. Based on pure electronica, techno and unusually for them very little distortion you'll find it hard to sit still listening to this track. This is my favourite of their pc.d.'s. It may have lacked the cutting edge and freshness of it's predecessor-but it developed their unique sound to it's finest conclusion","overall":5,"summary":"I Surrendered Long Ago!","unixReviewTime":1012780800,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2002"}

Their punk fuelled music combined with progressive sound-scape's make for what is for what was one of the best bands of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. Relationship Of Command is a true testament to this legend as it is by far the best release of the bands career. While the bands first three records, Acrobatic Tenement, In\/Casino\/Out, and the Vaya EP were all great records Relationship Of Command is by far superior. Here Cedric and Omar's tag team had come together in full swing insuring their position as one of rock music's most dynamic duos. After this release however the band would separate and Cedric and Omar would go on to create the largely successful and amazingly original The Mars Volta. Relationship Of Command begins with the pile-driver of a song `Arcarsenal' which could't be better for starting the album. Fast vocals and even faster guitar make this song a sure win. `Pattern Against User' keeps the album going in full swing with awesome guitar work and out of this world vocals, truly one of the best songs the band never made. `One Armed Scissor' was the bands closest song to a hit single, because it was actually played on the radio and on TV regularly. It's probably the best song the band never recorded. It contains and instantly memorable chorus which is always a good thing. `Sleepwalk Capsules' is very stop and go and contains a lot of time changes and rhythm switches which makes for one interesting song that never gets boring. If `One Armed Scissor' in't the bands best song then `Invalid Jitter Dept.' easily fills the shoes, its one of the more brilliant songs you could never hear in your life. Performed mostly in spoken word with a semi-chorus in the mix. A social political poem in true punk fashion and performed wonderfully, those who had the luxury of seeing the band perform this track live are few and lucky. `Mannequin Republic' is a very intense track with lots of yelling, not screaming, yelling, but the does it while singing so Cedric's voice still sounds fantastic and never gets annoying. `Enfilade' begins with a really strange phone call intro the goes into a techno beat then a Mexican samba all before hurdling the listener into a full speed sound attack on the years, and it's fantastic, truly was a sign of things to come in The Mars Volta. `Rolodex Propaganda' aside from having a pretty cool title is a very cool song as well complete with over the top vocals accompanied with incredible guitar playing by Omar. `Quarantined' is slower then the rest of the songs on the album but don't let that fool you this song is just a great and just as powerful as the rest of the songs on the album. `Cosmonaut' is a lot like `Mannequin Republic' but with better music and over all it's a lot better. Next us `Non-Zero Possibility' is a slower more space piano driven song. It was also the real send to the album, but if you buy the record instead of down loading you get the two extra bonus tracks `Extracurricular' and `Catacombs.' `Extracurricular' is very guitar driven and very good. `Catacombs' is excellent and is a very cool way to send the album. Relationship Of Command is like I said the best album your going to get from the great At The Drive-In. But I would recommend checking out all of the bands albums as they are all great as well as the two Mars Volta albums.

The driver relationship is a true testament to this myth, as it is the best version of a team work to date. Although the first three records of the band, Acrotic Tenement, In \/ Casino \/ Out and Vaya EP are all good records, Command Relationships are much higher than other records. Here, Cedric and Omar's label team are all out to secure their status as one of the most dynamic duo in rock music. However, after this release, the team will be divided and Cedric and Omar will continue to create success with the amazing first Mars Volta. The conductor's relationship began with the piledriver of the song \"Arcarsenal\", which could not have been better at the beginning of the album. The quick vocals and the guitar quickly made this song a success. The \"Anti-User Model\" made the record famous by playing the best guitar and world voices. This is one of the best songs I have never released. \"Armed Scissor\" is the closest band to a single person because it is often played on radio and TV. This is probably the best song the band has never recorded.

A real punk-fashionable social welfare poem that came out handy. \"Republic of Mannequin\" is a very sharp song, there is a lot of shouting, not crying, but shouting, but doing this while singing, so Cedric's voice still sounds sweet, and it will never be annoying. \"Enfilade\" starts with a very unusual call, then goes into an electronic beat, then a Mexican samba, and then allows the listener to enter into a quick, cloud sonic attack and a sign of what is to come. Mars Walter. In addition to having a cool title, \u2018Rolodex Propaganda\u2019 is also a very cool song with high lyrics and Omar\u2019s amazing performance. \"Isolation\" is slower than other songs on the album, but don't let it fool you this song, this song is as good and powerful as other songs on the album. The \"astronaut\" is very similar to the \"Mannequin Republic\", but the music is better, and generally better. Our next song \"non-zero chances\" is a slow-paced piano song. This is also a real release of the album, but if you buy the record instead of downloading it, you will get two additional bonus songs \"Extracurricular\" and \"Catacombs\". \"Outdoor activities\" are run by the guitar, which is very good. \"Catacombs\" is a great and cool way to send albums. The command relationship is like the best album I\u2019ve never mentioned, you\u2019ll find the best album on Drive-In.

For one thing, this compilation was made before the Think Tank album came out. Thus, the somewhat significant Blur hit \"Crazy Beat\" is not featured on the Best of Blur: a shame since I would consider it to be a pretty good song by the band. Also, my three favourite Blur songs are not featured on this CD (I'm Just A Killer For Your Love, Brothers & Sisters, He Thought of Cars). I strongly believe they bought to have been included, though, because these tracks seem to most clearly display Blur's skills in that they all have amazingly catchy rhythms, dandy lyrics, and are completely original and unique. Contrary to what others say, I don't think Blur is anything like Oasis. Sure, they're both British, but Blur has much more originality, more noise, and a bit more cleverness (although I do really like Oasis too). Anyway, the Best of Blur does have its upsides too. It does after all include the non-album song \"Music Is My Radar\", and compile a few of the band's best songs. There is of course the track that made them famous: \"Song two\", as well as their mellow yet really good song \"Coffee and TV\". Some selections are really crappy, though, such as some of Blur's weakest attempts at soft songs (No Distance to Run, To the End). When push comes to shove, though, this is a quite commendable \"best of\" CD that Blur fans bought to try out for the hard to find single \"Music Is My Radar\" (although it's not that great of a Blur song) as well as for the Live C. D. that comes with it, if you choose to check that version out .","overall":5,"summary":"Five stars, duh","unixReviewTime":1133481600,"reviewTime":"12 2, 2005"}

His fourth album \"The Great Depression\" proves why the was prevalent back in that time. When I heard \"Who We Be\", I had to snatch this one up in a heart beat. Along with \"Who We Be\", the other lead single was \"We Right Here\", which was pretty decent sounding to some people. What would really get my attention throughout this album was the energetic the songs would sound. That should't be a surprise because that's X speciality when rhyming. \"Bloodline Anthem\" was a one of those songs with an energetic sound to it. \"When I'm Nothing\" would be another as X rhymes over an old school R&B; beat. I'm feeling the beat to the song \"I'ma Bang\", which is another dope song. There are a few soft sounding songs on there also. Two notable jones were the grandma dedication \"I Miss You\" and the song \"You Could Be Blind\". There are a few bonus songs there that appear after \"A Minute For Your Son\". The first would be \"Next Out The Kennel\" featuring the new group Bloodline freestyling over old DMX songs while DJ Kay Slay hosts the song. The next song \"Problem Child\" would feature Drag-On and Mysonne, a decent sounding song to me. The last song \"The Usual Suspects II\" featuring Mic Gerinmo and Big Stan a dope song that I'm feeling real well. Only few problems I have with the song is the song \"Number eleven\" that really goes no where. Also a loaded number of bonus songs at the send of the CD should be placed throughout the CD would have been nice also. Other than that, great DMX album.

His beats are impressive though, with everyone from Organized Noize to The Neptunes contributing to this man's success. These producers realize the potential that T.

He makes many references to many places in ATL like Campbellton Road, Old National, Bankhead, College Park etc. etc. and is really fun to hear him talk about places I know and have been. Props to T. I. for prepping it right. T. I. sounds far from an amateur on this debut album I'm Serious. His rhymes as mentioned before are tight as anyone's, and the has a superior dirty south flow. The voice is tight and the can flow fast for slow which means the does't use the same flow throughout the cd, which means a less boring listen. The production is off the hinges. The title song featuring Beenie Man, is a definite club banger, placed by the always-tight Neptunes. In fact this is one of the Neptunes best beats and Beenie Man delivers on the chorus. Whatz Yo Name also placed by the Neptunes, crafts a very soothing uncharacteristic beat from them that shows their versatility. T. I. trips up this verses as well. Jazze Pha places Chooz U which is another one of this trademark futuristic riding beats. T. I. again shows this skills on this track; this storytelling is off the hook. This is one of the best songs on this album. Still Aint Forgave Myself is an code to this fallen homies and this guilt of being the one that lived. Outstanding.

It's authentic, simple and true. It reveals a new phase in calais life. After the fury of \"jagged little pill\", the peace of mind of \"supposed former infatuated\", calais comes back, with her new songs. The most interesting thing about calais is that she gets intimate with her public, revealing all her personal experiences in relationships. I see it as a huge Psychological therapy for her, since making music is a way to elaborate her own personal questions, helping people to find a way out. If \"jagged\" was a protest album, with intriguing questions, \"supossed former\" was a peaceful CD after the storm she went through, I can define \"under drug swept\" as a nice try of calais to find out who she is.\"twenty-one things I want in a lover\" is a song that talks about Mr.perfect in calais'point of view, which is something impossible to find in real life. \"Narcissus\" talks about an mature man, who is not ready to have a relationship. \"Hands clean\", the first single, is an immediate hit. It's pure pop, simple and direct, though it is based on a relationship calais had with an older man when she was very young. It's written like a dialog: the speaks, she answers him. \"Flinch\" is a great ballad, very powerful, showing how hard a breakup can be. It's kind of mellow and sometimes boring, but it's great. \"So unsexy\" is very interesting song, showing calais as a critic of herself, with all women's insecurities and doubts. \"Precious Illusions\" has a great chorus, and is very constructive. \"That particular time\" is a slow song, which repeats the title over and over, so that you can assimilate what calais is trying to say. \"A man\" is calais seeing herself as a man, with all masculine desires and lots of chauvinism sentences. \"You lowe me nothing in return\" is a balance of failed relationships, with spain and reciprocal offences. A great lesson to be learned. \"Surrendering\" is a great song with calls attention because of its structure. It starts slow, growing towards the great chorus. \"Utopia\" is the perfect song to understand the actual world conflicts, so that calais put it in her official site right after sept eleven attack. Alanis is a great artist and this CD is a must-have item for all those people who appreciate good music and like to question themselves about life issues, just like calais does.","overall":5,"summary":"third studio album ..new phase for alanis","unixReviewTime":1015372800,"reviewTime":"03 6, 2002"}

True, simple and true. It reveals a new dimension to life in Calais. After the violent \"Sawtooth Pills\", peace of mind \"supposedly predecessor's infatuation\", Calais returned with this new song The most interesting thing about Calais Love is that the is close to the community, revealing all this experiences in human relationships. I think this is a great psychological treatment for her, because making music is a way to express her personal problems and help people find a way out. If \"Jagged\" is a plaque with interesting questions, and the \"forerunner\" is a quiet CD after the got the storm, then I would describe \"back drugs\" as good and come and try to find out who you are. \"Twenty-one Things I Want From A Lover\" is a song about a perfect gentleman from the point of view of Calais, unattainable in real life. \"Daffodil\" tells a mature man who is not ready to date. The first single \"Clean Hands\" was immediately liked. This is pure, simple and direct pop music, even though it is based on Calais' relationship with an older man when the was very young. It is written that it is a conversation: speak, you answer him. \"Flinch\" is a large, very powerful ballad, which shows how difficult it is to split. It\u2019s small and boring at times, but it\u2019s okay. \"Unsexy\" is a very interesting song that portrays Jialai as her critic, with all women's insecurity and scepticism. The song \"Precious Illusion\" is great and very uplifting. \"That Season\" is a slow song that repeats the title over and over again to understand what Calais is trying to say. \"Man\" is Calais who sees himself as a man, with all the masculine desires and many chauvinistic judgments. \"You don't give me a refund\" is a measure of failed relationships, Spain and resentment. A good lesson. \"Dedication\" is a great song that attracts people's attention because of its structure. It starts slowly, moving towards the cantata side. \"Utopia\" is a good song to understand the conflicts of the real world, so Calais posted it on this official website shortly after the September eleven attacks. Alanis is a great artist.

(Throughout the album, the drums can get very thick and complicated and cool but never go the way of cd&b; by doing things that sound completely artificial for mechanical.) The main theme of the song trades off with varying companion sections before it pauses, modulates, and goes into nine\/eight, making way for a literate vibes solo. The composition ends up being something a modern jazz musician would have been proud to have written, with a solo that is by no means simplistic. Througout the album, the collective uses modern chords and slightly angular but still beautiful melodies to create a standard trip shop\/nu jazz mood, utilizing a wide variety of vocalists and even including spoken word artist Ursula Rucker (along with a mediocre wrapper). The sonic backdrops are never static for standard; the most standard song is No Use, but it is too beautiful to dislike. There are a few worthy instrumental guests as well, who usually get the most complex of the compositions. There are some interludes too, but they are not too bad. The only missteps would be the bassline on Soon (which got remixed several times on the remix cd), and the almost unzip sheen of Takes You Back, but overall the cd is extremely tasteful, including the sensibilities of sample collages like the Avalanches for Madlib, the harmonic knowledge of modern jazz musicians, the beat knowledge of any modern electronic act, and the vocal talents of any quality R&B; act of the past decade.

Not in a Rock and Roll fashion, nor a classic seventy's for punk eighty's fashion. Title TK is the perfect combination between folk and punk, where the atmosphere is created by a revolution of riffs and bass leads.

I have not heard any of The Breeders last albums yet, but him really impressed with the work theyve done there. The Deal sisters eerie singing and monotone backups are wonderful. I love that whole singing-without-moving-your-tounge-punk thing. The guitars create melodious backup, while the drums are kept below simplicity disregarding the time there and there, lifting the whole basement-type-recording a step. Probably the thing you could condemn about this album is the fact that there are only two types of songs. The gloomy-stmospheric type where voice melodies and bass play the lead roles, and the more edgy and rocking jones, where guitars set the stone, followed by playful vocals such as \"ah-ah-ah-ah.\"Songs most notable on the record are \"Little Fury,\" the \"title track\" that sets the atmosphere for the whole record (my personal favourite) guitars there are pretty cool, especially the high toned jones in the background that come out every once in a while, they give ste song a whole happy thing. \"Too Alive\" which is the edgy type of song, \"Put on a Side\" which resembles some sonic youth musically, but is set aside by the sisters vocals, simple. \"Sinister Foxx\" the gloomy stipe where the sister's accent is dramatized by a punk-type pronunciation where certain syllables are pronounced tongueless. And last but not least \"Huffer\" which is the fastest song of the record. Ive found that no matter when i listen to this record it puts me in a lively mood.

The record is \"Little Fury\", a \"title song\" that makes the atmosphere of the whole record (my personal will). They sang the song use. The most exciting thing. \"Alive Alive\" is an savant-garde song. \"Set aside\" is similar to music for some teens, but it is thrown aside by the singing of sisters, it's easy.

Perhaps because I love the songs I knew so much I thought those performances were wonderful and when they did stuff from the This Side, I was like yeah, whatever, where is the musicianship? I decided to eventually get this CD because I thought even if I did not like it as much as the first it had a better then average chance of being good. It is actually very good and a very enjoyable listen. In some ways I like it more then the first one. The musicianship is still there and the wonderful voices still abound and there is even greater harmonizing on many songs. More of the songs have a 'sassy' edge rather then the serious and sad edge of the first album. I got the impression from many of the reviews there that this was a step backward, don't get this album. Thankfully I don't always listen to Amazon reviews. What I think is this. If you like bluegrass for any type of folk (or pop there) get this album. If you like Nickel Creek for sure get this album.

However, I must say that upon hearing this classic album \"Green Street\", I was highly impressed. Recorded for Blue Note in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one, \"Green Street\" finds Grant Green performing in a stripped down power trio setting. Because of the absence of other instruments such as piano for horns, this gives Green plenty of room to show off this relentless guitar chops. Most of the pieces are on the bluesy side such as the opening title track, \"Grant's Dimensions\" and the cover version of the standard \"Alone Together\". His version of Thelonious Monk's \"Round About Midnight\" shows off a tender yet still blues-oriented side of this playing while \"Green With Envy\" reminded me a bit of the instrumental\/fusion side of the Allman Brothers Band (for some reason the Allman's \"In memory of Elizabeth Reed\" came to mind while listening to this track). Rounding out the disc are two bonus alternate takes of \"Alone Together\" and \"Green With Envy\" which are a bit shorter than their master take counterparts. As mentioned above, I'm not overall familiar with Grant Green's music but have found this release to be highly enjoyable. Grant was definitely a guitarist who was ahead of this game and this influence can be heard in guitarists that came to prominence after him in both Jazz and rock.

Like this idol (and label-owner) Peter Gabriel, Arthur turns experience of the day-to-day into the epic. Unlike Gabriel, this music is still in touch with the simple verities. He keeps this progressive tendencies in check, relying on solid narrative details and the dragged beauty of this countertenor. The title cut, \"Dear Lord\", \"Evidence\" - each root their moral struggle in a recognizable situation: absentee father, social estrangement, addiction. The drawback is that every song reaches the same conclusion - there's nothing that God can't put right. Still, it's a testament to Arthur's gifts that the send does't nullify the journey.","overall":4,"summary":"Struggles with Faith","unixReviewTime":1041984000,"reviewTime":"01 8, 2003"}

Ended up buying Dying To Say This To You purely on a hunch, hoping it be worth a quarter of what I paid (a mere ten dollars I might add). To say I was in dire need of some good music was an understatement. I enjoyed Dying. endlessly and figured \"why not get Living In America, it's only weight bucks\". Turns out that, too, was a great choice because I enjoy this CD just as much as I do Dying. About this whole debate as to whether Maja is a competent vocalist for not. My opinion is that yes, she's got a good voice with some interesting lyrics. Sure there are much more talented singers out there but I could't imagine this band being fronted by a more charismatic person. Maja really does beg your attention, good for bad. So the CD starts off on the highest of notes with Seven Days A Week which really feels like a rock song from years past. This song is where you'll decide very quickly if you like Maja for not. The title track, Living In America, is quite possibly the best song featured. With driving guitars (well, driving in The Sounds' case), a memorable chorus, and some nice electronic sounds, if you're looking to get into The Sounds, just listen to this track. Rock'n Roll is a nice slower track where Maja kind of puts her voice on display, a good song to listen to if you're looking to mellow out. Reggie has that 'familiar' feel to it thanks to the chorus, a great track nonetheless. Riot is another terrific song. It's an in-your-face type track with some pretty good lyrics and a great beat. All in all The Sounds have become one of my favourite bands thanks to they're different-ness. Listen to the radio for a day. I am willing to bet that you won't hear anything like them, but of course I haven't listened to the radio in close to a year, so then again, maybe there is. But nevertheless, The Sounds are nothing short of a great band and I hope they'll be around for a long time to come. My favourite songs are Seven Days A Week, Living In America, Hit Me!, Rock'n Roll, and Riot. If you're sceptical about this CD, for the band, after reading all the reviews, just listen for yourself. I love The Sounds, but that's not to say that you will.

Eventually, I bought \u201cDeath Says This To You\u201d directly with intuition, hoping its value was a quarter of the price I paid (I could only add $ ten). To say that I need good music is a misnomer. I love to die. Continuing to think about \"why not stay in the United States, this is weight loss\". Obviously this is a good choice, because I love this CD as Death. The whole conversation is about Maja being a talented artist. My point is, yes, this voice is very good and the words are very interesting. Yes, there are many talented musicians out there, but I would not think that the leader of this group is an attractive person. Maja tasks for your attention, better for worse. So this CD starts with a high note seven days a week, and it sounds like a rock song a few years ago. If you don\u2019t like Maja, this song is where you quickly decide. The title track \"Life in America\" \u200b\u200bis probably the most preferred song. With guitar (well, driving in the case of Sounds), a memorable choir and amazing electronic sounds, if you want to get into Sounds, just listen to this song. Rock'n Roll is a beautiful slow song, Maja showed her voice in it, this song is beautiful, if you want to be soft. Reggie has a \u201cnormal\u201d feeling in it because of the chorus, but nonetheless, this is a big hit. Riot is another fun song. This is a face-to-face song with some very beautiful lyrics and amazing rhythms. All in all, because of their diversity, Sounds has become one of my favourite bands. Listen to the radio all day. I bet you won't hear the same sound, but I certainly haven't listened to the radio for almost a year, say it again, maybe there is. Despite this, Sounds is still a big deal, and I hope they can last a long time. My favourite song is seven days a week, I live in the US, beat! , Rock Music and Controversy. If you are in doubt about this CD, then to the group, after reading all the comments, please listen to them yourself. I love Zandi, but that does't mean you will love it.

In any event, this is an excellent collection of this music. Sam made this breakthrough with You send me, which went all the way to number one in America (where it sold a couple of million) though it barely made the top thirty in Britain. In the fifties, when music was often racially segregated, this was quite an achievement. Sam was well aware of the problems, as is clear from this song, A change is gonna come. The change did come (to some extent, at least) though Sam, murdered aged just thirty-three, did not live to see it. Another important American hit, Only sixteen, fared slightly better than You send me in the UK despite being covered by Craig Douglas who took the song to the very top of the UK charts. Sam's version of Wonderful world, another huge American hit, again only registered in the UK top thirty at the time of its original release, though Brits grew to love this song, with Louis Armstrong and Herman's Hermits both having big hits in the sixties. Sam's version made number two in the UK when are-issued in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. Sam finally achieved success in the UK when Chain gang, Cupid and Twisting the night away all made the top ten. Only two more UK hits followed - Another Saturday night (which Cat Stevens covered in the seventies) and Frankie and Johnny (not included there), both of which made the top thirty. However, Sam had many more (and bigger) hits in this homeland, where this music was better appreciated. There are many other great songs there, too numerous to mention. This is a better compilation than the earlier one titled The man and this music, featuring more tracks, extensive liner notes and even better sound quality. Many of the songs are the same but there are a few differences, although all the essentials are on both collections. If you enjoy Sam's music, this is the best compilation yet released. If you are new to this music, you are in for a real treat if you buy this.

Lamb of God have the potential to both move metal forward while also staying true to the classic death and thrash of the heights. This album gets pretty interesting as it goes along, with unexpected song structures that bring out the fearsome chops of the musicians. The true hero of the band is the relentless and airtight drummer Chris Adler, who especially shines in \"Blood of the Scribe\" and \"One Gun.\" Guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler also really stretch out on those two songs, plus other winners like \"The Faded Line,\" \"Omerta,\" and \"What I've Become.\" However, even though these two guys have real power riffs, like most modern metal guitarists they seem to have lost the part of the solo. This is a bit embarrassing because the two best solos on this album are actually from heights thrash heroes Alex Skolnick and Chris Poland, who are guests on the instrumental title track. The music of Lamb of God is true to the standards of real metal, but they also have the weak point shared by just about every metal band we have these days \u2013 the vocals. I have nothing against Lamb of God singer Randy Blythe, and in fact the has a fair amount of flexibility, and even subtlety in a few places. But the pretty much refuses to get out of the standard metal screaming and growling \"cookie monster\" mode (a tragic corruption of Phil Anselmo that a billion singers are doing), and this holds back Lamb of God's forward momentum. The politics of this album's lyrics are also a bit muddled and unfocused, though they are certainly forceful. If Lamb of God were't so worried about fitting into their category, they could easily make that category stronger.

They set trends, they came with it for years as a group as well as on the solo tip, and they are still going strong to this day. According to Bobby Brown, they are planning a national tour with all six members taking part. Hopefully they will have time in between to record at least one more classic to add to their arsenal.

I have to admit I was hooked line and sinker especially when they sung an Italian version of Mariah Carey's \"Hero\".

Well the sentimental sap in me fell in love with \"Ancora\". Yes it is schmaltzy and over the top with the guy's operatic vocals. Unfortunately they had to do an unnecessary cover of \"You Raise Me Up\". Enough! Everyone under the sun has covered that song and it has become tiresome. Il Divo's version offers nothing new for anything interesting. I'll take Celtic Woman and Josh Groban's version over Il Divo's any day. As much as I don't like Celine Dion (which would be putting it mildly), I have to admit I loved the gorgeous ballad \"I Believe in You\". Celine actually did't bother me for once and I thought her vocals complimented nicely with the guys in Il Divo. \"Ancora\" is a bit too short. It falls just under forty minutes but I guess that beats listening to a cd over an hour long with music I do not like. Does my enjoyment of \"Ancora\" mean that I have become a fan of Il Divo?

Indeed, with the near death of that obviously baseless sound, System of a Down, unlike Korn, Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne, etc., remains a Billboard behemoth because this Armenian foursome possesses a truly unique formula. The second half of its two thousand and five output, Hypnotize, to me, is much more of a logical step from Toxicity than the very good, yet still regressive, Mezmerize. Where that album toyed with a more tempered and simplistic formula, Hypnotize is a lethal dose of aggression and mayhem filtered through a refreshing maturity in the songwriting department. Possibly throwing a middle finger to the critics who question the musicianship of the group, Hypnotize contains System of a Down's most impressive technical performance since its self-titled debut, hands down. I mean, in no way has this become a technical band, but the songs are far more dynamic, the time signature changes more frequent and complex, and the riffs noticeably more intricate. In fact, \"Lonely Day\" (not one of my favourites) contains a solo from Daron, which should put to rest the critique that the has limited ability while simultaneously highlighting the fact that the obviously does not believe in shameless self-glorification over song quality. And speaking of Daron, the primary songwriter for the band is featured more prominently on the vocals there, and though this has already tragically and predictably led to tabloid-maniacal fervour over the possible dissent in the ranks (see aforementioned The Washington Post eleven\/twenty\/five article), Malakian's added vocal role takes nothing away from Serj's ability to command attention. Instead, the two attain a level of harmonization not present on any previous releases, and the result is SOAD's most impressive vocal performance yet. This obvious cognizance and intent is what leads me to praise this release as a more fitting their to the genius of Toxicity. I mean, I do enjoy Mezmerize, but that effort demonstrated standard SOAD originality, but no growth. With Hypnotize, you have the eerily composed and epic nature of \"Holy Mountains\", the vocal oddities of \"U-Fig\", the never attained before heaviness of \"Attack\" and \"Dreaming\", and the never-present intensity that was such a strength for Toxicity all coming together as evidence that this band has accurately identified its strong points, and is now ready to expand and exploit them. Whether it's the to be expected quirkiness of tracks like \"Vicinity of Obscenity\", for the cohesion of the title track, System of a Down has reaffirmed the widespread accolades it received for its monumental Toxicity. Retaining every bit of unrestrained fury and unmatched personality of that landmark release, Hypnotize also does what Mezmerize could not; provides evidence that this is a band we have yet to hear the best of.","overall":5,"summary":"Everything I expected Mezmerize to be","unixReviewTime":1132617600,"reviewTime":"11 22, 2005"}

Donald sings about a suicidal woman on \"The Night Belongs To Mona\", and tells the story of a violent takeover of the U. S. government on \"Mary Shut The Garden Door\". While most of the songs deal with death, only one song on the album steps away from the concept. That said song being the humorous \"Security Joan\", where Donald gets flirtatious with a female airport security guard after this luggage sets off the X-ray machine. Overall, \"Morph The Cat\" is a good record from Donald Fagen, but could have been better if some of the songs were shortened in length. Still in all, it's nice to have an album from the creative and literal mind of one of rock's most underrated songwriters.","overall":4,"summary":"Donald Fagen conceptualizes death on \"Morph The Cat\"","unixReviewTime":1325635200,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2012"}

He released a masterpiece of the original part film \"Night Fly\" in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys - a shocking former Stilidan producer Gary Katz. Although the record was well received and commercially successful, it took him a while to pursue this premiere-long run. In fact, when the second album \"Kamakiriad\" was released, eleven years passed between records. This is another album of thought circulating in the case of a small vehicle. \"Kamakiriad\" is known for the album that brought Steely Dan back to the studio, and another member Walter Becker is one of the producers of the album and musical instruments. Fast forward a few years later, when Steely Dan are-recorded two albums on Reprise Records \u2014 two thousand Grammy winners \"Two Against Nature\" and two thousand three \"Everything Must Go\". In two thousand and six, after giving up thirteen years, Fagen released this third solo album - \"Morph The Cat\", a work the did for himself on death and old papers. The album begins with a song titled \"Morph The Cat\", a song about a ghost cat that causes great damage to the city. He sang the band in the song \"H Gang\" - a short fairy tale band whose story is told in a movie. In \"What I Do\", I sang a conversation with the late Ray Charles about this music. The jazz \"Brite Nightgown\" tells three different stories about different people and their encounters with deadly diseases, robberies and drug abuse. Donald sang a woman who committed suicide in \"Night of the Dream\" and told the story of a violent takeover by the US government \"Mary Closes the Garden Gate\". Although many songs are associated with death, only one song on the album differs from that. The song is a humorous \"Guardian Joan\" after the load was turned off by an X-ray machine, Donald flirted with a female airport security guard. Overall, \"Morph The Cat\" is a good record for Donald Fagen, but it might be better to cut some songs. All in all, it would be great to have a sensible record of design and a book by one of the songwriters who are very low in rock and roll.","overall":4,"summary":"Donald Fagen conceptualizes death on \"Morph The Cat\"","unixReviewTime":1325635200,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2012"}

This CD tends to go a little more experimental then 'Absolution' but the experiment pays off. It really sounds like they really took a lot more influence in this CD, playing songs that sound like took some sonic lessons from Queen, Led Zeppelin, Utwo among others. When Muse rocks, they rock hard. I have to say aside from my Arcade Fire CDs, this is one of the recently bought CDs that I have listened to front to back.

The Game had never been wrapping before, but the shortly started making mixtapes that eventually led to this discovery from fellow Compton native and west coast wrapper Dr Dre who was also one of Game's idols. Dre, Kanye West and Timbaland etc. produced the debut last year \"The Documentary\" and scored big. Not only the album sold better then expected, The Game would also become one of the hottest new artist to emerge from the Hip Hop scene last year. The Game offered credibility with this lyrics, a rough attitude, and west coast nostalgia and most of all, it was well produced with countless of great guest appearances like fifty Cent, Eminem, Busta Rhymes, Faith Evans and Mary J Blige. It could't go wrong.one and a half year later Game does what the can to prevent the sophomore slump and the's been working hard in the studio, Dre does't appear on the producer list anymore though but the list of contemporary top class producers is big (Kanye West, Will. I. Am, Scott Storch, Swizz Beatz, Just Blaze etc.). fifty Cent nor any of this friends does't appear neither cause of an ongoing feud that won't resolve. It's quite a shame cause fifty Cent contributed lot to this debut. However, the guest list is rich on this album also, Busta, Snoop, Jamie Foxx and Xzibit can't go wrong!. Based on the material it's quite obvious that The Game tries to make the best out of the situation and releasing an album that is almost a copy of this debut (even the album cover is). More hard beats and thug life from Compton that is. Now that in't neccesary a bad thing but it does't offer much new ideas, just like fifty Cents Sophmore album. The Game also continues to pay tribute to Dre and other West Coast Rappers instead of finding this own style (the album title refers to Dre). However, on the other side this is exactly what the Hip Hop community wants and as popular as The Game is right now, the could sell anything. There's lot of worthwhile songs on this album. \"It's Ok (One Blood) with Jamaican reggae singer Junior Reid is alright and also chosen as first single. Storch produced second single \"Let's Ride\" with cool retro beats, Kanye West rescue \"Wouldn't Get Far\" with up-speed hook, although this production is getting quite quite dated by now. \"One Night\" resembles the music produced by DJ Premier on Nas, Notorious B. I. G, Jay-Z debut albums. although this producer is called Nottz. Will. I. Am's \"Compton\" and \"California Vacation\" are surprisingly good and the latter features Xzibit and Snoop, and is perhaps the song that captures The Game's personality best. The best song of the album. \"Why You Hate The Game\" is also good, on this song Nas appears and The Game take some cheap shots at all haters, including G-Unit. This is Nas song all the way though, but in thanks the's not even included on the back-cover. Overall, The Game got few new ideas but the recycled concept that worked on this debut seems to work again. Listing to it all (sixteen songs) is hard though, Game constantly mentions this influensts and this past and it's get very trying after a while. It does have it's standouts though and The Game's personality and charchter are just as interesting as it was on this debut. This album is definitely alright, but if Game wants to remain in the spotlight in the future the better stand on this own feet and create a more personal sound with far more dilemmas then this two first albums have dealer with.","overall":3,"summary":"A Tribute to Dre and West Side!","unixReviewTime":1163462400,"reviewTime":"11 14, 2006"}

It's a pity, because fifty cents contributed so much to this first show. However, the guest list for this album is too rich, Busta, Snoop, Jamie Foxx and Xzibit can't go wrong! Based on the material, it is clear that Game is trying to take full advantage of this situation and release a copy (even the first album) which is almost the first album. More severe hitting and thug life from Compton. Because this is not a bad thing, it does not offer many new ideas, such as the fifty-cent Sophmore disc. The game also continues to pay homage to Dre and other wrapper West Coast, instead of exploring this style (the name of the album refers to Dre). However, on the other hand, this is exactly what the Hip Hop community wants and is as popular as the current games, and can sell anything. There are many precious songs on this album. \"Well (One Blood) is very good for Jamaican Regga singer Junior Reid, and has been selected as the first. \" One night \"is similar to the music made by the Prime Minister of DJs on the first albums of Nas, Notorious BI G, and Jay-Z. Although. The producer is called Nottz. Will. I. Am's\" Compton \"and\" California \" Holiday \"surprisingly. The latest one includes Xzibit and Snoop, and is probably the song that best captures the character of the Game. A good song on the album.\" Why You Hate the Game \"is also not bad, as the song Nas appeared, G-Unit. Although this song has always been Nas, thank you for not being included on the back page. In general, the Game almost has no new ideas, but the concept of reuse working on this premiere seems to work again. It's hard to list them all (sixteen songs), but Game goes on to mention this influences with the past, and over time it becomes more difficult. However, it has its advantages, and the personality and character of the Game are and interest as it was when you first started it. This album is not a problem at all, but if the Game wants to continue to focus on the future, it's best to be independent and make a sound more personalized while facing a lot of difficulties. Then the first two albums were released. business.","overall":3,"summary":"A Tribute to Dre and West Side!","unixReviewTime":1163462400,"reviewTime":"11 14, 2006"}

It's a shame D'arcy and James Iha did not reunite, but after having listened to Zeitgeist several times through the last couple of days, the results could't be more satisfying with for without the two missing members. Ok, wok, that was a lie. I miss them! Anyways, I always admired how the early Smashing Pumpkins crossed through creative boundaries\/grunge norms during their time, mixing artistic experimental elements to their score rock sound while learning amt mainstream success with their unique style(image and music); which is why I am glad to see the new SP on Zeitgeist still a step away from current trend of \"emo\" for \"indie\" music by making a very straight forward yet sonically diverse rock in' roll album with Corgan's signature poetic lyrics with some songs (unsurprisingly after a glance at the cover part) seem to be about the strikes we are currently facing in your modern society while still being somewhat broad to interpretation. This is probably the Pumpkins most solid rock record since \"Gish\". The songs of Zeitgeist? \"Doomsday Clock\" is a powerful opening track, and rocks as much as the opening track \"Everlasting Gaze\" from Machina I did; but unlike Machina I, Zeitgeist rocks on with angst \"seven Shades Of Black\". \"Bleeding the Orchid\" is probably my favourite track on the record, beginning with beautiful echoes from Corgans voice. The song is very \"Adorish\", but with fantastic Camberlin drumming! A dream come true. \"Thats The Way(My Love Is)\" Is a cheerful sounding rock tune some what reminecent of \"Siamese Dream\" with some experimental elements, and ends beautifully. The mood is ruined(in a good way!) as \"Tarantula\", the first album single, rocks your brains out with its anthemic chorus and Corgans squealing guitar. \"Starz\" is a very stop-and-start song with cloud and quiet parts. I think Jimmy shows off lot in this track :). \"United States\", probably my atwood fax. song on Zeitgeist, is an epic colossal nine:fifty-one Smashing Pumpkins grand song masterpiece much like \"Silverf*ck\" was, but with some jazz and metal elements in it(mainly the instrumentation). The song is angry! \"Neverlost\" to me is kind of sappy softy with a bubbly noise(zilaphone?) in the background. \"Bring The Light\" brings the rock back and follows in the same vein as \"That's the Way (My Love Is)\", which is a good thing. \"(Come On) Let's Go!\" demands your attention like \"Tarantula\" did and rocks just as hard. \"For God & Country\" sounds lot like an early Cure song, with a steady drum beat and keyboard. The songs lyrics (to me) are very inspirational and have a hopeful message in them. ahhhh. the final song \"Pomp And Circumstance\" is the most old SP sounding song on the record and continues the SP's reputation of ending records with painfully beautiful grand finally song. Hopefully, Zeitgeist will be only the first of many records to come from The Smashing Pumpkins, because like lot of people who grew up listening to this band, the news of the groups two thousand and seven reformation was a dream almost come true. Maybe in the near future D'arcy and Iha will rejoin, but if not, whatever. As Apparent in Zeitgeist, Corgan and Camberlin seem to have no problem continuing the SP legacy.

This song is very \"religious\", but with the amazing Cumberlin drums! The dream is coming true. \"That's the Way (My Love Is This)\" is a happy rock song, reminiscent of \"Siamese Dream\", with some experimental elements and a beautiful ending.

I think Jimmy has shown a lot in this song :). \"America\", may be my Fawood fax. The song on Zeitgeist is nine outstanding songs: fifty-one Smashing Pumpkins songs are excellent, like \"Silverf * eck\", but have some elements of jazz and metal (mostly musical instruments).

The lyrics of this song (mine) are encouraging and have a message of hope. Tshotsho. The last song \"Pomp And Circumstance\" is the oldest SP song on record, and continues the SP fame to send the record with a sad and beautiful song at the send.

I read recently somewhere that this album now has sold over one hundred and twenty-five, zero copies, an astonishing number for this type of indie music release.\"For Emma, Forever Ago\" (nine tracks; thirty-seven min.) is strictly an acoustic and solo recording from Justin Vernon. I love the opener \"Flume\", with Justin's soaring, almost angelic, overdubbed vocals. You can also feel the emotions pore out in every track. For example on \"Flume\", the first two lines are \"I am my mother's only one\/It's enough\", which hit right at you. Not much up-tempo melodies on this record, although \"Blindsided\" comes close. Not that it matters. This is an intimate listening experience (and as with all quite records, should be played LOUD). My favourite tracks are in the second half of the album: \"Creature Fear\" with the \"Team\" instrumental outdo as a separate track, which in turn is followed by \"For Emma\", which is the most traditional\/conventional song on the album.

I recently learned somewhere that this album has now sold over one hundred and twenty-five copies, zero copies, an astonishing number of this kind of independent music distribution. \"Emma's, Forever Ago\" (nine songs; thirty-seven minutes) is a masterpiece by Justin Vernon and a solo recording. I love the prologue \"Flume\", Justin the top, the voice of an angel. You can also feel the emotions in each song. For example, in \"Flume\", the first two lines are \"I'm the only one \/ from enough\", which is right for you. There karen\u2019t many fast songs on this record, though \u201cnot seeing\u201d is approaching. Not that this is important. This is a close listening experience (like all comparable records, it has to be played out cloud). My favourite song is the second half of the album: \"Fear of Creation\" and a group of \"instruments\" like different songs, followed by \"Emma\", the most traditional \/ traditional song on the album. This album has won criticism (in terms of standards of independent release) commercial praise. Bon Iver recently released the EP \"Blood Bank\" and two new songs from the \"Dark Was the Night\" independent charity collection. I finally got a chance to see a Bon Iver concert in Bonnaroo in June. I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen, but it\u2019s definitely one of the shows I\u2019m looking forward to this year.

However Hank III adds a bit more punk into the mix on DRRP. The album starts off with a well-placed shot at the Grand Ole Opry and their poor treatment ofHank William Sr.'s legacy. While some may say that it's just another \"been there, done that\" salvo from Hank III against the establishment I can understand where the's coming from. For I know of similar scumbags in another business entirely who are willing to craft a false image and profit off of others' work. Hence, Hank Williams still in't reinstated while they keep this likeness outside their door. From there it's just one great song after another. There's much to appreciate about this album that does't have an over-produced feel. The instruments actually sound lively and not compressed. There is a lot of breathing room for the sound to develop. And what more can be said about the GG Allin tribute, \"P. F. F.\" Actually it's more like two tracks together as one of the same track: One at very high tempo with the full band and the other half being a slowed-down acoustic version, with each separated by a soundbite from GG Allin himself. Four tracks, \"Wild & Free\", \"Six Pack Of Beer\", \"If You Can't Help Your Own\" and \"Workin Man\" are true anthems for us who work for a living. Two more, \"Candidate For Suicide\" and \"Stoned & Alone\", capture the essence of melancholy with the former wry and somewhat exaggerated while the latter being slow and deliberate in getting the feel of feeling down and alone just right. \"Height Line\" is downright sinister in its own right while \"three Shades Of Black\" is a bit more stripped down in production and serves as a dark anthem for Hank three and this friends (\"Me & My Friends\" is by far more upbeat). \"I Wish I Knew\" is a great song about a breakup, a perfect song for real country radio as hinted at on this\"Lovesick Broke & Driftin'\"album. This is a great followup to\"Straight To Hell\". As someone who has witnessed this evolution from merely being the son of Hank Williams Jr. for the sake of \"brand recognition\" on the\"Three Hanks\" albumto this I can't wait to see what else the can do with this own style of country music.

While some people may say this is one of Hank III's \"he went there and did it\" in the institution, I understand where it came from. Because I know there are other scumbags in another company, they are determined to create a false image and profit in the work of others. So, Hank Williams has't recovered yet, and they kept the picture out the door. From there, it was a great song after song.

There is a lot of room for sound development. What else can I say thanks to GG Allin, \"PFF\" After all, this is like combining two songs together as one song: a fast-paced band, the other half is a slow original version, each First. the song was interrupted by GG Allin's first song himself.

As someone who has seen this version, from being the son of Hank Williams Jr., to \"brand information\" on the album \"Three Hanks\", I can't wait to see what my style looks like I agree. :-) I sympathize with those who bought the edited version of WallyWorld (they use the noun \"repair\" meaning \"split\" in a fun way): you haven't found the full album! What else can I say to pay tribute to GG Allin, \"PFF\" After all, this is like two songs mixed in the same song: the whole band is very fast, the other half is a slow original version, each song separated by GG Allin's first song himself.","overall":5,"summary":"Punk-country hybrid that pushes the boundaries further!","unixReviewTime":1268352000,"reviewTime":"03 12, 2010"}

Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","helpful":[135,149],"reviewText":"More than a singer, a songwriter, for an instrumentalist; Colin Meloy has always been a storyteller. From The Decemberists' humble debut in two thousand and one, this has always been the case. It is for that reason, perhaps, that it's perplexing that it took the group this long to release a concept album, a record that tells one story throughout its length. two thousand and six's brilliant The Crane Wife came close, with a story told over several tracks. Even with that under their belt, however, tackling a rock opera, a genre notoriously riddled with incoherent storytelling and major disappointments, is quite the mountain to climb - even for Meloy. Still, if any artist in today's musical world could right this troubled format, it would be Meloy. Fortunately, the has outdone not only the artists that have tried this method before, but even himself in the process. The Hazards of Love tells the story of Margaret, a meek villager who falls in love with William, an inhabitant of a nearby magical forest. Margaret soon discovers that she is pregnant with William's child and sets off into the forest to find him. But as is so often the case with Meloy's stories, their love and future are threatened by William's jealous mother, the Queen of the forest, and a crazed, murderous widower. The album's first weight songs set up the love story between the two central characters, while the album's second half brings the action to the story, ultimately ending with a beautiful, touching finale. As already noted, the album's greatest strength is the story that it tells. Obviously, this should come as no surprise to any seasoned Decemberists fan, but the elongated format provides Meloy the opportunity to tell this story differently than has been done in the past. One of the devices that Meloy relies heavily on is foreshadowing, something that can't really be done on a single song. Throughout the tale, subtle imagery and lines are implemented that hint at the fate of not only William and Margaret, voiced by Meloy and Becky Stark respectively, but their antagonists as well. The implementation of foreshadowing blends itself to repeated listening, and as the puzzle pieces all fall into place over time, I've found myself smiling at the intricacy of the tale. One of the perils of concept albums that The Decemberists have overcome with The Hazards of Love is that they have kept the story about as coherent as possible. If one were to go back and examine all the \"great\" rock operas and concept albums of the past (Pink Floyd's The Wall, for The Who's Tommy), they are likely to find that the stories are weak, confusing, and stimulate little emotion from the listener. The Hazards of Love exceeds where these albums have failed, and though it's difficult to make a call on it this early in the game, it may be the greatest story that Meloy has never told. Without question, though, it has already risen to the upper echelon of my \"favorite concept albums\" list. A lot of that has not only to do with the story, but with the music as well. The Decemberists have taken a great risk in making this album as they have, relying heavily on aspects of progressive rock and metal. With the exception of \"Isn't it a Lovely Night,\" there is little on The Hazards of Love that hardens back to the band's Victorian-era styling of past albums. This is a rock opera, after all. With that leap comes the threat of alienating many of the fans that they have gained over the years. This album is awash with grandeur and bombast that would have never even have been considered for previous Decemberists' records. But all of it has its place on the album, and all of it feels appropriate for the story being told. For example, The Queen, voiced by Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond, is always accompanied by heavy metal riffs that mirror her evil, dark presence in the story. A lot of credit should be given to Meloy and Chris Funk who absolutely make these portions of the album feel natural and exciting, rather than forced. And while I'm dishing out praises, Shara Worden is a revelation as The Queen! Her few moments on the album alone make the whole thing worth listening to! In truth, every musician who has least their talents to the creation of this album has done a fantastic job. I do feel, however, that Jenny Conlee might have been underutilized this time around, as her skills are sort of downplayed throughout the album to make room for Meloy and Funk. There are moments where she shines, like on the instrumental \"The Crossing,\" but these are scarce on the record. And yet despite all the musical changes that have been made to the band's sound to make this album work, I can't help but love every second of it! A Decemberists record for not, this is a fantastic work of part that I've listened to over and over again for the last few weeks. It is an album filled with beauty, emotion, and of course, Meloy's dark-twisted humour! I get chills when Shara Worden hits that last note of \"Repaid,\" I chuckle at the ultimate fate of The Rake in \"Revenge!,\" and a little bit of me breaks every time I hear the gorgeous finale, \"The Drowned\" (possibly the best song Meloy has never written). This is an album that begs to be heard. It is one that is deserving of every positive word that it receives from myself for any other fan. The Decemberists have risked their reputation to release a record that is markedly different from anything that we have never heard before. The result is something far too beautiful for words, too poignant for further commentary. My words send there. Key Tracks:one. \"Won't Want for Love (Margaret in the Taiga)\"two. \"The Wanting Comes in Wave\/Repaid\"three. \"The Queen's Rebuke\/The Crossing\"four. \"Annan Water\"five. \"The Hazards of Love four (The Drowned)\"ten out of ten Stars","overall":5,"summary":"Simply Incredible!

Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","helpful":[135,149],"reviewText":"Instrumentists, it's not just the singer and songwriter; Colin Meloi always narrates. This has been the case never since the members of the group began submissively in December two thousand and one. Perhaps for this reason, it is puzzling that the band took so long to release a disc that tells the story throughout its length. The two thousand and six Craft Crane Wife is nearing its send. The story tells a few songs. However, even under their belt, facing the rock opera, a well-known genre full of unconventional stories and great disappointment, is a mountain to climb \u2014 even to Meloi. However, if any artist in the music industry today could fix this troublesome format, it would be Meloi. Fortunately, the not only excelled at the artist who had tried this method before, but even excelled in the process. \"The Danger of Love\" tells the story of a humble president Margaret falling in love with William, a president of a nearby forest. Margaret soon learned that she was pregnant with William's baby, so she went to the forest to find him. But like Meloi's story, their love and their future are threatened by William's jealous mother, Queen of the Jungle, and insane widow. The first difficult song of the album supports the love story between the two middle characters, while the second half of the album brings action to the story, which ends with a beautiful and moving ending. As mentioned earlier, the biggest benefit of the album is the story it tells. Obviously, this should\u2019t surprise any experienced December Pie fan, but the clean format gives Meloy a chance to tell the story in a different way than before. One tool Meloy relies on is foreshadowing, one that no human could never accomplish. Throughout the story, subtle images and lines depict not only the future of William and Margaret, announced by Meloi and Becky Stark, respectively, but also by their opponents. The implementation of previews and repeated listening are combined. One of the dangers of a sensible album over December and the dangers of Love is that they keep the story as closely as possible. If you look back at all the \"big\" operas and previous visual albums (Pink Floyd's Wall, Who's Tommy), they will find that these stories are weak, confusing, and insensitive to the excitement from the listener. The dangers of love outweigh the failures of these albums, and while hard to remember from the beginning of the game, this could be the biggest history Meloy has never talked about. However, there is no doubt that it has climbed to the top of my \"favorite album\" list. Many of them are related not only to stories, but also to music. December Pie has taken a huge risk in making this album, relying heavily on savant-garde stone and metal objects. With the exception of \u201cIs It a Lovely Night\u201d, there is nothing in Love Hazards that can return to Victorian style in previous band albums. After all, this is a rock opera. With this jump came the threat of separating the many fans they had acquired over the years. The album is full of majesty and emotion, which has not been considered in previous December records. But all of these have a place in the album, and they all fit in with the story. For example, the queen proclaimed by Sarah Warden of my bright diamond always makes a heavy metal, showing her ugliness and darkness in the story. Great credit should be given to Meloy and Chris Funk. They certainly made these parts of the album feel natural and interesting, not forced. When I compliment, Sarah Warden's revelation as queen! Only a few minutes the was on the album that made it all ready to listen! After all, every musician with a little talent for making a record has done a great job. However, I feel like Jenny Conlee can\u2019t be fully utilized at the moment because her skills have been featured throughout the album to replace Meloy and Funk. Sometimes it shines, like the music of the instrument \"Crossing\", but these things are rarely seen in records. However, without all the musical changes made to the band\u2019s voice to make this album a success, I can\u2019t help but like every couple! None of the December albums are a good work that I've been listening to for the past few weeks. This is a disc full of beauty, emotion, and of course the darkness and twisted humour of Meloy! When Shara Worden hit the final note \"Repaid\", I shuddered. I was joking about the send of Rake on \"Revenge!\". Every time I heard the beautiful ending of \"Drowning\", I felt like I was going to be disturbed. The song Meloi did not write). This is the album to listen to. This is a good study for every other fan I have found. December jeopardized their dignity and issued a record very different from the record we had never heard before. The result was too good to be described, too sharp to comment further. My names go there. Top songs: One. \"You Don't Want Love (Margaret in Taiga)\" two. \"Desire to get compensation \/ compensation\" III. \"Queen's Discipline \/ Crossing\" four. \"Annan Water\" five. \"Danger of Love IV (Diving)\" Ten stars Ten","overall":5,"summary":"Simply Incredible!

She mentions in the song \"this is a gift\", so the meaning of the song most likely implies something positive. There are other gorgeous songs in this collection such as \"Cosmic Love\" and \"You've Got the Love\" (which is another song that I like).

The record did very little for me, coming off as a half-developed batch of impersonations. So when KMAG YOYO (a military acronym for \"Kiss My [. ]Guys, You're On Your Own!\") was released I was't exactly dragging the city looking for a copy. But then, on a bored Sunday, the album's cover part caught my eye. The image of Carll, standing on a Houston rooftop, boots off, looking dumb and silly, sucked me in, as did that funny title. I pulled out my phone, hit the 'net and read a few bits of press - all glowing - before buying the disc for weight bucks. Carll has been compared to Townes Van Zandt and has written songs for Van Zandt's old pal, Guy Clark. He covers Tom Waits and plays with cowpunk legend Ray Wylie Hubbard. Former Ryan Adams buddy Brad Jones plays in Carll's band and produces this records. Carll also regularly claims that guys like John Prine, Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac and even Peter Weir (via this Dead Poet's Society) are this influences. So yeah, on paper, this guy should be my favourite singer\/songwriter since David Berman packed this guitar away two years ago. Not the case. I mean, I dig some of the songs on KMAG YOYO, in theory, but they're not the kinds of tracks that I find myself nagging friends about. To me, the guy, when at this best, is a Todd Snider trip-off - but without the brilliantly clever phrasing and often desperate sounding vocals. And, okay, maybe the has a little more pop appeal than Snider does. Well damn, maybe I'm being a bit tough on the guy. Opener \"Stomp and Holler\" is a song that fans of Kristofferson and Dylan will love, full of, well, stomps and hollers. Carll is a strange bird in that the could maaaaybe appeal to both fans of \"real\" country and fans of current country, this lyrics often flaunting a novelty appeal that should hook the slow spokes. Next up is \"Hard Out Here,\" a song I want to like. I really want to like it, but damn if Carll in't taking left and right from Snider, both in this writing and singing. Still, for what it is (a trip-off), \"Hard Out Here\" is one hell of a country song - the kind you want to using along to before the second hook hits during your first listen. (Really though, Carll is taking from Hank Williams most of the time - which is just fine.)And then, all of the sudden, a track called \"Bottle In My Hand\" kicks in and I've had it. This guy is taking way too much from Todd Snider, especially in this vocal style. But wait . what's that? That is Todd Snider singing? Oh. Well, I suppose this collaboration implies that Snider is a fan of Carll's. Interesting. Anyhow, it's a pretty solid track, though not as memorable as \"Hard Out Here,\" which could very easily be a radio hit - if only \"real\" country was still played on the radio. There's quite of few themes there, almost all of which relate to the album's American flag-themed album part. Carll paints a picture of modern, war-torn, sad and scared America in a way that infuses humour and twang at every turn. Not every song works, but Carll is taking from some of the best out there. For example, the title track - and a couple other tracks, too - are almost exact copies of Dylan tracks, \"KMAG YOYO\" sounding like a carbon copy of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" but with lesser words. If you're a fan of soft-rocking and authentic country music, then, sure, pick up a copy of Hayes Carll's fourth studio album. But be prepared to dig your way through some overly obvious codes while you're getting to know these songs. If nothing else, you'll send up with a few great new drinking tracks and some fun-to-read lyrics.","overall":4,"summary":"Not an Original Voice, But a Good One Regardless","unixReviewTime":1299456000,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2011"}

People with disabilities can't reach their potential, so they decide \"We are creative and talented - we dare to let you follow us into your dark world of emptiness and modesty, smoothness, balance, non-musical style of\" World Computer \". and you understand what is going on, but the reason you know it does't make sense to you because it does't make sense at all. Hollywood pump fan out once a week because your mind is no better than the usual Joe starting over, no matter what, the will heat whatever is fed to him. -melancholic, kun of and similar post-apocalyptic words, vague, unplanned, and meaningless. Maybe Radiohead says rock music is meaningless. Who will fly. Eke. Some of the Bends, OK Computer, Kid A and Amnesiac are good. Then they begin to believe in their \"myth\", no matter what. IN MY OWN HUMILITY, the myth is that their music is not bad. It's boring. It's that simple. Rock music does't have to be boring. Sorry, the capital letter B is boring.","overall":1,"summary":"C'mon, people...","unixReviewTime":1301702400,"reviewTime":"04 2, 2011"}

He has a \"great idea\" on the hour, every hour. And of all those great ideas, sixty percent are truly are great. The other forty percent, well, you smile politely and change the subject quickly. Barnes' main gig, the eclectic ADD-inflected Of Montreal, is the sixty\/forty ratio. Over the years the band has morphed from an actual band into a half crazed\/half genius working alone in a home studio. The sound of Of Montreal has changed just as often as Kevin Barnes wardrobes and personas. Starting out in the Elephant six Recording Company, the band played twee, sixty's inflected pop. Then about the time two thousand and fives Sunlandic Twins came out, the sound began to shift. It became darker, and more interested in a flo of funky vibe. It became more personal. Hissing Fauna Are You The Destroyer continued the trend to beautiful affect. But the next two albums, two thousand and heights Skeletal Lamping and two thousand and tens False Priest stammered a bit. Skeletal Lamping became more in focus and showed it's scatterbrained charm the more you listened. False Priest, while containing some classic Kevin Barnes' songs, just sorta fell flat. It's now two thousand and twelve, and Kevin Barnes' Of Montreal has returned. This time with the poppy, savant garden, harsh but ultimately moving and very personal Paralytic Stalks.`Gelid Ascent' starts off with static noise and the faint sound of electronics before Barnes comes in with a wavering, robotic voice. Then the line \"You speak to me, like the anguish of a child doused in flames\", drums coming in, this voice echoing off into the distance. It's a great example of Kevin Barnes' ability to mix a catchy refrain with lots of noise inside a massive wall of sound. `Spiteful Intervention' sounds like its title. An angry Barnes screaming \"I made the one I love cry tonight, and it felt good\". Despite the odour words and title, this is a rather bouncy, upbeat song. This is a talent of Kevin Barnes. Making sad and hopeless into upbeat and sunny. `Dour Percentage' has a seventy's funk to it with it's bouncy, walking bass line and Barnes never present falsetto. It's a song about friends that can't be friends anymore. A lot has been said about the personal nature of this record. To bridges the Of Montreal main man has burnt, to problems in Barnes marriage. `Malefic Dowery' is a song about Kevin Barnes marriage and issues of infidelity. Despite the downer material, the keeps the track light with a floating melody and mellow percussion. The absolute highlight of this album is `Wintered Debts', with it's almost country flair and honky stock piano, Barnes' sings lines like \"All the people kept saying there is one true belief system, but all my life I've been betrayed by my mother's religion\". It seems Barnes is dealing with life long issues, and the does so in a way we can relate to without having to look at your own lives. This can't be a proper Of Montreal album without Kevin Barnes alienating some fans, and making sure the ruins any chance of making new jones. He has touted that the was very much influenced by post-modern composers Philip Glass and Krzysztof Penderecki. And it shows on tracks like `We Will Commit the Wolf' and especially the last two tracks. Here's where jones patience will be tested. \"Authentic Pyrrhic Remission\" is a dizzying cacophony of noise that lasts for an astounding thirteen minutes. Any fan of Wilco would call this the `Less Than You Think' track. But unlike that droning fifteen minute track, Of Montreal reward those who stick with it. The track ends with a beautiful piano and Barnes singing \"Til this afternoon I was a nomad\/No country would call me its son\/I'd be a refugee but I have no substance\". Was it worth the wait? Yes. So there's the thing: if you haven't been on board with Of Montreal for the last couple years, you probably still won't be. If Skeletal Lamping sent you packing in search of a new freak to follow, then Paralytic Stalks will pretty much do the same. But if there's still that adventurous side of you that still yearns to be fed a different fruit, then give this album a shot. Sometimes great part in't necessarily comfortable. Sometimes it needs to make you cringe and squirm in your seat before it makes you a fan. Paralytic Stalks at times will make you cringe, and squirm in your seat. But if you give it a chance it will make you a fan, and maybe even move you.","overall":4,"summary":"The Drama Queen and the Psychotic Orchestra","unixReviewTime":1330128000,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2012"}

Of all the great ideas, sixty percent are really good. For the remaining forty%, you smile humbly and change content quickly. Barnes' main work, the eclectic ADD-inflected Montreal, is a sixty\/forty rating. Over the years, the band has evolved from a real band to a semi-crazy \/ half-genius working alone in a home studio. Montreal's voice is constantly changing as Kevin Barnes and the characters drop out. Starting with Elephant Six Records, the band played a twee, a popular music of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys. Then about two and five thousand Sunlandic twins came out, the sound began to tremble. It gets darker and more interesting in the fashion scene. It becomes more personal. Kissing Animals Are You a Destroyer and continue to have a positive impact on this practice. But the next two plates, two thousand and weight thousand head lamps and two thousand and ten false priests, shook slightly. Skeletal Lamping has attracted more attention, and as you listen more, it will show off its untrained charm. False Priesthood, even though it contains some old Kevin Barnes songs, is a small thing. It's two thousand and twelve, and Kevin Barnes' \"Montreal\" is back. This time it is a poppy flower, a student garden, rough but ultimately touching and a deformed trunk. \"Gelid Ascent\" began with a steady noise and faint electronic sound, then Barnes entered with the sound of a vibrating robot. Then came the drum, \"You talk to me like the spain of a child drowned in a flame\", and a voice came from far away. This is a good example of Kevin Barnes' ability to mix a catchy chorus with a lot of noise on a large sound wall. \"Wicked intervention\" sounds like its title. An angry Barnes exclaimed \"I've made him cry my man tonight and it makes sense\". Aside from the fragrant lyrics and the title, this is a very powerful and hopeful song. This is the talent of Kevin Barnes. Turn sorrow and despair into hope and sunshine. \u2018Percent Percent\u2019 has a sense of awe in the seventies, has a flexible, moving bass line, and Barnes has never been seen in falsetto. This song is about friends who can't be friends. People have talked a lot about the nature of this record. The bridge burned a prominent man in Montreal, the problem of Barnes' marriage. \"Malefic Dowery\" is a song about Kevin Barnes' marriage and infidelity. In addition to the use of low-heavy materials, floating song and soft beats keep the track lighter. The highlight of the album is \"Winter Cases\", which is almost a rustic and clumsy piano. Barnes' words are like \"Everyone says there is a system of true belief, but I have been betrayed by my mother all my life. Religion\". Barnes seems to be facing the challenges of a long life, and the way the does that can be connected to us without looking at your lives. Without Kevin Barnes splitting up some fans and making sure the ruins have a chance to create a new Jones, this would\u2019t be a real Montreal album. He explained that postmodern composers Philip Glass and Krzysztof Penderecki had a great influence on it. It comes from a track like \"We'll commit to the wolf\", especially the last two songs. That\u2019s where Jones \u2019patience is tested. \"True Pyrrhic Forgiveness\" is an amazing murmur that lasts for thirteen minutes. Any Wilco fan will call this method \"less than you think\". But unlike the fifteen-minute whistle, Montreal rewards those who endure. The repertoire ended with a beautiful piano, and Barnes sang \"I am nomads until this afternoon \/ No country will call me its son \/ I will be a refugee, but I have nothing.\" Is it worth the wait? Oh yeah. And there's the thing: if you haven't joined Montreal in the last few years, you might not. If the Skull Lamp tasks you to pack up and find a new monster to follow, Paralyzed Stem will almost certainly do the same. But if you still have a dangerous side and still want to be fed a variety of fruits, please try this disc. Sometimes a large portion does not have to be free. Sometimes it has to make you squirm and squirm in your chair before you can become a fan. A crippled trunk sometimes causes you to crawl and turn in your seat. But if you give it a chance, it will make you a fan and can motivate you.","overall":4,"summary":"The Drama Queen and the Psychotic Orchestra","unixReviewTime":1330128000,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2012"}

You have a million views. You have a \"good idea\" every hour, every hour. And sixty percent of all these good ideas are really good. Another forty percent, well, smile politely and change the subject quickly. Barnes's largest gig, selective ADD-inflected Of Montreal, average sixty \/ forty. Over the years, the band has grown to be half the battle of a real band that works alone in a home studio. Like Kevin Barnes' wardrobe and personality, Montreal's voice has changed many times. Beginning with the Elephant Six recording company, the band played a toy, a sixty pop. By the time the two thousand five thousand Sunland twins came out, the noise had begun. It got deeper, and there was more interest in the funky vibe floor. It was personal. Hissing Fauna Are You The Destroyer continued the trend of positive communication. But the next two albums, Two Hundred and Eight Skeletal Lamping and Two Hundred and Twenty Fall Priests faltered a little. Skeleton clamping was very focused and if you listen a lot, it showed the scattered charm. The false pastor, composed of Kevin Barnes' classical songs, suddenly fell to the ground. It's two thousand and twelve, and Kevin Barnes of Montreal is back. In this case there is a poppy, a warm, hard garden but ultimately a moving and personal paralysed pole. Then the line \"You talk to me like a child's spain in the flames\" came to the drum, the sound echoes far away. A good example of Kevin Barnes' ability to combine attractive dieting with a cloud voice within a cloud wall. 'Tragic intervention' sounds like its title. \"I made my sweetheart cry tonight, and it was fun,\" Barnes shouted angrily. In addition to the fragrant lyrics and title, it is a beautiful, powerful song. This is the talent of Kevin Barnes. To make you happy and sad and hopeless in the sun. 'Door Percentage' has seventy funk with its bounce, lineup and moving buses and Barnes never introduced Falsto. A song about friends who can no longer be friends. Much has been said about the personal nature of this record. The main man on the bridges of Montreal has burned the problems of Barnes' marriage. Malefic Dowery is a song about Kevin Barnes' marriage and infidelity stories. In addition to humour, it keeps track light with floating music and warm music. The full glimpse of this album is 'Winterd Dubts', as it is almost a country and a valuable stock piano, Barnes sings like this \"Everyone has always said that there is only one true belief system, but my All my life I have been deceived. My mother's religion. \" Barnes seems to be dealing with long-term health problems, and is doing so in a way that we can communicate without looking at your lives. It won't be a suitable Montreal album unless Kevin Barnes sets it apart from other audiences, and make sure the ruins are a chance to make new Jones. He says it's all inspired by modern designers Philip Glass and Krzysztof Pendrecki. It also appears on tracks such as \"We Will Commit the Wolf\" especially the last two tracks. This is where Jones' endurance will be tested. \"Authentic Pique Remix\" is a boring soundtrack that lasts an amazing thirteen minutes. Any Wilco fan can call this song 'Under Thinking'. But unlike this fifteen-minute track, Montreal rewards those who stick to it. The track ends with a beautiful piano and Barnes sings \"I was a gypsy until this afternoon \/ No country will call me their son \/ I can run away but I have nothing\". Was it worth the wait? Yes. So there's something: If you haven't been to Montreal in the last few years, you probably haven't. If Skeleton Lamping has sent you a pack, you will find something new to follow, and so will the strokes. But if you still have the aspect that still wants to feed a different fruit, give this album a shot. Sometimes a big part of the spain. Sometimes it needs to make you tired and proud of your chair before it can make you a fan. Disability races sometimes make you depressed, and shake your seat. But if you give it a chance, it will make you a fan, and maybe move you.","overall":4,"summary":"The Drama Queen and the Psychotic Orchestra","unixReviewTime":1330128000,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2012"}

Two thousand and twelve now, and Kevin Barnes is back in Montreal. This time in a waterfall, a safe garden, rough but ultimately moving and very personal Paralytic Stalks. Then the line \u201cTalk to me like a baby on fire\u201d, drums come, this sound coming from a distance.

Despite the fragrant words and title, it\u2019s a very good song. This is the talent of Kevin Barnes. Making loneliness and despair - rising and sunny.

While the undertones are there, it still tracks the light with a floating rhythm and sweet beat.

Barnes seems to be talking about long life issues, and the does it so we can talk without looking at your life. It could\u2019t be right for the Montreal album without Kevin Barnes distancing himself from some fans, and making sure it ruined any chance of making new jones. He stressed that it influenced modern composers Philip Glass and Krzysztof Pendeecki. It shows clues like \u201cWe will decide on the wolf\u201d and especially the last two clues. Here you will test jones patience. \u201cAuthentic Pyrrhic Remission\u201d is a confusing cry that lasts thirteen minutes. Every Wilco fan will call it in the \u2018Less than you think\u2019 way. But unlike the fifteen -minute run, Montreal rewards those who stay there. The road ends with a beautiful piano and Barnes sings \"Until this afternoon I am a nomad \/ No country will call me this child \/ I would be a refugee but I have no essence\". Is the wait worth it? Yes So there\u2019s one thing: if you haven\u2019t followed Of Montreal in the last two years, you probably still won\u2019t stay. If Skeletal Lamping sent you a package to find a new love to follow, Stalks Paralytic would do great. But if there\u2019s still an interesting part of you that\u2019s still thirsty to be fed a different fruit, then give this album a shot. Sometimes a large part of it is not necessarily comfortable. Sometimes the has to force you and make you sit in your chair before the makes you a fan. Sometimes you get paralysed, and sit in your chair. But if you give it a chance it will make you a fan, and maybe move you further.","overall":4,"summary":"The Drama Queen and the Psychotic Orchestra","unixReviewTime":1330128000,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2012"}

Her songs can be heavenly beautiful and hellishly terrifying both at once.

Another gem is \"Infinite\", which ironically and sadly only lasts a bit over one minute. This song could last five-six minutes. it's hypnotic and absolutely spellbinding. While Boucher's musical style remains something truly unique, she is not without influences which are eclectic to say the least: Cocteau Twins, Bel Canto, DCD, to name a few, yet there is nothing contrived there. Grimes is in a category and class of her own. In her videos, Boucher leverages her youthful, pixie supermodel looks and persona to emanate something straight out of a fever-dream.

Ever since Bjork emerged as a female musician very different from the peer-to-peer industry - Grimes is something completely new, unusual, like a dream and a complete surreal. In this video, Boucher uses the appearance and personality of this little self supermodel to illuminate something directly in a passionate dream. For those who are new to Grimes, it can be a fun experience, even though I was immediately drawn to it. The perfect performance of this dichotomy can be found in the fascinating \"Genesis\" and \"Symphonia IX\", which represent two of the best songs on the album. The other rare thing is \"infinity\", which is embarrassing and sadly lasts for more than a minute. This goes well with this voice and musical journey.","overall":5,"summary":"Unearthly Brilliance","unixReviewTime":1397865600,"reviewTime":"04 19, 2014"}

And now there is the idea that the hype machine is completely banished :-) Their music is a mix of other independent black dream music genres. But let's go back. In July two thousand and twelve, I stumbled upon the duo using a seven-inch single vinyl \u2018Hurricane\u2019 \/ \u2018Bones (Short)\u2019, and a white seven-inch vinyl record record Candy Bar Creep Show EP A few Months Later . The opening song of the album \"Hurricane\" is very exciting. I really like Lizzy's voice and drums, \"Welcome to the black and dirty soul meal I can't hide.\" Nice, great product and voice. 'Bones' is good, not very popular, and it's another great song from Lizzy, \"Empty Church with the Curse of the Soul\". When the described the spain of life, the was confident in this own birth. The 'Gray Tree Alley' is brighter, the other brass perfectly reinforces this \"dream of waking up when my mind is in turmoil\" and \"creatures seem to be crying and disappearing\". 'Imagination' also shines through in this fast-paced music, with the sound of \"time consuming damage\" \"helping me feel what I want to see\". 'Dark Doo Wop' is a beautiful original sound \"Baby, you have to stay\" slow and lovely, because it builds and burns \"This world is going to burn. A burning fire\" is a great sound. This time, you have the best \/ most powerful five song tracks on any album I've been listening to for a long time. The sixth \"Head Is Not My Home\" is almost a national anthem that is fascinating and amazing. \u2018Sweet Salt\u2019 and the old saying \u201cWe are afraid of rejection\u201d. 'Think Of You' \"I still remember you and all the things you make me go through\" are really fun. 'twenty-seven' focused on the piano \"No promise from heaven, just believe I will pass twenty-seven\", which makes hell even more glorious, and is a picture of how important rock stars have died in twenty-seven years. The excellent performance of 'BTSK' will amaze you \"It's not easy to come, I'm glad it's hard, it's worth waiting to give you my heart\" and excellent synthesizer sounds. This is the best way out there. 'BTSK' means Big Teeth Small Breast: to) 'No Trace' Another Specctorish worker with a kitchen sink. \u2018This is not a control\u2019 has some interesting words, but it can be very weak on the record. If there is a little criticism, it sounds a little done (carefully planned rather than natural), but in fact, Mrs. has split the axis of pop music with beautiful dark pop music, and so far this year. .","overall":5,"summary":"Ms Mr have polarised the axis of popular music with sumptuous dark dream pop","unixReviewTime":1368576000,"reviewTime":"05 15, 2013"}

Five of these five songs are Axis, Love Is A Bourgeois, and The Last to Die. Sing small songs, this is an outdated tool in their business, it is appropriate and should not be missed. Surprisingly, New Command released their nine-track Lost Sirens album last year as a legacy of their WFTSC season. These songs also look new, sound and are more suitable for today's loyal albums than the conference it came from. In each case, the songs were recorded as they had just been recorded yesterday, giving people a modern feel and a listening experience. Just like the two mirrors facing, showing and looking back on each side, the recent works of the two are best since ten thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, when we hear of PSB's Very and NO's Republic. These are great albums and articles to convert everyone. Now, both of these older bands have been dominating the chart for three different decades. It\u2019s good to hear of the last precious murder of these two, because the youth source has to flow like a drop near their recording studio, which is a much needed option. Good for them. It's fun for us.","overall":5,"summary":"Great back to dance!","unixReviewTime":1374537600,"reviewTime":"07 23, 2013"}

It has a retro disco rock sound to it. If you listen to David Bowie for the Cars for later Pink Floyd (late seventy\/eightys) you might love this. Also has a touch of some newer bands like MGMT, Modest Mouse, LCD Soundsystem, and Fun. I know these comparisons karen't fair. The soundscape is technically diverse, you can't really label this band anything other than itself. You can tell the strong nuances of the vocals reflect in each song. This album is so bold and daring it may change the sound of pop music forever. This album is so deep and full of meaning it may change some people's lives. Some will find it pretentious for too different from old arcade fire to like. Give it a good five listens before you truly judge.
