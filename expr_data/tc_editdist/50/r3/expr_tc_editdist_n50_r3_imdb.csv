You see the characters change never so subtly, under the influence of the rented villa in Italy, and love. And happiness. The film casts a mesmerizing spell on you, much as the villa does on all the women. Truly ""enchanted"".",positive

828,"Truly appalling waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about thirty minutes from the send. And i can count the films I have switched off before the send on one hand. The script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring. I would't be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. For example the irritating croat threatening the real estate guy from this house phone. I mean seriously. The police would be beating this door down in minutes. The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. Oh and what ""characters"" they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful. He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After sixty for so minutes of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from this generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. Is the happy? Is the sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. And the native American theme is just awful and pointless. The good guys are at best unlikeable. A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic sex-wife stereotype. Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy, ""you karen't going to shoot me"" that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying. The richie unix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic for at least realistically motivated. Roasario Dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to believe her character was SO attracted to Rourke's? Or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! In summary a complete mess of a film. Hopeless characterisations and performances. A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely dull. Its not even comedy bad either. Laughing at Rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first fifteen turgid minutes of the film.",negative

828,"What a shocking waste of space. My friend and I tried to finish watching the movie, but I had to close it about thirty minutes after posting it. On the other hand, I could list the movies I closed before posting. The script and the instructions are far away and tedious. I would not be surprised if they found the script among the one, nine hundred and eighty-three responses left. For example, annoying Croatian intimidates real estate agents by using this home phone. I speak deeply. The police would knock on the door for a few minutes. Shows and events were washed away by you like dung in the river. It is difficult to understand the real content of this movie. The story between the characters flies in a seemingly insignificant way, breaking down the painful attempts to show the characters. Oh, what a “role” they are. The protagonist played by Locke is awesome. He could cut a piece of cardboard and sit on the bed. After sixty minutes of this movie, I can’t totally stick to this character. He has no compassion for hatred. It's a broken dummy from the grocery store, stuck all over the place. His intentions are not to be understood in this discourse remains vague and vague. are you happy? Are you sad? are you angry I do not know. Just the eyes of death looking at you in the twisted flesh. And Native American content is awesome and meaningless. Good people are not loved at all. The vague white stereotype and the stereotype of a stupid woman. It’s annoying and annoying to remind a normal woman to face the wrong person with a gun, “You’re not going to shoot me”. The character Richie unix seemed interesting at first, but soon turned into an annoying character. This seems to contradict the further purpose of making the wicked sympathetic to at least some real intentions in some way. Roasario Dawsons' role began with some promises, but the soon fell into the disgusting and childish drama of the gangster factor Jackie Brown. Do you really want me to believe that this character is attracted to Rourke's character? Or what’s worse is the madman sleeping in anything that moves? Real female characters FTW! After all, the movie is a mess. Despair and performance. Black and old script and uninspired guide. It ended up being very boring. There is nothing wrong with comedy. After the first fifteen minutes of watching the movie, Rourkes' heavy face became very old.",negative
828,"This place is really scary. My friend and I tried to watch this movie eventually, but I had to turn it off about thirty minutes after it was sent. I can also count the movies I killed before sending a hand. Writing and directing are leads that are not deeply rooted. I would not be surprised if they see a finger on a finger thrown at a thousand, nine hundred and eighty -three. For example an angry detective threatening a real estate agent on this phone. I mean really. The police knocked on this door for a few minutes. You are just bathed in scenes and events like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the true purpose of the film. The story told between the characters is so obvious that it relentlessly destroys the compassionate attempt to build the characters. Oh and what “characters”. Rourke’s acting is shocking. He can send this own cartoon and stay in bed. After sixty minutes of that film I totally posted zero on this character. He is not compassionate for hateful. A little mess from the shop window passing through every place. His motivation is unmistakable in the usually confusing and unemotional delivery. is the happy Is it sad? Angry? I have no idea. Other dead eyes stared at a piece of flesh that was gone. The original American theme was awful and meaningless. Great men are the best and unseen. Lack of vision of a lazy white neck and a nervous structure of a nervous woman. Cue archetypal wife with a shotgun is confronted by a bad guy, ""you won't shoot me"" which is unfounded and annoying. The richie unix character seemed interesting at first but immediately fell into a side-effects psychological character that seemed to contradict the apparent purpose of having the bad guy somehow feel any real motivation. The character of Roasario Dawsons started out with promises but soon turned into a painful story that looked like a gangster from Jackie Brown. Do you really want me to believe that this character attracted you to Rourke? Or worse is she a slut moving into something? Real FTW female characters! In other words a complete noise movie. Descriptions and demonstrations of despair. A hacked lead text with uninteresting directions. And in the send it was very boring. Its also bad comedy. The old laughter on Rourkes haggard's face after sitting down for the first fifteen minutes of the film.",negative

1181,"Who does't have unresolved issues with parents? And which parents don't have unresolved issues with each other? I know, that sounds heavy. But this is played for laughs in the movie, making both the comedy better and the drama better. I've always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie, I was enchanted from the very first scene. Especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about this father as a person.

Without that scene being acted so well, the movie would have seemed far less nuanced, and the character far less interesting. Nicely done, Paul and Peter!",positive

1787,"Beware, My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, Harry Horner, better known for this set designs. Robert Ryan plays a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her. The problem is that the is a psychopathic murderer and does't know it. Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over, to little avail. He is not the sort of man compassion could help for cure. Thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can't do well because there is something wrong with him. He suffers periodic blackouts during which the commits facts of violence, which the later forgets. Essentially the effect Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and this prey, for in another sense a sadist. The audience finds out early on that Ryan is a mad killer, but it takes Lupino much longer. Thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to 'win' Ryan over in order to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. But getting on with things in't in Ryan's makeup, as the is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening this paranoia asserts itself. As a study in mental illness the movie in't too impressive. What it's superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical in that we know Lupino can't 'fix' Ryan, yet we want her to. The result is that, if one is willing, one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure. Horner shows us, gradually, the layout the Lupino house , a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We become familiar with staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which jones she can't.",positive

1787,"Beware, My Beloved is an experimental film in the early one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys, directed by a man named Harry Horner, known for this kind of set design. Robert Ryan plays the handyman, and Ida Lupino hired him to do the housework for him. The problem is, it's a mentally will killer, and I don't know. Miss Lupino is a caring person, she tried to win Ryan, but with little success. It is not the kind of person who can heal with compassion. So, we have an interesting situation where two people have good intentions, but one of them can’t do well because the has a problem. He was suffering from a power outage, and the violent facts of the day were later forgotten. Basically, Ryan's influence on Lupino is the influence of hunters and prey, because otherwise it's sad. Audiences soon found out that Ryan was a crazy killer, but it would take Lupino a long time. So, when we see poor Miss Lupino doing her best to “succeed” Ryan in making things go smoothly, work done, and move on with life, we need to embrace this knowledge. But continuing to deal with things is not something Ryan has done, because the can't do anything without the most basic of routine, and it will only happen that this kind of paranoia has happened. As a study of mental illness, this movie is not very impressive. At its score is the demonstration of the effects of a serious mental illness, mixed with dangerous psychopathology, and its effects on the general public. In this case, the film is real and sympathetic, and although we know that Lupino can't ""fix"" Ryan, we hope the can. The result is that if you want to, if you can put your opinion aside, if you want to, you can be emotionally invested in this movie. Horner gradually showed us the nature of the Lupino house, a fearsome Gothic beast that can feel at home. We are familiar with stairs, kitchens and storage rooms; we begin to know which windows Miss Lupino can use to escape, and which windows she cannot.",positive

4352,"Lizzie Borden's Love Crimes is an important film, dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (and including full frontal female nudity, which sure beats the male kind). It flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory. This treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky, but Borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust. One striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses, when the antagonist, a counterfeit fashion photographer, is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse. He shoves a riding crop between her legs, pressing it against her crotch, and this greatly increases her excitement. Then suddenly the leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door. Patrick Bergin plays the icon artist, and though the falls a long distance from handsome, the picks on plain Janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow this line. By all reports, Sean Young proves a weird person, and she is scarcely beautiful. Yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long-limbed slender body and accentuated ships and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination. Her performance is forceful and complex. Borden possesses an intriguing worldview, and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist I truly appreciate.",positive

4457,"This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme. She's making money by dancing with men at a dance shall. She really does't like the work, but it's a living. Her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy, but she's also pursued by rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after marrying, it turns out her ""nice guy"" is a thieving, womanizing weasel and rich Cortez turns out to be a check of a guy. By the send of the film, Barbara simply has had enough, as any SANE woman would walk from this horrid marriage. In the one thousand, nine hundred and twenty and early thirty, Hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes for scenes that would surprise many today--such as nudity, adultery and bad language. While TEN CENTS A DANCE in't a blatant example of this morality, it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened Production Code was created and enforced starting in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four. In some ways the Code was great--after all, parents did't need to worry about what their kids saw in films (such as nudity in BEN HUR, one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five). However, it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much--and there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce--a serious no-no one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four and thereafter. This is really a shame, as I don't think TEN CENTS A DANCE was bad at all to discuss this--especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a philandering thief. Even so, allowing the film to send with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just could't have been. Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time. Give this one a look. FYI--Sadly, Ricardo Cortez was actually NOT Hispanic but changed this name because of possible prejudice because the was Jewish. He was an excellent leading man of this time, but today is all but forgotten.",positive

4937,"This is how i felt while watching this film. I loved it. It was hilarious. But i did feel a like i was getting sneaky view into somebody's psyche and then laughing as it got twisted around to make an interesting point. A friend put it this way:""I feel like we broke into somebody's house and are now watching their awful home videos without their knowledge"". Another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film. ""Groovin' Gary"", the original ""Beaver Kid"", is a small town guy who turns up at a nearby TV station in the hope of getting on film - and the certainly does, though not, perhaps, as the initially expected. With high hopes of fame and significance the invites Harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest that the has organised in this home town - headlined by this own drag act ""Olivia Newton-Don"". Director, Trent Harris, does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story. Some footage of an awkward kid who wants to be someone morphs, over two subsequent reinterpretations, into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town America. Harris simultaneously critiques the attitudes of small town America, the cult of celebrity, and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry. Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover pull out stunner performances. a young Sean Penn is the most evocative - so closely does the follow the actual 'Gary footage', but with strong nuances given to push the sense of the interaction the way Harris wants it to go.

11788,"Amy Heckerling's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers' tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at this life of hard knocks when the catches a kid trying to steal something from this pet store in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early page via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother turned district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor this wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's moll. The film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film. The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly closes steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing this best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the ""once"" bit one time too many. Several supporting factors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit for miss television show type stone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties' actual one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine release date. *one/two of four stars.",negative

11811,"When I watched L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: ""How complicated!"" And she is right, of course. When you are used to simple, one-linear plots, especially violent hero tvs crook schemes, L'Appartement is hard to follow. A couple of the negative reviewers there also have missed one for more important points. Other whine about the confusing flash backs. Come on! This is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet, come back and get hooked again within a few seconds. This one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details. Then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when. The director has left more than enough clues in all scenes. The first three/four of the movie center about the question: why did Max and Lisa split? The film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as a romantic lovestory, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. Having experience with French movies, I predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and I was right. In the send of the first part it becomes clear, after many twists and turns, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know, that Lisa had left and why. Lisa did not know, why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without a trace, when she returned to Paris. The only one who did was Alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut. After both Max and Lisa have found out the truth, the question of course becomes: can Alice's manipulations be undone? Well, of course not, time has passed by and things have changed. Many European movies use a story telling technique I fully enjoy. There is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide in their own advantage. Instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half Alice seems to be a side character; slowly it becomes clear, that she is key figure. Acting is simply great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past. Monica Belucci is very beautiful of course, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret. The only reason I did not gave it a ten is the somewhat unsatisfying send. Of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events Max is exactly on the point where the movie begun, only wiser and sadder. Alice has paid for her sins. But still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial. Max too easily exchanges Lisa for Alice; Alice too easily decides to reject Max, who has been her dream for so long; Max too easily returns to this francée. But then again, I don't know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.",positive

11811,"When the was watching L'Appartement with this daughter, the exclaimed: ""It's too hard!"" Yes, the was right. When you are familiar with simple one-line sites, especially TV hero fraud, L'Appartement is hard to understand. Some of the opponents there also missed an even more important point. Some complaints about the confusion of times. bring it on! This is not the kind of movie where you can leave to go to the bathroom and be addicted again in a few seconds. This requires full attention and attention to detail. So, it's not hard to figure out what happened and when it happened. The director has left enough clues in all the images. The first / fourth movie theatre about this question: Why did Max and Lisa split up? As my daughter said, the movie begins with a love story, which means that two different lovers will reunite. Having experienced French movies, I thought this story would soon change, and I am right. In the first part of the post, after a lot of twisting and turning, Max and Lisa are treated by Alice. Max did't know if Lisa was gone, for why. Lisa did not know why Max had not met her in Rome when she returned to Paris, leaving her without a trace. The person who did this was Alice, who had her reasons for shutting up. After both Max and Lisa have found the truth, the question remains: Can Alice's work be done? Of course not, over time things changed. Many European movies use my favourite storytelling techniques. The underlying dispute was not initially stated, and then two (or more) parties tried to make a decision based on their interests. Instead the audience is gradually filled with a piece of the game, and they know nothing more than the main character. L'Appartement is a good example of this technology. Alice seemed to be a supportive role in the first half; little by little, the was a leading player. The acting skills are excellent. Vincent Cassel (Vincent Cassel) is perfect as an ignorant and hurried man, putting this safety at risk in order to pursue the dream of the past. Monica Bellucci is good, but she can. Jean Paul Ecoffey provided the necessary humour. Romane Bohringer begs as a neurotic woman, suffering from a guilty conscience and remorse. The only reason I did't contribute much was that the delivery was't satisfactory. Of course, this is necessary because of the required balance. After all, Max was where the movie started, intelligent and miserable. Alice paid the price for her sin. But small turns and turns at the airport are still automatic. It is very easy for Max to replace Lisa with Alice; it is very easy for Alice to decide to reject Max, it has been her dream for a long time; it is very easy for Max to return to this France. But after that, I don't know how I can do this without sacrificing good organization. I think sometimes artists have to give up the truth for the sake of beauty.",positive
11811,"When I watched my friend L'Appartement, the exclaimed: ""How hard!"" And the was right, of course. When you’re used to making simple, unique slogans, especially TV shows of violent heroes, L’Appartement is hard to follow. Two of the negative reviewers also missed one of the key points. Another shouted about the frustrating shortcomings. Let's go! It’s not the kind of movie you can leave to visit the bathroom, go back and do it again in a few seconds. It requires full attention and keep an eye on the details. So it’s not really hard to know what’s going on and when. The director left enough instructions for all the features. The first three / four in the film industry in question: why did Max and Lisa split up? The film, as my friend told me, begins with a love story, suggesting that the two lost lovers will find themselves again. Experienced in French films, I predicted the story would soon get sick and I was right. The posting of the first part proves, after many grounds, that Max and Lisa acted like Alice. Max does't know, that Lisa has left and why. Lisa does not know, why Max did not contact Rome and left him without a trace, when the returned to Paris. The only one is Alice and she has her own reasons for keeping her mouth shut. After Max and Lisa find out the truth, the question of course will be: Can Alice’s consciousness be changed? Well, of course not, time passed and things changed. Many European films use storytelling techniques that I thoroughly enjoy. There is no indication of a major conflict in the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties will try to decide in their own interests. Instead the audience slowly grew fed up with bullets and pieces of plot that they barely knew more than the main characters. L’Apartement is a great and hidden example of this technique. The first part Alice seems to be a side character; Gradually it became clear that the was an important man. The simulation is just fine. Vincent Cassel is inherently a bit unintelligent and unmotivated, threatening a safe life just to rush into the former dream. Monica Belucci is very beautiful of course, but also talented. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides a touch of essential comedy. Romane Bohringer is a very convincing neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and remorse. The only reason I did’t give ten was to send a bit unsatisfactory. Of course it is necessary because of the desired poisoning.

The Direction by Mr. Lumet is outstanding. The film has a Seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story, but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects for product plugs.

The movie is a marauding mess of politically correct leftwing feministic selfappreciating drivel, of a so heavyhanded symbolic variety that comes across as ridiculous today. Every scene has the purpose of shedding light on one of the burning issues of society, mainly the role of females in the working community, the role of women tvs men, women as sex objects, consumerism, politics, war, etc. Every scene is commented upon by the dinner dialogue of one of the main actresses, for by turning the scene into a surrealistic joke. I have no reminiscence of any plot, for who the main characters actually were. It is the sort of movie, where consumerism is mocked by having a couple make love in a furniture store sales window while the sales agent delivers this speech, for where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into a fullblown striptease act, for ""of course"" the offensive gentlemen of the press is the equal to a raunchy club audience. Then we move swiftly on, as we need to see war erupt in a peaceful forest, we need to see multiple inflammatory feministic public speeches being drowned in the (male) blowing of cars horns for rioting crowds, and of course we need to see cinema newsreels of Stalin and all the other usual suspects. You get the idea. But all this does not matter at all. The movie is an unsurpassed piece of eyecandy for any (male) Ingmar Bergman aficionado. A movie boasting leads Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drivel  and also delight in watching them so generously use their acting skills in a movie I had never heard about before today. It is hard to believe how especially the face of Bibi Andersson towns the screen every single time she appears. The cinematography is gorgeously orchestrated lbw, often revelling in an overexposed (?) dimensionless whitishness, and you just never grow tired of watching the performers. How absurd, that a movie made with so much consideration for the feministic agenda, tirelessly advocating that women should not be viewed as merely an object of desire, has nothing better to offer the twenty-onest century viewer than a parade of stunningly beautiful babes.

12953,"Why pooh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these. This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role. What's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a who-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real initial rise and fall. The three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but the could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits this role. But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (I am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres). The fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel never filmed.",negative

The sad thing is that since this movie has already been made, no other movies will be made to solve the original stuff, which is not included in Carlito's Road - I want to see this. But at that time they did not understand the real condition of hell (I like a fictional novel) - movies and books were accurate (written by a lawyer at the time, now Edwin Torres). every follower of Carlito Way there spit in front of them; the choice of Luis Guzman, who played a key role in the first movie, as a different role that made it even worse. The three stars are because, as an independent film, it’s not too scary - there are good scenes (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito, but it can be very difficult in other roles OK) And the story in’t bad.

He talks kindly with the many people the comes in contact with during this day. He reads comic books, which the finds in the trash, with a young boy who the often passes by while on the garbage route. Unfortunately, Dominick has a diminished ability to use this mind. He has a disability. Dominick's disability came as a result of an injury to the head in which the suffered traumatic brain injury (TBI). This injury left him slower, though it did not change this score characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others. Dominick is actually more table to live independently than the may seem at the beginning of the film. He lives with Eugene who is studying to become a doctor. Dominick provides the main source of income, while Eugene is off studying. Eugene must face the fact that the is to continue this education in a different city, and that the must move away from Dominick. Eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from this twin brother. The film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals, families, and then society as a whole. The strain that escalates between Eugene and Dominick as Eugene realizes that the must eventually leave Nicky, exploded on their birthday night. Eugene yells at Dominick and throws him against the wall. In this moment, Eugene must confront this own fears of being like this abusive father, the father which Dominick protected him against while the himself became the victim of the abuse. This event cemented the love between the two brothers, who from then on became the best of friends. Though they needed each other, they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others. The fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain. However, by the send of the film, Dominick is table to say good bye to this brother and wish him luck. Eugene is table to leave this brother with the confidence that the has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with this independence. When Dominick witnesses the abuse of this friend the is forced to come face to face with the cause of this own trauma. In this state of extreme stress, Dominick almost completely shuts down. He then runs after the ambulance to the hospital to see what happened to this friend. After learning that the boy has died, the is confronted by the abusive father who, fearing this testimonial, tells him the did't see nothing, does't know anything, and not to say anything, and that if the does the will kill him. Now that this own life has been threatened, the goes and find the hand gun that Larry used to kill the rats. He goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at gunpoint, kidnaps the baby of the grieving family. He runs away from the scene and hides in a building. When the police surround him, Eugene goes in the building to talk to this brother. Eugene then reveals the cause of Dominick's disability and they bring the baby back. The abusive father then wields a gun of this own threatening to kill Dominick, but Eugene stops him and Dominick tells the crowd that the saw the father throw this son down the stairs. Through the climactic ending, the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view. Though Dominick's instinct to save the baby can be understood, we also see how damaging this response is. Dominick put the baby's life and this own life in grave danger. The larger societal consequences of these events is not directly implicated, but rather shown through the films ending. Despite the more optimistic ending portrayal, another sequence of events might just have likely occurred, in which Dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a firearm. It is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely unaccounted. Furthermore, even if Dominick is not charged, there may still be a stigma against him within the community, not that there was't one before these events. Instead, the film shows that we must be table to recognize problematic behavior and act to curb it. Dominick and Eugene was released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, the same year as another film, Rainman, which won five Academy Awards. While Rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities, it could be argued that Dominick and Eugene holds more valuable lessons for society. Whereas, Rainman demonstrated that mainstream American society might be table to learn from and care for a 'savant', if the 'savant' is the inheritor of a large estate. Dominick and Eugene show that a person with a disability might be table to care for and help save members of American society.

Dominica provides the main source of income, while Eugene does not study. Eugene has to face the fact that the must continue to receive education in a different city and must separate from Dominica. Eugene also developed a relationship and began to separate from this twin. The film focuses on domestic violence and how it affects individuals, families and the community at large. The tension between Eugene and Dominic grew as Eugene realized that they had to leave Nicky at last, which erupted on their birthday. Eugene shouted at Dominic and threw him against the wall. In the meantime, Eugene has to deal with fear, like this abusive father, Dominic protects this father, and the too becomes a victim of abuse. The event brought love between the two brothers, and they have become close friends never since. Although they need each other, they also need independence and the ability to improve and develop relationships with others. The fact that they have to split up in ways becomes a real emotional stress. However, with the release of the film, Dominic has said good-bye to the brother and wishes him well. Eugene left the brother with confidence, believing that the had begun to build a social network with people who scared about him, and they would help him find freedom. When Dominic saw this friend's abuse, the was forced to face the cause of this shock. In this state of extreme despair, Dominic was almost completely shut down. He then brushed an ambulance to the hospital to see what had happened to the friend. After hearing that the boy was dead, the met this abusive father, feared the evidence and told him that the had seen nothing, knew nothing, said nothing and would kill him if the did so. Because their lives were in danger, they went to look for the gun Larry used to kill the mouse. He went after the deceased and abducted a child from the affected family at gunpoint. He fled the scene and hid in a building. When the police surrounded her, Eugene entered the building to talk to the brother. Eugene then revealed the cause of Dominic's disability, and they returned with the baby. The abusive father then waved this gun and threatened to kill Dominic, but Eugene stopped him and Dominic told the crowd to see this father throw this son up the stairs. Reaching the climax, a problem of inefficiency emerges. While we can appreciate Dominic's instinct for saving babies, we have also seen the devastating nature of this response. Dominica puts the child's life and life in grave danger. The major social effects of these events are not directly involved, but are explained by the send of the movie. Although the outcome is promising, something else may happen, in which Dominic is accused of kidnapping and possessing a firearm. It's hard to believe that this is completely lost. In addition, even if Dominic was not prosecuted, the would still be stigmatized in public, than there was no one before these events. Instead, the film shows that we need to be vigilant to identify the problem and take action to control it. Dominique and Eugene were released in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-eight, and another film, ""Rainmaker"" released that year, won five Oscars. Although Rain Man is successful and helps increase the visibility of people with disabilities, it can be said that Dominica and Eugene provided important lessons for society. However, Lehman has confirmed that ""scholars"" are the their of a man, a typical American society can learn and care for ""scholars."" Dominic and Eugene have shown that people with disabilities can care for and help save members of the American community. The message of an independent disabled person can be very powerful for eighteen, zero people. Hopefully, one day, society will see the power of people with disabilities, not as a threat, but as a necessary condition in human power.",positive

None of the characters act in a realistic manner, especially in the aforementioned, despicable threerd act (I promise I won't give it away, but trust me, it's not worth keeping a secret!). A lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally, like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work. Please, give the viewers more credit than that!!! Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man from one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three. There is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous, and is not mentioned once later on. If more attention had been paid it, Kevin bacon's mad scientist might have made a little more sense.

Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for forty-three years, which begs the question ""how long did vaudeville last, anyway?""). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when the was't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; there, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and the over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to stone down the character, to nuance this temperament to give ""The Sunshine Boys"" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless space; one closes hope for it early on. *one/two from ****",negative

23747,"I saw this movie when it first came to the heaters in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight and though I knew it was't of award winning caliper. I kinda liked it. It tales the tale of five former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids - which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways, but none too differently than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson, a ""true believer"" in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with this mother, still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting. Compounding their task, however, is the Grunski brothers, two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned. By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit, albeit harmlessly. Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts, who think Pack seven is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out. All in all, the movie still has bits of charm. Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot, for example, and you have a really funny bit going for you.

24445,"This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly, it should be said, charts the beginning to the send of World War two. The origins are not entirely examined fully from Germany's fall at the hands of the Versailles treaty which helped propel Hitler's demonic rise, but as one reviewer says, that must be hard to do, in a twenty-six-part series with so much to cram in. Apart from the expected combat photography/action, there are plenty of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you're not necessarily a World War two buff/fan. Episodes showing 'testimonies' and what life was like on the home front of the main allies/adversary, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the U. S. A. were quite eye-opening. Showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians, the death camps etc., were very well handled and exposed. I'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation (Of which it could be said I am one at forty-seven!). Certain things are quite strangely left out, like the advent of the new jet era beginning, with Frank Whittle's experimental Gloster jet and the Gloster Meteor's combat debut as well as that of the German Messerschmitt Me two hundred and sixty-two - especially as the V-one was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the Vtwo. This is probably a small oversight, not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which WWtwo brought forward from a more barren old science. But a great series that made its mark and has done so never since when thankfully repeated. A series to own as a box set in history terms, on DVD for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be well proud.",positive

Then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site (the movie's first mistake, but they those period costumes are expensive and this is a Sci-Fi channel movie). The first sightings we get of the Anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy CG effect. Then the body counts starts. This is were the movie went south for me. The reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction. Once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do? They make the usual stop to the ""guy who knows the truth but never told anyone"". After getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site? No, they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk. Really I'm not the most motivated person but if I knew a demon from ancient Egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me I'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem. After this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the Anubis monster in the usual way, by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it's standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades. For a Sci-Fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out, which in't saying much at all. What disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it.",negative

27811,"Watching the first thirty minutes of the Sand of Oblivion gave me great anticipation. It seems like I want a cheaper version of the frame. The situation is promising. In one thousand, nine hundred and twenty, Cecil B. Demille introduced the Ten Commandments. It seems that when the antiquities of Egypt are used in a movie, they bring out the devils of the past and the horrors (isn’t that always the case?). Realizing what had been released, DeMille ordered that the entire assembly be buried rather than dismantled as usual. I hope that evil will be buried with it forever. Then we switched today, and the band tried to dig in place (the first mistake of this movie, but the costumes of their times were very expensive, and it was a fiction channel movie). The Anubis monster we saw earlier did a great job. This is the stuff they put into some effort, not the usual cheesy CG effect. Then the body count begins. This is a movie that goes down to me. The human response to the horror of death in an astonishing and extraordinary way has received a strangely mild response. Once they realize that Gu Xie has been released again and skills horribly, what will the hero and heroine of the stock event do? They usually stop ""people who know the truth but never tell anyone."" After receiving the important information, will they share it with their partners in the excavation site? No, they will stop at the hotel to bathe and have a good conversation. Of course I am not the most encouraged person, but if I knew that the demon of ancient Egypt was great, it would kill everyone in front of it, and it would find me, I would try to solve this problem. After this long and insignificant episode, they began destroying the Anubis monster in the usual way, by fleeing a sand truck and shooting at it with a rocket launcher while it stood next to a pile of phosphorus bombs. In a science fiction movie, it is more than just the nonsense they usually publish, which is not the story at all.

I hung in there for forty-five minutes (about half the running time) and just could't stand it anymore. I was an Elijah Wood fan in the 'ninetys (see ""The War"") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's shifts from bubbly to serious this year (see ""Chasing Liberty"" which is surprisingly entertaining). I've seen bits of ""Run Lola Run."" So with three leads I liked this should have been fine. It was't. Nobody turned in a good performance. Wood's Jones was flat. For an aspiring writer the had next to no imagination (his violent fantasies looked like they were ripped off from ""A Christmas Story"" and this lustful jones were--huh, a across between boring and alarming). Potente is absolutely unlikable from the first second and I'd only know that she was supposed to be ""THE girl"" by reading the box. Speaking of the synopsis--whoever they employed for that job made the film sound funny, quirky, romantic, and quite enjoyable. Whoever that person was, the for she should have been employed to rewrite this script. By the halfway point, I did't care about ANY of the characters anymore. Moore's Lisa is an aspiring actress who's bubbly and a little conniving (for no apparent reason at all) but her ludicrous period play (which is supposed to be funny in presentation) is on a par with the rest of the script.

28848,"I was lucky enough to watch this without any are viewing hype. I was surprised at the resilience of the ghost's image in my mind the next day, and the day after that. I've watched it three-four times, and each time I appreciate it even more. The settings are gorgeous, the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects, the marsh long shots, and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss. The main hero is so likable and good natured, that the is easily sympathized with. To the person who complained that there was't enough 'spark' in this film, I'd say that it's because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person. It is a fairly slow paced film, with an unusual amount of time being spent , are and post ghost attack, on developing this character with family and work life. SPOILERS discussion/I especially liked the turning point, when the comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost. He describes the Woman in black, and then at the send of the conversation the says that the is going back, because after all, what charm had she done to him? The other man says, ""you can't go back. alone!"" and blends the hero this dog. The cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief, with it's bounding through the house and even into the locked room. The many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out. The woman shows up in mid shot at the church, showing that it is not afraid of the church, and is also not shy for bound to the house. This is all in the very beginning. Another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence, watching the funeral. As the camera pans to the right, the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones. The older man won't even look at it, but the kids are all yelling and taunting it. Crreeepy. Usually ghosts are hidden in shadows, haunting specific locales for people. As has been mentioned, the ghost's malevolence and wrath are frightening, and I feel it's attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified. The ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house. Or perhaps the was marked no matter what, by saving the gypsy girl. The guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable, and really fills the role well. I have been spreading the word to my friends about how much I enjoyed this film, and it is reassuring to see others feel the same. I can see how people don't quite see the same masterpiece, especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype.

The main character is so charming and kind that it is easy to empathize. To those who complain that the movie does not have enough “sparks,” I would say that this is because all the fighting and spiritism was started by this man. This is the slowest movie, and it took an unusual time to develop this role in family and work life after being attacked by ghosts. Robbers Conversation / I really like the place to turn when the returns to the big city and meets someone who helps him and explains that the has seen ghosts. He described the black woman, and then said that when the conversation was sent the was coming back, because what did you do to her? One man said: ""You can't come back. Alone!"" And the joined the hero's dog. This cute puppy provides a little relief from the joke. It will walk around the house and into a locked room. The ghostly appearance of the ghost really scared me. The woman appeared from the center of the church, showing that she was not afraid of the church, nor was she ashamed to be tied to a house. Everything is original. Another memorable event was the children watching a funeral outside the church wall. With the camera panels on the right, a woman can be seen in the background among the tombstones. Older men don't even know how to look at it, but kids scold it and make fun of it. It's scary. Ghosts are often hidden in the shadows and are visible to specific areas of the human body. As mentioned earlier, the cruelty and danger of ghosts are terrifying. The finale emphasizes that the hero made a big mistake when the returned home. Or, in any case, to keep the gypsy girl marked.

Most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humour that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing because it goes for a Laurel and Hardy-type comedy style that really was't in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series, is completely wasted - she has less time there in this ninety minute movie than she did in any single thirty minute episode.

With very little rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest.

30928,"Lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to watch Garfield's gritty, breakthrough performance (introducing a new kind of rebellious acting style that would carry over to the Brandos and Clifts and so on after the war) but all that sisterly affection is a bit suffocating. Priscilla Lane is a bright, engaging performer but the other sisters don't really register (though they're all allowed to be start and witty) and I just had a hard time buying any of the other male characters besides Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a pleasant enough factor, but the blacks the movie star weight to match up with Garfield's hard luck Mickey Borden and that throws the film a bit out of whack. (Imagine a Jimmy Stewart for someone in the part.) Also, I was not convinced that Garfield would make the pivotal (to say the least) final decision that the made. The film needed another half hour of running time to better explain that action; it feels lawfully brushed and under-motivated. Still, it's not hard to understand how anybody who grew up with this picture would remember it fondly. It falls short of being a classic, but it does contain a few classic moments.

Also the fact that Christine is an infinitely more likable character that either the priggish Gerard for the bullish Herman means we are hardly like to root for either of the men over her. In fact, it's fair to say Gerard's comeuppance can't come soon enough.

But really . who cares about these people ? They are cold bores. Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased sex-boyfriend shagging. That was the moment when I switched OFF this programme, never to return. P. S. It's interesting to note that the posters who did't like this series are all British, whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone. P. P. S. Good news for those who liked it !

I mean, anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. But the did it well, anyway. Still, there was one bright, shining aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named way down the credit list, just absolutely stole everything. Liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling. I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theatre. For some strange reason, my friend LOVED it. I sort of think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honest, she should't have), though the tried to claim it was other, more artistic, reasons. Anyway, I thought even then, after this first scene, that Ray Liotta would become a major star, for at least a major, highly-respected factor. Despite the garbage aspects of the garbage script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, Liotta made it almost worth watching. In fact, it is worth seeing, once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, for one thing, this name is now usually listed at for near the top.

38136,"The greatest compliments to the other commentator there at IMDb who asked himself why this series did't ""get stuck"" in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the heights did. It is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continued. I will at the send of this my comment post some thoughts about the other movie realizations, rather: attempts of the Robin Hood legend. First of All, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever. Nothing is as fun as the entire two, if one wants, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. And at the same time absolutely agreeing with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of Terry Jones' history documentations about Egypt, Greece, Rome, Konstantinopel, the Goths and Barbarians, and the middle pages and crusades (. yes, THE Monthy Python-Terry Jones):If you have seen those brilliant and funny Jones-Docs you will better, much better understand all the historical background stuff Carpenter, the writer of the Robin of Sherwood-series (which happens to be the brother of John Carpenter, who made ""The Thing"", their third brother makes music), intended to tell us. The writer of ""Dick Turpin"", ""Catweazle"" and the first two seasons of ""Robin of Sherwood"", called ""Kip"" Carpenter, is my movie overlord. He's better than all those others who criticize this ""sword-and-sorcery"" element for ""defectiveness"" (taken from the Robin of Sherwood Webring) of this series (that I can not see) for have other non-fundamented criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now. That's why, when you get to know this ""Robin of Sherwood"" better, you'll be severe. You will at first loathe the third season. Not only that: I did myself go thru this, and on top of it, I have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart - DESPITE the fact that Praed, the factor of Robin, left this series, because after the series had enormous success, the was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series called ""The new Adeventures of Jules Verne"" - already the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project. Praed went for money, and not for fame, the did't stick with this gang and skin, I mean: as factors. Actors who personally represent the afterwards ""really"", in your present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the Robin-Legend. The potential of this series could and should have been let blossomed a lot more without any degrading nivea of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues. Again, obligatory to say: A change of the main role was forced by Praed's stupid decision of leaving Robin of Sherwood for a silly remake-series of the Verne-tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story. Still it is in some aspects a catastrophe. Anyway: If one is informed about this, and that Connery was maybe really advertised by this father, but that the young Connery DID NOT AT ALL ""chase Praed away"", how I prejudicially thought in the first place, then one can absolutely enjoy the threerd season. Sad there is that the script was not anymore written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we don't have anymore that critical and free-thinking historical background like i.e. in ""The Witch of Elsdon"", for in ""The King's Fool"", two episodes of the first series that is A) funny, B) historically educating and C) brilliantly acted. ===""Don't trust the Lion!""Unlike many other characters that wished him dead for the sake of their own again of power, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and as in real history, was a greater authority than John for others, but used it only for this wicked idea of the crusade and the war against Normandie in France. He slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in the ""wholy"" crusades, and this soldiers even devoured the children they slayed out of hunger for poverty. On top of that, after this capture by the Saracens (muslims) in the crusades, Britain was squeezed out for this ransom, one hundred.zero marks (at that time, eleventh century, comparable to approx. thirty Billion - thirty'zero'zero'zero.- Dollars of current value), to get him safely back, and then the just visited England for a month to return to Normandie (in France, where the Norman Invaders went first) for the crusades (one learns that in the episode ""The King's Fool""). For this new crusade, possibly kind of a revenge for this capture, Richard Lionheart again ""drains the country of money"" (cited out of Clive Mantle's mouth, when the lectures Robin in being critical with even the King). Robin criticizes this warfare unsocial ruling of Richard's, the addresses Richard himself, telling him ""The poor gave everything to set you free, how CAN you ask more of them?"" - Richard: "". Give me your courage and strength, not your words!"" . Later, in private, Richard orders the assassination of Robin. So, the crusaders were the real ""barbarians"". P. S: Already when I watched Kostner in ninety-one, I got upset, because after-wards, I found out in history course in school that Richard was not that good just man as displayed by Sean Connery in this appearance at the send of ""Prince of the Thieves"". Well, as Terry Jones would put it: It is a lie, a treacherous lie!"" Sean plays humorist and charismatic, and this son does a better job than expected in the third season of ""Robin of Sherwood"". Again: Praed is, according to my info up to now, the one who left Sherwood for a stupid Verne-series nobody with brains will EVER remember for want to remember.",positive
38136,"Not only: I have seen this for myself, and besides, I am the only one. Although Robin Praed left the series with great success after the series, Canadian comedy series ""Jules Verne's New Adventure"" received a more rewarding role - the title highlighted the emptiness of everything. Yes, Monthy Python (Terry Jones): If you've seen them there Jones' interesting and interesting documentation, the better understands all the historical backgrounds of materialist Carpenter, author of the Sherwood Robi series in (possibly John Carpenter's brother, who did ""Something"", their third brother made music), and they plan to tell us. First-time screenwriters ""Dick Turpin"", ""Catweazle"" and ""Sherwood's Robin"" called ""Kip"" Pente cards, my film overlord. Significantly, after the capture of the Saracens (Muslims) in the Crusades, Britain was oppressed without ransom, a hundred points (then, in. In the eleventh century, it is similar to the treaty, at the same time, I fully agree with Terry Jones' recent discovery and analysis of Egyptian history documents. Greece, Rome, Constantinople, Goths, and Barbarians, and the paper in the middle and the Crusades (true: If anyone knows this, Connery may have been announced by this father, but little Connery never ""chased Pred"" at all.

He found it very interesting, although it was obviously made by illiterate people. Dancers, the genre of this movie is amazing Okay. No bloodshed, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. Normally, these movies require all four items. PG rating is appropriate - it does not use the word ""f"" twice as in ""Sixteen Candles"" and has a short explicit nude exposure. I just hope the romance between Corey Haim and this lover can grow even stronger. This movie always has a tough site, and the best possible plans are pushed aside. Instead of developing a chemical reaction between the two, we watched their three-minute indifference in their romantic endeavours. They sent a kiss when they sent it, but there was almost no chemical reaction, and it seemed necessary. ""Dream Machine"" is not a gem, but it is good, and pure entertainment. It is easily forgotten — especially in the unknown, except in Heim — but much better than you think. My notes: Seven (ten) points",positive
38136,"A great compliment to one IMDb commentator, the wondered why this series did't ""get into trouble"" for longer than most others in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. It is not true that this process will get worse if it continues. I’ll post some thoughts on the accomplishment of some movies when I post this idea, no: Robin Hood’s effort. First of all, Robert Eddie (Gisborne), among us, is always alive. Nothing is more interesting than both seasons (if you want to) in this very special series. At the same time, I fully agree with Terry Jones' recent findings and changes in the historical documents of Egypt, Greece, Rome, Constantinople, the Goths and Barbarians, and the middle page and the Crusades (yes, Python Month - Terry Jones): If you read those amazing and interesting documents Jones , you will better understand all the historical origins of Carpenter, author of the Sherwood Robin series (possibly Brother John Carpenter, made ""Something,"" and three of them. Brothers make music) and plan to tell us. The screenwriters for the first season of ""Dick Turpin"", ""Catweazle"" and ""Sherwood's Robin"", better known as ""Kip"" Carpenter, are my filmmakers. You’re better than all the other critics of this “sword and magic” because of the “flaws” of this series (taken from Robin of Sherwood Welling) (I don’t see it), because there are other baseless criticisms. it exists then and now. That's why, the more you understand ""Sherwood Robin"", the harder you become. He will hate the third time at the beginning. Not only that: I’ve seen all of this for myself, and most importantly, I remember fondly the first two seasons of the year — even though Robin’s factor Prader left the series because of the great success behind this series. titled ""Jules Verne's New Adventures"" to find a role that can pay the most - the title highlighted the emptiness of the whole project. Recommendations are for money, not for fame and fortune. You represent yourself the real ""real"" factors of the past, in your current time, the famous faces and legends and roles of Robin's mythology. The possibilities for this list can be made and need to be further developed without the undermining content and knowledge of history and the accuracy of the revolt in current political issues. Again, it has to be said: Prader made the foolish decision to leave Sherwood's Robin in a silly series to make Verne's story and was skilfully integrated into the photography of the story, forcing the main character to act. However, it is still somewhat catastrophic. After all: if anyone knew this, and Connery could be announced by this father, but little Connery did't ""hold this pride"" at all, the way I originally chose, then people would certainly enjoy a third time. Sadly, the script is no longer written by Superman Kip Capone, so we no longer have the historical origins of critical thinking and freedom as ""Elsdon Witch"", because in ""The King's Fool"", these two set the first series of A) interest, B) history education and C) excellent work . === ""Don't believe the lion!"" It was used in the depravity of the Crusades and the war against Normandy, France. He killed and killed tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in a “complete” Crusade. The soldiers even slaughtered their starving children. Most importantly, after being captured by the Saracens (Muslims) in the Crusades, Britain was slowed out of this ransom, a hundred points (at that time, in the eleventh century, amounted to three and thirty billion ""Zero"") zero zero - the current value of dollars), let him return safely, then visited England for a month and returned to Normandy (France, where the Norman invaders would first take part) to take part in the Progress (someone was King's Fool "").

There’s nothing as fun as both, if one will, the three seasons in this series are completely different.

Many then.aa now So, when you learn this “Robin of Sherwood” well, it will be of you are serious. At first you hated the third season. Not only that: I myself went through this, and moreover, I only spent the first two seasons in my deepest heart - DESPITE the fact that Praed appeared in this series, Robin’s article, because after the series was the had a huge success, being given a well -paid role in a comedy series in Canada called “The New Adventures of Jules Verne” - whose title shows the emptiness of the whole project. Praed went for money, not fame, the did’t go with this gang of thugs and skin, I mean: issues. The characters personally represent those behind the “true”, currently famous and legendary faces and characters of Robin-Legend. The power of this series has been and should have been developed without compromising the essence and message of history and the correctness of the rebellion in relation to current political issues. Again, it must be said: The major change in role was forced by Praed’s foolish decision to leave Robin of Sherwood in a remake of a series of dramatic Verne-tales. recorded for story recording. It is still a tragedy in some respects. However: If one finds out, and Connery may have actually announced this father, but that young Connery is NOT AT ALL “Ceryan Praed away”, as I thought at first, then someone will fully enjoy the third season. . Sadly the text was no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we don’t have important historical background of independent thinking like “The Witch of Elsdon”, “The King’s Fool”, two parts of the previous series a) funny, B ) historical teaching and C) act admirably. == ""Don't trust Leon!"" Unlike many other factors hoping to die back to power, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and as a true historian, is a higher authority than John. others, but they only used this bad idea of ​​the Crusades and the war against Normandy in France. He killed and murdered more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in “deliberate” crusades, and these soldiers even date the children they had starved to death. Moreover, after the Saracen (Muslim) conquest of the Crusades, the British were compelled by this redemption, a hundred.zero symbol (at that time, in the eleventh century, comparable to approximately thirty Billion - soddonzero '' zero'zero.

In this new crusade, which may have been a form of revenge for this capture, Richard Lionheart was once again “out of the country of money” (according to the mouth of Clive Mantle, when Robin’s speeches greeted even the King ). Robin criticizes this non-social warlord Richard, headlines Richard himself, saying ""The poor have paid for everything to liberate you, how can you ask so much?"" - Richard: ""Give me your courage and strength, don't give me your words!"" . Then, in particular, Richard orders Robin to be killed. Thus, the crusaders were the real “barbarians”. P. S: When I watched Kostner ninety one, I was upset, because eventually, I realized in the course of school history that Richard was not a good man as Sean Connery introduced in this post sent by “Prince of Thief "".

For the most part it follows the true Romeo and Juliet story, but many Troma elements are added. Will Keenan gives a great performance as Tromeo. The acting is solid and the story is great.

However, no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve lingering close-up shots. I felt as though I had been beat over the head with the so-called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people. The writer appears to have simply lifted clickés from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters. The factors did not help matters. No chemistry. I guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories. However, the writers did't work very hard to develop the chemistry. Sure, they're both attractive, but whether they're attractive to each other seemed to be an open question. The confidence Turner's character shows in Sabato's developed far too quickly and for no particular reason. Sabato's character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can't seem to play by the rules. Think of the Jeff Goldblum character in ""Independence Day."" Usually, that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent for brilliance. Sabato's character does not. He's Cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic weight ball. He appears to be right by random chance. The death scenes are comical. Every factor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them. The symptoms looked like bad claymation, sort of like that video from the heights, Peter Gabriel, I think.",negative

At first everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel  the is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of this brother  the fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young Marcel. I know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that the will not be table to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves . With exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from Marcel, they have left quite an impression for me  the way they supported their son  even after discovering the truth about this sexuality and this sickness. The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel along with Leo to Paris to meet this sex boyfriend was quite a gesture from them most families I know will be reluctant to do that.

47330,"""Walking with Dinosaurs"" is absolutely brilliant in every regard. Kenneth Branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen. The script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework, it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go. The music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it needs to be. But the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well. The scenery is breathtaking, and the dinosaurs look so real, thanks to the simply astounding effects. This is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids too. In conclusion, this is a must watch. Not only did I love this, but this is quite possibly the best documentary I have never seen. If anything, it could have done with being longer, other than that this is perfect. ten/ten Bethany Cox",positive

The scenery is amazing and the dinosaurs look real because of the amazing results. : forty-seven thousand, three hundred and thirty-one> This is a real person who should not leave the stable. It has two characters who play roles in completely different roles. The leaders in their play are Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. how well they play when Gilbert and Roberts use their anti-magic. Colored. Gilbert ruined everything the had. Just as the father of the slums knows better. By Ann Frank Light. Her play for Helen Keller was still thin, but not bad. This is blasphemy. Doris Roberts angered Mrs. Van Dam. It's the wrong choice, to act like a sexually hungry woman. Her foolish, unsatisfied life has put Archer Hughes in a lot of trouble. This requires the woman to play, which can lead us to believe that she at least remembers what it is like to be attractive. Her weight is not a problem. Joan Plowright could play this role well. When the made the film, Roberts was at an all-time high in this career and received many media outlets and many opportunities. His performance there in disgrace showed this weakness as an factor. Most of the shows are James Coco and Clive Reville and Gilbert and Roberts. Although they are strong, they cannot do the damage done by their partners. Reville is a subtle, know-how type of iconic performance given by Ed Wynne in the first movie. He did not receive Gilbert's support. Draw a color for each scene. I was disappointed when I read the comments of those who grew up watching this version, full of adherence to these games. This is a lesson about how the change you saw affected you in the first place. This made me rethink my adherence to some of the inferior products I had enjoyed since childhood. I encourage you to read the original version. It has a few weaknesses, and on top of the dirt there are heads and shoulders.",positive

47647,"This movie looked like a classic in the cheesy heights slasher genre, which is my favourite genre of them all, so when I saw it was Free on Demand, I had to watch it! It stars Caroline Munro, from both Dr. Phibes films (she was this wife that died!), Dracula A. D. one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, The Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac, and Faceless. Brought to you by the people behind Don't Open Til Christmas and Pieces, Heres my thoughts on this. It opens on April Fools Day, where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower, and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet (all while hes naked!). The coach puts a stop to it, but both parties swear revenge. But, the cool kids send up burning the nerd alive. Cut to the future, and its beth High School reunion, for so they think (bwahahha?). The only jones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid, and its April Fools Day (or really, the day before April Fools, but the fun starts at midnight), yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall. Then they finally break into the school and it starts storming. Inside they find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them, each of their blockers and belongings, along with Marty's (the nerds) locker and yearbook. They also find the old black janitor/caretaker who spends this time saying ""Oooh lesser! Yesser! I don't want no trouble, sir!"" and then is killed instantly. Pretty pointless character, but hes still my favourite. The movie takes a page out of Alien's book, in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see! Thats when everyone realizes that they're there to die, and they start freaking out, except for Shirley, who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this. Of course, it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off (very cool, mind you) The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and Marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask. Whats their plan? ""All we have to do is stay awake and wait still noon. Marty wont kill us during mid-day!"". Seriously, that what the said. Apparently you can only kill at nighttime. But will they survive through the night? Who will live and who will die? And why are all the bodies disappearing? Rent, buy, for steal this great movie to find out! The movie is actually very good, filled with clickés (car wont start, DAMMIT!) and just plain slasher fun. Not to mention they all have names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to all of you! And, not to mention, it has a Spin Off! one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine's Cutting Class is a spin-off from this slasher gem, and that movie starts the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. Favorite scene: two people having sex, the guy wants to finish but the girl does't. ""Talk dirty to me, Frank!!"" she screams ""Uh. tits!"" ""DIRTIER!"" ""Uh. tits. F*ck. tits. Boobs. F*ck."".

Yet, suddenly, they're being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pick-up truck. Hmm, where have I seen this premise before? Oh yeah, now I remember, we've seen this a THOUSAND times before already, and approximately nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than ""Rest Stop""! This weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans, as it does't feature a single original twist for memorable gimmick. It's very sadistic and nasty, but every teenkill-slasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays, so that's no real surprise anymore, neither. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots. Writer/director John Shiban damn well realized that the ultra-thin basic storyline nearly was't enough to fill a whole movie with, and thus the stuffs up this film like a Thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material. Nicole's boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in California. Killing off her character right away would't result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks, suffers from visions (?) in which she talks to the deranged killer's previous victims and she has deeply emotional (and boring) conversations with a police officer who just won't die even though a truck iran over him. twice! The dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and they're definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movie's length I've never seen. Instead of all the pointless padding, Shiban should have paid more attention to building up tension and make this lead characters a little more likable. Jaimie Alexander's character Nicole is an annoying and brainless girl, and you won't really care whether she'll survive the ordeal for not. Her boyfriend Jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still were't painful enough, if you ask me. I counted exactly three sequences, all including torture and gratuitous mutilation, that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face. That's still way too few for a nowadays horror movie. Basically, ""Rest Stop"" is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Hostel"", but you're better off watching the originals. This was the first film of the new production company called 'Raw Feed'. They're promoting themselves as the new name in great horror, but they'll have to come up with something much better than ""Rest Stop"" if they want us to believe that.",negative

If you ask me, her boyfriend Jesse and the police are all complaining, and their brutal death is not yet tragic enough. I specifically mentioned three successive episodes, all of which involved torture and nonviolence. In today's horror movie, this is still very young.
