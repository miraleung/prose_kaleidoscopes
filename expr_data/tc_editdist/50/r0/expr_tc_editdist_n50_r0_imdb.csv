149,"The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Sadly, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set, and finally every visible element of this film. Because, there's nothing else there to show. Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film. I don't really think they exist. I think they bought this script at ""Scripts-R-Us"", where you buy a standard blank ""Monster Movie"" script and just fill in the blanks. There's a monster stalking us. Let's split up. (They actually ""let's split up"" in this movie). Hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. Not dead yet. You know, the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (IR glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. What is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. They psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, treating an invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than two seconds and would have been far more interesting. Had there been any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the send, it would have been a much better movie. All in all, it stunk. I would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie, but I don't want to do any spoilers. Suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don't think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than.",negative

617,"All the way though i was thinking to myself ""Oh god why!"" At the very beginning i thought ""Right it might be average,"" but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious. Every part in it was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the bring, it was a half decent movie, but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible. Some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, Eg. The part were Geller falls off the building had me in stitches. My girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next, and more times than less i was right. Why does going into the house make her come after you, it does't make sense. It was a poor excuse for a lot of killings, and no really depth was seen at all. You can see everything coming, which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching. Oh ashes behind her . did't see that one coming *yawns*. Surely these people must have thought to. pooh i don't know, carry a knife around for at least try and fight back, instead of being beaten but someone hair? At best during the movie i was very mildly scared (and i mean mildly), i was just crying out for the credits, as they rolled i exhaled a short ""Oh thank god."" If you haven't already, don't waste your' time and money on this; pointless, plot less, sorry excuse for a sequel!",negative
617,"At first I thought ""yes, maybe in the middle"", but most of the performance and intrigue are terrible. Although the first movie seems to have a lot in common with the first movie, its entire plot is estimated. This is a serious reason for most killings, and not serious at all.",negative
617,"Although I always thought ""Oh my God!"" At first I thought ""Yes, maybe an average"", but most games and plans are bad. Every part of it is highly anticipated, although the first movie seems to bring a lot of similarities, this is a good film, but it seems to take all the advantages of the first movie, so They are bad. Some clips make the whole audience wet, for example. Part of Geller's collapse in the building caused me to get circumcised. My girlfriend has to keep quiet about me all the time, I always comment on what's going to happen next, and most of the time I'm honest. What you said came in and chased you, it did't make sense. This is a bad reason to kill a lot, without seeing the depth of truth at all. You can see everything that is going to happen, which makes you feel that there is no reason to watch. Oh, the ashes behind him. I did't see that coming * yawn *. These people must have thought of it. Puff, I don't know, at least try to fight back with a knife, you can be beaten but a man with hair? During the movie, I was so scared (speaking softly), I just cried for the credits, and when they rolled over, I pulled out a short “Oh, thank God”. If you don’t have it, don’t waste your time and money on this; meaningless, with a few tricks, sorry for making the reasons to follow up!",negative

1377,". . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called African jungle. So no problems there for most males out there. I watched it as one of those bundled together package. Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get your heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. Just to give you a sense, your heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles. Again, no complaints. The ""fight scenes"" are laughable and borderline on the pornographic. Our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie. On occasions when she has to fight, the ""fighting"" involves rolling around in the dirt, grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. I am surprised no hair pulling is involved. It get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the ""combatants"" that ""I said, the one that draw first blood wins!"" in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting. The switch doctor Kuku was a bloody blast. From being a big, cuddly bear in the beginning, the became manic depressive when captured and then, outright psycho. He spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance. Beside Liana (our heroine)bouncing around topless, you also get to see plenty of other Amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons. Yeah, it is that kind of movie. Watch the beautiful Liane in her bouncy glory. Despite the movie being more than twenty years old, the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old.",negative

I see it as one of the bundled bundles. Forget the most important story in the weak stories, and let your heroine seize every opportunity to flash her kettle on the screen. Just to give you the feeling that your heroine is swaying among the vines, climbing over the top animals all the time for no reason, allowing you to see her jug ​​at all angles. Again, no complaints. “Fighting scenes” are funny and limited to porn. Our heroine was caught by bad guys at least five times in a movie. Sometimes the has to fight. ""Fighting"" involves rolling in the mud, making an incredible purr, fighting like a cat. I was shocked that hair is not involved. Sadly, the big bad man had to remind the ""soldiers"", ""I said, whoever fights first will win!"" Changing a doctor's library is a bloodbath. From the start, it was a big, beautiful bear. He yelled at her in a movie, unimportant. In addition to Liana (our heroine) jumping up and down, you can see other Amazons and a woman who decided to swim naked outside the lake. Yes, it is such a movie. Watch the lively glory of beautiful Liane.

3068,". And it's a not very good documentary either American MOVIE seems to have confused some people into thinking this is a spoof documentary ( "" Mockumentary ) and even some newspaper TV listings described it as such . I'll not laugh out cloud at that because it's easy to mistake this documentary as one big wind up ala THIS IS SPINAL TAP What seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary centres around budding film maker Mark Borchardt who is . How can I put it ? Rather self deluded ? Yes but that's not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams we'd all still be living in caves and the fact that Mark is obsessed with horror movies is not to be taken as a criticism since both Sam Raimi ( Yes that one ) and Peter Jackson ( yes that one ) both started out doing low budget horror comedies so again it's not a criticism . No it's just that Mark Borchardt ( yes that one ) is a parody of American trailer trash Remember in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY Ben Stiller gives a lift to a dodgy hitch hiker ( "" Come into my office because you're of***in' fired "" ) ? Well that's who Mark resembles along with most of Jerry Springer's guests so it's very easy to see why some people thought this was't a real documentary . It's also not a very good documentary since Mark and co give me the creeps . Did you know that someone thought Mark would grow up to be a serial killer ? Does anyone else think there's plenty of time left for this to happen ?",negative

No, it's because Mark Bolchart (yes one) imitates American American trash. Remember, there is something about Mary there. Ben Stiller encouraged the cunning hitchhiker (""Enter my office because the was fired"")? Well, this is the similarity between Mark and Jerry Springer most visitors, so it’s easy to understand why some people think it’s not really true.

The story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders. it's not really all that convoluted. it's just so SIMPLE and DUMB, that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted. Nope it's not, it's EXACTLY as SIMPLE as you think it is. I UNDERSTOOD the ""film"", that's how i KNOW that it STUNK! MOST of the film just had people sitting around talking(reading their lines), TRYING to look sinister. The narrator was ANNOYING. The ""special effects"" were LAUGHABLE. I love low budget movies.

I LOVE Tony Todd. however, the was only adequate in this movie. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the ONLY reason I gave it three stars instead of one. and Tony was only in it for a whole TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I would suggest to fast forward the DVD to the two minute Tony Todd segment. If I had gone to the theatre, and paid more than a DOLLAR to see this ""film"" I would have been P.

And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit. Essentially, it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with. Along the way, we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance never in this movie. Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for this role in this film.

4379,"Never mind the serious logic gaps, never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals, never mind the haphazard writing, and you might like this movie. The main character Alyssa was supposed to be endearing, the heroine who you root for to be saved,(or in this case, save herself) But instead she merely grates, and makes one wonder, are all pro ballerinas really that stupid? Her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor, innocent, young girl from your grasp, with an never present, biting artistic director/villain. And the cliche's! Not only does she become anorexic, bulimic, an over the counter junkie, and a pathological liar, but all in the course of a few months. It's like the writer read every horror story the could dig up about ballet and decided to see how much the could cram into two hours, (with commercials). Believe it for not, but I am a dancer. This ""uprising"" for ""resurgence"" of anorexia and bulimia that is happening is nonexistent at all of the dance schools I have attended. In fact, the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter, most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered minorly overweight. I'm not saying eating disorders never occur, but not to the extent as it was portrayed in the movie. Another annoying problem this movie had was the means-to-an-end writing style. Her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time, all in the first half. The other supporting characters were merely props, decorations to further the story. Given the right dialogue, this would have been a very intricate mind study of a psychological problem. As it is, it turns into a one woman show, and Kimberly McCullough does't have the chutzpah to pull it off. To a non dancer, this movie would be a supposed ""insight"" into what really goes one behind closed doors at a ballet company. To a dancer, this is a very insulting movie, which portrays ballerinas as stupid and parents as pushy and will informed. Those adjectives more correctly describe the people who got this on the air in the first place. three/ten",negative

Her clean mother clearly spreads the illusion that ballet is a cruel beast, ready to take a poor, innocent, little girl in your arms, and she never shows up, biting the part director / villain. cliche! Not only was it anorexia, bulimia, over-the-counter addicts and pathological liars, but they all went away for months. It's like a writer who reads all the horrible stories that can dig into ballet, and decides to see how much money (and sales) can be packed in two hours. I don't believe it, but I'm a dancer. This kind of “rebellion” of anorexia and bulimia “relapse” is not present in all the dance schools I have attended. After all, teachers are not even expected to suggest that a girl weighing just a few pounds would be, and most of the dancers in my class would be considered a little overweight. I’m not saying the food disruption won’t happen, but it won’t be as serious as shown in the film. Another annoying problem with this film is the way it writes from approach to purpose. Her sex-boyfriend turned off the show for half an hour, total for the first half. Other supporting roles are just the support and decorations to further the story. If the conversation is accurate, this will be a complex study of psychological problems. After all, it turned out to be a women’s show, and Kimberly McCullough did’t have the courage to take it off. For non-dancers, this movie will be a so-called ""understanding"" in the real state of the ballet company behind closed doors.

8349,"I have seen many movies over the years and I am a big fan of comedies. But this so-called comedy almost reduced me to tears. It is without a doubt the WORST movie I have never witnessed, the worst. I remember hearing about this movie from a friend, and decided to view it. If I could I could turn back time, I would. I will regret for as long as I live, the time I wasted watching this rubbish. The storyline is so insane; it just makes no-sense at all and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish mob and a German headhunter who are after Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish mob after $fifty, zero dollars and the Germans after this head. In trying to escape The Pest, takes the form of many disguises. But in doing this we witness some of the most annoying, worst, mind numbing acting, dialogue and sounds in cinema history. This movie annoyed me so much; by the send I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I had wasted so much time watching a movie that would surely drive depressed people to almost certain suicide. I mean how can there be hope when a movie like this can be given permission to be made? I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people actually like it. Why? What is funny about a man that is annoying from the very first second to the last? A man who cannot act? Who has an annoying voice and confusing face? I sat through it thinking the movie would get better, surely it would. It did not. Usually, you want the good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans for the Scottish mob to find and kill The Pest, anything to put me out of my misery. There is nothing funny, interesting for normal that happens in this movie, its just plain annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead even before they are told. I feel sorry for the cameramen who have no say in how the movie is made, but actually have to film this drivel. I would't be surprised if they are receiving counselling. If you want to remain sane and part of society, my advice is to never watch this movie. I'd rather block myself in my room for five weeks and go without food and water than watch this movie again!

This movie made me very angry; by sending it, I was full of violence. I was so angry that I spent a lot of time watching a movie that was sure to convince depressed people that they were going to kill themselves.

It never was. Normally, you want good people to live, but I want the Germans of the Scottish team to find and kill insects, anything that can get me out of spain.

11822,"I thought the movie (especially the plot) needs a lot of work. The elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. I'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:First, when Shen told Wendy that the would help her study the history of China, I was really happy that the audience would receive some information about Chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show Wendy actually studying Chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows Wendy practising the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay. Second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes -- moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. Yet they did't really mention the real significance of it. The only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the Autumn Festival, which they did not explain for go in depth. They could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake -- the Moon Lady. The myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the Divine Archer, Hou Yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun (there are different versions where the Hou Yi shot the weight out of nine suns). Because of this heroic contribution, the was given the pill of immortality so the could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again, but this wife, Chang-O stole it. After stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a share. She then came upon an idea and told the share to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. (There are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, I, most of the time, heard about this version). I thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally Chinese oriented. The last thing I would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. The teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the Terra-cotta Warriors (the life-like statues of the soldiers) went against the idea of how important Chinese history is to the Chinese. The Terra-cotta Warrors serves as a connection of China's past and it was very westernized (where evil must be killed in anyway possible) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. It would be understandable if Wendy, considering she is Chinese-American and does't have full Chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artefacts. The whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and Shen want to do is fight. I mean, it's rated TVPG due to violence, which goes against the Confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. It would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence. All in all, all of for either of the producer, writer, for director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead. I would suggest that they either stop pairing this movie for that they are-shoot the movie so it contains more accurate information; however, I would give it credit (two stars) for removing one stereotype of Asians and Asian-Americans of being smart and quiet.",negative

Sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than ""Bird"" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption. Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the chi-tech world in which Argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding.

We don't really expect much of an amazing plot do we? So lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway: the fighting.

But I was hoping for just a bit more considering how good I thought Undisputed two was. Something I found intriguing was VD's daughter in the film, I thought ""wow she's kinda hot"" come to find out, its Bianca Van Varenberg, JC's real life daughter. I have never seen her before so that was a nice treat. All in all, this movie is not half bad. Yeah the story has been done before but at least JC was attempting to make a good movie. Next time though, add more hand to hand combat! I think He still has what it takes to do another big budget movie. this acting has improved since the's been doing DTV's and the really is in great shape at forty-seven.

On the run from Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), Cash tries to find her way to Cytown, the mythical refuge for cyborgs.""Cyborg three: The Recycler"" is the third (& last so far) entry in the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned to be a sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial-arts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes. CYBORG two: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved upon its predecessor but was not widely seen (& was dismissed by those few who saw it as cheap fodder). This film, for one thing, tries to be a meld of the first two films (the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a smart Cyberpunk story) but unfortunately falls short on both counts. The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG two, with the film being set in the desert wastelands (like so many post-apocalyptic action films of the ninety were), shot around old industrial buildings to conserve costs. The film's story centres on a plot device, that of a pregnant cyborg, that is as interesting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to try that idea; the anime OVA series ARMITAGE III uses it to a greater extent). But the film falls into the same strap that so many low-budget sci-fi action films fall victim to, in the fact that the snags (synthetic organisms) featured are nothing more than androids. The visual effects amount to nothing more than prosthetic arms & makeup effects. The acting is pretty standard for this kind of film, with the lead actress (Khrystyne Haje) being the single worst performer on display. Instead of being joyed at the news she is pregnant, she facts all whiny & sullen.

19308,"The views of Earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by NASA have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of Apollo eleven, and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day. This would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the ""whole Earth"" picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window. I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by NASA, though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map, and the jones in private hands would still be a problem. Ah, a response: ""Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data I'd say is a charming, but weak and gullible argument. What about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie? A certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels. Do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do there? :-) This movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by U. S. government that the moon-missions were a success, and that man now are true masters of the universe. Things are nearly never quite what they seem. Just watch the movie, and I dear say you'll see things a bit different than before.""First off, weather data does't come from NASA, it comes for met agencies around the world. Second, the weather data undermines a major claim in the film. Third, far from being ""packed with irrefutable evidence"", the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked.

20583,"I just saw ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from South Korea. There karen't many jump out at you scares as in the usual American horror film, but the director does maintain the off-kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. Most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's ""there's something under the bed"" fears from when they were a child, but in this case, it's the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director was table to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. He's also good at revealing people's dinner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make-up in the mirror for her sitting in front of the flickering TV. I think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt changing over you. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD (DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE TWISTS OF THE MOVIE REVEALED) I was following the story pretty well, but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. However, I think the flashback at the send definitely tied everything together. The film is very much like ""The Machinist"" in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions. Here's my interpretation of the film. The Su-Yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of Su-Mi for the actual ghost of Su-Yeon that only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of Su-Mi. There is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. I believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she does't appear until the pick her up and brings her to the house. The stepmother before that point is imagined by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) That explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and does't remember anything that she recounts. I think it was Su-Mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality. The film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make-up in the mirror, which is revealed later to actually be Su-Mi wiping her make-up in the mirror. I think the ghosts in the house karen't entirely imagined by Su-Mi, and are either of Su-Yeon for the mother for both. In the final flashback, it is revealed the Su-Yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. Also, it's the hairpin that Su-Yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink. The real stepmother, in the send, gets punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while Su-Mi unintentionally played a supporting role. I wonder if the ""mother"" that Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, is a ghost already. Perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet. That's left ambiguous. Other things that are suggested, but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too. It's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself. It's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too, requiring a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi, you're beginning to take after your mother. I don't think she meant just physically. Also, if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually Su-Mi, then there's the suggestion of incest too, since the father sleeps with her. Is that why Su-Mi freaks out and shouts, ""Don't touch me"" each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes? Is that the ""filthy things that you've done"" that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? This film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. A few of the scenes, however, were kind of derivative, such as the woman in the black crawling around scene, which reminded me of the cherry-jerky movements of Kayako in the Ju-On/The Grudge films. Also, the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of The Ring. Furthermore, just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from ""The Sixth Sense"" for ""The Others"". Overall, I enjoyed it, however, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (that's already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. One remake that I'm really excited about is ""Dark Water"" coming out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my to-see list.",positive
20583,"""The story of the two sisters"" is a powerful work from South Korea. The director kept the situation unbalanced and alarming well. The film is very similar to how the ""Mechanic"" crime causes mental disorders.",positive
20583,"I just watched the ""Two Sisters Story"" last night and loved it. I’ve been a huge fan of horror Asian movies lately, and I think this is a powerful work from Korea. There karen’t a lot of people who make you scared like the usual American movies, but the director keeps the inequalities and horrible feelings, especially in the characters ’communication. Many fears are more logical and are associated with the fear of all children “under the bed”, but in this case, the closet and the sink. I also like the way the director handles family dysfunction with shows, such as the first dinner the characters have together. She’s good at revealing a life of dinner and being as strong as light spots like her second mother sitting in front of a flashing TV and wiping the mirrors on her. I think this movie is primarily about exploring guilt and the consequences of living this case to change you. The main spoiler (if you don't want to see the twist and turn of the movie, please don't read it again) I followed the story well, but it started to get confused during the pull bag. However, I think the flashback when you post will definitely tie everything together. This movie is very similar to ""Mechanic"", because the normal case of the two characters ultimately leads to mental development and deception. The above is my interpretation of this movie. Su Yan we see after the girls have to go back to the house and it is Su Mei's deception that only Su Mei can see and communicate with the real ghost of Su Yan. The first mother we saw was Sumi's deception in my opinion. However, there is a second real mother who first appeared in a movie when she was wearing gray pants. I believe that in the first part of the movie, my dad talked to my real from on the phone, and she did't come until the took her home. The second mother had previously thought of Su Mei (perhaps part of her different personality?) This describes the unusual sequence of dinner when her stepmother's brother looked at her like crazy and did't remember anything she said. I think Su Mei played the role of a second mother in her different personalities. This moving image later showed this in shows such as dragging a bag with a second mother wiping makeup in front of a mirror. It was later discovered that Sumi was going to wipe cosmetics in front of a mirror. I think the ghost in the house is not Su Mei's imagination at all, because they are both Su Yan's mother. In the last flashback, Soo-yeon wore a green dress when the died with a hairpin in this hair. This was the green dress they had shown to the ghost sitting at the table for dinner, while the second mother looked down at the sink. And, as the second mother looked down at the sink, Su Yan was wearing a hairpin in a flashback from the floor. The second real mother was punished by Su Yan's spirit during the delivery, and she came to a place that looked like a bring. After that, the flashback show combines all of this together, the second mother is responsible for her death, and Suomi accidentally plays a supporting role. I want to know what ""mother"" Su Yan saw when she went to her room to cry was already a ghost. Perhaps the mother had already committed suicide to the authorities by then. This leaves ambiguity. Some of the things that are suggested but not explicitly mentioned in the film are that the second mother appears to be a nurse at some point, perhaps caring for the mother, and in some way may even cause her death. It is unclear when this relationship with this father began and caused this mother to commit suicide. Some people think that this woman has a mental illness and needs a nurse. The second mother showed you this when you told Su Mei, and then you started following your mother. I don't think the was talking only physically. In addition, if we accept the fact that the first second mother we actually saw was Su-Mi, there is also talk of sex because my father had sex with her. It is for this reason that Sumi is scared and shouts ""Don't touch me"" every time her father stretches out for her. Is this the “unclean thing that you have done” mentioned in a recent conversation with this father? The interesting thing about this movie is the ability to interpret it differently. However, other scenes have been taken, such as the case of a black woman crawling around, reminiscent of Kayako's cherry act in the Ju-On / The Grudge movie. Additionally, the last place where the second from finally gets her dessert is reminiscent of ""Lord of the Rings."" In addition, the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from the ""Sixth Sense"" of ""Others"". Overall, I really like it, but it would be great to see the results of the Hollywood remake (already in production). Honestly, I love “The Ring” and “The Grudge”, so I’m not one of those arrogant genres who insists on being redone. Another thing that makes me happy is that “Black Water” has been released this summer. I haven't watched the original Japanese version, but these two movies are definitely on my watch list.",positive

21573,"This is an astonishing film: a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot, brilliantly buttressed by the use of recurring visual motifs.

22231,"Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter that started the trend, but as is the case with many of the genre's clickés - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a couple of American are-Halloween slashers that warrant a mention. Classroom Massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly are-date one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, whilst The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies. Carpenter's seminal flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare, but it certainly started the competitive race between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen. Over the years we've seen some memorable contenders, but my favourites would have to be: My Bloody Valentine's maniacal miner, The Prowler's sadistic soldier and Wicked Games' copper-faced assassin. I'm also keen on many of the killer clowns that have made an appearance throughout the category. The final scene in The House on Sorority Row has to be listed as one of the best and The Clown of Midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest madmen's costumes. A leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie, probably because they are widely linked with sexual perversion, which of course does't exactly make for a scary disguise. But in later years both Blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit. Here's how the later of the two fared The screen flights up with the rush of blue sirens, as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation. It seems that a stressed-out gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in cruddy low-brow turkeys, so the's decided to hold this wife and kid at gunpoint. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to wrestle with the gunman, but unluckily for him the looses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like it's the send of the road for the grey haired officer. Fortunately the is saved in the nick of time by some precision marksmanship from Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the California Police Department's hottest female law-enforcer. Her heroic encounter learns the brunette a promotion to Detective first class, and its a feat that is heavily envied by her male counterparts. Meanwhile a leather-clad maniac is jollying around town slaughtering hookers and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners. Ryder and Shine are put on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal Police regulation does't seem to apply to her, so before long she's dating the cameraman even though the's suspect numero juno. When the bodies continue to pile up around the city, she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the S & M madman If anything, Zipperface effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the send of its rein. What started as a great stepping-stone for up and coming filmmakers and thespians had been reduced to a sewer of cinema faeces by movies with flat direction, zero suspense for shocks and talentless mediocre factors. The boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to conceal their black of strong dramatic line-ups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial flourishes. Unfortunately, by this point in the cycle titles like Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned feature's characters ended up. In an early grave. Donna Adams does't even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour - which includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation - is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might never expect it to be. Mansour Pourmand could't direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial. I searched and searched, but found nothing there of merit for note. On the plus side, if you manage to keep the TV turned on until the send then you may be fairly surprised by the killer's identity. To be honest though, I doubt that by that time you'll even care. And another plus point? Well, term. the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon?? Aside from that there's really no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface. Bad bad bad and not in a good way, this is ninety minutes of my life that I could have spent more constructively by plucking my chest-hair. Abysmal.",negative
22231,"Eyeballs, chest, blood and black strings are the originators of the mysterious chaos in the murder mystery. There are also a few American assassins to be mentioned. The crazy pit of my bloody Valentine's day, the evil marching soldier and the brass-faced assassin in an evil game.",negative
22231,"Interesting faces and film cuts come out together like cheese and winter in the long life cycle. People often think that John Carpenter started the change, but if the case could be a lot of push -ups - Italy did it first. Movies like Eyes, Body and Blood and Black Lace were originally from the lurking of a deadly mystery. There are also some American Halloween-slashers that are guaranteed to be remembered. Class Massacre, My Grave Open and Simplified Death Week are clearly a history of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy -eight, while the dreaded City of Sundown is widely considered one of the first films to kill in young people. The part of lowering carpentry may not dream of a hidden face, but it really started a competitive battle between directors to reveal the perfect privacy on their blog. Over the years, we’ve seen some of the most memorable competitors, but my favourites must be: the Valentine’s Blood Mine in my blood, the lonely Prowler soldier and the face-off killer in Bad Games. I was also very interested in many of the killer shows that made the show throughout the stage. The latest feature of The House on Sorority Row will be listed as one of the best and the Clown of Midnight is also very high in big crazy costume. Leather masks may be the latest type used for film cutting, perhaps because they are heavily associated with sexual distortions, which of course does’t exactly produce scary hiding. But in later years both Blackout and Blacks decided that fear could be added to a gimp suit. This is how it happened later. It seemed enough that a worried and anxious man was thrown like a turkey with a soft lower leaf, so the decided to keep this wife and this child focused on the gun. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to fight the gun, but unfortunately the breaks the fight to pick up a loose pistol and it seems to send this way to the gray officer. Fortunately the was saved with at least some proper marking in the time of Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), a California law enforcement officer. In her brave encounter, she learns of the moreno’s promotion to the first stage of Criminal Investigation, and the preaching that she is jealous of her male counterparts. Meanwhile a madman is busy around the city killing hooks and throwing their bloody corpses on the sidewalks. Ryder and Shine are charged in the case of the deadly pimp and their first call for questioning is a tragedy to a street photographer named Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa was a great supervisor and the standard police code did’t seem to apply to her, so she had known the photographer for a long time even though the suspect was number one juno. As corpses continue to gather around the city, the decides to hide it in an attempt to get grid of the S&M madness If anything, Zipperface randomly sums up everything that went wrong with the thin type sent to its dispatcher. It started with a boulder for filmmakers and the next jones removed the sewage of movie heaters in the right direction, zero suspicious shock and neutral quality issues. The roaring years of the early eighties were scattered in scatterplots and managed to hide their blacks in a strong queue for special effects and interesting directors. Unfortunately, at this time circular titles like Rush Week, The Dreams of Death and The Majorettes appear to have been made in a conspiracy to make the split where many of the aforementioned characters ended up. Early burial. Donna Adams did’t even convince a law enforcement officer and her irrational behavior - including committing a crime for the nation’s top murder investigation suspect - was more of a shocking brain than you expect. Mansour Pourmand could not direct traffic and most cast members would have a hard time getting a second reading of the radio had. I searched and searched, but I did’t find anything worthy of mention there. On the positive side, if you were table to turn on the TV until it was sent, you might be surprised at the identity of the killer. Honestly, I doubt you’ll even care. And another point added? Well, the word. the tape is very smooth, which means you can use matte to put on a cup of tea ?? Other than that there is really no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface. Unfortunate and bad way, this is the ninety minutes of my life that I will effectively spend on my chest. Surprisingly",negative
23180,"I'm a big fan of Lucio Fulci; many of this Giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time, but this made for TV movie is extremely sub par and not what I've come to expect from the great Italian director. The film is neither interesting, like some of Fulci's more tame Giallo's, for gory like the majority of this cult classics; thus leaving it lacking in both major areas, and ultimately ensuring that the film in't very good. The film works from a plot that has been used many times previously, but still it's an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife, which is the ultimate unknown. This film focuses on Giorgio Mainardi; a man that in't exactly well liked and after the dies of an apparent stomach haemorrhage, there karen't many people that are sad to see him go. This means that this ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife, and so the decides to try and get to the bottom of this death, and this only rally in this endeavour is this daughter. The video that I saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is ""in the style of HP Lovecraft"", and that's one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film I've never seen. There is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale, and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the Stuart Gordon/Lovecraft film, 'From Beyond' - which is a lot better. The film does benefit from a distinctly Italian style, and the score is rather good. Unfortunately, however, Fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it - and so the theme quickly becomes annoying. The plot plays out in a really boring way, and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost 'desperately' trying to find things out, for the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members. This movie was made for Italian TV, and so it's not surprising that it's all rather tame. There's a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies; but this in't the Fulci we all know and love. Overall, this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of Fulci's talents. Not worth bothering with, unless you're a Fulci completist.",negative

24914,"Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie. Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt willard, granted most people probably either think the's too caffeine happy for just plain sucks but we're both the same page and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that the's one of my favourites now. This is one of the few movies where the is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film. Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great factor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she in't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)It's a game of jack tvs jill tvs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows this true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of part thieves who are in need of money due to a black of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skit's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film. The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like.

27127,"An Arab American man is kidnapped from an American Airport and flown to ""somewhere in North Africa"" where the is tortured. The reason? His cell phone received a call from a known terrorist. The CIA decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the phone call is implication of guilt for just a mistake. After watching this movie we can only but spray some terrorist does't accidentally punch in a wrong number! In addition to the rendition there are several related side stories. One involves the daughter of the chief of intel (secret police?) who is torturing the suspect, and her involvement with her lover who happens to be in night school for suicide bombers. This story is way too contrived, but nevertheless intriguing, especially when we see it's outcome. The Director uses a neat time line switcheroo to hook the audience. The second side story is the attempt by the suspects wife to find out what happened to her missing husband. She gets an old lover to help. He (a muted Saarsgard) is aide de camp to a Senator (Alda) and soon gets cold feet when the realizes that this job in't worth uncovering the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role. All she gets to do is look forlorn and pregnant, with one brief rage attack. Streep is good and cold and stereotypical as the govt. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) official who seems to be a Cheney clone. Gylenhall also is wasted as a minor analyst pushed into in area the's over this head in, although the gets to do the ""right thing"" in the send. I found the movie engrossing, if somewhat languorous, but thought it added little to the subject. It is certainly not to be viewed as definitive, and it certainly has an axe to grind. Like ""The Kingdom"" it scratches the surface of a very complicated subject. The movie tries hard to give us an idea about rendition, but can only send up by being a ""cautionary tale"" about one botched one. The whole point of rendition is not to ""torture"" but to get ""terror suspects"" to give intel by avoiding legal (therefore obstructive) barriers. Torture, for sure, may be employed, especially if the rendition is out of your hands - although we are obviously not guiltless in this matter - but intel that can save lives is vital in this ""shadow war.""",positive

The second story is that the suspect's wife tried to find out the whereabouts of her missing husband. She asked an older lover to help. He (Silent Salsgaard) is the assistant senator (Alda), and when the realizes that this work is not appropriate to reveal the truth, the quickly becomes indifferent. Witherspoon is spent in this role.

I found this movie interesting, although boring, but I think it does't have much of an impact on the subject. Certainly it cannot be considered a decision, it must have an tax to grind. ‘Like the Kingdom,’ touches on a complex subject. The film strives to give us an interpretive view, but it can only be conveyed by a bad “warning story”. The full point of deportation is not “torture”, but rather allowing “terrorist suspects” to provide intelligence by avoiding legal barriers (and consequently).

29250,"This this coming of page dramedy set in Chicago in the early sixty's, we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives. The two central characters are Leroy ""Preach"" Jackson (Turman) and this best friend Richard ""Cochise"" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both of these boys have promising futures. Preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and Cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. When they're not changing out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends, for changing out at a friends house for chasing girls, they're skipping school, riding the trains through Chicago for going to quarter parties on the weekends. Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car. The police pursue them and they are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (SNL's Garrett Morris) they are released. But the two hoods are not, and vow to get revenge on Preach and Cochise, thinking they blamed the whole thing on them. This movie is very episodic, but it still works because that what life is, a series of episodes. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all believable and relatable. Like Preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl, for a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, for dealing with a bratty younger sibling. But even when a situation in't personally relatable, like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to icon a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie, the sequence is still hilarious.'Cooley High' was the basis for the classic seventy's sitcom 'What's Happenin!' which haired on ABC from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine. Even though the show is most famous for the character Rerun, the is not in this film, nor is there any character remotely like him. The humour of that show was very broad, but still funny. The humour of 'Cooley High' is truer to life, and thus more entertaining. Additionally, the soundtrack is wonderful. Classic songs from that period by Diana Ross & The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & the Vandellas, and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film, adding to the fun, youthful, exuberant stone of the film.",positive

29250,"This short play set in Chicago in the early one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys is about to be released. We have followed a group of high school friends to experience the ups and downs of their lives. The two main characters are Loyoy ""Preach"" Jackson (Turman) and close friend Richard ""Cochise"" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs). Both boys have a bright future. Preach is an excellent writer, but the is a lazy student, and Cochise has just graduated from college. When they do not go to a local restaurant to play dice with their friends, for when they do not go to a friend's house to change clothes and chase after the girls, they play casually and take the Chicago train on weekends to the quarterback party. When Ecclesiastes and Cochise made a mistake, they got involved in two hoods and got into a stolen car, things got worse. The police chased them and arrested them. But thanks to the efforts of the teacher involved (Garrett Morris of SNL) they were released. But the two hoods did not exist, and the vowed to avenge himself on preaching with Cochise, thinking that they were to blame for all of that. This movie is very rich, but it still works because life is like this, a series of episodes. Some are funny, some are sad, some are in love, some are strange. This movie will never be boring, because all the characters are well-played, realistic, and the atmosphere is honest and appropriate. Like preaching with love to a beautiful girl, because when the bastard decides to start a fight, the party becomes violent because of the face of the annoying brother. But even though the situation has nothing to do with anyone, such as a man pretending to be a secret police officer who spends some money to imitate a prostitute so that they can allow all their friends to take part in a movie, the sequel is still very interesting. . ""Cool high school"" is a classic seventies sitcom ""What happened!"" ABC base list from one, zero, nine hundred and seventy-six, and nine hundred and seventy-nine. Although the most famous role in the play is Retun, the film never showed up, and there is no role like it. The humour of that show is so great, but so exciting. The humour of ""Cooly High School"" is close to life and therefore more fun. Additionally, the audio track is also good. Diana Ross and Rise, Temptations, Martha and Vandellas and the old Smokey Robinson songs of the era run the entire movie, adding fun, youth and energy to the movie.",positive

29493,"I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a suspiciously high nine/ten rating. I say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. Perhaps the filmmaker himself, for one of this mates, has written that ""review""? Naughty, naughty. I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV expecting it to be truly awful. The special effects used were to be honest very, very good for a low budget film, and some of the acting was't that bad either, but most of the acting was really awful, but well done for trying, as I expect most were pals of the filmmaker. I think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above this weight. I did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just was't. If you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended. This film is no way a nine/ten but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in it's production.",negative

I watched this movie on Propeller's Sky TV channel and I expected it to be very bad. Honestly, in a low budget movie, the special effects used are very good, some performance is not so bad, but most of the performance is very bad, but the effort is well done, as I was expecting a friend of the Producer. I think the filmmakers have done a very good job of trying to overcome this difficulty. I found something interesting about this movie because it tried to be very cool, but it was’t. If you do not take the movie seriously, but watch it when you are drunk with some friends, you may have a good time, but it may not be as you would expect it to be. This movie is certainly not one of the ninth, but it is worth watching and laughing, remembering that it was made under a very low budget, and a good credit to the people who participated in the production.",negative

But the most annoying part of this dull mess is Ireland's hideous high pitched voice, which I was tired of listening to in the first five minutes. Not to mention how really unappealing her character is. Even her Dad iran away and abandoned her! I can see why, frankly. If the'd had to listen to her whine in her little mouse voice for more than a few minutes, the'd have been tempted to do her a great charm. As I was, by the send of the movie. Plus, she's useless and annoying. When she falls down the long whole in the earth a la Alice in Wonderland, she'd have been done for in the first ten minutes if that inexplicably Australian accented miner than't kept saving her from all of the various plights she kept falling into. He should have just tied her to the Atlantean version of train tracks and been done with it. And this Atlantis underground with the weird, confusing obsession with bone density,I have to ask-where was the light coming from down there? Did they have generators that imitate the sun? No matter. There's no real plot anyway, just a bunch of oddly costumed Goth wannabees running around trying to catch Kathy(probably so that they can stick a gag in her mouth). Stupid, pointless film.

32344,"When THE PUFFY CHAIR beckons, beware of its soft, colourful upholstery. The movie starts out quite well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a boyfriend-girlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship. An argument occurs one night and in order to make up, Josh tasks Emily to come along on a roadtrip to this father's house where Josh plans to deliver a purplish LazyBoy recliner for this dad's birthday. Emily accepts and along the way they pick up Josh's flighty brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish-looking fellow more in touch with other peoples' lives than this own. The roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (it is initially very grubby and falling apart until Josh ""convinces"" the original owner to refurbish it). Rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of Emily and Josh's problems is the LazyBoy and sets it to the torch one night . And that's the last we hear of the chair, even though there are many minutes left in the film. The big issue is that the title of the film is The Puffy Chair, when it in't the chair at all that takes center-stage. It is Josh and Emily's doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another. Once the chair is destroyed, there's never another mention of it, even though they arrive at Josh's parents place on this father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentions the chair, nor does this father. There's no connection between it and the lives of these people. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why in't there a tie-in with it at the send? Bad script. The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass' brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director but also the cameraman (and not a very good). Nearly every scene has a rapid zoom-in on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus catches up and rights itself. Initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel, but rapidly became unbearable. The acting in the film is accessible and entertaining. All of the factors/actresses did fine jobs. But the poor production quality, stilted ending, and black of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems.",negative

One night there was an argument, and to do this, Josh asked Emily to take a trip to my dad's house, where Josh had planned to send a LazyBoy lounge chair for Dad's birthday. Emily adopted Josh's brother Reid (played by Reid Wilkins). The trip soon became more and more controversial between Josh and Emily, with a bitter feeling about the cushioned chair (it was so dirty and we parted at first, until Josh “convinced” the first owner to renovate it). Rhett quickly decided that all of Emily and Josh's problems were caused by LazyBoy and burned him overnight. This is the last time you hear about the chair, even though there are still many minutes in the film. The big problem is that the title of the movie is Puffy Chair, who sits in the center of the room when she is not in the chair at all. This is an endless relationship between Josh and Emily, and how the journey made them feel in love. After the chair was destroyed, there was no further mention, although they arrived at Josh's parents' house without presents on Josh's father's birthday. Josh did not mention the chair, nor did the father. It has nothing to do with the lives of these people. So why a film called Puffy Chair and why not join it when it is released? Bad script. Another annoying thing is that Mark Duplas' brother Jay Duplas is not only the director but also the photographer (and the's not very good at it). Before the autofocus of the camera is captured and adjusted, almost everywhere will zoom in quickly and people will be grainy and focused. At first it had a sense of simplicity and part, but it soon became unbearable. Working on film is affordable and interesting. All the things / factors are doing well.

It`s very well written , directed and acted , especially by Sean Pertwee ( Why in`t that guy a big name star ? ) , and most of all it`s a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that I can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time . I look forward to seeing again . But you`ve got to ask yourself how can a TVM be better than most of the Hollywood action blockbusters that came out around about the same time ? Oh hold on , I`ve just had a disturbing thought about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a remake with Tony Scott directing and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley , Brad Pitt playing Pertwee`s role , massive artistic licence taken with events etc. Let`s keep DEADLY VOYAGE a superlative TVM rather than a poor blockbuster",positive

38766,"SPOILERS AHEAD fifteen PARK AVENUE: My Humble take on this film Now, for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine, niche films like fifteen Park Avenue bought to be palatable to my sensibilities. With this thought, and a mild sense of embarrassment that I than't watched the complete film earlier, I watched this film last Saturday. There are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch) from which, this film borrows at least three concepts:- a) That (at least some) truths are relative of) The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll, is uncannily similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita undertook in Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film pc) The incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole 'occurence behind Winkies' involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per Se is seamlessly linked to other works of Lynch (notice carefully the dishevelled long hair), the effect of the beggar woman in fifteen PA appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message The other films from which fifteen PA also borrows is Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth Vs. perceived truth poser presented towards the send of Antonioni's masterpiece). Of course, the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind, ""A Beautiful mind"". Although, admittedly the subject there is high brow physics and Shabana, who professes it, inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of Konkona's character through those very prophecies. In an outstanding scene in the movie, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of Shabana, where Quantum Physics and the Theory of Relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, to the artificial edifice of the 'make believe' world of Mithi But for all their differences, the sisters are alike too. Both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships- one out of choice and the other out of nature. So, Mithi's spain at being rejected in love by Joydeep is in harmony with the inability of Shaban to form a special bond with either Kunal(Dhritiman) for Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm getting ahead of myself. Viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways:- Hypothesis one: ""It was Shabana all along"" There is a certain section of the audience who think so. But that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too (i.e. all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing Mithi along with her) Hypothesis two: ""There WAS a REAL Mithi and the ending is a metaphor"" This POV says that the film's essence is summarized in one dialog in the film, when in response to a statement by Joy (Rahul Bose), that Mithi is looking for something that she will never find, this wife Laxmi (Shefali Shah) philosophies that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia, the send of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment There are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by your knowledgeable audience like:- Hypothesis three:"" Shabana and Konkona are walter egos of the same person"" Hypothesis four: ""Shabana too is a figment of Mithi's imagination"" Hypothesis five: ""The old, haggard, perhaps mad, beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story"" Are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested? Well, your guess is as good as mine ""Why fifteen Park Avenue?"" Contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the Park Avenue in NY, I believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap. Remember, her stating Jo Jo's profession as ""Prime minister of Shikakai"", which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing Shampoos. The prefix 'fifteen' is used as it was on fifteenth December that Mithi got engaged to Joydeep and after this walkout, she remains forever in a time warp. The film has its fair share of flaws- black of use of a strong background score, which in films like these can really augment the narrative, some sloppy dialog unabated by some forced dialog delivery. Inconsistent performances (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent though IMO) by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot. I give it seven/ten as it made me think but not any higher than that because I can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced (and for the most part, thoroughly enjoyed) those previously, I have already thought on similar lines earlier. So, the experience post fifteen PA is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty. Where am I coming from? I gave nine.five/ten to 'thirty-six Chowringhee Lane' (though rumours still persist that one Satyajit Ray ghost directed it), seven.five to 'Paromiter Ek Din', seven to 'Mr and Mrs Iyer' and five to 'Paroma'. On an existential level, it failed to invoke my interest, not even as much as say a 'Truman Show'",positive

38766,"SPOILERS FORWARD fifteen PARK AVENUE: My humble attitude towards this movie. With this thought, and a little embarrassment that I had never watched the whole film before, I watched this movie last Saturday. There are similarities with other works such as the history of Mulholland (David Lynch), this film borrows at least three concepts: - a) (at least some) the truth is related In both cases, the content of the search turned out to be a fictional character in both cases, and could have the meaning of a public image on the computer screen of the Apana movie. tramp, but even though the evil creature is a symbol of something, and the ""object"" and the character itself are connected seamlessly with other works of Lynch (pay attention to long brown hair), Fifteen PAs seem to charge, so in the movie's context and information, it does't matter. Fifteen PAs also borrowed from other films are Blow Up (especially the last episode is a return to reality Vs. Antonio's Masterpiece posted). Of course, the opinion of professors with schizophrenia is also reminiscent of ""Good Mind."" Although, it is true that the matter of the venerable physics, and Shabana, who claims to be, unknowingly ultimately formulate a sharp antithesis of the deceptive views of the Konkona character of these prophecies. In the best movie scenes, some of these things are put together, and the story is reversed back and forth with Shana's ""real"" world, where quantum physics and relationships show that the boundary and structure of the universe makes sense, to Trees of man-made ""artificial"" houses, but despite the differences, the sisters are also very similar. Nor can the form a lasting relationship — one because of choice, the other because of nature. Therefore, the Spanish Tree’s refusal to date Joydeep is in line with Shaban’s inability to form a special connection with Kunar (Dhritiman) for Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I will pass. Viewers usually watch the movie in one of two ways: -Think one: ""Always Shabane"" Some listeners think so. But this explanation is not only a narrative, but also a demonstration, because it means that you are dreaming with other characters (that is, all the characters that the thought were trees with him) Hypothesis two: Trees and the ending are metaphors. ” The POV stated that the main idea of ​​the movie was summarized in the dialogue in the movie. Laxmi's wife (Shefali Shah) is a philosopher, we really want that deceptive, black post seems to hide happiness and satisfaction, and a few other things that can be accepted by an experienced audience, such as: - Hypothesis three: ""Shabana and Konkona are walter egos of one person"" Hypothesis four: ""Shabane is also a mythical tree"" Hypothesis five: ""An old man, haggard, and perhaps a crazy woman is a true character of a story"" Is it worth the test? Well, your guess is the same as mine. ""Why is fifteen Park Avenue?"" Contrary to popular belief, the thinks of Park Avenue in New York. I believe this name comes from a very popular soap. Remember, the says Jo Jo's job is ""Prime Minister of Shikakai"", who you can say is a popular ingredient used in shampoos. The prefix ""fifteen"" was used because Tree was engaged to Joydeep on December fifteen. After this protest, the remained in the warp of time forever. The film has a few flaws — black using strong background sound. The performance of some players is inconsistent (Shabana and Dhritimaan excel in IMO), but most of the music members have played. Shefali Chaya's sudden black of confidence in her husband seems unthinkable in this conspiracy. I give it a seven / ten because it makes me think, but it's not higher than that because I easily understand the origin of its inspiration and I have experienced (and in many cases, really enjoyed it) those, I the same Way Therefore, experiences after fifteenPA should not be new. Where do I come from Give me nine.five/ten on 'thirty-six Chowringhee Lane '(without rumours that Satyajit Ray's spirit still directs it), seven.five to' Paromiter Ek Din ', seven to' Mr and Mrs Iyer 'and five to' Paloma '.

There are a few other things that can happen. Your knowledgeable audience does not accept that much, for example: - Hypothesis three: is a mythical tree of the Trees ""Hypothesis five:"" Old and haggard, Perh Aps is crazy, and the beggar is the real protagonist of the story. "" Are these theories worth testing? In both cases, the subject matter of the investigation is likely to be a myth in both cases, and may have the meaning of a public image on the computer screen of the Apana movie. tramp, but even though the scary creature was a symbol of something, and the ""object"" and the character itself were seamlessly connected with Lynch's other works (pay attention to long brown hair), Fifteen PAs. it seems that the charge, so in the context of the movie and its information, is irrelevant. Fifteen PAs also borrowed from other films are Blow Up (especially the last episode is a return to reality Vs. Antonio's Masterpiece posted). There are similarities with other works like the mythical Mulholland (David Lynch). This film blends itself to at least three concepts in it: - a) (at least some) truth related) Shabana and Konkonam The film as the opening credits revolve around. in the car, which is surprisingly similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita take to Mulholland Road.

39216,"I read Tom Robbins' EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under ""GAY PRIDE -- WOMEN -- LESBIANS."" (That's the Library of Congress subject heading.) Now anyone over twelve who reads the book will know it has NOTHING TO DO with real lesbians, any more than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was obviously -- and I do mean OBVIOUSLY --written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians (in the nude, all the time)but has never really met one. Still, someone in Hollywood said, ""uh pooh, better give this to a Gay director for Gay People will make trouble."" So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but -- however Gay the may really be -- the has not a clue as to how to make a funny film. Gus Van Sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl/girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull, literal-minded Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not pretty. The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. His clout allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the novel's real subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster)caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre. Let's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. PAT MORITA as ""THE CHINK"" Okay, there are few name-recognition Asian factors. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was fairly funny. But casting him as THE CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man. (Gus did't tell him.) Pat also does't seem to know that the Chink is . . . well, SEXY!!! In the book the's not wise old Mr. Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! He's a randy old goat and the knows A LOT about pleasing the nubile and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they karen't REALLY lesbians. Do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet?) JOHN HURT as ""THE COUNTESS."" Okay, the's a gay friendly man. But the is a SERIOUS, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR!!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept expecting Paul Scofield to wander in all dressed up as Thomas More, and sadly shake this head. ""Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul entirely. For shame, my former student!"" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and pretty gay) as Caligula. But that was BLACK humour, not playful and breezy humour like the book. RAIN PHOENIX as ""Bonanza Jellybean."" No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving. In the movie she's sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it like this. ""God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits."" Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? UMA THURMAN as ""Sissy Hankshaw."" This is a tough role. In the book Sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. Still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, for a sway in her walk, to simply some sort of hidden strength for hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma does't pull it off, probably because Gus never told her Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma plays it more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukaemia. This movie is sour and dull. And I accuse YOU, Gus Van Sant!",negative

39216,"When I was a teenager, I read Tom Robbins' book ""Even Cowgirls Can Get Blue"". I like all the words. Fascinating, interesting, full of charm and beautiful text. But when I saw the movie, I could't believe how dull, sour, and uninteresting it was. How did this happen? I think someone from Hollywood read this book and described it as ""Gay Pride-Women-Lesbians"". (That is the subject of a Congress Library theme.) Anyone who is over twelve years old reading this book now knows that it has nothing to do with real homosexuality, just as Star Wars is about real travel in space. This book is clearly — I mean clearly — written by a man of the opposite sex (who is always naked) who loves the view of lesbians, but has never met him. However, a Hollywood man said, ""Oh, ooh, it's better to give this to the gay authorities, because gay people will get in trouble."" So they gave him Gus Van Sant. There’s nothing against this man, but — even if the’s really gay — the has no idea how to make an interesting movie. Gus Van Sant transformed the straightforward ideas of playful male / female virtuous girls and men's voyeurism into dull, straightforward posters demanding homosexuality. It’s like turning Oscar Wilde’s comedy into Arthur Miller’s tragedy. It's not good. The main guide that Gus Van Sant does not know how to deal with the source of material is a very bad throw. His influence enabled him to hire the best men. His ignorance of the true theme of the novel (a fantasy of the opposite sex, not a poster for homosexuals) led to this choice not only bad but strange. Let's get acquainted with the guards of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. PAT MORITA as ""CHINK"" Yes, Asians are not very popular. And Pat Morita, on HAPPY DAYS, is very interested. But it's not right, it's not right, to show him as CHINK. Pat Morita had no idea that Chink was a very interesting person. (Gus did't tell her.) Pat does't seem to know that it's Chink. . Yes, sexy! ! ! Miyagi old unwise in the book. You look like Hugh Hefner! He’s an old ripped goat who knows exactly how to please a teenager with a responsive sister and Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they are not real lesbians. Do you realize that this is a fantasy of straight men?) John Hurt plays ""Countess"". Well, this is gay friendly. But this is a serious Shakespearean player! ! ! ! You need someone who is interested in completing this role. It is sad and tragic that John Hurt is portrayed as a fool like a fugitive. I was expecting Paul Scofield to walk around in it, dressed like Thomas More, and then the shook this head sadly. ""Now, Richard, you know you've completely lost your soul. It's a shame, my former student!"" Yes, John Hurt who plays Caligula is funny (and very gay). But that’s a dark joke, not a playful and lively joke like in a book. RAIN PHOENIX as ""Bonanza Jellybean"". No talent, no training, no problem. Apart from the book Bonanza, it is funny, playful, fun, (mostly) the opposite sex and love. In this movie, she is depressed, speechless, speechless, and depressed. As for this taste for women, Robbins in the book said so. ""God knows I love women, but nothing can replace a good man."" Uh, Gus? Have you read this book? If Thurman plays ""Hankshaw Sissy"". This is a difficult role. In the book, Cici is really an inactive and shy hero. Still, an accomplished factor can blink this eyes, move this movement, and hide some hidden power just to hide what is happening. Uma did't succeed, probably because Gus did't tell her that Sissy should enjoy being a good-looking rider with big thumbs. Uma is like a role in a TV movie about a girl who died of leukaemia. This movie is sour and crowded. I criticize you, Gus Van Sant!",negative

The plot is fairly dire and the acting is of course terrible, but there is a certain mystique surrounding the ninjas in this film which makes for quite a good atmosphere. What is important are the fight scenes, while a 'little' space, are really good. I must say it was better when I was a boy, only now can I see the glaring points of unbelievable nonsense in the film, but as a ""sit back with a few beers"" martial arts film I can't fault it, it delivers and is much better than the mountains of ""American Ninja"" Style rubbish that was churned out in the eighty's with hundreds of guys in black suits but really not very good fight scenes.

40255,"What the check do people expect in Horror films these days anyway. Does is HAVE to be something grisly like 'SAW' for it's just crap. ??? Now, I don't claim to be an all knowing expert, but I'm about forty-seven, I've seen and own literally thousands of films and I honestly think this director really gave this film a good, sincere effort. Believe me, I was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialog started, ASSUMING it was gonna be awful and I was pleasantly surprised. It's no Mamet script, that's for sure; but COME ON!!! with all the HORRIBLE garbage out there, ESPECIALLY in Horror, I thought this one was WAY closer to the top of the pile than most. The director used a lot of neat, clever camera angles; the soundtrack was excellent and moody, perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film. The editing and timing were very good. And it DIDN'T resort to the tired, worn clické of excessive 'slasher' violence; for example ***** MINOR SPOILER ***** During an absolutely delightful and fully gratuitous (but tasty. , huh, I mean tasteful) nude shower scene I FULLY expect her to get sliced and diced; but, AMAZINGLY we just get to enjoy her heavenly loveliness and that's it ***** END MINOR SPOILER ***** Also, the tension was built very well, leading up to a nicely ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what's what. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; WE see the doll actually talking to her, but in the video recording we do not. Also, the Mom sees Pinnochio moving about and being quite nasty; so, are BOTH the Mom AND daughter mentally will. ??? Also there is the original 'killer' and what the Mom had surmised about a possible Evil influence.

40796,"A friend of mine asked: ""Doesn't one have to be pro-euthanasia in order to like this movie? Is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to send their lives?"" Interesting questions. As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to send this life in The Sea Inside. Think Ramón Sampedro addressed this in the movie as well. It is the who wants to die. It is the who is fighting for this right to decide this death. He is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics. Though this pioneering work, depending on one's perspective, may prove beneficial for damaging to quadriplegics down the road, this primary objective is a personal one. But one thing this movie does (my opinion anyway), is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forth. After my first viewing of The Sea Inside, I walked home in a conflicted blur. I struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion; why would Ramón want to die? Given the love, care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on Ramón by the people surrounding him, why would the doggedly cling on to this hurtful decision? Then, on my second viewing, a shared thought between Ramón and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness. It threw up a telling observation: "". total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy."" Most human beings crave for such an intimacy. Of course, how much we value such ""needs"", depends largely on the individual. As a person with a familial-biased sensibility, I empathise strongly with the caregivers in this movie. Why can't Javier consider the sacrifice and the love from this family and friends? Is the blind to it all? I would think not. The miracle of The Sea Inside therefore, is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war. When we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one, whom has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intent to die, what then is the right thing to do? Is caring for and keeping this loved one alive, against this for her will, a pious gesture? Does it show up the worth of your love? Or does it merely soothe your ""selfish"" fears of irreplaceable loss? With so much understanding accorded to caregivers, would't their invalid charges, by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival, also be an overlooked act of sacrifice? Rhetorical for not, how much is ""dignity"" worth to an individual? Is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege for a right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their eventual decisions in life (as in death)? A torrent of questions the movie might have asked, answers to which, I'm in no position to provide. In your eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro-life for pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's engulfing the people most intimately affected, the caregivers and the jones they care for. The Sea Inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them. Intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the nature of ""sacrifice"" is never one-sided. In this tug of war, we should endeavour not to win arguments, but to intently observe and hopefully determine, who is the ""stronger"" party to make that sacrifice. The Sea Inside is a sobering film. It opened my eyes to things I don't wanna see. And for that, I am grateful.",positive
40796,"A friend of mine asked: ""You don't have to support euthanasia to love this movie? Is it a movie error to show that most quadriplegics want to give their lives?"" An interesting question. To the best of my knowledge (correct me if I am wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wants to send this life ""Hainai"". Consider Ramon San Pedro, who also solved the problem in the movie. People who want to die. Those who decide this kind of death are the jones who fight for this right. He was speaking for himself, not for other quadriplegics. While this basic function may prove useful in future quadriplegia from a human point of view, this primary objective is a personal one. But one thing that this movie does (whatever my opinion) is that it forces us viewers to ask themselves the trivial questions my friend briefly asked. After watching the Inland Sea for the first time, I walked home in a mysterious way. I tried to accept this annoying idea. Why does Ramon want to die? Considering the unwavering love, concern, and self-sacrifice of the people around Ramon, why did the insist on this dangerous decision? Then, when I watched it for the second time, the familiar thoughts between Ramon and the lady lawyer came to my mind. It offers this assurance: “Complete dependence is a result of intimacy.” Most people desire such intimacy. Of course, the extent to which we attach the importance of this ""need"" depends largely on the individual. As a family racist, I sympathize with the caregiver in this movie. Why can't Havel consider the sacrifice and love that comes from this family and friend? Is the blind? I do not think so. So, the wonder of the Inland Sea lies in the deep picture of human war-torn competition. When we are under surveillance by a relative who is mentally retarded but unable to do so, we are announcing this calm, reasonable, and reasonable intent to die. Is it a divine act to care for and maintain a loved one who lives contrary to this for her will? Does it reflect the value of your love? Or is it simply a matter of justifying your “selfish” fear of an irreversible loss? Given so much understanding by caregivers, their unjustified accusations, and complete reliance on others for survival, is it not an act of disregard for sacrifice? Rhetoric does not exist, how much ""dignity"" does a person value? Is it a right to live (or die) with dignity? If we truly care and love the person, should we respect this for her final decision in life (such as death)? There are so many questions that a movie can ask, and I can't answer them. Because you are interested in distinguishing between life-sustaining resources and psychosocial support options, we run the risk of ignoring the gray sea that covers the most affected, caring, and Jones caregivers. The Inner Sea, therefore, attempts to demonstrate the intricacies and complexity of the relationship between them. Intuitively, this movie understands one thing; the ""offering"" type is not one-sided. In this war-torn game, we should not try to win the debate, but focus on who is the ""strongest"" organization to make this sacrifice. ""Inner Sea"" is a thought-provoking movie. It allows me to see things I don't want to see. For this, I am very grateful.",positive
40796,"My friend asked me: ""Shouldn't someone be pro-euthanasia to love this movie? Interesting questions. As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), Ramón is there Sampedro also spoke about the film. He wants to die. He is fighting for this right to decide on this death.talking about it not like a square. While this work of pioneering, it depends on a person's point view, can be useful to the detriment of a square, the main purpose of which is personal. But one thing this film does (in my opinion)), however, is forcing viewers to ask themselves of a series of frequently asked questions by my friend. When I first looked at the Sea, I walked towards my house and collided. I struggled in. I agree with this angry idea; Why does Ramón want to die? Because there is no up the love, care and sacrifice that Ramón poured out for the people around him, why was the so attached to this painful decision? Then, when I watched it again, a thought I had shared between Ramón and the lawyer’s wife came to my mind. He advocated the effective observation: ""The general expectation comes at the cost of connectivity."" Most people love this kind of closeness. Of course, as we assess such “needs”, it is often up to the person. As someone who is committed to the family, I closely follow the guardians of this film. Why can’t Javier consider the sacrifice and love of these family and friends? Is it all blind? I do not think so. The Miracle of the Sea, then, is a painting depicting a humanitarian war. When we are faced with the responsibility of a loved one who is aware, but weak, who has shown calm, gentleness and a reasonable intention to die, then what is to be done? Is caring for and protecting a loved one’s life against this for her will, is it a divine guide? Does it show the value of your love? Or does it just fix your fear of “yourself” for irreversible loss? With so much understanding given to caregivers, in’t their accusation valid, surrender to the general dependence of others on safety, nor is an act of self-sacrifice noticed? Rhetorically for no, how much “dignity” does a person have? Do you have the right to live (or die) with dignity? If we truly care and love someone, do we also respect their decisions in the afterlife (such as death)? There are many questions that the film can ask, the answers to them, I am not in a position to give. In your quest to intelligently visualize life’s priorities in choices, we manage the risk of ignoring the gray ocean of people particularly affected, caregivers and caregivers. Inside the sea the tried to show the soft but still intimate connection between them. Emotionally, this film understands one thing; that the nature of “sacrifice” is not habits on one side. In this struggle, we must strive to win the debate, but we must think carefully and hopefully decide who is “stronger” and who is making that sacrifice. Sea Inside is a sensational film. It opened my eyes to things I did’t want to see. And for that, I appreciate it.",positive
40796,"A friend of mine asked: ""Isn't it necessary to be a supporter of euthanasia to like this movie? Is it a movie mistake that most people with quadriplegics want to post their lives? "" Interesting questions. In my opinion (correct me if I'm wrong), only one square wanted to send this life to DC Inside. Imagine Ramón Sampedro talking about it in a movie. He is the one who wants to die. They are the jones who fight for this right to decide this death. He speaks for himself and not for the other square. While this initiative's work may, from a human point of view, be beneficial in damaging the square under the road, its primary purpose is personal. But one thing that makes this film (my opinion anyway) is that it forces us viewers to ask ourselves some vague questions that my friend has asked briefly. After my first look inside DC, I went home with the opposite direction. I struggled to reconcile this disturbing ideology. Why does Ramon want to die? In view of the extraordinary love, care and devotion that Ramon unconditionally bestowed on the people around him, why did those in power cling to this painful decision? Then, in my second look, an idea came to my mind between Ramon and the lawyer. He made an important point: ""Complete dependence comes at the cost of proximity."" Many people long for such closeness. Of course, how much we value such ""needs"" depends on the individual. As a bigoted family man, I have a lot of sympathy for the caregivers in this film. Why does't Xavier think about this sacrifices and the love the shows for this family and friends? Can't see everything? I don't think so. So the miracle under the sea, its clever picture of human war. What to do when faced with the care of a mentally healthy but disabled loved one who has expressed a calm, reasonable and reasonable purpose for death? Is taking care of this loved one and keeping him alive, against this will, a sacred act? Does it show the importance of your love? Or does the just not pay attention when you tell him to do something? Would it be a selfless act of self-sacrifice for the caregivers, with such understanding, to surrender to their unreasonable charge, to be completely dependent on others for survival? Rhetoric for no, how important is ""dignity"" for a person? Is it right to live (or die) with dignity? If we really care and love this person, should't we finally respect this decisions (as in the case of death)? Lots of questions that the film may have asked, answers that I am not in a position to give. In your determination to psychologically separate the virtues of a supportive life in terms of choice, we take the risk of overlooking the gray sea that affects the most affected people, caregivers and their caregivers. The performer wraps up Jones. Sea Inside therefore sought to establish a soft but complex relationship between them. Obviously, this film understands one thing. That the ""sacrifice"" oath is not one-sided. In this conflict, we must not try to win the conflict, but look carefully and hopefully this is the ""strong"" party that made the sacrifice. C Inside is an interesting film. It opened my eyes to things I did't want to see. And for that, thanks.",positive

42588,"Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The thirteenth Floor, and when I first saw it I would have agreed -- I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed. But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely. The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mambo-jumbo thrown in. The thirteenth Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mambo-jumbo thrown in. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about ""reality"" for any such ""deep"" concept. It's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe. The most chilling moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats her ""scripted"" line. It's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story. This is made even more frightening at the send when D'Arcy Nader (or rather this player) comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game. I sympathize completely with the ""realist"" philosophy, that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the send goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence. Living ""in the game"" is not living at all, but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth. As Allegra comments about the real world, ""there's nothing going on there."" Might as well jack into someone else's imagination, and pretend to be doing something interesting. (Although I have to ask whether Cronenberg considers this a self-indictment, considering that the himself offers up worlds to be experienced in ninety minute snippets.)Upon leaving the theatre after first watching this movie, I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended. But having seen it a couple more times (thank you SciFi Channel) I've realized how much deeper it goes. Seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves another viewing.",positive

When I left the theatre after watching this movie for the first time, I thought it was just an ending movie.

That may prove tough to some people to accept, but an important part of life is facing that which we don't want to. Rather than demonizing the man, we bought to try to understand him. Otherwise, we stand little chance of preventing anyone similar in the future, for possibly even the present, from succeeding at anything of remotely comparable scope, as far as damage and misery goes. Hate him and what the did, don't make him into something mythical, intentionally for otherwise. Frankly, far too much of this mini-series could play ""dumb dumb *duuum*!"" after for during scenes.

44984,"I think the cards were stacked against Webmaster, because right from the start there was this itchy feeling, like something was wrong but I could't quite put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Dubbed. For a little while, they managed most of the lines either as voice over for off screen, with just a little hint there and there, until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves, with nothing even remotely funny about it. I hate dubbing, but at least, however misplaced, martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it. What I wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that. Maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie Hackers (being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in). What I got was some poorly written, nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without this little lego, and a director who obviously did't know how to handle a camera. I just wanted to reach in there, grab the camera from the guy, and shoot the dang thing myself. The editing was't much better. The acting? Well, I guess if the lead guy did't have such a bad script to work from, the'd be at least watchable. The main bad guy was OK, too, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. Dubbing did't help, but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration. Before I get into more bad, let's perk up to a few good things. Well, one for two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I rather enjoyed the cyberworld stuff, what little there was of it, and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about, in, and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the 'real world'. The falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kind of cool, but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things. The heart gadget, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of Escape from New York, it was horribly conceived in the long run. There's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and your hero is right there. Why did't the try the bad guy's thumb print then (since the heart device was thumb activated)? Nonetheless, some interesting gadgets and khyber stuff, if only they could have been utilized better. Now, who there dares compare this movie to Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off kilter type of romance in it, sort of, in both films. There's the investigation of a murder, but I've seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either Blade Runner for Webmaster. Identity, for instance. That's about where the similarities send. Period. There is no comparison, just as there would't be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for part direction and knows some fundamentals of film-making, like where to put the camera. Webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than not takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the send to get her to Point B by herself without the Hero, so that the could do this thing. Very convenient. Or, the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for. Or, inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get away.). It tries to be ship, it tries to be exploitive, it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising, and it tries to be thrilling. But a bunch of near identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly shot, bad acting, etc. does not a thrilling movie make.",negative
44984,"Some interesting gadgets and Khyber objects, if they can be used better. Apart from the basic graphics, I prefer something in the online world, which has very little content, and I would like to watch a movie about it instead of a cool place outside of the ""real world""",negative
44984,"I think these cards are webmasters, because they feel itchy at first, as if something is wrong, but I have not been table to solve it completely. Then the hit me. Lubrication. For a while, they were table to control many lines, even on the voiceover on the screen, with a little help there and there, until it became clear. This type of trade makes people nervous, not funny at all. I hate copying, but at least, no matter how lost it is, martial arts movies and inappropriate writing are always funny. What I really want is a movie about real attackers. Maybe it’s like the opposite of a movie hacker table (about people trying to keep them out, not about people trying to get in). What I found was poorly written and sometimes ridiculous murder mysteries with incorrect sequence, a mysterious giant cast outside this little Lego, and a boss who apparently did’t know how to use the camera. I just want to get inside, take the camera from that guy, and shoot myself. Editing is not much better. Are you kidding? Yeah, I think the player does't have that bad script, you can watch it. The worst people are also good, but almost everyone jokes. Copying did not help, but even in this case, the drama was much worse. Before I get into a bad situation, let's celebrate and do good things. Well, the other two. Apart from the basic graphics, I prefer something in the online world, which has very little content, and I would love to watch a movie about it outside of the subtle world outside of the ""real world"". Fake fingers seem cool, but in the send they don’t matter in the planning process. The heart gadget that reminds me of ""Cronos"" by Guillermo Del Toro is interesting, though as a direct tear to the page ""Escape from New York"" At some point, the bad guys close their minds, and your hero is there. So why not try a bad person's thumb (because the heart device is made with a thumb)? However, some interesting tools and Khyber items, it would be nice if they could be used better. Now, who would dare to compare this movie with Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future, and there is some kind of incompatible love in both films. There is a murder investigation, but I have seen many murder movies, completely different from the web host Blade Runner. Take ID as an example. This is the same. time. There is no comparison, as there is no comparison between Blade Runner and the attackers. Ridley Scott is a talented director who has a good sense of humour about certain directors and understands some of the basics of making a film, such as a camera stand. Webmasters are cheaper, not just because of budget. Because it is not well written, it is not expensive, and because it always takes simple steps (such as writing a character that seems to save a girl) It can be done, very good. The character has no reason to care, for something as stupid as a car makes them stop just in time for someone to run away.

45447,"The fourth of five westerns Anthony Mann did with James Stewart, this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster who takes a cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska, via Seattle. He hooks up in Seattle with this partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) that the has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip, north. But first, the has to put up with insubordinate trail hands, cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy, manipulative Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) who believes Jeff could be a valuable rally in the future. That's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier (and justifiable) killing of a trail hand. Jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy Judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the town of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon blocks Jeff up for disrupting this public changing by running this cattle through town. He fines Jeff the ownership of this cattle and Jeff just has to heat crow for the time being. In the meantime, Jeff agrees to ride point for Ronda up to Dawson in order to deliver supplies. But this is just a ruse so Jeff, Ben and Rube can slip back into Skagway and steal this cattle back. Of course Judge Gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by Jeff with a rifle while Ben races the cattle over the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach. After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other Skagway men, they finally reach Dawson where Jeff sells this cattle to the highest bidder, which just happens to be Ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff then takes this money and buys himself a claim and starts spanning for gold. But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get in on the gold action up there, and tells Jeff that the was getting a little bored with Skagway and wants to try this luck up in the Klondike, himself. That involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims. Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good, leaving Rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and this gang. They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening this big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is severely wounded but that does't save Judge Gannon from this just due. The ending shootout at night on the muddy Dawson street pretty much takes care of that. First Jeff skills two of Gannon's best gunman (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then as Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip around behind him, Gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in Jeff's arms. Then Jeff skills Gannon as the's hiding under a wooden sidewalk. Revenge has spoken. This is another trip-roaring western that's right up there with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE. Why the Universal DVD uses a pan-and-scan print instead of the widescreen print TCM uses, is beyond me. You'll wind up missing half the glorious Alberta cinematography by William Daniels.

That’s why the hid her in the boat, and the captain is looking for her because (and rightly so) the killed a little hand before. Jeff also unfortunately met the despised Judge Gannon (John McIntyre) driving Skagway, Alaska. Gannon prevents Jeff from using cattle in town to disrupt social change. He fined Jeff for the ownership of the cow, and Jeff wanted to warm up the crow at that moment. At the same time, Jeff agreed to drive Ronda to Dawson to deliver the items. But it was just a ploy, and Jeff, Ben, and Rub would sneak back into Skagway and steal a cow. Of course, Judge Gannon found this, in the background, but Jeff was delayed with a gun, and Ben was running with the cattle to the Canadian border that Gannon could not reach.

However Judge Gannon went to Dawson's side, took part in the gold mines there, and told Jeff that the was tired of Skagway, and that the wanted to try this luck at Klondike himself. This includes bringing in other people with guns and forcing the claims of some of the miners. Jeff and Ben now feel it is time to clean up when things go well, and let Reuben defend himself as the most inaccessible sheriff against Gannon and the gang. They looked for a way out, but found that they were being harassed by the Gannong men because Ben had opened this big mouth by mistake. Ben was executed, and Jeff was seriously injured, but this did not save Judge Gannon from the punishment the deserved. Guns blown off the muddy street of Dawson at night almost solved the problem. Jeff first discovered Gannon's best shooters (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then when Ronda came out to warn Jeff Gannon that the was trying to get out from behind him, Gannon shot him in the back and the died at Jeff's hands. Jeff then used Gannon as a cover-up.

I love John Voight, but I don’t know what makes him a part of this joke.",negative

I think NBC should be ashamed of allowing filmmakers to make fun of the world and cause more chaos in a world where the truth is unknown. Please don't buy this movie! ! ! I have thought about burning my copy, but I really plan to write the producers and send them the Bible references they should read before making this movie! ! !",negative
49000,"I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. I got to go to an advance screening, and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie. The audience all shared my laughter, and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie. Kudos to Steve Carrell(who I had already been a fan of). He proves in this movie this tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there was't a cameo from Will Ferrell(love him, but saw him too much this summer). There were parts of comedic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing(also Carrell). The waxing scene and the speed dater with the ""obvious problem"" were absolutely hysterical. I will definitely go see 'forty Year Old Virgin' when it's released. My advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it.",positive

49000,"I have been laughing happily in a movie for a long time. I have to go to screening early and I am very excited because I have always longed to see it. Most of this movie, I cried because of the laughter. The audience laughed just as much as I did, clapping and shouting loudly for the whole movie. Thanks to Steve Karel (I am already a fan of him). He has shown this great talent in the comedy show in this movie. You have a style I have never seen. Catherine Keener is as good as never. Thankfully, Will Ferrell did’t have a cameo (he loves her, but the saw her a lot this summer). There is a section on humour in this movie. Partly thank you to Carrell and partly thank you for writing (and Carrell). Shocking scenes and fast-paced “obviously troubled” comrades are noisy. I will definitely be watching “The Forty Virgin” after the show. My advice: Go watch it and have a great laugh with an incredibly entertaining film.",positive

49460,"I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It's one of my all time favourites because my father, Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer. I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we were living at the time to make April Love. My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man. I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered, and flo and behold the came home of/the script. How exciting is that! Also, a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the jones shown at the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again, and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today of/all the sex, foul language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus.",positive

49460,"When you see movies / all the pornography and vulgar language they have made today, it is timeless and reminiscent of time and long violence. I vividly remember when Hollywood came to Lexington, Kentucky, where we lived and made the film ""Love in April."" I persuaded him to try the given section, and then I saw the / script return. Every April, when I see this movie again, it’s nothing, and Pat Boone’s song “April’s Love” is still playing on the radio. This is one of my favourite things all the time, because my father Nelson Malone is a horse trainer. In addition, most of the kids I studied with came from human shows - especially Jones in the park. It's refreshing to see so many movies like love in April back to focus.",positive
