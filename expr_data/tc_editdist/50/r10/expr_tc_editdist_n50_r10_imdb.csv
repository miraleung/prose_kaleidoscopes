39374,"This film simply has no redeeming features. The story is incomprehensible, and the script is gross, sadistic, and stupid. The sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable car chase. The music is awful. The acting is limited largely to growling and smirking. A half star dud. Shame on DirecTV for putting it on pay-per-view. In a theatre, people might well have thrown soda at the screen.",negative
39374,"This movie is completely worthless. The story is difficult to understand, the script is crude, painful and stupid. A place to have sex is ridiculous, as even running away from a car is inevitable. The music is awesome. Performance is mainly limited to roasting and giggles. Half the stars are stupid. Shame on DirecTV for paying per view. In the arena, people can throw soda on the screen.",negative
39374,"This movie is not just about redemption. The story is vague, and the script is big, cruel and stupid. Sexual harassment is a joke, as well as an unavoidable car chase. The music is bad. Imitation is basically limited to bumping and dancing. Half Star Dude. Shame on DirecTV for putting you in every scene. In heaters, people are more likely to throw soda on the screen.",negative
42678,"This movie was funny from START to FINISH. Everyone in the cinema was laughing out cloud throughout the film!! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the girl from Will and Grace) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters were't as funny even though the movie focused around them. All in all, this is a great movie to go and see with your girls (yes guys, it's a girlie movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!",positive
42678,"This movie is very interesting from beginning to send. Throughout the movie, everyone in the cinema is laughing in the cloud! ! The main characters are Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edy Cohen (Debra Messing, Will and Grace's daughter) and Manicurist Tanya (Di Bi Bi Mazar). They have good lines, the best attitude, and so on. Jada Pinkett is really fun to play lesbian, good and convincing. The only downside to this movie is that some of the main characters are not interested, even though the movie is around them. All in all, this is a wonderful movie you can watch with your girlfriend (yes, guys, this is the perfect girls movie!). Enjoy it! ! !",positive
25344,"A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented factors, sounds like a great idea. An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less of the content allowing the factors and writers and director more creativity. But then why is this movie so bland? Ask the dust. This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters. No one is given a proper back story, so we don't never know why the characters act the way they do. Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to your imagination, if you still have one left at the send of this movie. I told a friend that I went to see this film, and that I thought it was awful. Her question: ""Not even Colin Farrell could save it?"" My response: ""Not even Colin Farrell's ass could save it.""",negative
25344,"The film, starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two highly respected and talented characters, is a good idea. A free movie looks great. The studio will control a bit of content, allowing authors and directors to do things more easily. But why is this film so aggressive? Ask for dust The movie starts with the fact that we are investing heavily in the characters. The true story is not given back to anyone, so we do not know why the characters behave. Definitions of physical and emotional scars are left in your mind, if you have a time when this movie is being posted. I told my friend I went to see the movie, and I thought it was bad.

40827,"I have never commented on IMDb before, but I feel I have to after watching The Batman animation. Its absolute rubbish! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early ninety so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula? I feel like writing a complaint letter to WB. The original animation was dark and brooding, exactly the way Batman was intended to be. WB had to mess this up with some stripe Batman of the Future. Now they produce this drivel. The Joker does't remotely resemble the Joker from DC comics. DC should sue.

The Warner brothers had the best Batman animation series in the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys so what are they doing that they are trying to confuse the formula for success? I was forced to write a letter of complaint to WB. The original movement was dark and elegant, just as Batman intended. The WB is to confuse it with a little Batman in the Future.

Warner Bros. had a complete list of cartoons in Batman in the early ninetys, so what did they do to try to tarnish the winning formula? I want to write a letter of complaint to the WB. The original images were dark and meditative, which is exactly what Batman wanted. WB has had to interrupt Batman with future lines. Now they produce such nonsense. The clown is not like a joke in DC comics. DC must sue. I encourage everyone who agrees with me to email WB and use human power to find the original formula",negative

22940,"Where to begin? This film is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful game of rugby, however, if you live outside the US and do follow the game, it is laughable. Various rugby traditions such as the ""Haka"" which is preformed by the New Zealand ""All Blacks"" and only by the All Blacks. The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer. The film itself is quite well directed however it is the poor script and over-all execution that lets it down, heavily. Taking into account is is based on a real story, it does posses a great deal of clickés in the storyline. I would strongly suggest that any American interested in rugby watch this film then watch what rugby actually is on Youtube because the rugby portrayed in this film has been distorted and skewed so far from what it really is.",negative

This is the most important piece in modern drama, but it has been criticized and represented by the author. The director of the film himself was very good, but the bad script and overall implementation made it a great disappointment.

21995,"This was a very nice soft-core movie for both men and women. Plenty of nudity/sex, but without the overall branch you'll usually find. They could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning. Trust me guys, if you want to get your woman in the mood, get something with Bobby Johnston in it! And I'm sure lovely Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please PM me! I'd love to know. The photography was much better than usual.

31378,"There are certain scenes in this film (like the hero's first meeting with super-villainess Shirley Eaton) where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and doing its premise (females want to rule the world by making men slaves) justice, but it never dares to.

If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film. unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes I know, bad writing. but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film.

Where Johnson felt trapped by this blessings, Fineman was trying to forget this life in the same perspective. Jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and Sandler pulls tears.

A typical love story, the characters have to win their short supply, the villain has to show up, but none of it started. By the time these things happened, I was already bored and the equipment was not working at all. In the squares that needed a lot of disagreement with the construction, it was as if the frame of need had been determined. Baby things don't have to be this way. Children's movies can vibrate and engage like adult Jones. The fear of saying, ""Hey, this is for kids"" is bullying. I will take the ""sword in the rock"" at any time. It was bad. I think Disney is going to release anything these days. As far as children are concerned, the ten years I have seen them will agree. Net garbage.",negative
16462,"This film is pure Spanish. Sitting in the theatre for a few minutes, I wondered when the movie would start. All standards are in place; In a normal love story, the characters have to get away with their shortcomings, the evil has to come out, but none of them started. By the time these things happened, I was bored and the equipment was completely useless. Features that require so much tension and construction, it is felt that the necessary diagrams have been cut. Baby products should not be like this. Children’s movies can be as rocking and engaging as adult jones. The reason, “hey, for the kids,” is bullshit. I’ll take “Sword of the Stone” every day. It was horrible. I feel like Disney will make it all up in days. And kids, the ten years I’ve seen it will allow. clean waste.",negative
30296,"I actually liked certain things about this game. I loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games. There's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. The graphics really were't bad, but I would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter. The music was fine. The things I hated were: The movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total spain. The story was too flame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality. The inability to save was awful!!! Some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later. I thought the weapons kind of sucked, too. This game is fun for awhile, but it's nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff. I'd recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person, but that's about it.

5922,"This story was never among my favourites in Christie's works so I was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation. The mouse motif was effective if a little overdone, the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past' subplot. The students were all pretty much as I imagined them although its a pity they were't a more cosmopolitan bunch - perhaps the revised thirties setting did't allow for that! I thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming; perhaps its because I've not long are-read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on. Humour was much more prevalent in these early Poirots. Sometimes it works but I found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode (though I did smile at the 'Lemon sole' throwaway line). Altogether though, a solid entry in the series though not one of the best.",positive

The content of the mouse is legitimate, and if a little finished, the bones of the story are there, though more emphasis has been placed on ""past crimes"". Students are almost as I think, although unfortunately they are not a group of foreigners - perhaps the revised one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys setting does not allow that! I think I took a big risk when I shot; probably because I haven't read this book in a long time, but since it came out in some shots that show up right away, it seems like I know who the killer is. Humor is common to these former Poirot objects. Sometimes it works, but I find that there are a lot of heavy points in this article (although I smile at the “mon only” discarded product line).

The performance is solid, no one can expect otherwise from McGanley's Morse, and the steering is fast and expensive. Personally, I find it difficult to link the comments from the previous post to the movie I saw. AWOL is aptly written by Shane Blake, it is a common occurrence to play this genre in honor of pulp legends, while at the same time blinding the audience and not taking them too seriously. Overall, AWO L is a very well made and entertaining film.",positive
25006,"The first ten minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and mpg-thirteen movies. These are the two reasons the movie is so bad. They constantly reference a movie called ""Get Leo"" which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty. Every time they do this, you will be really angry. Travolta in't very cool, neither is Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious. They karen't the kind of funny you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie though. If you haven't seen get shorty, you will probably like be cool. If you liked get shorty, you will leave the theatre wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.",negative

20362,"""Party Girl"" capitalizes on the tremendous charm of Parker Posey. In fact, at times, the movie seems to be a vehicle in which Ms. Posey is allow to play herself, as she normally is in real life. The film, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is a treat for Ms. Posey's fans. Ms. Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower Manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents. This is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent Meat Market districts became. At least, there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way, if we can call it that way. Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary.

9987,"RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt all warm and tingly when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. To me, she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him. However, I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. In addition, I thought that Lurky (voiec of Pat Fraley) and Murky (voiec of Peter Cullen) were diabolical. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who has't seen it, especially die-hard fans of the TV series. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.",positive

I think Lurky (Pat Fraley's voice) and Murky (Peter Cullen's voice) are demons.

The dialog is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully. There's Max, who has apparently led a horrible life. And there's Edward, who in't sure what life the wants to lead. My favourite character was Tom, Edward's insane boss. Tom has a short role but a memorable one.

Being made on a low budget, one can comprehend why the special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they were not completely horrible.
