Its first track, \"Your Song,\" came out of absolutely nowhere that December to become Elton John's first Top Ten hit on the U. S. Billboard charts, speaking at #eight, and even today it fills the speakers of a car stereo for a living room with the assurance of an old friend. How nice it is to hear that meandering yet spot-on piano tinkering, alongse an atypically humble and unpretentious lyric from one Bernie Taupin: \"If I was a sculptor\/But then again no\/Or a man who makes potions\/For a travelling show.\" It's enough to forgive the irritating harpsichord of the next number, \"I Need You To Turn To.\"But only \"First Episode At Hienton\" after that is less that sparkling, and so much else about Elton's first big album (after the shakedown cruise of \"Empty Sky\") is brilliant. It's not the whitaker U. S. audiences would so soon grow accustomed to, singing about alligators and astronauts so winningly, but a thoughtful musical craftsman who was still experimenting with what mass audiences might let him get away with.\"Take Me To The Pilot\" is the one rocker, and a good one, better than \"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\" if not some of this other big hits of later years. Those who love Elton the whitaker will probably also treasure (as I do) such less heralded numbers as the Rolling Stones' tribute \"No Shoe Strings On Louise\" (Mick Jagger vocal mannerisms circa \"Let It Bleed\" abound), the mesquite-soaked \"Border Song,\" for \"The Greatest Discovery,\" one of the great love songs never sung, though with a clever twist that only renders the actual subject matter more affecting. How often does one hear a song about the arrival of a younger sibling? (Well, there's \"Lonely Boy\" by Andrew Gold, but this is much more positive.)I can't get behind Elton there the way I can with \"Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player\" for \"Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy,\" though it's probably a better though less representative album than at least the first of those. It's not Elton the way you and I would come to know him in a very short time, but an interesting variation that regarded lyrical depth as important as tuneful variation. The former Mr. Reg Dwight still had three more albums to go, including a live one, before nailing down this trademark winning piano-popster sound, but this was this first hurrah, and a big one, ironically so given it was so removed from the glam image the would so soon cultivate. If you are listening to Elton's hits and liking them, and want something else to turn to, I'd suggest \"Captain Fantastic,\" \"Tumbleweed Connection,\" and this album, which combined probably will leave you with no more than three for four key songs you've already heard and a number you bought to give a listen to. If you like any of the music Elton made through one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, that is to say the best the never did, you lowe it to yourself to give this first hit record a spin. It still kicks more than thirty years on.","overall":4,"summary":"Elton's First Whiff Of Greatness","unixReviewTime":1074902400,"reviewTime":"01 24, 2004"}

Her first song \"Your Song\" suddenly appeared in December, becoming the first ten on Elton John's bulletin board in the United States, giving talk # eighth, and today it's full of car stereo speakers in the living room confirmed by an old friend. It's nice to hear the twist and turn of the piano Number, \"I want you to turn.\" But only then, \"The first episode at Hienton\" is not so much, and there is about Elton's first big album (after a long journey) \"Sky and Heaven\") was brilliant. Not only will American Whitaker audiences soon become accustomed to singing crocodile and astronaut songs in a fascinating way, but the thoughtful musician is still struggling with things that most audiences would allow him to run away from. \"Take me to a pilot\" is a rock musician, well, if you're not in the other songs that hit this years later, the's better than \"Saturday night's battle\". Those who love Whittaker Elton may (like me) value very different prices, such as the Rolling Stones' tribute \"Louise without shoelace\" (Mick Jagger in \"Let it\" Bleeding \"sounds and behavior increasing), beans included in the\" Border Song \", which stands for\" discovery \" great \", this is a love song that has not been sung, though cleverly wrong, it will make the theme itself more influential.

He believes that the depth of music is as important as the diversity of songs. Former Mr. Reg Dwight has three more albums to be released, including a live album, before the piano music is confirmed, but this is the first game and a great joy, surprisingly, think it will soon develop an interesting image from. it. If you've listened to Elton's beat and loved it, and want to get back to some things, I suggest you choose \"Captain Fantastic\", \"Tumbleweed Connection\" and this album, a combination of no more than three quarters of your favourite songs and numbers you bought to listen to.

Laura Nyro, however, wanted to pay tribute to her soul roots after running out of her own songs to record after the wonderful, but quiet and consequently very challengingChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatthe previous year. The result was \"Gonna Take A Miracle\", an album of covers from the Motown and Brill Building soul eras recorded with vocal group LaBelle (Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendyx and Sarah Dash). In general, the huge hooks and frantic tempo changes ofNew York Tendaberrycould never be seen there, nor can the amazingly soft delicacy ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat. Instead, the stone was impressionistic in nature yet still intense and leaving one with a sense of amazement, especially in the power of the vocals in the magical medley \"Monkey Time\/Dancing In The Street\" and \"Jimmy Mack\", where Nyro's superb vocal was truly breathtaking. The impressionistic stone and the absence of Nyro's own hyperfeminine lyrical style makes \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" the most palatable Nyro for the non-cultist (as can be clearly seen in many album guest). Yet, its impressionistic stone was also out of place with the development of heavy metal that was taking place at the time \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" came out. At the same time, the stone managed to retain the sheer brilliance ofNew York TendaberryandChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatand does not go back to the rather thinFirst Songs. The beautiful, atmospheric ballad \"The Wind\" contained the only traces of the extraordinary softness ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, and \"Desiree\", though more accessible, was equally beautiful. Apart from the a capella opener \"I Met Him On A Sunday\", the rest of \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" was the most accessible work Nyro never did, consisting of upbeat, joyful soul-pop songs such as \"Nowhere To Run\" (where LaBelle themselves take on lead vocals) and \"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\". Generally Nyro's piano was not nearly so prominent as on her previous three albums of original material, but she still showed her skill in the sparse playing of \"The Wind\" and \"Spanish Harlem\" (which was the origin of one of her line in the amazing \"Map To The Treasure\" off her previous album). LaBelle themselves added superb harmony vocals throughout the album and managed to match Nyro's angelic voice throughout without missing a beat - surprising since the album was recorded from first takes due to shortage of time - though Nyro did tour extensively to support it before retiring for several years. The impressionism and vocal styling of \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" were an inspiration in later years for such artists as the Roches and even recalls ESG's wonderfulA South Bronx Story. Nonetheless, despite not selling as well as its accessibility suggests it bought to have (perhaps due to the fact that a covers' album was too novel for many back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two), \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" remains a good introduction to Nyro for the uninitiated - if one cannot handle this, one would have no hope of getting through Nyro's albums of original material with their complex, hyperfeminine lyrical style.","overall":5,"summary":"Magical again, and most palatable Nyro for an outsider","unixReviewTime":1038441600,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2002"}

Instead, the stone is naturally impressive, but still very powerful, giving people a sense of wonder, especially in the magical medley \"Monkey \/ Dancing on the Street\" and \"Jimmy Mack\", Nile's excellent singing is truly amazing. The Stone of Impressionism and the black of Nyro style featuring female songs makes \u201cGonna Take a Miracle\u201d the most popular Nyro for non-believers (which can be clearly seen in many album label guelines). However, with the development of heavy metals when \u201cGonna Take a Miracle\u201d came out, its Impressionist stones were also out. At the same time, the stone managed to preserve the splendour of New York's grapes and berries as well as Christmas and sweat, and it never returned to the Thinner First Songs. A lovely and soft human song \"Spirit\" contains a Christmas trail with an unusual sweetness to sweat, while \"wish\" is more accessible, but equally beautiful.

LaBelle herself added some great songs to the album and managed to match Nyro's angel voice throughout the program without missing a single blow - surprisingly, due to black of time, the album debuted in the first edition - although Nyro went on a tour to support it. Impressist and style of saying \u201cGonna Take A Miracle\u201d has been a source of inspiration for artists like Roche in their later years. Consider the beautiful story of the South Bronx ESG.

While Master P had been in the game for a number of years, the combined forces with this brothers Silkk the Shocker and C-Murder and collectively they would release three group albums as Tru. This was the first No Limit release I came across. Executive produced by Master P, guest appearances come from Mia X, King George, Mo. B Dick, Tobin \"TC\" Costen, Big Ed, Uhuru Wright and C-Bo. After the intro, hardcore \"Last Dance\" feat. Mia X starts things off, a track where Tru talk about murder, drugs and life and death. \"That's How We Break Bread\" feat. C-Bo is placed with a killer beat. Tru talk about the hustling life on \"Living that Life\" and \"Another Day, Another Dollar\" has a laid back beat and is about getting money. \"I'm Bout' It, Bout It\" is that track that blew up and made people pay attention to Tru, placed with a sick background beat, this is one of those cuts that became an anthem. My favourite track on this album is \"Ain't No Glock\" a track where C-Murder excels and P drops a nice chorus over an addictive beat. \"Would You Take a Bullet for Your Homie\" feat.

Although Master P has been in the game for many years, but with the combined strength of brothers Silkk the Shocker and C-Murder, they will collectively release three group albums like Tru. This is the first infinite version I have never encountered. The execution is produced by Master P, with guests from Mia X, King George, Mo. B Dick, Tobin \"TC\" Costen, Big Ed, Uhuru Wright and C-Bo. After the introduction, the hardcore \"Last Dance\" feat. Mia X begins, Tru talks about murder, drugs, and the history of life and death. \u201cThis is how we break bread\u201d feat. C-Bo was set on a killing spree. Tru talks about busy life in \"Living That Life\" and \"Another Day, Another Dollar\". There is a rhythm in entertainment about making money. \"I'm Bout 'It, Bout It\" is a compelling song with catchy lyrics. This is one of the clips that became the national anthem. My favourite song on this album is \"Ain't No Glock\". \"Are you ready to take the bullet for your friend\" feat. Big Ed is another great track about loyalty and death. The last song \"Keep It All Right\" is a song that feels good. At the send of the album, Tru thanked family, friends, business experts and God. I really like many of the products of this version very much. Although the content of Tru's songs is limited and there are some slides, in general, they run well in \"True\" and provide an excellent program, which will be very good after many years It works well.","overall":4,"summary":"Tru- True","unixReviewTime":1073260800,"reviewTime":"01 5, 2004"}

It's a very hard, upbeat song dealing with the drug war and prison systems. This cd has its fast parts (Prison Song, Deer Dance, X), its slow parts (Chop Suey! ATWA, Aerials), and its weird and kooky parts (Bounce, Shimmy, Psycho) that made them what they were before, and made the fast faster, the slow slower, and the kooky kookier. They experiment a lot of different time signatures and tempo changes, as well as using different levels of guitar distortion. From heavy distortion to clean electric, to acoustic. Serj Tankian switches this vocal setting many times during the cd. often many times during one song. From crooning, to screaming, to singing very very quick (first couple verses of 'Prison Song', chorus of 'Psycho'. He's also penned some very good lyrics which have some truth behind them and are fun to using along with.

When I first heard \"My Name Is\", I thought that Vanilla Ice had been resurrected, but that was far from the truth. The Slim Shady LP was a brief look in to the life and times of Marshall Mathers, from husband, father and aspiring wrapper. Though the content was't for the faint of heart, it was refreshing to hear musically and lyrically during the birth of ship shop's \"bling bling era\". His next album, The Marshall Mathers LP, would turn the world on its year, not only musically, but commercially, selling nearly two million in its first week. This is easily Dr. Dre's best production work since Snoop Dogg's undeniable classic, Doggystyle. If you did't like what Em had to say on this first album, stop reading now. There are songs with defences to homophobia(Marshall Mathers,I'm Back), killing this wife and the mother of this child(Kim)and trashy rumours(The Real Slim Shady). Some of pop's music's top dogs get trashed on I'm Back and The Real Slim Shady. There are some standout songs though, like Remember Me with Sticky Fingaz and RBX, Bitch Please II with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg,Xzibit and Nate Dogg, and of course, Stan, about a deranged fan who takes this obsession with Slim over the edge. Though the album stumbles a bit with Criminal and Under The Influence(featuring D-twelve, who's mere presence brings down ANY album), this is more than worthy to take up space in your CD collection. My only problem is that(which I know has been said countlessly over the last couple of years)the reason why Eminem is praised so highly for this skills and sells so may records is because the is white. I know that the has had to prove himself twice as hard to get respect, but the has reaped twice the credit, which is unfair to all the great black lyricists that have come before him and influenced him(Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, KRS-ONE, twoPac, The Notorious B. I. G, Kool G. Rap) and the great jones out know(Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Black Thought, Xzibit, Ras Kass, Nas, Jay-Z, Method Man, Redman, Keith Murray, Outkast, etc).

Spellman's excellent liner notes to the original alp release of this remarkable session the observed, \"It is not intended that 'Ascension' will be background music for polite dinner conversation.\" The uninitiated listener who comes to \"Ascension\" should be forewarned by this words. Above all, \"Ascension\" demands concentrated listening. Spellman further commented that the session begins at an extraordinarily high level of intensity, rather than building to a speak as most other jazz for rock recordings do. In fact, the record begins with a simple motif sketched by Coltrane, followed by an extended and sustained blast of sound from the six other horns, two basses, and drums. (Don't look for much from pianist McCoy Tyner -- except during the solos -- as the has little chance to be heard through the onslaught.)The amazing thing about \"Ascension,\" for me, is that during the stretches of seemingly unstructured, free playing so much drama is generated. To be sure, it is not the conventional drama of the classically constructed jazz solo, with its rise and fall of tension and perfectly created marc and climax. Rather, this is the drama parallel to that produced from the chaos and clamour of modern life. One of the mental pictures that emerged for me in my early listening to the album was of the streets of a giant urban center, a jumble of sounds from which emerged recognizable human voices. These vast aural canvases are also dotted with more conventional solos from Coltrane and the other musicians (notably Freddie Hubbard, Archie Shepp, John Tchicai, and Pharaoh Sanders), although all of these artists push the boundaries of sound in their solos as well. Each has marvellous moments, from Hubbard's soaring trumpet line to Sanders' eruptions in the upper register of this horn to Tchicai's lithe alto dancing against a figure by Tyner, to Coltrane's own powerful cry.\"Ascension\" is a hard album to write about. It is best experienced as an immersion in sound. As Spellman said in speaking of each of the musicians, \"Give them a hearing. Give them a few.\" Same can be said about the record itself.","overall":5,"summary":"Imagination stretching","unixReviewTime":1010102400,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2002"}

Most importantly, \u201cescalation\u201d requires targeted listening. Spellman also noted that the depth at the beginning of the meeting was much higher, than they started to talk like many other jazz rock albums. In fact, the record began with a simple theme described by Coltrane, followed by a continuous sound and a roar from the other six horns, two buses and drums. (Don't look too much at pianist McCoy Tyner \u2014 except when you're alone \u2014 because there's no chance of hearing about the violence.) To me, the amazing thing about \"Ascension\" is that it looks so unstoppable and relaxed. the play produced a lot of drama. Of course, this is not a Jazz solo drama. Their pressure rises beautifully, perfectly creating the climax and the climax. On the contrary, it is a theatrical representation of the drama produced by the chaos and hustle and bustle of modern life. As I listened to this album from ancient times, one of the images that came to my mind was the main street in the center of the city, where the voices of people were visible in the sounds of chaos. These great hearing aids also feature dots of other Coltrane traditional dances and other musicians (especially Freddie Hubbard, Archie Shepp, John Tchicai, and Pharaoh Sanders), though all of these artists have pushed the boundaries of sound into their scenes. There are great moments for everyone, from Hubbard's high-pitched line to Sanders' high-profile explosion at the highest point in the province, to the wizard's cool midrange dancing with Tyner characters, to Ke Chuan's powerful Shout. \"Ascension\" is a difficult album to record.

Minnie Pearl once called Porter and Dolly the greatest man\/woman singing team in the history of country music. This CD shows why!\"Porter and Dolly\" has quite a history as an LP. It was the last album the duo never released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty long after their partnership was over. It was originally to have been put out in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, but Dolly's new management team headed by Sandy Gallin convinced RCA to shelve the duet album, citing that its release would hamper the growth of Dolly's new solo career. This did't sit too well with Porter who would go on to close royalties as a singer, songwriter, and producer of the album. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine Porter sued Dolly for three million dollars citing breach of contract and of blocking the release of this very album. After settling out of court for one million dollars, in which Dolly nearly ended up broke, the \"Porter and Dolly\" album was released. The album shot all the way to number nine and had two singles released; \"Making Plans\" hit number two and \"If You Go I'll Follow You\" went to number twelve, indicating the fans still loved their Porter and Dolly.

After two undisputed albums Let's Get It Thug Motivation and inspiration, Young Jeezy was table to achieve for surpass the quality of these two records. The economic downturn is balanced, and timely. As we all know, Young Jeezy is not everyone's favourite tea. It's been four years since Jeezy introduced a lot of stuff, looks, and mixing tapes, and some people haven't even dice yet. It really is a very good package (read well), with a disturbing repertoire, a decent product and something called charm; it\u2019s no surprise that one of the top packages is releasing an album today. While this rhythm is strong, the voices are strong, and the emphasis is clear. With Lil Boosie (why do people sleep in Boosie?!?), Nas (yes, Nas) and Kanye West, and singers Anthony Hamilton and Trey Songz, the number of appearances kept small. Needless to say, Jeezy can control himself. The theme is what you expect from a store store album with certain politics and visibility. There is no doubt that Put On is a monster song, but there is Curculate, Do Not Do It, Crazy World, by Way, Hustlaz Ambition, My President, etc. There is not a single weak song on this album for eighteen. The iTunes bonus song Done Must definitely appear on the album. The production features DJ Toomp, Drum Boy, Midnight Black, Don Cannon, Justice League, etc. Recession is undoubtedly one of the best albums of the year so far (with Lil Wayne, Plies, Nas, Killer Mike, Bun B), and it takes a lot of effort to get it on the album of the year with the top five. conversations With this album, Young Jeezy has made it into one of the top packs of the decade, you should\u2019t miss it.","overall":5,"summary":"Young Jeezy For President!","unixReviewTime":1220400000,"reviewTime":"09 3, 2008"}

They broke for a commercial and this song started, I had to find out the name and who it was by. I have always loved Nelly especially since I heard the song Country Grammar. This song is a little different but it still has that Nelly style to it. You do not have to be a wrap lover for this song, this song will grab anybody's years. It is truly an amazing song.

Carole the songwriter for interpreter had that invisible hook to catch and capture your senses. Wonderful lyrics and fabulous arrangements made C. K.'s sound. And we are talking about the golden and highly inspired decade of the late sixties and early seventies. Singers, composers and bands gave the best they could. Just to cite a few names: Karen Carpenter, Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Joan Baez, Roberta Flack, Janis Joplin, Gladys Knight, Bobbie Gentry, Dionne Warwick, Dusty Springfield for Mary Hopkin still resound in your affective memory. Carole King meant for her generation a true driving force.
