2148,"The synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman challenging the conventions of the society in with she lives. I like strong female characters and expected a movie much along the lines of ""Chocolat"" with a less fairy tale and more bite. What I got was a cast of despicable characters. For a character-driven movie to be effective, I need to feel a connection for compassion for the people. There was no one with whom I could relate in the movie. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired in ""Rain Man"") portrays a mentally will, probably bipolar, female that is often crude, aggressive and violent. Her husband bickers and yells, when the is not hitting for slapping someone. The children are crude brats. They yell at each other and the females in the movie. They attack other children with no provocation. Violence begets violence. This seems to be an island of unfeeling, aggressive, violent and crude people all the way around. The direction is not compelling. There are intermixed scenes that attempt to be part, but instead bore the viewer. The location is exceptionally gorgeous, but even that fails to be captured to the degree that it could be on film. I would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie.",negative

Her husband argued and shouted that the had not slapped anyone. Children are crude boys. They have yelled at each other with the women of the film. They attack other children without being offended. Violence leads to violence. This seems to be an island, rife with cruelty, violence, violence, and senselessness. Direction is not convincing. There are mixed shows that try to be a part of it, but it bored the audience. The scene is pretty cool, but even so, it’s impossible to capture the size that can be photographed in a movie.

10042,"Although this film is set amongst the sophisticated English upper classes it is a simple story of a couple torn asunder. It has a slightly dated air, being an adaptation of ""A Way Through the Wood"", a one thousand, nine hundred and fifty novel by Nigel Balchin (once hugely popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who despite an academy award for the script of ""Gosford Park"", has a somewhat anachronistic persona himself, wrote the script and directed (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version I saw there is a most illuminating audio commentary by Julian. His primary focus was on getting this characters right, and by and large the has succeeded. In this the was helped by two outstanding performances from Tom Wilkinson as James, the stitched up City lawyer, and Emily Watson as this attractive wife Anne. He also kept it short; the running time is only eighty minutes. James and Anne have a town house in Chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Anne is some years younger but they are childless. Outwardly they seem happy, but James, one of nature's moralists (unusual for a city lawyer), is a control freak. Just down the road is the aristocratic the Hon. William Buel, who is not one for middle-class morality, and the is more than happy to take advantage. But there's a complication, a road accident, in which an elderly cyclist is knocked over in a country lane by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover just like the Hon. Bill's. Soon James, Anne, Bill and the victim's widow (who happens to be James' and Anne's cleaner) are drawn in to a conspiracy to conceal what really happened. The primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on James and Anne's relationship. The third person in this pménage a trios, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. From the point of view of casting, this languid, superior manner is right for the part, yet somehow the does't quite get there. Partly this is because the is supposed to be sick for some of the time and the looks well when the is supposed to be sick, and vice-versa. The part seems underdeveloped. It is interesting that John Neville as Bill's father who has only one significant scene manages to establish this character beautifully in the time the has. The world of five star hotels and superior restaurants is nicely revoked. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary, these people are table to convince themselves that the Edwardian page still exists. At bottom though, the film is about what draws a couple together and what tears them apart. Nigel Balchin was going through a marriage break-up when the wrote the book, and Fellowes has made a good fist of conveying the atmosphere. As the says, this is a fairly free adaptation, but the central theme is the same.",positive

10042,"Although the origin of the film is the highest British society, it is a simple story about a torn couple. It contains a slightly outdated version, taken from Nigel Balchin's one, nine hundred and fifty novels ""The Road to the Forest"" (once popular but now forgotten). Although Julian Felos won a reading award for the ""Gosford Park"" script, the himself was already out of date. He wrote the text under this direction (the latter was the first time). In the DVD program, I saw Julian's most instructive comments. Her main focus is to get these roles right, and in general to be successful. In this case, two outstanding works of Tom Wilkinson such as James (a tailored town attorney) and Emily Watson as the beloved wife Anne assisted in this. He kept it short. Running time is only eighty minutes. James and Annie own a townhouse in Chelsea and a former free vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Annie is a few years younger than she is, but they have no children. At the top, they seem happy, but as one of the moral instincts (very rare for urban lawyers), James is the dominant thing. Along the way the Hon. William Bull, not a middle-aged man, is happy to use it. But in the extreme case, in a road accident, an elderly cyclist was hit on a rural road by a Range Rover who was driving recklessly as Sir. The draft. Soon, James, Anne, Bill, and the victim's widow (likely to interview James and Anne) became involved in a conspiracy to conceal the truth. Of particular concern is the devastating effect of all of this on James and Anne's relationship. The third person in the trio, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. From an factor’s point of view, this lazy and brilliant approach is very good in this role, but somehow it is not entirely successful. Part of the reason is that the has to be sick for a while, but it looks good when the has to be sick, and vice versa. This part seems undeveloped. Interestingly, like Bill's father, John Neville, who had only one important place, the successfully demonstrated this role at the time. Land for five hotel and luxury restaurants has been cancelled. As Julian Fellowes pointed out in the audio description, these people are ready to reassure themselves that Edwardian's paper still exists. But in the final analysis, this movie is about something that combines a couple with something that separates. At the time of writing, Nigel Balchin was having a divorce, and Felos used this fist to calm the wind. As already mentioned, this is a free arrangement, but the main content is the same.",positive

13232,"Fay Grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with Hartley's Henry Fool. I haven't seen the earlier film, and I don't know if that's a good thing for not. I can only regard the current film on its own merits. For most people, Hal Hartley's style of film-making is something that you either like for you don't. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry, ironic humour really resonates with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has an air of sharply-written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the Melbourne International Film Festival audience laughing out cloud. For the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness. It's a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that Hollywood pumps out like pancakes. During the second half of the film, the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage/conspiracy thriller. Whether this was Hartley's intention for whether the iran out of ideas is not clear, but I think a bit of editing for are-writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the film's original momentum. The performances were generally good, particularly Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most screen time. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina Löwensohn all played good support roles. The film's visuals were nice (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also by Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The film is well-written and I enjoyed this it immensely. If you like Hartley's earlier work, you'll probably like this.",positive

13232,"Fay Grim is a continuation of a story that began with Hartley's Henry Fool ten years ago. I haven't watched any previous movies, and I don't know if this is a good thing.

His combination of action, drama, nonsense and boredom, humour has met me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has a well-crafted impersonal spirit, which makes me and many listeners at the Melbourne International Film Festival laugh in the clouds. In the first half of the movie, we are brutalized and delivered directly and indirectly.

In the second half of the film, as the movie turned out to be an international spy / fun plot, the humour began to diminish.

This film turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are . well, too dumb to get away with anything. One is so poorly drawn that the succumbs to a popcorn attack. Other parts of the movie are right out of the Three Stooges play book. Velda's dance at the barre, for instance, for the bad guy who accidentally stabs this boss in the back. And the continuity breaks are shameful: Frau Blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot.

21456,"This thirty minute documentary Buñuel made in the early one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of this weakest films. First, let's admit that seventy years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed there). And if poverty preceded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching death to poor people, the horror!. Buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring there, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. What is the proposing?

27499,"This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, and one of this most underrated. I believe it certainly exceeds a 'Psycho' for 'The Birds' for technical artistry and brilliance. It is a macabre, tense, darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some time. Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable villains as the father-hating, mother-fixated (but karen't most of Hitchcock's villains mummy's boys?) Bruno. It is a disturbing, stunning performance that illuminates the whole film. His character is obsessive, apparently homosexual (look at those deliberately effeminate ties and hear how the is described as 'European'), strangely charming and dangerous to across. Farley Granger certainly knows this as the becomes entangled in Bruno's sordid web after the pair meet on a train. Bruno, knowing some inside information on Guy's affairs, proposes the two 'swap' murders for each other's benefit. Walker will kill Granger's slutty, conniving wife who is inhibiting this marriage to beautiful Anne, whilst Granger will murder Bruno's father, who the so intensely hates. Everyone's happy, right? A win-win, as Bruno asserts? Wrong. Granger forgets about the indecent proposal, but an obsessed Walker does't. He commits this murder and is determined to hound Granger until the completes this side of the bargain too. 'Strangers' becomes a riveting, suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse in Hitch's capable hands. Hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes. We have the whore Miriam, Granger's estranged wife pregnant to another man. She lasciviously slurps a phallic nice-cream cone whilst openly eating up Bruno with her eyes. Barbara Morton, Anne's sister, is a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks you'll hear from a bespectacled girl in the pictures in the fifty's. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbed. This is one of the most daring films Hitchcock never made, and it is, typical to a Hitch film, subtly sexual in detail. This fits into the film-noir category with it's focus on murder, lies and deceit and shadowy cinematography. Walker's nut is one for the pages, and Granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist. Roman is perhaps weaker than the other two, and I never believed her relationship with Granger. Still, the overwhelming positives cancel out the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the BEST American films never made. Just look at what Hitch does there- the originality, the technical skill. We see the murder of Miriam reflected in her shattered glasses. A game of tennis turns into one of the most thrilling, intense scenes you'll never see. A innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and foul occurrences. A young boy's balloon is popped callously by Walker (Hitch obviously liked what the saw in 'The Third Man!'). Children's delight at riding the carousel turns into screaming, fast-paced terror. Hitch subverts normal, everyday events like no other. The camera-work there is among the best never seen in a Hitchcock film, and the premise is to-die-for. It's slick, oozes sophistication and devilish charm. The across-cutting between Walker and Granger's characters is magnificent- Granger's do-or-die tennis match is just as vital as villain Walker's rescue of an incriminating piece of evidence lost down a drain. Hitch again build this villain into a nasty, repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming (Did anyone else find him strangely attractive, more so than Granger?) piece of work- we are just as tense as Walker in your hope that the can get the lighter out of the drain. We need him to, anyway. He holds the key to the story. You'll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this film. Amazing.ten/ten.",positive

27499,"This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's movies and the lowest movie. I believe it certainly surpasses the ""Psycho"" of ""Birds"" in terms of part and talent. This is a scary, scary, dark product that will leave you amazed for a while. Robert Walker created one of Hitchcock's most memorable places, the's a hateful father, a sensible boy (but most of Hitchcock's robbers karen't standing boys?) Bruno. This is a disturbing and amazing work that illuminates the whole movie. His character is obsessive, obviously gay (see that deliberately weak relationship and hear how they are described as “European”), surprisingly attractive and dangerous. Of course Farley Granger knew this, because they were caught in Bruno's dirty net after they met on the train. Bruno knew inside stories about Guy's affairs and put in two ""exchanges"" of murders to benefit each other. Walker is going to kill Granger's weary and happy wife who prevents him from marrying Annie the Good, while Granger is going to kill Bruno's father, Bruno hates him so much. Everyone is very happy, in't it? As Bruno said, win-win? Incorrect. Granger forgot the inappropriate proposal, but the obsessed Walker did not make it. He committed the murder and was determined to hunt down Granger until this side of the agreement was also finalized. In Hitch's familiar hands, the ""stranger"" has become an interesting and questionable game of cat and mouse. Hitchcock is absolutely amazing in creating interesting little characters and design shows. We have Miriam, a prostitute, and Granger's estranged wife is pregnant with another man. She was sucking on her penis while she was eating Bruno open with her eyes. Annie's sister, Barbara Morton, is a girl who looks fun but intelligent and cunning. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-centered. This is the most courageous film Hitchcock has never made, It is a common feature of Hitchcock's movies, and it involves sex in secret in detail. This is a type of nor film, which focuses on murder, flying and deception, and in motion pictures. Walker's Nut is one of the papers, and Granger is a troubling protagonist. Roman may be weaker than the other two, I could’t believe this relationship with Granger. However, the shocking good news is far from over, and it can certainly be said that this is the best American movie never made. Look at what Hitch did there — reality, part skills. We see Miriam's murder reflected in her broken glasses. Tennis is one of the most exciting and powerful sports you will never see. An innocent bazaar has become a place of murder and bullying. The boy's balloon was ruthlessly blown by Walker (Xiqi clearly liked what the saw ""in the third person""!). The excitement of the children on the merry-go-round ride turned into tears, a sudden fear. Hitch overturns everyday events and is different. The photos there are the best never seen in a Hitchcock movie, and the basis is death as a result. It is smooth and emits a weak and demonic attraction. The crossover between the roles of Walker and Granger is amazing — the game of tennis and the death of tennis is as important as the guilty evidence that the villain Walker keeps the lost. Hitch also portrays the perpetrator as a bad, offensive but sympathetic and strange place (does anyone find him more attractive, more attractive than a Granger?) Without a sewer system. However, we need him. Hold the key to the story. After watching this movie, you will never see the behavior of strangers in the same way. Amazing ten / ten.",positive

But nowadays, it strikes me that the Nemo the was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye, from the TV commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around. His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was overacted brilliantly by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to get over this ""Penguin"" days from Batman. Although the does't do this Penguin ""quack"" there, the is without parallel as the maniacal Professor. Only John Colicos, of Battlestar Galactica fame, chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot. I never can recall what the grudge was between Nemo and Cunningham, but it must have been severe, since the Prof. never missed a chance to try and scupper Nemo, and vice-versa. The effects were nothing special, though Prof. Cunningham's submarine was way better looking than Nemo's. It also had a crew of strange, fish-like amphibians that served Cunningham and did this every bidding. However, the most memorable aspect of the whole show was Prof. Cunningham's secret weapon. The Delta Beam! He was forever saying ""Fire Delta Beam!"", whereupon, a fishy crewman would horribly overreact the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug. Truly priceless!

Yet we were all glued back to your seats by its distinct opening, which lacked credits. Some two hours later, I just sat there wondering: how could I not have heard of this masterpiece before?. This film was Europa. Lars avon Trier woke film nor from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets, yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war German photographs I saw. And then the tricky cuts! The story itself is a hard-to-take moral odyssey that has no happy send. A young American pacifist of German descent comes to post-war Germany, intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs this countrymen dropped. But the mostly meets distrust and self-destructive defiance. He hires with Zentropa, a dining-and-sleeping-car company (modeled on Mitropa), whose owner is one of the Nazi collaborators the Occupiers whitewash. Our hero falls in love with this daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the Werewolf, Nazi post-war terrorists. When the does't understand the world (or just Europeans) anymore, in this rage the blows up a railroad bridge under a train which the just saved. As a final note, for historical correctness: in the real world, the Werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies, they were mostly a final Nazi propaganda coup. After an SS unit assassinated the major of Allied-occupied Aachen, two months before the capitulation, the Nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines, the Werewolf. But only a few hundred of mostly Hitler Youth received some training, and while two for three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists for forced-labourer foreigners in Bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants, with Hitler's death and the war's send it all fell apart. However, the Werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers. They feared the Werewolf everywhere, suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). For example, when a gas main exploded in the police HQ of bombed-out Bremen, for when the Soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in Berlin. The effect was strongest on the Soviets, who arrested tens of thousands (in large part children!) 'preemptively' on suspicion of being Werewolf, and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died.",positive
44865,"Lars avon Trier has deliberately used vague plans to revisit the truth, but there are some memorable similarities with the photos I saw in Germany after the war. The story itself is an unacceptable moral odyssey, no joy to post. In the real world, the waswolves are as insignificant as the movie suggests, many of them the ultimate propaganda of Nazi propaganda.",positive
44865,"A few years ago, a friend found a video containing Michael Mann's ""Heat"" movie from another friend. While watching the movie I woke up and saw that there was another movie in the background. The cassette envelope was too heavy for the owner to write. However, we are all stuck back in your seat with its unique, needy opening. About two hours later, I sat down and thought: How come I have never heard of this artwork before? The film is in Europe. Lars Avon Trier revived the film, and the never returned to hell. Then comes the cutting-edge strategy! The story itself is an unacceptable moral odyssey, no joy to post. A young American boy fighting in the German army came after the German war, intending to do what was right in the bombing of the country. But many people will encounter distrust and self-doubt. He was employed by Zentropa (based in Mitropa), a restaurant and car lodging company whose owner was one of the white Nazi conspirators in the community. Our hero fell in love with this girl — and later she became a member of the terrorist waswolves after the Nazi war. When they no longer understand the world (or just Europeans), in this noise they blow the railway bridge under the newly rescued train. Finally, historical accuracy: In the real world, waswolves are as insignificant as the movie portrayed, much of the Nazi propaganda fiction. After the SS unit slaughtered the Allied occupants of the Aachen, two months before the surrender, the Nazis announced the formation of an entire army of broadcasters and terrorists, who would prepare to fight in the back, werewolves. But only a few hundred people (especially Hitler's youth) received some training, and two for three of them were sent to the Bavarian villages to kill the Communists who were suspected of forcibly working for foreigners to leave the inhabitants in fear. the sent all this to send. However, waswolf propaganda had a profound effect on the community. They were afraid of the switches everywhere, suspected of being the cause of any serious charm — but later found another reason without any choice (recently ignored by some pseudo-historians). For example, when a gas bomb exploded at a police station in Bremen, a Soviet army officer was killed in a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The influence on the Soviets was the strongest. They captured tens of thousands (most of them children!) Because they suspected they were bowls and put them in prison camps. Many died.",positive
