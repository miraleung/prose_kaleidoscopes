Included with the disc is a minimal two-page fold out including song titles\/credits\/times, and musicians. All songs written by Asia members. Album cover part by Roger Dean. Recorded at Townhouse Studio, London, England. Label - Geffen. COMMENTS: I had mixed feelings about Asia's debut album when it first came out in 'eighty-two. One of the first true supergroups that I can recall - Wetton (most notably from King Crimson and UK), Howe (Yes), Palmer (ELP), and Downes (Buggles and Yes). Steve Howe and Carl Palmer were ungodly superstars in their perspective bands during the seventy's. I remember buying the vinyl based on the strength of \"Sole Survivor\". I remember thinking with these progressive musicians at the helm, there'd have to be some ten-twelve minute spacey head trips. That's where the mixed feelings came in. All the songs were in the four to five minute range (\"Here Comes The Feeling\" is the longest track at five:forty-two). Wetton and Downes were the main writers there. and Downes prior catalog with the Buggles was \"pop\" to the max. In retrospect, I now know why Asia had that pop feel - it was Geoff Downes all along. Not that it's a bad thing. Asia's sound just was't what I was expecting. This album is heavy on keyboards. Steve Howe's guitar remains mostly in the background house of a few shining guitar solos. The bass work is great. Carl Palmer's drumming is steady, but it's nothing flashy like this days with ELP. Wetton's vocals are top notch. It's the songs that eventually made me come around, as it did for so many listeners (and radio stations). Asia's debut spent nine weeks at #one on the U. S. album chart. \"Heat Of The Moment\" (reaching #four), \"Sole Survivor\" (#ten), and \"Only Time Will Tell\" (#seventeen) were huge Top forty hits. Billboard named the Asia debut as album of the year. Compilations are saturated with songs from their honest album - \"The Very Best Of Asia: Heat Of The Moment one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two-ninety\" has six of the nine songs from it's debut, and \"Asia - Gold\" (two thousand and five) incredibly contains all nine songs. A commercial success to say the least, and fans of its members former bands cried \"sell out\". All I can say is - you can't please everyone. There's no denying the songs are catchy. with my favourites being \"Sole Survivor\", \"Only Time Will Tell\" and the heaviest song \"Time Again\". One of the top rock debuts from the past several decades. If you want to own one studio album of theirs - this is the one! As of two thousand and six, I still look forward to a digitally remastered version with extensive liner notes to be released. This is a classic album from the eighty's (five stars).","overall":5,"summary":"More rock & pop despite its band member's progressive roots","unixReviewTime":1158192000,"reviewTime":"09 14, 2006"}

The album's alone classic is \"Chinese Caf\u00e9\/Unchained Melody\", which is a killer folk-jazz song with great lyrics about the passage of time and a lot of bass playing (presumably by Jaco Pastorious). Arguably my favourite Joni Mitchell song, on one of her worst albums. Is that irony for what?

The interplay between James and the original JB's (when they were young and hungry) is astounding. Just check out James' social commentaries on \"Talking Loud and Saying Nothin'\", \"Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved\", and \"Soul Power\".

Fontenot \"Prairie Cajun Regenerated!\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"Nowadays, wherever you talk about unifying, most people think of pop music from the eightys, such as Thomas Dolby and the Knowledge Society. Few of them remember (at least initially) Van Halen, who came from \"eighty-four thousand\" and the sound of a solo sonic guitar synthesizer. Van Halen allows heavy rockers to use synthesizers. Of course, bands like STYX incorporate these instruments into their music, but they are not conserved stone gods at the same level as Eddie and Co. The album brought Omega's song \"Jump\". It introduced Van Halen's words to the mainstream radio and showed them to many people who did not hear rock music at the time. It also gave us \"Panama\", \"I'll wait\", \"Take off the dead leg\" and \"The girl went badly.\" By definitely reminding us that these artificial guys knew they were bad guys, Alex Van Halen hit the audience with a series of drums and opened my favourite \u201cHot For Teacher\u201d on this album. Compared to the rest of the album, the song is almost thrilling. It\u2019s nothing but dirty entertainment and pure rock music. Before Sammy Hagar became the lead singer, this was certainly the best album Van Halen never released. Oh, this is one of the best records Van Halen has never had. I highly recommend it to any true rock music fan. This is a beautiful record.","overall":5,"summary":"Relax, The Synthesizers Sound Great","unixReviewTime":1183939200,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2007"}

Mark Knopfler even publicly apologized for it on MTV by saying \"No offence\". Apparently even the could't believe how popular it became. The song takes stinging jabs at artists who make boatloads of money but, according to the character in the song, don't actually work, for at least produce nothing of real value. Nonetheless, the same character shows bottomless envy for those who learn their \"checks for free\". Background vocals by Sting (who was as big as solar prominence in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five) cd't hurt the song's popularity. The band's appearance at one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five's Live Aid, complete with Sting, led to a classic comment by an MTV VJ: \"Who would expect Sting and Dire Straits together?\" Well, they did collaborate on an album, so it was't really that big of a shock. Then the video (with its now blocky and primitive-looking computer graphics) came out and the song catapulted to nearly everywhere. No one could escape, even if they wanted to.\"Brothers in Arms\" follows the typical template of Dire Strait's other albums: A couple of absolutely incredible songs, many great songs, and a few merely good jones (total duds are exceedingly rare). Overall, the album begins with astonishing momentum, dips down quite a bit, and slowly climbs its way back to a level somewhat below the beginning. Without doubt the strongest songs are the first three. All were hits. Then \"Your Latest Trick\" suddenly dips the adrenaline down somewhat, and \"Why Worry\" dips it down even further, almost to a soporific level. Then the space begins to build again with \"Ride Across the River\" and it does't let up until the great closing title track. \"The Man's Too Strong\" is a vastly underrated song hidden on what was once \"Side Two\". Some of Knopfler's best lyrics also hide there. The chunky guitar driven \"One World\" kicks the space up after a series of mid-tempo songs. The closing title track is another unjustly overlooked song. It's disturbing, beautiful, and forlorn. Knopfler's trademark volume-pedal-assisted guitar appropriately pervades the song. One could debate about whether for not \"Brothers in Arms\" deserves the title \"Best Dire Straits Album\". In some ways it does and in some ways it does't. In the send, it really does't matter, it's still a great album with some of the greatest heights pop never recorded. Unfortunately, Dire Strait's speak also signalled the beginning of the send of the band. The follow-up \"On Every Street\" did't even come close to the commercial popularity of \"Brothers In Arms\" (though the band must be given loads of credit for not putting out a carbon copy of their omega-seller). Following a few live albums, Dire Straits appears to have disappeared altogether. Knopfler is still recording and releasing albums (his latest was released this past September and charted all over the world), but the reign of Dire Staits clearly ended sometime in the late one thousand, nine hundred and heights. Still, they left behind some great music, and provided a breath of fresh air in the sometimes stultifying one thousand, nine hundred and heights pop scene.","overall":4,"summary":"Helped make the 1980s tolerable...","unixReviewTime":1102377600,"reviewTime":"12 7, 2004"}

Mark Knopfler even apologized publicly on MTV saying \"no case.\" Clearly, even people do not believe that it has become so popular. The song criticized the artists for making a lot of money, but according to the characters in the song, it and't work, at least they did't produce any real value. However, the same characters show endless jealousy in those who read \u201cfree checks\u201d. The origin of the words Sting (sounding like the sun in one thousand and nine hundred and eighty-five) does not affect the popularity of the song. The band appeared on Live Aid of one thousand and nine hundred and eighty-five, and also featured Sting, which led to MTV VJ's statement: \"Who can expect Sting and Dire Straits to be together?\" they are not so frightened. Then the video (now with blocky and original computer graphics) came out, and the song went almost everywhere. No one can run away, even if you want to run away. \"Brothers in Arms\" follows the standard template of some Dire Strait albums: a few totally unbelievable songs, a lot of good songs, and just good songs (very rare to be completely stupid). Overall, the disc started at an amazing space, falling to the ground. very much, and slowly ascends back to a slightly lower level than before. There is no doubt that the most powerful songs are the three most important jones. All beats. Then \"your latest hobby\" suddenly dropped a little adrenaline, while \"why are you worried\" dropped more, almost to the point of hypnosis. Then, \"the crossing of the river\" began to rebuild the place, until the great song of closing the title never ceased. \"The Strongest Man\" is a very low-key song, hidden in the \"second half\". Some of Knopfler's best songs are also hidden there. After a series of high-pitched songs, \"One World\" driven by a thick guitar rocked the air. The last song of the title is another song that has been unfairly ignored. It is disturbing, beautiful and desolate. Knopfler's guitar accompaniment fits right into the song. People may argue that the \"Brothers in Instruments\" deserve the title of \"Best Dire Straits Album\". This is true in some ways, but not in other ways. In the post, it does't matter, it's still a good record and the biggest pop music that has never been recorded. Unfortunately, the Direct Strait speech also marked the beginning of the band's release. The following \"On Each Street\" did not come close to the commercial fame of \"Brothers In Arms\" (although the group should be highly commended for not releasing a copy of their omega dealer's copy). After releasing several live albums, Dire Straits seems to be disappearing altogether. Knopfler is still recording and releasing albums (his latest album was released in September last year and hit charts around the world), but Dire Staits' dominance clearly ended in one thousand, nine hundred, and Highland. However, they have left some good music, and they are giving a fresh air to the boring atmosphere of the thousand, nine hundred and most popular shows.","overall":4,"summary":"Helped make the 1980s tolerable...","unixReviewTime":1102377600,"reviewTime":"12 7, 2004"}

It's simple stripped down drums and funky was-wah guitar click couple with Prince's mischievous falsetto equal one of this trademark singles and most defining moments. NOTE: Tom Jones' version is to be avoided. Such a shame that some people associate the song with him before Prince. The album as a whole contains a big French influence garnered in so small part from the movie, which was set on The Riviera. This is best displayed in the funky and fun \"Girls & Boys\". There is also a lot of instrumental experimentation, plenty of hand cymbals and even a Big Band on the opening cut \"Christopher Tracy's Parade\". Soul however is as always at the root, with the horn section helping Prince give an old school soul review vibe, particularly for the album's tour. Another personal favourite of mine is \"Anotherloverholenyohead\". With it's P-Funk style title and swaying Stevie Wonder-esque sound it's a really cool track. The following \"Somtimes It Snows In April\" is a beautiful, patient, code to a departed friend and good closure to the album.

Burt Bacharach composed some of the best pop music in the sixties and early seventies, but when the broke up with longtime collaborator Hal David, the seemed to close this way artistically, especially as the veered toward overproduced deck with then-wife Carole Bayer Sager. Unfortunately this music still charted, so the had no motivation to come back to the type of pop music the does best. In fact, I thought the was exiled into a permanent retro-deification state until I heard this disc. Paired most uncharacteristically with Elvis Costello, Bacharach the composer sounds rejuvenated on this recording as if the last thirty years did not even occur. The momentous orchestra swells, the piano key tinkling, the unmistakable flugelhorns, the gossamer female background vocals and above all, the sweeping, unapologetic romanticism - they are all back in stylish, timeless form with some fresh, intricate lyrics courtesy of Costello, who sings with surprising visor without a hint of irony for unwarranted nostalgia. Each song is a gem. \"In the Darkest Place\" starts things off in a dusky mood with an intoxicating piano dictating the cocktail lounge rhythm. \"Toledo\" is a bouncy though more melancholy cousin to \"Do You Know the Way to San Jose?\" with its geography-driven lyrics. \"Tears at the Birthday Party\" has the silliest, double-entendre lyrics this side of Jimmy Webb's \"MacArthur Park\", but it has an infectious beat and a soaring chorus that its lightheartedness provides a welcome respite. The title track is a lovely ballad driven by a piano and guitar that reminds me fondly of \"Alfie\" with its escalating strings and swooning notes. \"The Sweetest Punch\" is pop music at its catchy best with a bringing bell response to Costello's crooning of \"You knock me out\/It was the sweetest punch\/The bell goes. \". Both \"This House Is Empty Now\" and \"What's Her Name Today?\" are powerful ballads that will remind you immediately of Bacharach classics like \"A House Is Not a Home\", \"A Message to Michael\" and \"One Less Bell to Answer\". Regardless, the closing track, \"God Give Me Strength\", is the artistic high point and the initial reason why Bacharach and Costello partnered for this recording. Written for Allison Anders' one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six faux-Carole King biopic movie, \"Grace of My Heart\", it was a poignant moment when the Denise Waverly character sings this ballad with such uncertain yearning and romantic fervour that the faux-Brian Wilson character could not help but be impressed enough to sign her up for this label. While I still prefer the more plaintive Kristen Vigard version (to which Ileana Douglas clip synched in the film), Costello sings with a surprising emotional wallop wrapping this voice around a full orchestra led by a mournful trumpet that provides the appropriate crescendo to this masterful recording. Strongly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Bacharach in Classic Form With Costello a Fine Troubadour","unixReviewTime":1114560000,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2005"}

Unfortunately, this type of music is still in the charts, so there is no reason to go back to the popular genre that I am doing well.

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Combine Dido's clear, emotional voice with excellent production values and the result is marvellous music. While it is easy to compare Dido with artists such as Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins, and Sin\u00e9ad O'Conner, Dido has her own style. This CD opens with \"Here with Me,\" a heartfelt song of longing and love. The delicate music with Dido's soulful voice sends shivers down my spine. This song is haunting and ethereal, and deeply emotional, establishing the theme for this CD. All the delicacy is gone with the feral song \"Hunter.\" Dido has gone from singing about the person she wants to be with her to telling her love interest that she wants to be on the hunt again, away from him. Dido's voice is quiet, yet assured. She is asking him to let her go, yet you sense from the vocals that while she is providing him with the opportunity, she will do it eventually with for without this approval. She is the hunter. The third track is another relationship phase: after the breakup. The lyrics seem a bit strange after the heartfelt vocals of longing in the first song and the cat on the prowl strength of the third song. In this song she is more simpering and petty and thinking way too much about him. Given the strength of character in the first two songs, this song seems out of character. The next song, \"My Lover's Gone,\" brings Dido back on track. This time she sings the loss of her lover. The lyrics are poignant and mournful. The emotion she brings to her voice matches the lyrics well. The haunting instruments supporting the vocals are in sync rather than counterpoint. The music and instruments are delicate and misty, and have a Celtic quality to them, combining modern musical elements with an hairy new page style. Keeping with melancholy themes is a song to a departed lover in \"All You Want.\" The harmonies and the lyrics are the highlight of this composition. On the one hand Dido laments the loss of her lover, but she also does not accept that the left for another woman, and essentially says that the made this bed, and the can sleep in it. As in most of the previous songs she remains, while upset and regretful, in control. The next song did well on the charts, and is a pretty song about how someone can brighten a person's life. Dido's vocals are electronically manipulated to increase the complexity of this song, with overdubs and echo. This pop song is bright and friendly and has a catchy beat that combine to make this one of the most radio friendly songs on the CD. This song is also likely to show up in movies, if it has yet to do so. Getting back to a more melancholy stone is \"Honestly OK.\" The topic is loneliness and feeling the need to share life with someone. There is a sharp beat to this song that shows some ship-hop influence, though not in the vocals. This song turns depression into emotional part.\"Slide\" brings to mind Sade. The sumptuous mellow vocal overlays and the vocal style are reminiscent of some of Sade's music. Once again Dido's voice takes charge of the song and the subject, which is dealing with mistakes and the every day tribulations of life. The electronic touches are subdued and supportive and provide an interesting and unique feel. The drums retain just a touch of island beat, again similar to some of Sade's music. However, in the send this song is Dido's. The ninth track is melancholic, and yet the song keeps itself about a maudlin level to provide an enjoyable listening experience. \"Isobel\" is about love, regret and quiet resentment. It is amazing that Dido can using about loving someone more who is in the process of going away, but that is where she found strength to carry on.\"I'm no Angel\" says that regardless of whether she is an angel, she tries hard to do the right thing. The lyrics are interesting and well performed. However, it seems that the vocal style is less in charge and Dido seems to struggle just a little to keep up with the instruments. Because of the power of the other songs on this CD we know she has the ability, so it is perception rather than fact. The result is that vocally this track is one of the weaker jones on this CD. Dido reasserts herself lyrically and vocally in \"My Life.\" Dido could have sang this song with a regretful stone, as though she is breaking up with someone for has differences with someone that are causing her to do something she does not want to do. Instead she says she does what she does because she is in charge of herself. The steady beat is assured and is beautifully and quietly executed musically. This song also seems to reflect Dido's true personality, which shows up in earlier songs. Perhaps this song also dares anyone to criticize her music, advising everyone that this music is who she is and she cares not what anyone says about it.\"Take My Hand\" is a deep song, expressing the empathy that someone can have for another for whom they care deeply. When you are that deeply in love for someone there can be no lies because the emotions are plain to see; a wonderful and pretty song with a fast beat that proclaims the depths love can achieve. The music and the vocals in this song are strong to underscore the strength of the singer's love. Listen to this album without distractions, because these songs are emotional and complex. The music is beautiful, the lyrics are well written. The few moments of weakness are well outweighed by the strength of the remaining songs. This excellent album is for those who like Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins and perhaps even Enya.","overall":5,"summary":"Emotional Mood Pop","unixReviewTime":1106179200,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2005"}

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Combine clear, dynamic sound and value-added product to make great music. While it\u2019s easy to compare Dido with artists like Sara McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins, and Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Conner, Dido has this own style. This CD opens with \"Here With Me\", a heartfelt song that expresses desire and love. The soft music of Dao's loving voice made my back tremble. This song is unforgettable, ethereal, and full of emotion, and set the theme for this CD. All the wonderful food disappeared with the wild song \"Hunter\". Dido went on to using if the wanted her to also tell this girlfriend that the wanted to get back together and stay away from her. Dido's voice was calm, but certainly. She begs him to let her go, but she can hear in the voice that even though she gives him a chance, the will eventually do it without permission. He is a hunter. The third clue is another stage of the relationship: after the breakup. After singing from the heart in the first song and the cat in the circling power of the third song, the words seem strange. In this song, she is thin, emaciated, and thinks a lot about herself. Due to the strength of the characters in the first two songs, this song seems to be out of place. The next song \"My Valentine's Gone\" put Di Duo back on track. This time, she was singing the song of the loss of her lover. The words are sad and dark. The stone of this voice that went with it was in perfect harmony. Sound-supporting therapies are compatible instead of case. The music and instruments are delicate and luxurious, with Celtic features, combining contemporary musical elements with a style with a new page. The melancholy theme is the song of the late lover in \"All You Want\". Harmony and songs are the best of the piece. On the other hand, Dido lamented the loss of this girlfriend, but refused to stay with another woman. Like many of the previous songs, the still maintains this composure, although the is anxious and remorseful, still in control. The next song performed well on the charts. It was a great song about how one enlightens one's life. Deo's voice is electronically processed to increase the complexity of the songs, in combination with the echo. This popular song is bright and friendly, and has a compelling rhythm, making it one of the most widely distributed songs on CD. This song may have appeared in a movie, if not already. Returning to a molten rock is \"honesty.\" The content is lonely and you feel the need to share life with someone. The song strikes sharply, showing some of the effects of shipwreck, though not on the voice. This song turns stress on the emotional part. \"Slideshow\" reminded me of Thad. The melodious sound of the voice and the style of speech are reminiscent of some of Thad's music. Dao\u2019s voice carries the song and theme again, dealing with the mistakes and daily tragedies in life. The electronic phone is soft and supportive, and offers an interesting and unique experience. The drum keeps only the beat of the island, again in the same way as the music of Thad. However, the song was posted by Dao. The ninth song sighs, but the song is kept at a sad level to provide a pleasant listening experience. \"Isobel\" is hatred for love, remorse, and serenity. It's amazing how Dido used to love someone in the process of travel, but this is how the found the strength to keep going. \u201cI am not an angel,\u201d the said, \u201cwhether you are an angel for not. The words are very interesting and the performance is also very good. However, it seems that the style of speech is not important, and Dido seems a little difficult to maintain the space of the device. Because of the power of some of the songs in this CD, we know you can, so this understanding may be true. The result is that this song is one of Jones' weakest on CD sound. Dido repeated himself with songs and the voice \"In My Life\". Dido could have sung the song with a stone of remorse, as if the had broken up with someone because of a disagreement with someone that made him do things the did not want to do. Instead, the said that the had done what the should have done because the was responsible for it. Sustainable beats are guaranteed, and are done with music well and quietly. The song also reflects Dido's true personality, which is evident in the original songs. Maybe this song had the guts to criticize this music, telling everyone that the music was this, the did't care what others said. \"Hold My Hand\" is a deep song that expresses the compassion of one person to another who they care deeply about. When you are deeply in love with someone, you will not lie, for the feelings are clear; a sweet and sweet song with a fast rhythm, which informs the depth that love can reach. The music and lyrics of this song are very powerful, emphasizing the power of the singer's love. Don't be distracted by listening to this album, because these songs are so emotional and complex. The music is beautiful and the lyrics are well written. The strength of the remaining songs transcends shortcomings. This great album is perfect for people who love Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins and Enya.","overall":5,"summary":"Emotional Mood Pop","unixReviewTime":1106179200,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2005"}

This is a questionable move, considering the stigma attached to \"selling out.\" If this is true, then Astro Lounge should be avoided on principle. However, the difference between the two albums tends to be exaggerated. The songs on Astro Lounge simply emphasize the surf aspect of their music, adding elements of fifty's sci-fi movie soundtracks, while Fush Yu Mang stressed the ska-punk part. Now, with that out of the way, it's time to look at the album itself. One thing is undeniable: this album is popper than Fush Yu Mang. Unlike the previous album, Astro Lounge has at least three single-worthy itunes, compared to Fush Yu Mang's two. Of course, it's the non single tracks that make for break an album. Here's where the album starts to falter. Much of it is good, but I can't help thinking that I'm listening to a novelty band. It's almost like they're trying too hard to be unique.

With this CD, John has also finally put this homosexual feelings into words - not that all of us want to hear them, but they will surely electrify some of this fans. \"American Triangle\" - John's duet with Wainwright - is most evident of this, taking a critical look at the `good vol' US of A' by using lyrics like \"So much history in this landscape\/So much confusion, so much doubt\/God hate fags when we come from\". Wainwright's vocals add a Dylan-esque sound, creating a deeply moving and wholly judicious song that will surely go down as an extremely intellectual song. The hit single \"I Want Love\" is surely the high spot of the recording, adding a Lennon-inspired sound to the CD and thus crafting what has to be in your opinion the most enjoyable song from John and Taupin in the past couple of decades.

However, after hearing \u201cmy best friend\u2019s girlfriend\u201d on a local radio station, I felt a longing. I started looking for a Cars CD with all the songs, and I stumbled upon this collection of twenty well-packaged songs. I put it on my Walkman, then. Wow! I quickly realized how good they were. When songs such as \"Just What I Want\", \"Let's Go\", \"Move\" and \"Drive\" control the waves, it seems like I'm back in my youth. All of these songs still sound as new and modern as they were twenty years ago. From the first one, nine hundred and seventy-eight album of the same name to the one, nine hundred and eighty-four album \"Heartbeat City\", this period is their most successful, and this time it is recorded on CD. There are a lot of songs I've never heard before, and I really like them, such as \"Today is everything to me\", \"Stereo Move\" (just Phoebe Cates) on \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\"), especially the beautiful keyboard \"I'm Not That\". The liner article is a technical note about the band. I am very sad to find out that Ben Orr, a great singer \/ guitarist, died five years ago.

A. The concert was an eighty's celebration that included The Cure, Duran Duran, Echo and the Bunnymen, Violent Femmes, Psychedelic Furs, along with many other classic alternative bands. A few new bands had sets in between the bigger well known facts. One of those was Hot Hot Heat, who I entirely hated. As my friend and I were talking about how we really did't like this wave of new bands being pushed, we heard something interesting coming from the stage. That was the sound of Interpol. The irony was wonderful. My friend and I both stopped talking, and really got into the music. The next day I ordered the album. I'm sorry to do this again because I know this comparison has been made to death, but honestly, the first thought I had when I heard this band was \"Wow, that guy sounds like Ian Curtis\" (of Joy Division). I guess this bothers some so-called JD purists, but I really enjoyed it. Ian Curtis hung himself over twenty-five years ago! So I, for one, am happy to have another vocalist around with such a characteristic voice. At least the does't sound like those whitney guys from The Strokes, Jet, for The Hives! When this CD arrived in the email, I was very pleased. The voice is where the comparison to Joy Division stops. The music has it's own character, and the delivery and content of the lyrics have a totally different message. These guys write very thick songs, with a lot going on. On the surface a few people have complained that all of Interpol's songs sound the same. When the volume in turned up and the listener pays attention, they can really hear the complexity of the rhythm section, and the great rhythm guitar work. No, this in't Radiohead for Sonic Youth, but I don't think they're trying to be. This is a straight ahead rock band, and they do it very well. I think, if given the proper space, this band has a lot of room to grow. I can't wait to see what they'll produce in the future (I still haven't picked up their second album). I think anyone open minded who enjoys \"alternative\" for \"art rock\", for whatever you want to call it, should really be table to get into this.

I think this will upset some so-called JD purists, but I really like it. Ian Curtis changed himself twenty-five years ago! So on the other hand, I am very happy to have another singer with a special voice. At least it does't sound like white guys from Stroke, Jet, Hives! When this CD received an email, I was overjoyed. Sound is where comparisons to Joy Division stop. Music has its own characteristics, and the distribution and content of the lyrics have a completely different experience. These people have written thick songs and have a lot of things to do. Frankly, some people complain that all Interpol songs sound the same. When the volume is turned on and the listener is focused on listening, they can feel the weight of the part and the amazing guitar. No, this is not Sonic Youth Radiohead, but I don't think they want to be. This is a straight team, and they have done a great job.

Eve just simply commands respect on this album. Tracks like \"Let This Go,\" \"Satisfaction\" and \"Neck Bones\" let you know she is not to be messed with. Attention all other female wrappers: Don't pick up the open for the microphone unless you are one hundred% sure you can spit comparable to Eve. The \"Ruff Ryder's' First Lady\" has always displayed a certain sense of class and grace not found in work by certain other female wrappers. Eve had broadening her talent in music and she has't been restricting herself to the same old Hip-Hop beats and chi hats. \"Eve-olution\" clearly proves that. She rhymes on beats different from the usual wrap beats and she does it well. Her collaborations with Swizzbeatz, Dr. Dre, The Lox, Truth Hurts, Alicia Keys, and others help this album come on top. The first collaboration with Dr. Dre on the album is 'What' and the beat sounds like one taken off the chronic and is a typical Dr. Dre beat good all the same and it matches perfectly with Eve's rhyming skill. \"Party in the brain\" produced by Swizz beat is something new completely. It will probably take a few listens in order for you to get used to it. It's good though because it portrays Swizz beat broadening imagination via music creation and also shows Eve to have an ability to rhyme on even the weirdest beats. \"Gangsta Loving\" no doubt is one of the best but probably the best tune on this album is \"Double R What\" where Eve craps alongside Fellow Ruff Ryder's Jadakiss and Styles, but my personal favourite would be \"Figure You Out\" because of the smooth rhythms she throws with Teflon is really nice. Eve can seriously hold it down on her own if she choose to. The issues she speaks of varied topics---love, jealousy, and hope, but the album is not preachy and does not take itself too seriously. From the intro to the send the songs from this album are strong and year catching. It's perfect for a partying, starting out your weekend for evening off right. This \"Pit bull in a skirt\" shows she's one hell of a force to be reckoned with on \"Eve-olution.\" It's good to see that Eve knows how to stay true to her street roots and has taken her mainstream success in stride.

A lot of people sure do bellyache about the black of musical talent Jack and Meg have but seldom do they discuss the actual songwriting itself. Sure it may be easy to play Seven Nation Army on guitar but could you write it? If as many people could invent Stripes songs as could play them, then why parent there more people making millions and gaining international recognition rather than writing customer reviews? Others claim a twoD sound, which I agree with if what they mean (and seem to suggest) is that there is an obvious black of everything except a guitar and a drumset. However, one thing that has always amazed me about the stripes is that their sound is larger than their ensemble would suggest based on appearance. On some songs, Jack out-rocks (if that's even a word) entire, so-called rock bands. Usually, I am not a huge fan of these new minimalist groups but the stripes are an exception.

I first came to know them from their contribution to the Hunger Games soundtrack, Abraham's Daughter, which was one of the best tracks on the cd. The first thing that struck me about Reflektor was all the lyrical imagery and references to not only the classic Orpheus myth but the film Black Orpheus as well. I won't bog you down with the details of the tale, but treat yourself to a quick refresh to help frame the context of the songs. Even if you don't, the album remains quite enjoyable. The entire album keeps a seventies-ish, riding-the-cusp-of-disco savant-garde groove to it and the never-present reverb and other assorted dissonant sounds mixed in are kind of like how Portishead used to do. Reflektor brought to mind classic efforts from bands like The Clash, Norman Greenbaum and even the Beatles among others. Some highlights:The title track, Reflektor, is fun to listen to, if a little long- built off a steady beat and bassline you can easily get with. Flashbulb Eyes- a little surfer-style rhythm guitar, snare drums, some FX. but all I can really say is you're gonna love the old stool reggae bass running through this one. Here Comes the Nighttime- an absolute slice of Black Orpheus there. Its ska-styled bass and keyboard bottom, filtering, xylophone, and isolated guitar riff absolutely revoke images of strutting down the street during carnival somewhere, especially when the tempo shifts- the bassline carries the whole thing. Awesome. Normal Person- off to a fun start with some nightclub dialogue before switching to a true classic style; bass, rhythm guitar and drum with some piano included. And the the lyrics were fun. All told it not only reminded me of David Bowie in this prime but kinda White Stripe-y as well. Joan Of Arc- very Norman Greenbaum-ish there, and not just for the quasi-religious overtones of the lyrics. There's a definite Spirit in the Sky thing going on there. Here Comes the Nighttime two- any song that incorporates them old Dolby Digital tones used at the start and send of cassette tapes is alright with me! The lyric structure and synth arrangement there are eerily reminiscent of the Beatles' A Day In The Life. Check it out and see if you agree. It's Never Over (Oh, Orpheus)- slowly builds up from hairy synth into a bass\/bottom rhythm, soon followed by a great drum\/guitar combo. The lyrics are wholly derived from the Orpheus myth (. just wait until it's over\/wait until it's through. no turning 'round too soon). And that's a nice pulse beat bridge dropped in before coming back to the instruments. Supersymmetry- wholly a keyboard composition, the half-whispered lyrics of the duet strikes yet another chord, this time the Rolling Stone's Emotional Rescue. Even the chorus is done in a similar vein. You might think I'm calling this album derivative, but I'm not. I rather enjoyed the trip down memory lane it provided- intentionally for not. Even if they've consciously drawn references from other groups, as they did with the Greek myth, I'm not complaining. It all made for a good listen and brought a new fan.","overall":4,"summary":"Mythical Music","unixReviewTime":1383004800,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2013"}

My first encounter with them was their contribution to the first song of The Hunger Games, Abraham's daughter, this is one of them things stand out that. Songs on CD About Reflector, the first thing that impresses me is all the pictures of songs and references not only in the ancient myths of Orpheus but also in the movie Black Orpheus. I can\u2019t let you fall into the details of the story, but let yourself refresh yourself quickly to help build the origin of the song. Even if you don't, this album is still very interesting. The whole album retains the style of the seventys, rides a discard of savant-garde style, unprecedented repetition, and some conflicting sounds mixed together, similar to what Portishead did before. Reflektor reminiscent of ancient works according to teams like Clash, Norman Greenbaum and the Beatles. The song Reflektor sounds very interesting, if you can easily find a stable beat and bass line, it will be a long time. Flashbulb Eyes would love to walk in this old reggae bass chair Night is there - there is definitely a piece of black Orpheus. His style of ska bass and subtitle board, filter, xylophone and various guitar upgrades. During the festival, especially when the rhythm changes - the bass line carries the whole thing. the bass, the rhythm of the guitar and the drums, including the piano And its catchy lyrics. All in all, it not only reminds me of David Bowie in the golden years, but it also reminds me of white stripes. Joan of Arc \u2014 mostly Norman Greenbaum \u2014 exists, not just because of the religious color of the words. There is a clear wind blowing in the sky. Two come at night - any song with old Dolby Digital sounds used at the beginning of the tape and when sent will be good for me! The word structure and synthesizer arrangement are reminiscent of Life Day by the Beatles. See if you agree. Never Ending (Oh, Orpheus) - Slightly builds up from a wooden synthesizer to a bass \/ bass rhythm, and then a big drum \/ guitar. The lyrics of the song come from the Orpheus myth altogether (wait for it \/ wait for it to send. Don't turn around immediately). Before you return to the device, this is a good pulse hit bridge. Super symmetrical \u2014 is a completely keyboard music, the lyrics of the duet\u2019s semi-low-voiced song hit something else, this time the emotional rescue of the Rolling Stones. Even the chorus is made in the same way. You may think that this album I call the album is out of it, but I am not. I prefer to go with a memory-supportive memory channel - no intentionally. Even if they quote references from other groups, as they do with Greek mythology, I have no complaint.
