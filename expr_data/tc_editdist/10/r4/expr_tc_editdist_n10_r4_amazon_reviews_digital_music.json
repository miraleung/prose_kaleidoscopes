There is deep emotion in this playing, but always of a controlled kind, and in remarkable taste. He certainly is one of jazz's greatest masters, and this work, when it is at this best, as there, is truly fulfilling. The other musicians on these two tracks are pretty well on a par: Monk very definitely so, playing just as indivualistically and profoundly as Davis. It is an interesting note that these were the two tracks where Davis told Monk to stay silent while the was soloing, which Monk did not appreciate. In truth, though, Davis was probably right to think that both the and Monk would flower forth more when presenting their own solos, and at the send of the day I feel it is Monk who plays the second track more differently from the first than does anyone else. Jackson is also in great form: dazzlingly fluent without superficiality, swinging with great refinement and assurance. The other tracks, i.e. \"Oleo\" etc., are played without Monk and Jackson: thus Horace Silver stars on piano, in this typically \"funky\", particulate and soulfully driving way, and Sonny Rollins is also heard to great advantage, though this best work was still to come (which means that the is already no less than excellent there). The bassist, throughout, is Percy Heath, and the drummer Kenny Clarke, and they do very fine work on all the tracks.

Some of the singers in these two songs are good: Monk is real, plays independently and as deep as Davis.

But in reality, Davis thinks Monk will be more productive when the shows their own games. It would be correct, and when it was posted that day, I felt that Monk's second song was played differently from the first track. Anyone. Jackson's condition is also very good: it shines smoothly but it is not realistic, fast, very good and content.

Six months prior, she had released A Star Is Born, which was her greatest box office film success to date. The accompanying soundtrack was Number one for six weeks, (the longest running Number one album of her career) which included her co-penned opus \"Evergreen,\" which also learned her an Academy Award for Best Song after spending three weeks at the pole position on the Billboard Hot one hundred. By one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, Streisand was still delivering an album a year, but the fact that she delivered Superman just six months following A Star Is Born was extremely unusual, especially since the soundtrack was still bring high on the charts. The pop success of Streisand was now in full gear, and the songs on Superman were further proof that Barbra, a singer who barely scratched the pop singles chart a decade earlier, was now encroaching into new territory, and radio was finally embracing her. The press dubbed the six-month releases of A Star Is Born and Superman as \"Streisand's one-two punch!\"There were't many female singers (if any) that could release an album that carried a title such as \"Superman\" - and yet it seemed appropriate. Streisand was known for her chutzpah, and her pose on the album cover wearing a skimpy pair of white short-shorts with a tight white it-shirt emblazoned with the Superman logo seemed absolutely fitting. The title and the photo suggested that the queen of entertainment also had balls. And as successful as her career had been prior to 'seventy-seven, she seemed to have reached an even higher speak. It was fascinating to her fans and infuriating to her detractors. Now that I've exhausted the packaging and multiple interior Steve Schapiro photos of the empowered Streisand, let's get to the music. Streisand had finally delivered an entire pop album that was consistent and one that absolutely suited her. The songs ranged from pop ballads such as the hit single, \"My Heart Belongs To Me\" which reached Number four on the Billboard Hot one hundred, to gorgeous sonatas including \"Love Comes From the Most Unexpected Places,\" which was co-written by the prolific Kim Carnes, to rock and roll. From the opening title track, Streisand's vocals soared so effortlessly above the clouds, that when she sang the lyric \"I'm Superman\" with such conviction, you believed she WAS Superman! The entire album is so much fun; it's like cotton candy at a summer carnival. The only exception would be \"Don't Believe What You Read.\" Even though the track was co-written by Streisand and the lyrics were terrific, elucidating the details of her life in the tabloids, the steely rock guitar chords absolutely lacked a hook while repeating a monotonous rhythm. On the other hand, one other song that was co-written by the songbird was the gorgeous ballad \"Answer Me,\" which was originally written for A Star Is Born. Although, it did't make the final cut to the film and soundtrack, it luckily ended up on this album. Upbeat rhythms such as \"I Found You Love\" and \"Cabin Fever\" captured Streisand's playful side, and since she succeeded so well in this genre on \"A Star Is Born\" (despite what many critics said) it was a given that she continued to show off her versatility as a first rate vocalist that could capture just about every style of music. Speaking of versatility, she even sang a brilliant cover of the Roger (\"King of the Road\") Miller country-tinged ditty, \"Baby Me Baby.\" Two very bright highlights were the albums final two tracks, Billy Joel's luminous \"New York State of Mind\" and Rupert Holmes' divine code to independence \"Lullaby For Myself.\" Billy Joel was said to be \"over the moon\" with Streisand's dazzling rendition of \"New York State of Mind\" that the later commented, \"My mother now knew I had made it because Barbra Streisand had recorded one of my songs.\" Barbra Streisand had made it alright. She had conquered just about every medium of entertainment; it was just a matter of time that she dominated the world of pop music.

Six months ago, the released A Star Is Born, which was this biggest film success in the office to date. The accompanying soundtrack is the number six album, (the longest running album number of this career) which includes the opus they wrote \u201cEvergreen,\u201d which also won the Academy Award for Best Song after spending three week in column position. on the Billboard Hot hundred. One thousand, nine hundred and seventy -seven, Streisand is still releasing an album of the year, but the fact that Superman spa for it six months after the Star was born is remarkable, especially since the music is in the chart still. . Streisand\u2019s pop success is now in full swing, and Superman\u2019s songs are further proof that Barbra, a singer who barely scratched the pop of her pop ten years ago, has already flooded the earth. before, and finally the radio was over. The media called the six-month release of A Star Is Born and Superman as \"Streisand's one-two punches!\" yet seems appropriate. Streisand is known for this chutzpah, this album cover-up look with a pair of short white shorts with a tight white shirt with the Superman logo emblazoned on it looks perfect. The title and photo suggest that the entertainment queen also has a ball. No matter how successful the was in this career before the seventies, the seemed to have reached a higher level. It was attractive to its fans and infuriated the founders. Now that I\u2019ve finished packing and lots of photos inside Steve Schapiro\u2019s mighty Streisand, let\u2019s move on to the music. Streisand finally released an entire pop album that was consistent and none of them matched it. Songs range from popular singers to the single-hit single, \u201cMy heart is mine\u201d which reached number four on the Billboard Hot Hundred, and beautiful sonatas including \u201cLove comes from places I don\u2019t know. expect, \"they wrote together. Kim Carnes, to shake and roll. From the trajectory of the opening title, Streisand\u2019s voices echoed in the cloud, that when the sang the song \u201cI\u2019m Superman\u201d with such a sentence, you believed it was Superman! The whole door was very interesting; like cotton candy for the summer carnival. The only exception is \"Don't believe what you read.\" While Streisand\u2019s way of writing and the lyrics together is beautiful, explaining the details of this life in the tabloids, the metal guitar strings completely close the hook by repeating the creative rhythm. On the other hand, another song written by song bird is a beautiful album called \u201cAnswer Me,\u201d originally written for A Star Is Born. Although, they did\u2019t do the final cut of the film and music, but luckily it ended up on this album. Beats like \u201cI Found You I Love You\u201d and \u201cCabin Fever\u201d captured Streisand\u2019s team, and because of its successful win over \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d (although many critics said it) it was a hit . because the continues to show this effectiveness as a first-class vocalist who can handle any type of music. Speaking of talent, the even sang a beautiful cover for Roger (\"King of the Road\") tiny of Miller's ditty country representative, \"Baby Me Baby.\" Two things that really shine are the latest albums on both tracks, Billy Joel's bright \"New York State of Mind\" and Rupert Holmes's sacred freedom code \"Lullaby For Myself.\" Billy Joel is said to be \u201cabove the moon\u201d along with Streisand\u2019s stunning translation of \u201cNew York State of Mind\u201d who later commented, \u201cMy mother now knows I did it because Barbra Streisand recorded one of my songs. \" Barbra Streisand is good. They succeed in almost every kind of hobby; it was just a time when the ruled the world of pop music. If I chose one word to describe Streisand Superman, it would be \"confidence.\" This is truly one of the best albums of Streisand\u2019s production.","overall":5,"summary":"Superman Soars!","unixReviewTime":1126310400,"reviewTime":"09 10, 2005"}

Scene","helpful":[9,16],"reviewText":"When an album sells somewhere around thirty million copies and it is the biggest selling album in the history of the music business, it does garner my attention. Therefore, separating out Michael Jackson's personal life from this music - I deed to review this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two release \"Thriller\". Looking at this album strictly from a creative musical standpoint, I do think this album is overrated. For this album, Jackson and producer Quincy Jones assemble a powerful team of musicians. These musicians - while very talented probably were't the reason why this collection became the monster-selling album that it became. Simply put, this album sold because it came along at the right time - and was marketed very well to fit in with the times. The musicians that contribute to this album are big names. There probably karen't many names bigger than Paul McCartney. McCartney is well known for this entertaining duet with Jackson on \"The Girl is Mine\". However, there are many other big names that contributed collection as well: James Ingram (background vocals on \"Wanna Be Starting Somethin'\", songwriter of \"P. Y. T. (Pretty Young Thing)\"), Toto's David Paich (an arranger on \"The Girl is Mine\", Synthesizers on \"Human Nature\" and \"The Lady in My Life\"), Mega-producer David Foster (Synthesizer arrangements on \"The Girl is Mine\"), Vincent Price (provides the famous sinister 'rap' on \"Thriller\"), Eddie Van Halen (a guitar solo on \"Beat It\"), Toto's Steve Porcaro (Songwriter of \"Human Nature\", Synthesizer on \"Beat It\", \"Human Nature\", and \"The Lady in My Life\"), Toto's Steve Lutkather (Guitars and Bass on \"Beat It\", Guitars on \"Human Nature\"), Toto's Jeff Porcaro (Drums on \"Beat It\", \"Human Nature\", and \"The Lady in My Life\"), and LaToya and Janet Jackson (background vocals on \"P. Y. T (Pretty Young Thing)\" Finally, acclaimed keyboard player and studio musician Greg Phillinganes (who worked on Lionel Richie's \"Cant' Slow Down\" and Donald Fagen's \"The Nightfly\" - two outstanding albums in this era) contributes to several of the tracks on the collection. As for the Toto band members, I do feel their contributions are overlooked. They had only one year ago released their own critically acclaimed album - \"Toto IV\" and now they were working on \"Thriller\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" - two of the largest selling albums of this time period. I don't feel it was Michael Jackson's vocals for any of the outstanding talent that helped this collection become the blockbuster seller that it became. This album was released in December, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. This was a time the music industry was undergoing change. This was the beginning of the page of music video. I give Michael Jackson and this management team credit. They take what I consider a mostly average set of songs, but they marketed it with some very clever music videos. Say what you want about Michael Jackson's music - but the did make the most of this medium. The videos basically became a marketing machine for this album - and it resulted in seven Top ten hits of the nine songs on \"Thriller\" in the United States. (The title track \"Thriller\" is probably the best example of this). There are several reasons why this album is \"average\" at best:- The Percussions are awful. Despite having one of the best drummers and musicians in the business in Toto's Jeff Porcaro, this album basically takes a bunch of music and puts a disco dance beat behind them. There is very little in the way of any solid drumming on this album.- There is little in the way of any cohesion on this album. Yes it did have a mixture of styles (the Rock-edge on \"Beat It\" to the R&B; Style of \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\" to the campy \"The Girl is Mine\"). A lot of times this happens when there are \"too many cooks in the kitchen\" - while there was a vast array of talent, I do feel that eventually this impacted the final product (even Quincy Jones could't fix that).- There is nothing groundbreaking in terms of the music on this album. Yes, the music videos were groundbreaking - but not the music.- One thing I discovered is that Michael's songwriting did't really shine. I thought it was the songs written by \"outsiders\" that were better. The Steve Porcaro \"Human Nature\" penned song is probably the strongest effort on the collection. Rod Temperton is very underrated on this album. Many people don't realize that the wrote the \"Thriller\" track (while it in't my favourite, it is probably the only innovative track of the collection). Temperton also wrote the two underrated R&B; itunes - \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\". As for the positives:- The strong points are the contributions of the Toto band members. As mentioned, \"Human Nature\" is probably the strongest track. While I've never been a fan of \"Beat It\", there is some good instrumentation in there. I actually feel if \"Beat It\" was just done as an instrumental without the disco beat - it would sound good.- Eddie Van Halen does give a terrific solo on \"Beat It\".- If you are a Synth-Pop fan, this album (with the exception of \"Beat It\") is going to provide plenty of it. The liner notes include all of the lyrics and do a good job at providing musician and songwriting credits. Overall, when I look at this collection - I just don't think it is the greatest album of all time. I would even say that for the year it was \"Album of the Year\" that The Police's \"Synchronicity\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" were miles ahead of \"Thriller\". The bottom line is that if there were no music videos, this would have been just another heights Synth-Pop album. If you are curious on what all the hype is - then you may want to get this collection - otherwise I don't recommend it.","overall":2,"summary":"Came along at the right time - but not a lot of substance","unixReviewTime":1110153600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2005"}

So, to dive Michael Jackson's personal life into this music \u2014 I decided to check out the one-eighty-two \"Thriller\" released. A closer look at this album from the perspective of music creation, I think this album is full of more. In this album, Jackson and producer Quincy Jones make a strong band of musicians. These singers - although very talented, may not be the reason why this list has become the best-selling album. In short, the album sells well because it appeared at the right time - and it sold well to keep up with the times. The musicians who contributed to the album were all great names. There may not be many bigger names than Paul McCartney. McCartney is famous for her role with Jackson in the film \"My Girl\". However, there are many other great names that have contributed to the collection: James Ingram (the origin of the consensus \"You want to start something\", songwriter \"PYT\"), David of Toto Paper (The arrangement of \"Girls\" is mine \", synthesizer of\" Humanity \"and and \"The Lady in My Life\"), lead producer David Foster (set of \"My Girl\" synthesizer), Vincent Price (co-star of the famous \"rap\" on \"Thriller\"), Eddie Van Halen (guitar solo on - \"Beat It\"), Steve Porcaro by Toto (song and song \"Creation of Man\") Author, synthesizer of \"Beat It\", \"Creation of Man\" and \"Lady in My Life\"), Steve Lutkather of Toto (guitar and bass in \"Beat It\", guitar in \"Man's Creation\"), Toto Jeff Porcaro (drums \"Beat It\", \"The Creation of Humanity\" and \"The Lady in My Life\"), and background origins with LaToya and Janet Jackson (\"PY T (Pretty Young Thing) \"Keyboardist and studio artist Greg Phillinganes (who participated in Lionel Richie\" Cant ' Slow Down \"and Donald Fagen's\" The Nightfly \"- two great albums at this time) many songs in the series As for the members of Toto, I feel like their contribution is ignored. They only released their best album - \"Toto IV\" last year, and now they're doing \"Thriller\" with Lionel Richie's \"I Can't Be Slow\" - two of the best-selling albums of the time. I don't think it was Michael Jackson's singing about any great talent that helped the series become the best buyers. This album was released in December, one thousand nine hundred and eighty-two. A time of change in the music industry This is the beginning of a music video page. I believe in Michael Jackson and the management team. They used what I think is a collection of popular songs, but they used some very clever Encouragement Say what you think of Michael Jackson's music \u2014 but they used the full subscription. These videos became the selling machine for this album - leading to American \"Thriller\" seven of the top ten songs in nine songs. (The title track \"Thriller\" may be the best example) There are many reasons why this album is such an \"average\" perfectly: -Percussion is terrible. Oto Jeff Porcaro of soto has one of the drummers and musicians in the industry, but the album uses music and disco dance behind them. There is no solid cover on this album. -This album is not cohesive. Yes, it combines different styles (\"Beat it\" rock style to R&B; \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\" style to bumpy \"The Girl is Mine\"). Many times this happens when there are \u201ctoo many chefs in the kitchen\u201d \u2014even though there are so many talents, I feel like this affects the final product (even though Quincy Jones can\u2019t solve this problem). -There is nothing concrete about the music in this album. Yes, music videos are basic \u2014 but not music. -The only thing I found was that Michael's song did't shine. I think songs written by \"outsiders\" are better. Steve Porcaro's song \"The Nature of Man\" could be the most powerful work on the list. Rod Temperton is underestimated in this album. Most people don't realize that the \"Thriller\" track is made by them (although it's not something I like, it may be the only new way in the list). Temperton also wrote two low-profile R&Bs; iTunes- \"Baby Belongs to Me\" and \"The Lady in My Life\". In terms of benefits: -Profits are contributions of Toto band members. As mentioned earlier, \u201cpersonality\u201d may be the strongest track. While I\u2019ve never been a fan of \u201cBeat It\u201d, there are some good tools in it. I honestly think that if \u201cBeating\u201d was done just like instrumental music without disco songs \u2014 it sounds good. Eddie Van Halen has provided a big solo in \"Beat It\". -If you are a fan of pop music, this album (with the exception of \"Beat It\") will provide a lot of content. The liner notes include all the lyrics and do a good job of providing the musicians and songwriting credits. Overall, when I look at this album \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best album never. I would even say that this year's \"Album of the Year\", police \"Synchronization\" and Lionel Ritchie's \"Can't Slow Down\" travelled miles ahead of \"Thriller\". Most importantly, if there is no music video, this will be another pop-up album. If you are interested in all the hypocrisy - you may want this list - otherwise I would not recommend it.","overall":2,"summary":"Came along at the right time - but not a lot of substance","unixReviewTime":1110153600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2005"}

First the single \"Against all Odds\" in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four that was film music and then Easy Lover with Phil Bailey and \"Invisible Touch\" with Genesis that was released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. The music on this album was still horn driven with drum solo's but it was the purest of this pop albums, with more positive sound even if it had some great ballads the had left the dark territory of bitterness and self pity. The album starts with the effective pop song \"Sussudio\", the myth asa that the was listening lot to Prince's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine album while touring and wanted to release something on the line. This uptempo pop song was one of this biggest hits. \"Only You and I know\" is a very catchy song with synths and horns, feels a bit dated today but it's a good pop song just the same. \"Long Long way to go\" is a slow ballad like song that features a guest appearance from Sting. Yes you heard right!. \"I don't wanna know\" is a uptempo song, although it discusses the issue about a breakup where the woman wants him back while the's done with it. \"Cos I don't wanna know No, I don't wanna know, She can cry all she wants, She's not gonna bring me back, no no\". \"One More Night\" was also one of the singles from this album, it's also a ballad about this divorce, when the tasks for just \"One More Night\".\"Don't Lose My Number\" is a catch uptempo song with percussion and synths. I was single released maxwell and a decent hook, but not as deep as many of the other contemporary songs. \"Who Said I Would\" reminds a bit of Sussudio, it deaures horns and is also a funky uptempo. The hook is the weakness though but musically it's great with a good horn solo. \"Doesn't Anyone Stay Together Anymore\" is a midtempo song about breakups. \"Inside Out\" is a semi-ballad with a powerful chorus. Features a great guitar solo. \"Take Me Home\" is perhaps the best song there, it got this hypnotic percussion sound in the background, the song itself is a semi-ballad that could have been released much later (it sound like a ninety' song). It's almost six minutes long. The album ends with \"We Said Hello Goodbye\" Beatles inspired title?, however it's a classic ballad without too many cathy instruments used. Overall, this was this most commercial album and this biggest success maxwell.

This English Scruffy group sexually supported Chair Handy and made it one of the best rock albums. At a time when female artists had to become green disco singers (Exception Heart), the chair completely broke old peas and ushered in a new era for female artists. She teamed up with artists like Pete Benatar and Patty Smith to make fun music for free women because it was't sex. Remember the old quote from Pat Bennett \"You broke my heart and I will kick you **\"? Chrissy reached the send of the degree. The \"hypocrites\" combined hard rock and pop to make it feel so flawless that the band never came close to matching it. From the sweet anticipation of \"Brass In Pocket\" to the cool dismissal of \"Up The Neck\" (\"Everything was great. The running of the machines\"), Chrissie has honestly brought in the same amount of solid and tender. James Honeyman Scott really helped toss the riff behind almost every song, as Martin Chambers and Pat Freunden's undeniable power - listen to the bass in \"The Weight\" - as a rhythm band. (And why did Demet, James, and Pete have to do the OD themselves? When will we learn?) There's a Honeycomb bonus CD about the release of this double disc. You get songs that were't on CD before (Save Pirate Radio), \"Porcelain\" and \"Cuban Slide.\" Demos are interested in how much they have changed before their first album was released. I laughed when I heard the words \"Roxanne\" before the \"Kid\" demo and was surprised that \"Pocket in Brass\" started with a low speed number. The live track shows the hypocrites in concert as fanatics. The package itself is a blast, including the characters! (I think I've been singing the wrong words all these years.) All the machines were there. Even on one occasion when Nick Lowe joined the producer, \"Stop Your Sobang\" could not break the collaboration of The Kinks Core album. It's a timeless start, with Tom Petty, Elvis Costello, standing by Jackson and Carson's first attempts of the season.","overall":5,"summary":"Gonna make you, make you, make you notice","unixReviewTime":1186790400,"reviewTime":"08 11, 2007"}

You can only imagine what the light show (if there never was any) must've been like while they were blasting through this. Their choice of a Sun Ra cover is remarkable, because it reveals a musical diversity you don't exactly glean from a first listening of this album.

Also, \"Starship\" takes some patience to get through on the first and second listening--a true freakout in every sense of the word.

The Brown Album(from what I have heard) blacks the energy and creative that makes Primus so great. This record shows defence energy in comparison, but blacks the technical precision that Seas of Cheese, Soda, and Punchbowl have. So what do you have there? I cracked up Primus with its biggest commercial appeal yet(ironically titled Anti-Pop). Now before you hit that negative feed back, consider some of these little titbits:one) Go back to Cheese and listen to the song Eleven. You know why its called Eleven? Because what you are hearing is a eleven\/eight! Weird time signatures used to be key Primus element. That's a lacking part of Anti-Pop.two) Rhythm - The bizarre rhythms are gone. I guess that had something to do with the odd time signatures but I miss the bouncy beat of \"Welcome To This World\".three) Producers - Embracing some artists, Primus took on slew of Producers for this album(Morello, Durst[Yuck!], Copeland, and of course Waits). Their influence shows up and makes this album more accessible than any previous record. And yet, I can still say that this is one great recording. The Bass riffs are still jaw dropping. Ler's guitar playing just keeps getting better. And Brain may still not have made himself of Herb caliper yet, but the's damn good there, adding a nice textured player of drums to the already dense wall of noise. The funk tones there seem stronger than before(certainly a good thing). The only thing is that it really seems like Les is running the well dry for lyrics, that sometimes overshadow the music. This is decent first cutting for beginning Primus fans. Its easy enough to listen to and has some high caliper musicianship. But incompareson to their early stuff, this is not their best. Still, its better than most . out in the music industry today.

Now, before you get the wrong answer, please consider the following tips: a) Go back to Cheese and listen to this eleventh song. Do you know why it is called eleven? Because what you heard was eleven \/ weight to'clock! The unusual time signature was once a priority for Primus. That is the missing part of Anti-Pop. B) Rhythm - A strange rhythm disappeared.

By this I mean that bands that are identified with the genre generally think about the way in which they can perform complex musical material in a live situation. Battles' \"supergroup\" pedigree includes death rock monsters such as Don Caballero and Helmet, and as a critical fan of so-called \"math rock,\" they have piqued my curiosity since their first EP. However, I never bought any of their albums. Then I saw the video for \"Atlas,\" and this curiosity became a fascination. I have long been a fan of King Crimson circa one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, and it seemed like Battles engages contemporary technology and virtuosity in the same way that Fripp and co. did on \"Discipline.\" I immediately bought \"Mirrored,\" and in the final weeks of two thousand and seven, it shot up my personal \"album of the year\" charts. What is really fascinating and ultimately satisfying about \"Mirrored\" is unravelling its tapestry of execution. I love to contemplate \"who\" is playing \"what.\" This form of listening is particularly stimulating when you have a band full of multinstrumentalists that sample, loop, tap, and generally thrash their way through their work. As usual, the most publicly accessible song on the album is not necessarily the most representative. I think that \"Atlas\" is great. The video reflects the energy and experimentalism of the band very well. However, there are songs on the album that show \"Atlas\" to be the \"single\" that it is. \"Tonto\" is a beautiful piece of work, as is \"Race: In\" and \"Tij.\" \"Race: Out\" is a fun \"whack-a-mole\" game of \"who is playing what\" and \"Bad Trails\" shows Battles' potential for more atmospheric work. The only work that I could offer any critique for is \"Rainbows.\" It is wonderfully epic, and covers a great amount of musical ground, but seems a little repetitive. The same seven-minute song could potentially be done in five. The slowdown: Battles creates highly active music that is satisfying on intellectual and accessible levels. To the passive listener, \"Mirrored\" may bring to mind the work of savant-garde DJ's, like DJ Shadow for BT. For the more invested listener, Battles' potential for mind-boggling virtuosity, a la King Crimson for Don Caballero, is similarly compelling. A quick YouTube search will confirm this - I dare you to check it out.","overall":5,"summary":"Is it live....or is it Battles?","unixReviewTime":1199404800,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2008"}
