22940,"Where to begin? This film is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful game of rugby, however, if you live outside the US and do follow the game, it is laughable. Various rugby traditions such as the ""Haka"" which is preformed by the New Zealand ""All Blacks"" and only by the All Blacks. The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer. The film itself is quite well directed however it is the poor script and over-all execution that lets it down, heavily. Taking into account is is based on a real story, it does posses a great deal of clickés in the storyline. I would strongly suggest that any American interested in rugby watch this film then watch what rugby actually is on Youtube because the rugby portrayed in this film has been distorted and skewed so far from what it really is.",negative
22940,"Where to start? If you are not familiar with interesting football games, this movie is very interesting, but if you live outside the United States and follow the game, it is funny. Various rugby traditions, such as ""Haka"" have been adopted by New Zealand's ""All Blacks"" and all Blacks. The leader of the Haka group is often a member of the group with the best Maori family. This is the most important piece in modern drama, but it has been criticized and represented by the author. The director of the film himself was very good, but the bad script and overall implementation made it a great disappointment. Considering that it is based on a real story, it has many clicks on the story line. I strongly recommend any American who is interested in football to watch this movie, and then watch the actual football situation on YouTube, because the football shown in this movie is disturbed and deviated from its true appearance.",negative

27744,"Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday thirteenth and other summer camp slashers. This movie has everything - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called ""Camp Blood"", the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all. The whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on thirty-five hmm film with acceptable Special Effects. But instead the Special Effects are poorly done. The killer walks around as if the's out on a Sunday afternoon stroll, and the only good things about this movie are the acting of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning.

33265,"It has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film. Initially, I was struck by the stylized sets, but found the rest slow going and dull. I thought that such a sensational subject needed the Ken Russell treatment to take it way over the top. I now find the enforced restraint (placed on the production by Mishima's widow) to be an asset. Some of the more lurid aspects of Mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by corresponding themes from this novels. I think it helps to be familiar with the novels - that's what finally made the difference for me. Still feel the film overall could be a little tighter and warmer, but it's genuinely unique, and deserves serious attention. Love the fact that the Japanese characters speak Japanese - not English. The Philip Glass score is mesmerizing.",positive

Some of the most terrifying events of Mishima's life are repeated and modelled on the related themes in the novel. I think it helps to get acquainted with novels — that’s what makes me different in the send. I still feel that the whole movie is compact and hot, but it is unique and worthy of consideration.

Some of the most tragic aspects of Mashima's life are repeated and copied through the themes that accompany the novel. I think it helps to get acquainted with the novels.

36204,"This movie is like the thousand ""cat and mouse"" movies that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies) There is the passionate, wise main character, this goofy but well-meaning sidekick with this will-placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable ""unlikely"" love story, the loved jones taken hostage, and of course the careless evil adversary with this brutal minions. Everybody has seen tons of these movies already, and ""National Treasure"" is like any one of them, with only a slightly modified wrapping. Every turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you I am not the sharpest tool in the shed). I am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theatre from a Hollywood movie, and if you have never felt that way too, heed my warning; stay miles away from this movie.",negative
36204,"This movie is like thousands of ""cat and mouse"" movies before. (The following may seem like pirates, but it only describes a great variety of movies) There is an interesting, intelligent character, this stupid but well-intentioned comrade, this kind of comedy, which begins to be full of hatred but quickly seduces the bright lady who caused the inevitable love story, beloved Jones. and the is certainly a careless evil opponent with this cruel minion. Everyone is watching a lot of such movies, ""National Treasure"" is like any other, only slightly modified packaging. Each cycle of the story is easy to predict (I assure you, I am not a sharp tool in the shed). I'm tired of feeling trapped by money after leaving a movie theatre in a Hollywood movie.",negative
36204,"This movie is similar to the previous thousand “cat and rat” movies. (The following may sound like a spoiler, but it really illustrates the large players of the film) but it quickly softens the beautiful lady who is inspired by the inevitable “inevitable” love story, the beloved jones are kidnapped , and of course the vicious and reckless enemy at the same time the ruthless workers. Everyone has already seen this film, and “National Treasure” is the same in each of them, with a slightly altered recording. Each around of the story is easily predicted (and I can assure you that I am not the sharpest tool in the flood). I’m tired of feeling like I cheated on money after I left the stage for a Hollywood movie, and if you haven’t felt that way yet, listen to my warning; stay away from this movie.",negative
36204,"This movie is similar to the thousand ""cat and mouse"" movies that preceded it. (The next one may sound like a joke, but it actually describes a great movie series.) Trying to put in hateful comments but soon softens a pretty girl who leads an inevitable ""impossible"" love story, Aziz Jones is kidnapped, and a vicious rival detaches from these cruel children Is. Everyone has seen these films, and the ""national treasure"" resembles any one of them, with a slightly altered wrapper. Storytelling was easily predicted each time (and I assure you I'm not the fastest shed tool). I'm tired of feeling cheated with money after coming on stage from a Hollywood movie, and if you have never felt that way, listen to my warning. Stay miles away from this movie.",negative
39484,"This was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. Excellent performances from a marvellous A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back. I could't help but care about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will blow you away, as will the young man playing the young lead. I also thought that the set design was top-rate. The viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented. The music is a blast, too. Nice selections to represent mood, time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypic but the delivers some great songs. This is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings. Take the time to watch it!",positive
39484,"This is definitely the best movie I've never seen. The excellent performance of the top A-List players will make you go from smiling to laughing to tears. I can’t help but care about the character. Ms. Merkson surprises you, with young people playing the main character. I think the set design is high. Audiences are really set in the description of each season. The music is very interesting. The right choice of shape, time and place. Blind blues are accurate, but they provide beautiful songs. This is a great story that will survive many repeated shows. Take a moment to look!",positive
39484,"It was one of the best movies I've never seen. Great game with a good list of characters that will take you from smiles to laughter and tears. I could't help but take care of the characters. Mrs. Merckerson will blow you away, as the young man in front is playing. I also thought the design set was too much. As presented, the audience is kept within each period. The music exploded again. A good choice to represent mood, time and place. The blind man is stereotypical but performs some good songs. This is good news that will be missed many times. Take a moment to watch it!",positive
39484,"This is absolutely one of the best movies I have seen. Great performance from the amazing A-List cast that will take you from smile to laugh to tears and back. I can’t help but take care of the staff. Si Ms. Merkerson will blow it up, as well as the young man playing the youth lead. I also thought the design style was great. The viewer is really immersed every season as it is presented. The music is also explosive. Great choice that represents the mood, time and place. Predictable blind but offers great songs. This is a good story that survives many recurring theories. Take the time to watch!",positive
12261,"This comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it, surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff. Just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time. And the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this, for they were simply making it all up as they went along. (*one/two)",negative
12261,"This comedy has some really interesting elements, and there are a lot of interesting things around it. Almost every show featuring castle attendants and their stupid stuff is a waste of time. And the plot is absurd, which makes people wonder if they fixed this script before they started shooting, because they just did everything that was going on. (*One two)",negative
12261,"There are some funny things to be tolerated in this comedy, which is surrounded by a lot of unpleasant things. Almost every scene that touches the castle staff and their jokes is a waste of time. And the plot is so funny that it makes you wonder if the had the script before the started filming, because the was doing everything. (* And two)",negative
12261,"These comedies contain funny and tolerant material, surrounded by a lot of painless stuff. Any appearance involving the castle slaves and their stupid ankles is a waste of time. The trick is so boring that it makes you wonder if they’re actually preparing a note before they start filming it, because they simply fix everything while on the go. (* one two)",negative
46581,"I've never watched a file in a language I don't understand just because I wanted to see the movie and I could't find it with English subs. I don't know how much I missed but it was't much. Probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. I want to mention to The Diceman from Germany there's no reason to feel that the 'sucks' when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. Like I said, I don't understand Japanese -or at least only the very small amount I came away with from reading the very lengthy novel -pro- baby my favourite all time book which I could not put down & took the next day off from work just to finish reading! I don't know if there's an English dubbed for subbed version but if the film but if there is I'd love to see it. The film was incredible in Japanese anything better is icing of the cake!!

46581,"I did't see the file in a language I did't understand, because I wanted to watch this movie, but I could't find English subtitles. I don’t know how much I missed, but not so much. It can be certain details that sound absurd until you see the level of emotion in the movie and the way the characters communicate. I want to mention the German Diceman that there is no reason to feel ""bad"" when we talk about the emotional power of this movie. Like I said, I don’t understand Japanese — for at least read a little bit about reading long-beloved baby novels, my favourite book of all time, I can’t put you down to rest at work the next day End of reading! I don't know if there is an English version called English, but if there is this movie, but if there is, I'd love to watch it. This movie is amazing in Japanese, and the best part is clicking a cake! ! Slainte ', Maegi",positive
