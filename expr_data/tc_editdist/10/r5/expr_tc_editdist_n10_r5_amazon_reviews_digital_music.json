Ashford & Simpson, Michael Masser and the Chic team, Nile Rodgers and the late Bernard Edwards produced the lion share of these selections. As much indication of her artistry, as it was a message that was apropos for one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, coming after the questioning turmoil of the sixty, she transformed, \"Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand), an anthem of unity that became a standard almost by her force of will. Beginning with \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\", the majestic masterpiece that became her honest #one. Prior to that, she performed \"Reach Out and Touch\" as an important addition to her career. Ashford & Simpson produced her first run of hits including the entire debut album. They would be pivotal through most of her career. This would also be her first solo Grammy entry. Her one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one hot streak was led by \"Ain't No Mountain\", an award winning television special and soundtrack, \"Diana!\". The streak would continue with her sensational movie debut. She took the painstaking jazz classic, \"Good Morning Heartache\" into the Top forty. The scene in the movie where she performs the song, could have made a compelling music over. Michael Masser would spearhead the next hot streak from her #one movie and soundtrack, \"Lady Sings the Blues\". She would return to the #one spot on the Hot one hundred with her second Grammy entry with the smash album of the same name, \"Touch Me in the Morning\". Masser would also write and produce the #one AC hit, \"Last Time I Saw Him\", included in this Greatest Hits retrospect. As Masser brought her back to the pop charts after her movie debut, the would spearhead her next #one leading into her next movie with the theme song from \"Mahogany\". Ross had won a Golden Globe and nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for \"Lady Sings the Blues\" and then nominated for a French Oscar, The Cesar for \"Mahogany\". The theme song \"Do You Know Where You Are Going To?\", would sail to #one in January one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, and also learn an Oscar nod for Best Song. Masser's brilliance would continue with the beautiful, \"I Thought it Took a Little Time\" that also rose to the top of the AC radio charts. As summer was rolling in, the iconic \"Black\" album would astound with the dance classic, the #one \"Love Hangover\". Music was changing and Ross and her creative team changed with the times. Rounding out the send of the seventy, and her first solo Greatest Hits would be a return to Ashford & Simpson as they delivered the very personal, #one \"The Boss\", unarguably considered her finest work of the decade. New hot producers, the Chic team, Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards would take her into the next decade with two #one pop\/dance \"Upside Down\" and \"I'm Coming Out\", a top five smash that would become anthemic. It would become her biggest hit to date. Only to be usurped by the five time Grammy nominated, Lionel Richie penned and produced \"Endless Love\", thirty years later selected as Billboard's Best Duet of All Time. And then Michael Maser would close out the decade with the movie theme song, \"It's My Turn\" and become another Top ten smash. So the seventy, was the decade of Ashford & Simpson, Michael Masser, Rodgers & Edwards (Chic) and Lionel Richie. This album went platinum and joined the list of several albums Motown released to capitalize on her RCA debut including \"To Love Again\", \"Diana's Duets\", etc. The seventy was the decade of the Love Goddess as her sold out concerts were as much musical events, as they were like sixty love-ins, fans would leave her concerts related with positive vibes!","overall":5,"summary":"A Brilliant Reflection of her first Decade as a Solo Mega-Star","unixReviewTime":1310688000,"reviewTime":"07 15, 2011"}

It\u2019s a feeling to know that the music you want to listen to has finally been recorded and released, and to know that other outsiders feel the same way you do! I remember many times, being against welfare, not going out with my friends, sitting inside and listening to this album over and over again! In the opening talk, \"The Land of Idiot\" sets the stage. The windy air, electronic beats and the real Marr guitar all play a role. Sumner's words also mean more than usual, perhaps removing the pressure from the new command camp. All in all, an amazing album, with the exception of special songs, is all a listening experience. Go ahead and regain the feeling of \"ninety-one\".","overall":5,"summary":"A classic from Manchesters finest","unixReviewTime":994032000,"reviewTime":"07 2, 2001"}

He would become know by many as the greatest wrapper never. While this is always in debate few can find reason why the should be considered any less than one of the greatest. No doubt two Pac is emotional, but the starts this tragic career with a more conciseness message. twoPacalypse Now is raw and powerful, and glimmers with the depth that two Pac possesses.two Pac was aiming at something much more grander than what the accomplished in this later albums. He addresses this life as the has lived it, a day-to-day struggle. He spins the trials and tribulations of this life into vivid story lines. He addresses very pertinent issues pertaining to the black race, with this main focus being directed towards the unwarranted targeting of black males by the police. two Pac does't flash out with unbridled danger, as the seems to do when the was under the death row persuasion. Instead the tells this stories in a calm and intelligent manner, one in which the clearly makes an effort to make the craps understandable. There is absolutely no bling bling in this album, its all real, and two Pac does't glorify the streets instead the tries to uplift them. two Pac's social conscience comes off as genuine and the does it without an excess of violent undertones.two Pac definitely tries to become a uniting force for young black youths, especially for those who struggled on the streets. Tracks like \"Words of Wisdom\", and \"Violent\" are powerful Public Enemy rescue songs, blunt and meaningful. His skill for storytelling comes out all over this album, in tracks like \"Brenda's Got A Baby\", \"Pat Time Mutha\", and \"Soulja's Story\" tell about tragedy, and ghetto desperation with terrific word play by twoPac. Few tracks could qualify as party songs, which I applaud. two Pac's theme is real and not influenced by the record industry. Something that I believe severely affected this later albums. Unfortunately social relevance does't sell fifteen millions records. This album also blacks a strong radio worthy hit. The music on this album is rough around the edges and blacks experience. But it has a lot of great moments. two Pac himself is noticeably young. His style is very unpolished and sounds a bit like beat oriented party wrap. Even though this was one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two the does kind of sound like a stereotypical eighty's wrapper. But as we all know this style expands marvellously in years to come. Even on this album the does show signs of range. He craps in a very slow and punctual manner but does have tracks where the craps very quickly mixing some of this rhymes much more closely. two Pac's powerful presence on the mic is noticeably missing, but this is mostly due to this inexperience. The sound of this album reminds me a lot of Ice Cube circa one thousand, nine hundred and ninety. His beats are obviously west coast, but do have some recognizable New York influences. His beats are not overly deep and banging. And they black a bit of creativity. But they are perfect for the time period. His beats are heavy on simple drumbeats and looping synthesizers. I must be honest I'm not blown away by any of the beats on this CD, at least not as much as some of this later tracks where they can literally send chills down your spine. They do suffice and at least show this hard edge but emotional approach to story telling in an upbeat while not overly violent way. I can definite feel what two Pac is tying to do there, even though I'm not overly impressed with the actual music the lyrical aspects are astounding and well worth the listen. This CD does't really break much new ground and is sonically inferior to many other CDs out there then and now. It facts better as a prologue to this later efforts and a terrific beginning to a dramatic career. Its strength lies solely on two Pac's ambassador to the streets storytelling.","overall":4,"summary":"THE BEGINNING OF AN ERA.","unixReviewTime":1133740800,"reviewTime":"12 5, 2005"}

He will be called by many people to be the greatest packer. While this is often contradictory, few people can figure out why it should be considered the greatest. There is no doubt that these two Pacs are emotional, but they started this sad work with more information. Two Pacalypse Now is old-fashioned and dynamic, and shines with the depth of the two Pacs. The Pac dual goal is a much more desirable goal than was achieved on recent albums. You see this life as a healthy life, a daily struggle. He puts the sufferings and tribulations of this life in clear stories. He addressed relevant issues related to black racing, focusing on the undoubted targeting of black men by the police. The two Pacs did not appear to have been dishonestly dangerous as they were begged to die. Instead, they tell a story in a calm and clever way, in which they make a concerted effort to make the roll of the dice understandable. There\u2019s no hitting the record, everything is real, and the two Pacs did\u2019t decorate the streets, but try to improve them. Pac's two social consciences are real, and that does't mean a lot of violence. The two Pacs will certainly strive to be a coalition of black youth, especially those struggling on the streets. Reports such as \"Words of Wisdom\" and \"Violence\" have powerful songs to rescue the enemies of the public, direct and meaningful. Her storytelling skills are everywhere on this album. In tracks such as \"Brenda's Got A Baby\", \"Pat Time Mutha\" and \"The Story of Soulja\", she tells of the tragedy and despair of the shacks with Pac's iconic word games. Few songs could be party songs, and I appreciate that. two. Pac's content is authentic and is not influenced by the recording industry. I think this has greatly influenced recent albums. Unfortunately, social fitness has not sold the fifteen million records. The album also broke into a powerful radio station that deserved to be beaten. The music for this album is hard on the edges and dark experience. But it has many good times. two. Pac is clearly new. His style is very complex, and it sounds like packaging a team focused on hitting. Although this is nine hundred and ninety-two, it sounds like a paper roll from the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. But as we all know, this style will increase dramatically in the next few years. This disc also shows border markings. You move the dice slowly and on time, but there are some repertoires where a roll of dice quickly emerges other rhythms closely. The power of the two Pacs on the microphone is clearly lacking, but this is largely due to inexperience. The sound of this album reminds me of about one, nine hundred and ninety Ice Cubes. His hit is clearly the West Coast, but it has a clear New York effect. His beating is not very deep and it is possible. They built a little. But they are very good this time. His beat is hard on simple dramas and loop synthesizers. To be honest, I haven't been table to beat any of the beats on this CD, though it was't as cold as some of the latest songs. Enough is enough, at least show this kind of difficult but interesting way of telling stories, telling them hopefully but not in a violent way. I can definitely hear what the two Pacs are going to do there. This CD did not break new ground, and the sound quality was not as good as many other CDs right now. After all, it is better as a prelude to later efforts and a good start to a great career. Its power lies entirely in the representatives of the street narrators of the two Pacs.","overall":4,"summary":"THE BEGINNING OF AN ERA.","unixReviewTime":1133740800,"reviewTime":"12 5, 2005"}

For one thing, this compilation was made before the Think Tank album came out. Thus, the somewhat significant Blur hit \"Crazy Beat\" is not featured on the Best of Blur: a shame since I would consider it to be a pretty good song by the band. Also, my three favourite Blur songs are not featured on this CD (I'm Just A Killer For Your Love, Brothers & Sisters, He Thought of Cars). I strongly believe they bought to have been included, though, because these tracks seem to most clearly display Blur's skills in that they all have amazingly catchy rhythms, dandy lyrics, and are completely original and unique. Contrary to what others say, I don't think Blur is anything like Oasis. Sure, they're both British, but Blur has much more originality, more noise, and a bit more cleverness (although I do really like Oasis too). Anyway, the Best of Blur does have its upsides too. It does after all include the non-album song \"Music Is My Radar\", and compile a few of the band's best songs. There is of course the track that made them famous: \"Song two\", as well as their mellow yet really good song \"Coffee and TV\". Some selections are really crappy, though, such as some of Blur's weakest attempts at soft songs (No Distance to Run, To the End). When push comes to shove, though, this is a quite commendable \"best of\" CD that Blur fans bought to try out for the hard to find single \"Music Is My Radar\" (although it's not that great of a Blur song) as well as for the Live C. D. that comes with it, if you choose to check that version out .","overall":5,"summary":"Five stars, duh","unixReviewTime":1133481600,"reviewTime":"12 2, 2005"}

Sure, there are parts where Jack and Meg let loose in the cacophonous blues rock they're known for, but this time around it's been balanced out with a generous helping of songs dominated by piano. Even songs like \"The Nurse,\" which contains mostly marimba and maraca, showcases just a few blasts of insane drums and guitar. One of my favourite songs on the album, \"Little Ghost,\" is an old-time bluegrass-styled tune. Then there are songs like \"My Doorbell\" and \"The Denial Twist\" where guitar has been effectively replaced by the piano, with the keys expanding upon what the guitar would normally cover. All that aside, Get Behind Me Satan is definitely a good album. The duo's songwriting has continued to evolve quite nicely, and Meg is showing noticeable improvement as a drummer, even offering up some fairly interesting, if still simple, beats. The overall sound is well-polished without being slick, and the subtle embellishments, like odd vocal spanning, instrumental flourishes and background ambience added in throughout, help the songs without being distracting. When all is said and done, this is most definitely a White Stripes album, and despite all the changes and revolutions they've made, they still retain the excellent songwriting and awesome guitar work that got them where they are.- Rob ReevesSynthesis.net","overall":3,"summary":"review from the Synthesis","unixReviewTime":1121126400,"reviewTime":"07 12, 2005"}

That's Riiiigght! Got to get my had clubs up like dat box Young Jeezy! Dem Boyz N Da Hood are really something serious. P Diddy found himself a gold mine with this group. They have the potential to put Bad Boy back on top. Hailed by Diddy as 'The New NWA', they look to make a mark on the industry. For a new group we got to do a run down of the characters before we get into the album.-First up we got that box J-O-D-Y Breeze, the youngest wrapper out the group from Griffin, GA. Discovered by Jazze Pha and is also signed to Pha's record label ShoNuff records with Ciara (you seen him in that Ciara video). He'll drop a solo album pretty soon with the singles AK's & Chevrolets and Stay Fresh a true classic pippin song. He's the most playalistic out the group.-Next up dat box Young Jeezy (Heeeeeyyyy). Young Jeezy has the biggest buzz out of Atlanta since T. I. first dropped. His mixtape Trap Or Die is an halftime classic on par with T. I.'s Down With The King. He's the most clever and witty out the group and has the best delivery and most easily recognizable voice (Yeaaaaaahhhhhh). He is the star out of the group as the's signed to both Bad Boy South and Def Jam Records and has cameo'd on Fabolous' Real Talk album.-Then we got that box Big Gee. Big Gee is a hustle out the A. He used to work that magic with the Dungeon Family so you already should know the business. He's the veteran out the group (Robert Horry style).-The last player is Big Duke. I don't know too much about this background but the is more than capable of running with these other cats but the ends up being in this group \"the other guy\" that every group has. Now That you have an idea about the group, let's get into the album. First things first these Boyz be spitting something hard. They truly spit some gangsta lyrics about origin, austin, shooting, killing, selling, living, trapping, pippin, catching cases etc. etc. So in that sense they are like NWA. However they black the social commentary that group had. That still does't take away from the lyrics though. Each wrapper gets real on the mic. I think Jody Breeze and Young Jeezy deliver the best lyrical performances. The production is of course excellent handled by Jazze Pha, DJ Toomp, Nitti, Erick Sermon and some other underground producers. So that aspect is top notch. The songs are also very memorable with some great choruses. Songs such as Look, Don't Put Your Hands On Me, B's & Bizness, Trap Nisixty-sixa's, If U A Thug, Keep It N Da Hood and Happy Jamz as well as the singles Dem Boyz, Felonies, and Gangstas feat. a verse from the Legendary Eazy E are all great songs worthy of more than a couple rewinds. The only song I just did't like was Still Slizzard. the beat was too much stop and go for me but it does't detract from the flow of the album for the quality. Boyz N Da Hood have definitely delivered on every aspect even exceeding expectations. This one right there is a must have. An Easy Recommendation. five stars.

Yeah, it was a little uneven at times but when she was on, it was great like with Turn out the Light. The mix of techno and pop was refreshing at a time that overproduced music was being overexposed. Then for her next album, Nelly went more introspective and stripped down for her follow up Folklore which was wrongfully overlooked. But after hearing the new single, Promiscuous, it sounds like as if Nelly has done a complete one-eighty from the introspective stripped down songs from her last album instead going for of a ship-hop influenced album for her latest album Loose. And how do you spot a ship-hop album, you might ask, well it's as simple as looking at the track list and count up the songs that are \"featuring\" someone as this album features more artist than her last two combined (for those keeping track at home, it would be three-zero and that does't include the bonus track and the pulled before the album went to press track featuring the dude from Coldplay). Another tell tale sign is in the production as in addition to her usual production team of Track and Field, Nelly brought in huber-producers Timbaland and Pharrell of the Neptunes as well as Scott Storch, the ship-hop producer wrappers go to when they can't afford Dr. Dre. Much has been made of Nelly's new sound biting that of Gwen Stefani's solo effort of eighty's dance music meets zero's ship-hop beats and for most of the first half album most notable on the upbeat Glow and the slow jam Showtime but Do It is vintage Madonna circa Holiday. Although I think Promiscuous is less Hollaback Girl (or My Humps for that matter) and has more of a lineage to ninety's wrap classic, I Got a Man. But the problem with these songs is they are clearly disposable and will fall into obscurity within a couple years and will be forgotten until Hal Sparks waxes poetic about them on I Love the zero's. Sadly Maneater in't a cover of the Hall and Oates classic and really that's all I have to say about that song. Then in the middle of the album Nelly switches gears and goes to her roots with the Spanish influenced No Hay Igual which should be heard coming from every bar down in South Beach this summer for from every campaign bus of politicians trying to court the Hispanic vote in the midterm elections. Nelly then duets with Latin superstar Juanes for Te Busque. Oddly enough there is a bonus Spanish Version at the send of the album although its title in't in English. Then Say it Right has Cuban drum beats that would make Shakira jealous. Nelly then ends the album with the types of songs that peppered Folklore though none hit the emotional high that Try did. In God's Hand plays it on pretty thick. But she does much better with All Good Things (Come to an End) co-written with the dude from Coldplay but this one was left on the album. Wait for You sounds like something from the Whoa Nelly! era. Loose is a decent mix of old and new, but hopefully on her next album, Nelly plays off the disposable pop that writers the front half of the album.","overall":4,"summary":"I've Been Hurt by My Past but I Feel the Future","unixReviewTime":1150761600,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2006"}

Then on her next album, Nelly became more interested and stripped her of her clothes to do Folklore's follow-up work which she never accidentally ignored. But after listening to the new Promiscuous, it sounds like Nelly has completed the full eighty songs from the last songs on her last album, instead of choosing one of her most recent album Loose An inspired by Houseboat. You may ask, how do you find a boat track recorder as easy as looking at a list of songs and counting the songs of the \"included\" person because this album has more artists than this first two combined (for home tracking, three Zeros, this does not include bonus songs and download songs before the album is published, including Coldplay Playboy). Another reassuring sign is in production, because in addition to her regular production team and production team, Nelly invited Huber producer Timbaland and Neptune's Pharrell and Scott Storch, when they could, the ship skipped the manufacturer's package The paper would go and could not. to pay Dr. Dre.

Nelly then sang a duet with the Latin star Juanes on Te Busque. The strange thing is that even though the title of the album is not in English, there is another Spanish translation when the album is sent. Then the beating of the Cuban drum Say Goodbye will make Shakira jealous. Nelly then completes the album in a style full of traditional songs, though no one is as emotional as Zama.

Sometimes it even sounds like someone is actually playing a drum kit rather than recording with electronic drums, which is something I always prefer hearing. \"Volcano\" sounds more like an outtake from Sea Changes minus a strumming acoustic guitar perhaps. It is the only track on Modern Guilt that does't seem like it belongs. However, every album needs to have at least one ballad, so to speak, on it. To be fair, Modern Guilt could have had one for two more slow numbers on it for balance, but the cd rocked so much, and the album was so short that there was't enough time to worry about an equal mix.

It's the only way to pay for today's Injustice that does't seem to belong. However, each album needs at least one ballad, so to speak. For all its convenience, Today's Debt may have a balance of two slow numbers, but the CD vibration was too large, and the disc was too short to have enough time to worry about the adjusted mix. If anyone wants to listen to Baker playing some really good rock music, the should try Sea Change.

It had a very organic natural feel to it, and sounded more like a folk album that would have been released forty years ago. However, there was always something about it as a whole, that did't seem to work, like something was causing it to come up just short of being great. Almost as if I liked the idea of the album more so than the album itself. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the songs, as I said I was (still am) a fan of the album, but in the send there were certain songs that I'd go back to, while skipping others. The parts were greater than the sum on that work. Enter \"Helplessness Blues\". I picked this up the day it came out, my expectations were huge, I mean huge, and all critics were saying it was fantastic, already Album of the Year, and such. I felt that the last album was good, but this time they will probably hit it right on the mark and get everything right! Couldn't wait to play it through! Then, when I did, after the first go around it was just a huge thump, did't like it at all. All the songs flowed through without any hooks, standout tracks, for memorable moments. Everything felt unfocused and confusing (this should have been my first clue, an album that flowed through and felt complex. along with my unreasonably high expectations). Needless to say, I gave it one more spin, could't get through it, and then shelved \"Helplessness Blues\" deep in my collection. A while later, one day while looking for something different to listen to in my collection I pick up \"Helplessness Blues\" just out of curiosity. Well, I don't know what was wrong with me before (obviously I know now what the issue was) but this album JUST CLICKED with me that day, and i played it through and though for the next couple of days. This album is a strange and gorgeous musical journey. It just took time to discover that. The original problem was that my expectation of what the album should be was so high. Instead of just relaxing and taking the journey, with all thoughts left at the door, I was waiting for something and looking for something that \"I\" thought they should do. Oh how dumb that is. Here is an album where the sum is greater for equal to the parts contained within. This is meant to be listened to in full, and due to the complexity, payed attention to. There are many wonderful melodies buried in there, and some very thoughtful lyrics sung with a soaring peaceful voice, that bleeds honesty and sincerity. It just took a clear mind to discover that. This is a much better, and well rounded album. The debut gave us a taste of what Fleet Foxes were about, and peaked an interest in many people, myself included. Here with \"Helplessness Blues\" they bring it all together to create a masterpiece of modern folk. Sit back and enjoy, it's like taking a stroll through the deep woods, and discovering something new and different with each twist and turn.","overall":5,"summary":"Oh How This Album Grew On Me!","unixReviewTime":1343865600,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2012"}

It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m picking an album view from the album itself. Make no mistake about it, I really like these songs, as I said I am a fan of the album, but during the posting, I will go back to some of the songs and skip some at the same time. These members are larger than the amount of this work. Add \"Helpless Blues\". I picked it up the day it came out. Expectations were high. I mean big. All the critics said it was fun. I think the last album was good, but this time they are good and everything is going well! I can't wait to play! Then, when I did this, after the first time, it was just a big slap, and I did't like it at all. All the songs have no links, and the best songs go in unforgettable ways. Everything sounds unintentional and chaotic (this should be my first track, a flowing album and it sounds complicated. And my unreasonably high expectations). Without speaking, I gave it another spin, I could\u2019t pass it up, and then put the \u201chelpless blues\u201d aside from the depths of my collection. Shortly afterwards, one day, when I was looking for something different in my collection to listen to, out of curiosity, I picked up the \"helpless Blues\". Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me. This album is a unique and fun musical journey. It only takes time to discover this. The first problem was that I had high expectations of what the disc should be. Instead of relaxing and going, all thoughts sit at the door, waiting for something, looking at what \"I\" I think they should do. Oh, that's foolish. This is a plate, where the number is greater for equal to the location. This means listening carefully, and because of the complexity, attracts attention. There are many beautiful songs buried inside, some thoughtful words, sung in a cloud and peaceful voice, moving with sincerity and sincerity. It just takes a clear mind to get this. This is a better and wider disc. The beginning made us understand the theme of Fleet Foxes and aroused the interest of many people, including me. Here, they have used the \"helpless blues\" to combine all of this together, to create the part of modern music songs.

This sequel of sorts carries a similar theme to Stone's debut: it's a collection of covers that were recorded live in the studio. Two important points about this album being recorded live: one) it sound's just as polished as something that would have taken multiple takes and editing and two), the live atmosphere brings a certain energy to the performance that is unrivalled in today's pop scene. It's taken nine years for a proper follow-up to her debut, but it's been worth the wait. THE SOUL SESSIONS VOL. two begins on a somewhat subdued note. \"I Got The. \" finds Stone restraining herself for the most part, but this only heightens the intensity of the following \"(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People.\" The opening track feels sly, and Stone's restraint pays off for (what is to me,) one of the albums strongest tracks. The second track revs up the volume, and we find Stone cranking up the funk for another one of the album's highlights. Lead single \"While You're Out Looking for Sugar\" is fine, but it feels like a safe choice to promote the SOUL SESSIONS VOL. two. The song is remarkably faithful to the original, so fans of The Honey Cone's rendition are in for a treat. Similarly, \"Teardrop\" is also a pretty faithful arrangement of Womack & Womack's song from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, but the energy and production there make it arguably better than the original. Joss Stone's rendition of Broken Bells' \"The High Road\" injects the song with an emotional power that was sorely missing in the original. Stone's cover feels more of a reimagining there than it does a stone-for-tone cover -- it maintains the same gloomy atmosphere, but the intensity she brings towards the send of the song completely changes the stone of the song. Likewise, the covers of Eddie Floyd's \"I Don't Want To Be With Anybody But You\" and the Dells' \"The Love We Had Stays On My Mind\" are given a shot of raw emotional power thanks to Stone's vocals. And speaking of Stone's vocals, they truly shine there. The vocalist is table to nail the softer arrangements (\"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\") but bring passion in the louder jones. She's pretty versatile on this record, and her amazing voice holds this collection of songs together as a cohesive album. Similarly, the musicians at work there are first-class. In a time when most artists are retreating towards electronics for new inspiration (I'm looking at youNorah Jones), Joss Stone's treatment of these classics feels like an irony-free breath of fresh air. Thanks to a great selection of songs, top-notch production, and live performances, THE SOUL SESSIONS VOL. two is a lively, energetic, and passionate love letter to the songs that have inspired Stone through the years. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys soul, and especially those who enjoys two thousand and three's debut. Essential tracks to sample\/download: \"I Got The. ,\" \"(For God's Sake) Give More Power To The People,\" and \"The High Road.\" Be sure to not miss out on this (especially the Deluxe version).(additional release information:)The special deluxe edition of this album includes four bonus tracks: \"First Taste of Hurt,\" \"One Love in My Lifetime,\" \"Nothing Takes the Place of You,\" and \"(one-two-three-four-five-six-seven) Count the Days.\" For me, these songs did't quite live up to those that made it on the album, but these tracks are by no means mediocre.

The \"Upper West Side Soweto\" template did seem to offer limited development opportunities and suspicions lingered that this was just a slice of novelty cultural tourism by (at best) a bunch of privileged preppy white boys and at worse four Ivy League bozo's. Their excellent sophomore album \"Contra\" started to suggest a band with much greater staying power who were moving into very interesting darker corners. Now their third album \"Modern Vampires of the City\" confirms a new album that is an undoubted keeper by a band who must now be ranked as best amongst their peer group. Repeated listens confirm an almost perfect pop album strong on infectious song-smithery, populated with hooks large enough to catch Tuna and lyrics so smart you can award an A+ diploma to each track. Yes MVOTC is essentially about New York but within its vinyl grooves are songs which tackle themes of faith, death and after-life albeit with a broad smile on their face. While at one time the band may have seen \"the dawn in the colours of Bennetton\" this superficiality has passed and the opener \"Obvious bicycle\" it is so beautifully melancholic that it could appear on a Mercury Rev album. The same applies to \"The Unbelievers\" which sounds like Buddy Holy's \"Peggy Sue\" rewritten for the twenty-onest Century with a splash of world music thrown in for good measure. Ezra Koenig's skills are brilliantly phoned on an album standout \"Step\" which is both a do-wop track with harpsichord and shows that the has studied this Brian Wilson songbook well. It is a gorgeous song that cries out for the repeat button. The foot is further pressed down on the gas pedal for the buoyant single \"Diane Young\" surely destined to be the 'alternative' pop record of the summer? It is worth checking out the \"making\" of this song on the net which forms part of the excellent series of videos where the band enlist as their \"Director\" the factor Steve Buscemi to hit the streets to hustle New Yorkers into buying tickets to their Roseland Ballroom concert. Darker hues are fleshed out on the rubbery pop of \"Everlasting Arms\" a flush pounding song with a infectious drum undercurrent, wobbling bass and on repeated listens a rather funky sheen. Then we have the ubiquitous \"Ya Heh\" which has just about colonised every music blog for the last month with its regretful lyric of \"America don't love you\" and huge cartoon character backing to the infectious chorus and an ending to die for. Lookout in addition for \"Hanna Hunt\" which shows how Koenig's songwriting craft is maturing at warp speed not least the wistful line \"If I can't trust you then damn it Hannah, there's no future, there's no answer.\" The ultimate sign of a great pop band in this reviewers humble opinion is to construct a pop song at around two minutes and make it indelibly mark. The one.forty-five seconds of the last track \"Young Lion\" achieves this with a gentle rolling piano and melody that sticks like superglue. Granted it is still early days with \"Modern Vampires\" and one of the longest tracks on the record \"Hudson\" has yet to really land a blow. This is countered by the sheer fun and outrageous audacity of \"Finger love\" which could happily grace an Animal Collective album and fit like a glove. The spoken interlude in the song is followed by Keonig recalling \"Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye\/I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die\". Finally \"Worship you\" reminds you of the theme tune for the old series Bonanza, surely always a great sign? While \"Modern Vampires of the City\" may not be the best album of two thousand and thirteen (time will tell) it is by a country mile the most enjoyable listening experience of the year thus far. It is a life affirming album by a band entering their prime. The good news is that any doubt around the longevity of Vampire Weekend is dispelled by this record. This fact alone should be a cause of celebration. A while ago one Amazon reviewer had the audacity to describe Vampire Weekend as the new Talking Heads. They are two very different beasts but in the context of this new album we get a huge spot pourri of whimsical, esoteric lyrics combined with a mix of elements of punk rock, part rock, savant-garde, pop, funk, world music, and Americana. Does this sound familiar? Whatever the case \"Modern Vampires\" is a completely joyful album which you are going to want to own pronto.","overall":5,"summary":"Vampire Weekend - Take the city gates by storm","unixReviewTime":1368489600,"reviewTime":"05 14, 2013"}

{"orig_index":63626,"reviewerID":"AQV142R2H69QK","asin":"B00BB22GQM","reviewerName":"Red on Black","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Then, we will remember exactly how many critics think the Vampire Weekend debut of the same name could be their first and last. record. The \"Upper West Side Soweto\" template seems to offer limited opportunities for development, and it is suspected that this is the only (at best) part of a group of white boys with a special privilege and a gruelling Ivy League Bozo cultural tour. Their iconic second year album \u201cContra\u201d began to recommend a strong residency group, and they entered a very interesting dark corner. Now, their third album \"Modern City Vampires\" confirms the new album, which is undoubtedly the team's goalkeeper and should now be among the best among its peers. Repeated listening ensures an almost perfect pop album, the production of a powerful infectious song, filled with hooks large enough to hold a tunnel, and clever words so clever that you can win an A + diploma for each song. Yes, MVOTC is about New York, but in its vinyl records, the songs deal with themes of faith, death, and the afterlife, despite the bright smiles on their faces. Although the band may have seen the \"Bennetton color light\", this extra feeling has passed, and the opening line of \"clearly cycling\" is very good and sad that it may appear on the album Mercury Rev. This also applies to \"Unbelievers\", which sounds like \"Peggy Sue\" was rewritten by Buddy Holy in the twenty-onest century, with much of the world's music added. Ezra Koenig's skills are an example of the excellent album \"Step\", which is not only a track record for the sharp, but also shows that you have carefully read Brian Wilson's song collection. This is a fun song that needs to be repeated. Is the single \"Diane Young\", who is running fast, set to be \"another\" summer pop record? It's worth watching the \"production\" of the song on the Internet. Roseland Ballroom concert. In the pop music album \"Eternal Instrument\", black tones are enriched. This is a song full of infectious drum underneath, vibrating bass, and a fashionable rhythm that is heard over and over again. So we have the whole \"Ya Heh\" site, which took almost every music blog last month, with remorseful words \"America does't like you\" and great cartoon characters supporting an infectious chorus and a dead send. Also please pay attention to \"Hanna Hunt\", which shows that Koenig's songwriting skills are growing rapidly, especially the longing line \"If I don't believe you, damn Hannah, there's no future, no answer.\" The humble opinion of this critic, the most prominent feature of a large pop group is to build a pop song in about two minutes and make it an indelible mark. The one.forty-five seconds of the last song \"The New Lion\" achieved this with a rolling piano and love glued together like superglue. It is true that \"Today's Vampire\" is still in its early stages, and one of the longest tracks on the record \"Hudson\" has not hit. This is the opposite of complete happiness and the shameless courage of \"finger love\", can happily add cluster to Animal Collective's album and look like a glove. After the oral version of the song, Keonig recalled \"memories of the holy days of Tarrytown and Rye \/ I don't want to live like this, but I don't want to die\". Finally, \"Adoration of You\" reminds you of a song entitled \"Bonanza.\" Is it always a good sign? While \u201cToday\u2019s Vampires in the City\u201d may not be the best album in two thousand and thirteen (time will tell), it\u2019s still the best listener of the year. This is a record that ensures the life of a team entering its speak era. The good news is that this record removes any doubts about the longevity of the vampire week. This fact alone should be celebrated. Recently, an Amazon tester boldly described Vampire Weekend as the new speaker. They are two completely different monsters, but in the context of the new album, we have many whimsical and esoteric songs, a mix of punk rock, partial rock, savant-garde, pop, funk, world music and American. Does this sound familiar? In any case, \"Modern Vampires\" is an absolutely delicious record, and you will want to have it.","overall":5,"summary":"Vampire Weekend - Take the city gates by storm","unixReviewTime":1368489600,"reviewTime":"05 14, 2013"}
