650,"People watch movies for a variety of different reasons. This movie did't have the big budget, there's no special effects, no car chases and there's no explosions. Actually reality does't have much of these either. At least not in my life. This is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since I'm neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain. So watch this movie for the characters. It is brim-full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk. Within the first three minutes Kiefer Sutherland enacts Detective Michael Hayden's life superbly and the keeps developing the character throughout the movie. Excellent acting, very believable. Henry Czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between this 'Harvey' and Kiefer's 'Mickey' enhances the oppositeness of their characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady, 'Mrs Ramsay', I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends!!! There's a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited there so watch the movie and enjoy them.",positive

650,"People watch movies for a variety of reasons. This film has no big budget, no special effects, no car chase and no explosions. Certainly not many of them. Somehow not in my life. It’s a real film about real people, none of them are perfect but together they are put in a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and this in turn makes a mess. I’m not ready to limit my psychological possibilities, because I’m not an expert and I don’t use my whole mind. Watch now this film by the factors. It was completely discharged full of funny people. For the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland made Investigator Michael Hayden this entire life and continued character development throughout the film. Great staff, very trustworthy. Henry Czerny could’t have been better thrown out and the relationship between ‘Harvey’ and ‘Mickey’ with Kiefer intensifies the rivalry between their factors. I was so happy with the housewife ‘Mrs Ramsay’, I’m sure they are friends with my mother -in -law !!! There are many hosts of amazing characters but space is limited there so watch the movie and enjoy.",positive
2470,"Fiction film (it lists as based on a story though it does have a ""documented by"" credit) about a group of scientists going into the wilds of Canada to try and find a Bigfoot.(They want to capture one and then attach a tracking device). Its lots of scientific mambo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of people wandering around in the wilderness. There are some attempts at creating tension and scares, but to be perfectly honest there is nothing there worth seeing outside of some great looking shots of the wilds. This is a perfect definition of an exploitation film, it promises you so much, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it delivers very little. Recommended for insomniacs only",negative

3718,"Comparing this movie to anything by Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I can say about it is it tries desperately to be like an Almodovar movie and fails miserably. The script is dreadful, the characters are one-dimensional, and the performances are the quality of high-school drama (except Marcia Gay Harden's, which is pretty good, given the material she has to work with). Furthermore, the cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of Gaudi's architecture for the infectious charm of Barcelona. If you enjoy the grit, pathos and dark, quirky comedy of Almodovar's movies, you'll find none of them there. Spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid.",negative

If you love courage, sorrow and darkness, comedy in the movies of Almodovar, you will not find them there. In addition, the photograph did not reflect the beauty of Gaudí's architecture at all to show Barcelona's infectious charm. The best thing I can say is that the was thinking about the Almodovar movie, but it failed miserably. It is an insult to Almodovar to compare this film with any of Almodovar's films.

7503,i would give this movie an weight.five for a nine. I thought it was just straight up hilarious i don't know how you could not think this movie was funny but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was little bit too much gross stuff because personally i think when they fly off of bikes and stuff like that is much funnier but I'm sure there are people that think the other things are very funny so that is not my desicion but anyways great movie go see it and after that you should definitely go buy it also if you do not like this movie that is fine because I'm sure there are many people who think that this movie shows how downgrading your society is for whatever this is just my personal opinion and you have yours. also the jackass box set is definitely something worth downloading for buying for whatever you do to get your videos,positive

18874,"One of my favourite movies. Great cast, lead by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious drama situations with brilliant comedic punches. An exact mixture of character and story. Real people with real problems, and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. Sensitively moves from slightly-sad to hilariously-funny. Read the quotes. This is the best adaptation of a Neil Simon play. If you wanna see more of Eugene check Biloxi Blues (starring Matthew Broderick who played in both stage versions) is OK, a bit on a darker side. Get away from the made-for-TV Broadway Bound.",positive

20058,"In my mind the best of the Ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time. The theme of workers of. management (with lots of talk of unions and rights) perhaps dates the film a bit now as it's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that does't stop ""White Suit"" from being a show stopping classic. The plot, about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil, does't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true Ealing comedy. The fabric repels dirt and can never wear out! The titular white suit that Alec Guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences, such as Guinness being table to use this indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall! The script itself is full of dry wit - ""Is the all right?"" ""Yes."" ""Pity."" - and characterisation is first rate. I'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well. Comedies of later eras would adopt a ""point the camera at the factors and let it roll"" mentality but the Ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations. This film is no exception. Of course, it's the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights. Alec Guinness gives a fantastically understated performance, with eyes that convey wonder, joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it. Stratton is a man oblivious to everything except this work. Such an insular character could quickly have become boring for irritating but Guinness effortlessly makes him likable, so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as Stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything the's never worked for. Joan Greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual, as are befuddled Cecil Parker and slimy Michael Gough; everybody gets laughs without even trying to. It's comical British understatement at its finest.""The Man in the White Suit"" is eighty-one minutes of sheer brilliance, with a great plot, great cast, sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism.

Managers (there is a lot of discussion about organizations and rights) can now have some dates for this movie, because it is no longer the subject of much discussion, but this does not prevent the ""white suit"" from being an old-fashioned suspension system. . The plan tells the story of a man who tried to create a new fabric for change, which eventually put the clothing industry in turmoil. proves to be a real Ealing comedy. Fabric dispels dirt and will never wear out! The white suit worn by Alec Guinness in the second half all became the centrepiece of many sculptures and sequences. For example, Guinness used this indestructible thread on the table to climb clear walls! The script itself is full of dry stuff - ""Okay?"" ""Oh yeah."" ""Regret."" - and the scale of the measure is outstanding. I am always amazed by the amazing directors of these films. The latest comedies will take the mind off ""pointing the lens at objects and letting it roll"", but Ealing movies are always trying to capture interesting light, angles and innovations. This movie is like that. Certainly, it was the players who lifted things up in the dizzy heights. Alec Guinness's performance is very low. As the story demands, this eyes will show surprise, joy and fiasco. Stratton is a man who knows nothing about this job. Such a mysterious character will soon be a bit of a loneliness for fun, but Guinness made him so attractive, that the final stage of the film produced a real sense of urgency, as Tratton tried to stand out in a world that wanted to bury everything and. it did't work for him. Joan Greenwood plays another strong female character, entertaining as usual, just like the confused Cecil Parker and the slender Michael Gough. Everyone laughed and did't even try.

39068,"This movie was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay (Ulee's Gold). Nice and straightforward writing, that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Ruby's day to day life. What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast I picked the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage. Although the stories are completely different this reminded me of Nobody's Fool, staring Paul Newman. The later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man. I like that. The story is very nicely told, and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I am not sure about is the title. I am sure that there are not that many bugs, and flies in paradise as there are in Florida. As I am allergic to mosquito, Florida is no paradise to me, I pitch all over thinking about Florida. I turn into a complete red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking at the beach of Panama City, Florida.

I was never big into ""scratching"" but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know little, and infusing in-jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area. Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys is in this film, but it was't until after the film that I could name several heavy hitters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q- Bert, etc). The extreme fascination for turntables by these talented and quirky DJs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. The film also sheds some gratifying light on these guys (and one woman) to be classified as musicians. Pray does't let this film idle and if there exists a slow scene it is soon are-energized by hardly never ceasing music. If nothing else, this film will increase your slang vocabulary.

The amazing games of Cher and Nicolas Cage (as usual) gently push the plot in one direction. The two organizations are in an out-of-the-box world, and the threat (in the traditional name) will never pass. Unfortunately, it is the basis of most Indian traditions. But why? What makes women hate traditions so much that women often suffer the most horrible tragedies, including rape, murder, infanticide, illiteracy, infidelity and spiritism. Women's name? the required level in the story. If you show a painful legend, the necessary sensitivity is not achieved, but aside Face the problem of abuse instead of dealing with the problem. Santoshi recently said the film was not made for the International Film Festival, but for the public in the country. Unfortunately, the cheesy is shown, and the film penetrates deep into the blood of good action Santoshi. The film is influenced by the location of the jerky plot, and its ending is a very well-made one. Compared to male athletes, female athletes are given friendships and broader features. The main character is dictatorially played by the great Manisa Koirala. One wonders if this video was created by an administrator with the proper purpose of designing and appreciating the problem at hand, you might be right. Mahima Choudhary's performance is commendable and the continues to show that the has untapped talent. Madhuri Dixit, who plays with Janki, has played with unprecedented interest and fun, and really deserves the title of ""working"". Among the canons of this singing and dancing roles, the role of street performers who find solace in alcohol and the promise of unborn children are the greatest risks. The final and most disturbing performance in this potential female legend is the talented Rekha performance. Lajja is a movie by Manisa Koirala. There is no doubt about it, but Rekha controls the entire process in the game. It penetrates your bones and sends a frightening echo to the vestibule of your heart. Rekha shines like Ramdulari, leaving something empty and careless, providing a play full of reality and originality, emotional nudity has become the score of this part of the movie. The comparison is really annoying, especially when you are face-to-face with one of the biggest heroes in the world, but before the beauty of this screen myth, everyone disappears into its shadow. """" Pinjar "", even celebrating the Queen of Hell"" Eat "": Has achieved the feminine goal of the first two minutes: Mahima rebuked her in-laws for abusing her father who did not commit any other crimes. Her grandmother saw her abuse in silence, and comforted her, ""Why are you crying?"" You have no reason to mourn. There is nothing wrong with that. My case. Not every woman's mistake is wrong. Who is in front of you, because if we had the courage to say what you said today in your time, there is no need for you to say anything today. ""In this scene, the importance of feminism is clearly evident in the text. Another subtle moment appears in the early stages of the film, when Vaidehi (Manisha) flees from her abusive husband to her parents' home in India. If an abusive woman seeks protection from her parents (family, business, children, etc.) complacent. She is not as human as a sign of family respect. Morality, the worry that this family respect will be irrevocably degraded by a daughter who has been changed to another man. Her main concern is that Vaidehi's sister is about to get married, and the opportunity to do so. the lives in the same family with this divorced daughter. She did not hesitate to tell him that no matter how violent and cruel the was, she would have to go back to the man she was legally owned by.

As Robert De Niro once stated in the film A Bronx Tale 'there's no bigger tragedy than wasted talent.' The writer of Clubbed had a good idea and a talent to make it into some sort of film. but without the ability, it seems, to put it all together into some sort of coherent film. As a brummie, some of the filming locations (especially a scene at the send outside the Ring O' Bells pub in Moseley!) were quite easy and fun to spot. but the odour look of the cinematography is really a downer on things. Some really poor acting, for instance lead factor Raido with an indecipherable accent that's all over the place, and a whammy script with some misfiring dialogue are bigger problems for the film though. More established factors like Peake and even telly favourite Neil Morressey are sidelined to very small supporting parts, while the disastrous Raido and Ronnie Fox's flame villain take centre stage. Williams does a poor man's Sick Boy from Trainspotting impression, leaving Salmon and Shaun Parkes seemingly the only performers left with any integrity from the whole thing, as the excessive, blood splattered violence (becoming a common trend for Brit flicks!) takes over.

Some very bad works, for example, the main character Raydo has unreadable accents everywhere, and some bad conversations and bad responses are the biggest problems in this movie. More mature characters such as Pique and TV lover Neil Moresi are not included in the minor supporting roles, while the fire disaster of Ledo and Ronnie Fox takes precedence.

47771,"THE CHOKE (aka AXE in the UK) is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight-to-DVD movie. I say ""supposedly"" because the title of the movie does not have the ""V"" in brackets to indicate that it was a made for DVD movie (even though it does have the appearance of one). The plot is simple  a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one. I think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece, but this does not excuse the faults there. Even straight-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so-called ""so bad, they're good"" movies. However, THE CHOKE falls far short of being either a serious slasher (such as HALLOWEEN) for being a ""so bad it's good"" movie (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE). The movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill. The blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget. But, from there towards, it's downhill all the way. There are so many faults in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them. But, a few obvious jones stand out and I'll go into them. The aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around fifty people present but after the music stops, there seems to be only around weight people left (and yet they're all meant to be locked in!). The characters in this movie are not likable at all. Most of the band members are aggressive foul-mouthed morons for just downright weird. No one really cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they've been dispatched. The highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church (seriously!). He spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But sadly, even this presence can't save the movie. There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation. Around sixty-five minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking. Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in other straight-to-DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all. There are plenty of over-the-top outbursts (mainly from the male characters) and one nearly results in a full-blown fight. In fact, the format could be said to go as follows: characters walk around--murder takes place--characters walk around--murder takes place. You get the idea. The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the of-word being used. Perhaps this was meant to be funny, but it just comes off as sad. And more to the point, we have all seen this done a thousand times before (usually to much greater effect). The movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all. The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons. They make little attempt to get out of the factory for find a weapon with which to protect themselves. And much of the time, they don't even pretend to be scared. In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed (with the exception of the final murder when the killer's identity is revealed). A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. There is no one seen stalking the characters at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this served to make the film funny (unintentionally of course), but there it is not funny at all. And, as another reviewer has pointed out, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. The extras look uncomfortable dancing to it. The score (at the send, there is no music at the beginning!) consists of a band of Sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie. Don't misunderstand the points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classics (such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE thirteenTH). But, it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either. And even as straight-to-DVD movies go, this is a poor effort. On a positive note, the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes. But, when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes close their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion. Fans of the traditional one thousand, nine hundred and heights B-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE thirteenTH should do everything in their power to avoid it!",negative

47771,"CHOKE (also called AX in the UK) is a horror film called a direct DVD movie. I say ""presumed"" because the title of the movie does not have a ""V"" in the brackets to indicate that it is designed for a DVD movie (even if it has a profile). This is a simple plot - the band caught the game in a place that was made for meat production, and they were killed on their own. I think most people will agree that this movie will never be a work of part, but this would not be a false excuse there. Even a direct DVD movie such as the BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (with a very low IMDb standard) has many advantages and is sometimes considered one of the so-called ""worst, best"" movies. However, CHOKE is far from being a serious killer (like Halloween) because the movie is ""very bad, beautiful"" (like ""Nail Gun Massacre""). The start of the movie is really good, the character was killed by a drill. The impact of blood is very cheesy, but considering that the budget is very low, this is understandable. But from there, it went all the way down. CHANGE has many shortcomings, and I can spend the whole day talking about them. However, the clear Jones is visible, and I will read them in depth. The performance of the aforementioned band seems to have been about fifty people in the beginning, but after the music stopped, it seemed like only eight people were left (but all must be locked!). The characters in this movie are not fake at all. Most of the band members are violent, insulting idiots, because they are so weird. No one really cares about what happened to them, not even the so-called friends they forgot about after they were sent. The plot in this movie is about the presence of a homeless person who seems to treat the meat processing industry as a kind of church (deep!). He spit on very interesting lines for no reason. Unfortunately, even this presence cannot save the movie. There are so many displays of people coming and going, talking about the world, and no sign. Nearly sixty-five minutes of film is spent watching the characters walk away talking. The character disappeared for a long time without explanation. Like all movies directly on DVD such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time cursing each other without annoying. There were extreme explosions (especially from male characters), one that almost led to a full-scale battle. After all, it can be said in this form: character goes-kill happens-character goes-kill happens. the understood. The dialogue is awesome, it seems like saying a few lines without using a word. Maybe it was fun, but it came out of the spain. More importantly, we have seen this approach a thousand times before (usually the result is better). There is no doubt at all in this movie. The corpse is the only sign that the character is in danger. The madman runs around, but the character behaves like a complete fool. It is rare for them to try to leave the factory to look for protective equipment. In most cases, they will not pretend to be afraid. Like DRIVE-IN MASACAC, the killer is not visible when it happens (except for the last murder when the killer is identified). Unusual weapons that suddenly appear can kill innocent victims. No one sees the tracking character at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this makes the movie interesting (intentionally unintentional), but not funny at all. And, as one critic put it, music in a bad way is bad, even for those who love punk rock. The factor looks like the dances uncomfortably. The sound (at the time of posting, no music at first!) Was made by a group of diabetic infants, who sang the worst songs that had nothing to do with the movie. Do not misunderstand the main points of this update. The critic enjoys bad movies (such as ""Nail Gun Massacre"" and ""The Bachelor Party Massacre"") as much as classic movies (such as ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the thirteenth""). However, it seems that CHOKE has tried very hard to get used to any of these categories and has never been familiar with any of them. Even playing a DVD movie directly is an awesome effort. The film, on the other hand, contains a number of deadly scenes. However, if the surviving characters do not ignore this situation, the significance of these places will soon disappear because the power they show will disappear without a trace. Proponents of the B-rated movie killer in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of classics like HALLOWEEN and Friday TthreeTH should do everything possible to prevent that!",negative
