1370,"I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Brontë's novel when I read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy BBC dramas. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be as bad as that: the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had. First of all, the music (and songs) seems totally out of place in a period drama (sounds as if it's been written for a contemporary horror film)and like another commentator, I was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun around the factors. I've seen some scenes filmed that way in ""North and South"" and it seemed all right there but in The Tenant, it's definitely overdone and simply annoying. Camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively. Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity. None of the characters were properly introduced at first. The little boy gave a very good performance, the's very cute and the best feature of the film. SPOILERS Tara Fitzgerald's characterisation of Helen Graham made her appear cold and harsh, letting no emotion pass through. She does't seem to be table to cry at all in a realistic way. I just could't believe Markham could have fell for her and I'm not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given. I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband! Fancy being married to such a virago. Besides, the was the only main factor that sounded right to me. Toby Stephens I found just OK, Helen Graham's brother not very good. Maybe it's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty. Besides, what is only hinted at and left to the reader's imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the TV adaptation: making some scenes both gross and comic, (like when Huntingdon's eye starts bleeding) and others far too sexed up for a period drama! I mean, don't we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas?",negative

I've seen some spiders shot this way ""North and South"" and it looks good there, but in ""Employer"", it's definitely over and annoying. The boy’s performance is very good and very good, the main character of the film. But I never thought it would be so bad: the whole series made me laugh, it did’t move me like a novel.

She does't seem ready to cry in the right way. I could't believe that Markham could be in love with her, and I never mentioned her way of cutting her hair. I could't help but feel sorry for her husband! He wants to marry such a Virgo. Other than that, this is the only main thing that sounds good to me. Toby Stephens, I think that's right, Helen Graham's brother is wrong. It can be difficult to compile a novel that includes vague themes such as drunkenness and cruelty. In addition, the book offers advice and leaves the reader with an idea, but the TV show adaptation is full of compliments: some scenes are dirty and funny (e.g., when Huntington's eyes start to bleed), while others are very stimulating. drama!

2500,"But I can't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung. Where to begin. The film quality, there in't any. I've seen clearer pictures on America's FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS! The acting is substandard, the gore effects is okay. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least in a Friday THE thirteenTH for HALLOWEEN we stick with one main character for the most part. There is no main characters, just victims. Man, now we come to the worst part of all. The final survivor skills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends. Then when the police finally arrive, they don't believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room. What kind of ending do you call that, crap, that's what. In my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie, that was just sloppy writing.

13834,"So many people have taken shots at Platoon and Born On the Fourth of July among other calling them ""leftist propaganda film."" Now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. To me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views. The acting and writing was a little to clickéd for my liking. Mel Gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by steaming up with this partner Randall Wallace for yet another one. Throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical ""Just tell my family I love them"" for ""Tell Ronny to spray before shoe goes to bed"" lines. The was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that I felt like I had to vomit. How about that scene were Gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this ""no color"" applies to what to put in the washing machine. Its in the mid-sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her. Another scene is were Gibson's daughter tasks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter. The directing displayed this all perfectly. The countless scenes of Gibson and this family for soldiers praying. I'm fine with showing that once for twice but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. The director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in Vietnam. What exactly was won their. The cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the American flag in the distance scenes spread throughout. I love America but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do. This may seem like a grant and maybe it is but I cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad. This movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. To me it says if your not Christian your wrong. Would God for Jesus want people to kill I don't think so. To me this movie was offensive. At first this movie was funny with the countless clickés and overacted scenes but then when I looked at what this movie was trying to say for not say it was really frustrating to watch. I guess though it is my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this comment offensively because I am not criticizing religion for patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else. If you want a real depiction of the Vietnam war watch Platoon, Born On the Fourth of July, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter for The Killing Fields. Even Full Metal Jacket which I absolutely hated was a better depiction. I have read a quote that in context says a true patriot does not go with everything the government for country does but questions it when its wrong. A real patriot loves their country too much to see it do bad things.",negative

13834,"Many people photographed ""Pai"" and ""Born on July fourth."" Some people call them ""Left Promos."" Now is my chance to make a film about politics. To me, this video has a profound effect on certain religious beliefs and their political views. In my choice, making and writing is fun. Mel Gibson seems to love to play roles in these violent movies, and the has shown this by working with this partner Randall Wallace again. Throughout the movie, there are garbage prototypes of ""Tell my family that I love them"" and ""Tell Ronnie to spray shoes before bed"". This waste disposal line makes me feel like I have to vomit. What about the situation where Gibson's wife went to the laundry? This “no color” applies to items that are installed in the washing machine. In the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys, the was trapped under rocks and did not notice the racism surrounding him. Another scene was Gibson's daughter telling him what the war was about, and the affair was filmed in a trivial matter. The director showed all of this perfectly. Many pictures of Gibson and the family praying for soldiers. I can show it once for twice, but after a while I wonder if this movie is trying to put something in my mind. How many scenes are the most glorious moments in the American flag photographed with stage music. The boss made us look like we were successful in Vietnam. What exactly won them over. Cinematography is the worst, slowing down to see the American flag in the distance everywhere. I love America, but a movie like this seems to compliment every little thing we do. This may seem like a funding, and it may be true, but when such a movie makes non-religious people love the country that they will admit anything that seems bad to their country, I can’t bear it. This movie is narrow for me, limited in many ways. To me, it says that if you are not a Christian, you are wrong. Does God want people to kill for Jesus? I do not think so. To me, this movie is annoying. At first the movie was funny, of countless clicks and extra-curricular events, but when I watched what the movie was about to say, I did't say it was annoying. I think even though it was my mistake that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one will offend this article, because I am not criticizing religion for being patriotic, but for some open-minded people who treat both and look out for others. If you want to show Vietnam images of the Vietnam War, born on July four, now the Apocalypse, hunters are rushing to the slaughterhouses. Even the full metal jacket that I hate so much is a better description. I read a sentence that says, in essence, real religions do not agree with what the government is doing for the country, but ask if they are wrong. A lover of the real world loves this country so much that the sees it do bad things.",negative
14931,"I watched this movie with my mother. She is eighty-one yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot. She even acknowledges this. I don't think she really understood what was happening, she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and this family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case. It was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that scared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him. I could tell when one the cops was flying. He would not look the defender in the eyes. His eyes moved to the side when the answered the questions. It is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of this skin. I read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men. They were finally found guilty after many years. I can't remember the title, but it was the same premise. Whites doing whatever they want with blacks. I am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and paedophiles are white. No comment from her. I want to commend the director and producer of this film. I feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. I am an david viewer of cindy films. I feel that they are well written and have substance. I am pleased that I happened to grab this movie on the shelf.

I read about a black man being dragged into the back of a truck by three white men. Many years later, they were found guilty. I don’t remember the title, but the base is the same.

I explained to my mother that most of the assassins and sexual misconduct were white. Nothing is said to him. I want to commend the director and producer of this film.

17410,"First of all, this plot is way overdone - girl wants to make it, everyone loves her, snobby girl intervenes, all looks lost, girl pulls through, everyone loves her again etc. Throw in the fitting in thing, an attractive male crushing on the heroine, plus single-parent troubles and it's so predictable that you can practically recite along with it. Second of all, I really hate how they keep on dissing classical music. They send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close-minded - in fact, I don't recall the quote exactly, but I remember at one point in the movie, Holly says, ""Why do they have to be so uptight. so classical?"" It's really insulting how label classical music in this way. Third, I've went over it dozens of times, but the only reason that I can think of for making this movie is to promote Britney Spears. there just in't any point at all.

I'm a huge fan of Lonesome Dove and all the books in the series. I love this movie and I'm so happy to see it complete. I think Steve Zahn did a very good job in creating Gus. I can think of nothing but this. The best. His voice, character, and pronunciation all reached T. Of course, no one would never think of Robert Duval as Gus, but I think Steve Zahn did. Very nice.

While the film popped out due to its very intense Technicolor, the film itself just was't that moving and at times the plot looked pretty cheesy--like this was made for classroom use and capturing the attention of a wider audience WASN'T even a consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times in the film things were reiterated--such as when the characters talked to her, they usually said ""Clara Barton"" instead of ""ma'am"", ""Miss Barton"" for ""Clara"". Plus, one sickly confederate soldier said that the was a ""Johnny Reb, A Confederate a Rebel,. ""--almost like the was the cartoon character Mojo Jojo from the Powerpuff Girls.

29493,"I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a suspiciously high nine/ten rating. I say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. Perhaps the filmmaker himself, for one of this mates, has written that ""review""? Naughty, naughty. I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV expecting it to be truly awful. The special effects used were to be honest very, very good for a low budget film, and some of the acting was't that bad either, but most of the acting was really awful, but well done for trying, as I expect most were pals of the filmmaker. I think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above this weight. I did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just was't. If you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended. This film is no way a nine/ten but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in it's production.",negative

I watched this movie on Propeller's Sky TV channel and I expected it to be very bad. Honestly, in a low budget movie, the special effects used are very good, some performance is not so bad, but most of the performance is very bad, but the effort is well done, as I was expecting a friend of the Producer. I think the filmmakers have done a very good job of trying to overcome this difficulty. I found something interesting about this movie because it tried to be very cool, but it was’t. If you do not take the movie seriously, but watch it when you are drunk with some friends, you may have a good time, but it may not be as you would expect it to be.

Sure THIS character was ably played by Emma Roberts but did NOT resemble the Nancy Drew I recall from the books. That is due to script, not the acting. Emma is an adorable teen, playing a self-confident, industrious and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not caught up in the trendy competitiveness around her. There are some weaknesses in the Plot, aside from not resembling the Nancy Drew of the Books, and trying to figure out what decade we're in. (like, what is that CAR, Anyway?) I read the IMDb overview before seeing the film, as I was researching Rachael Leigh Cook from other movies. This is not one of Her best roles, but I will continue looking for more of her films. Rachael was too old to play this lead, but does a fine job as the grown-up orphan central to the mystery. I am very disappointed in other reviews written there.

43827,"Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly routine outdoor yarn ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-four) pits the Cheyenne against the U. S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was pleased in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies haired was inexplicably in black & white. The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of ""Black Spurs"") eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with this old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""), who has killing on this mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that this Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On this way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of ""Objective, Burma!""), about the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of ""I, Jury"") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally, Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has braided this ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, eighty-two-minute boater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag seventeen"") brings in this partner with an narrow in this chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the narrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and skills this helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and this partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after your heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives for everybody will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an narrow in the back for this efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a amiable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of ""West Side Story"") and Robert Bray of ""Lassie"" fame is on hand briefly as the will-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women, and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has been keeping a secret that the is a Native American, too! Ironically, the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what your heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after the has run out of bullets. ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity for yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to ""Casablanca"" scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately, ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of ""Broken Arrow"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty and the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty, makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of this early roles. Actually, Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called ""War Paint"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three) with Robert Stack. Incidentally, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both went on to become regulars on ""The Rockford Files"".",negative

The color of this western co-artist's film is very appealing, but the TV printed by Turner Classic Films is indistinguishable from black and white. At the beginning of the action, Adam Reid (Rory Calhoun of ""Dark Spurs"") avoided many Indians and fought with this old friend and the Chief Chey's Fire Knife (""Good, Evil and Evil"" ""Lee Vancliffe) rode to Paffer together., Who with a murderous heart. A fire knife warned Adam that the Cheyenne warriors were preparing to destroy a nearby castle because they had violated an agreement between the Indians and the government. Adam found a beautiful tree legend that trampled on the water of the lake. , may be the most memorable of the western hemisphere. Major Iv He dismissed Adam's warning about the fiery knife until the captain realized that someone had cut off the harmony far away from the fort. This is one of the many unanswered questions by Richard Alan Simmons in this eighty-two-minute short film. Why did a cavalry bury their weapons in a secret place in the wilderness rather than put them in a castle? As soon as they discovered this, the Indians began to attack, knocking down the hero and making him the only survivor. Prior to the attack, a pair of white inspectors climbed into the castle. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag Seventeen"") introduced this short companion. When Adam uses hot water to help remove stenosis, the greedy Sawyer grinds the deep shaft and provides skills to the helpless partner. Later, we learned that Sawyer and this partner had mined gold. After your hero withstood the test, the problem of gold distribution was not solved. Adam and the Fire Knife have the last prisoner of war, and the Fire Knife tasks Adam to hand it over to Major Ives, because everyone will die. Naturally, Adam refused, and the Indians began to cut off the whites. James Best, as part of the cavalry support, has received limited support in this endeavour. Noah Beery, Younger plays a Mexican scout boy who is an Indian girl named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno's ""West Side Story"") and the famous ""Lassie"" Robert Bray Hunt down. -Kate plans to marry a designated horse officer. In this humble firing west of Kanab, Utah, the biggest surprise was the brutal cavalry officer Ives slaughtered Indian men, women, and children in the infamous Shaxi Massacre Swamp. It has always been a secret. Surprisingly, at the beginning of the wars, the strong bow given to the Fire Knife by Adam without this relationship with Adam is exactly what your hero scout used to kill Cheyenne is determined after the bullets are gone. The ""Yellow Tomahawk"" concludes with a vague note. The survivors arrived at another camp, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives presented their case separately to the general, but we did not read the results of the meeting. Is this the technical ambiguity of another open question? Producer Howard Koch has nothing to do with Howard Koch, screenwriter ""Casablanca"". Finally, the ""Yellow Tomahawk"" was one of the western states of India that came after the ""Broken Arrow"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty), where Native Americans were regarded as respectable heroes and were treated unfairly by other people. All white people. Sailand, which has produced tens of thousands of west, nine thousand and fifty-one thousand and sixty, has made this small west acceptable despite having thin characters and common conditions. Calhoun came out of the cast and became a leading actress who has always served well. The beautiful castle is to be seen for its feminine beauty. Peter Graves played skunk as usual in many of the first roles. In addition, Lesley Selander collaborated with Robert Stack in the previous year to produce a more satisfying theatre version of the film ""War Paint"" (one thousand nine hundred and fifty-three).

46546,"I really don't think it's necessary that I write a review on a movie with a title as derisory as ""Snake Island"", but even in the abstract confines of its own genre, this hit a new low, so my danger must be known. The only reason why I even bothered to watch this unbelievably bad movie is because I knew it was going to be bad, it was really late at night, I could not sleep, and in the past, really bad movies would drain the energy out of me and make me long for slumber. It became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful, but it condescended below even those expectations. The movie was directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who also stars in the movie as a tourist guide on the African river, who ends up having to strand this team on a remote island called Snake Island until another boat comes down to pick them up. They hang out, get drunk, and then become subject to the onslaught of poisonous snakes who are on a mission to purge their island of human beings. If your jaw dropped at the last sentence of my second paragraph, don't bother to reread it, you got it right the first time. Frankly, I prefer my creature features when the creature(s) just attack the nonsensically dumb humans out of hunger, not because they have some kind of a mission. These karen't mutant snakes. They're not giants like what you see in ""Anaconda."" They're just ordinary, everyday African snakes like mamas and vipers only they have the brains to form armies, take up causes, work together to strap people, understand your language, and even dance! Did your draw drop again? Well, it's going to drop further. Amount midway through this awful B-movie, about the part where I'd already given up, the human characters start drinking around a campfire and then all of a sudden, they break down into some kind of an orgy. And while they dance nude and such, the snakes hunting them all of a sudden stop and start jamming along to it. The combination of this scene and the scene where we discover that snakes, some the most roguish creatures on the planet, have formed an alliance against human beings for some oddball reason, proved just too much for my poor brain. And just when I though the filmmakers could't take it to an even lower level, the snakes started to using. The people in the movie? Well, let's just say that never before have I rooted for the creatures to kill everybody off so quickly. I just could not stand it any longer. I really don't think I need to keep going on; you get the picture. If there is anything that makes ""Snake Island"" any different from its other rivals, it's that it does dare to try to be even dumber and that's not a complimentary achievement. Whyjust whyI continue to subject myself to these really bad movies, I guess I'll never really know. But ""Snake Island"" hits a brand new low. It's a cheap, trashy excuse for a motion picture that makes ""Anaconda,"" a brainless snake movie, look as brilliant and sophisticated and thrilling as Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws.""

If your chin falls on the last sentence in my second paragraph, don't bother reading it again, you've got it right the first time. Frankly speaking, I prefer my biological traits when creatures attack stupid people only because of hunger, rather than having some form of work. These are not flexible snakes. They will not attack you as you see in ""Anaconda"". They are just ordinary, everyday African snakes, like mothers and poisonous snakes, the only jones who have the mind to build an army, to trade, to work together to bind people, to understand your language, and to dance!

In part of this horrible B movie that I had already given up, the human characters began to drink around the fire, and suddenly, they fell into some kind of carnival. When they danced naked for something, the snake that was hunting suddenly stopped and began to interfere with it. The combination of this idea and the place where we found the snakes, some of the most treacherous creatures on earth, for some strange reason building unity with humans, proved to be very difficult for my poor mind. Just when I could’t reduce it to a lower level even though the filmmaker, the snake started using it. Someone in a movie? Well, let's just put it this way: I did not support these creatures by killing everyone immediately. I can no longer bear it. I don’t think I should continue; you get a vision. If ""Snake Island"" is different from its competitors, it's because it has the courage to try to be more stupid. This is not the icing on the cake. Why - that's why - I keep humbling myself to these very bad movies, I think I never really know. But “Snake Island” hit the ground running.

We have the girl's sex-boyfriend and her parents ****-block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up, not to mention the awkward family members from the main character's side. check. We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed, check. We have the movie's ""funny"" moments come from incessant swearing, people falling down for being hit, scenes from the trailer, and homosexual innuendos. check. And dare I call it a spoiler, but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie. check. Honestly, this could have. no, wait. should have been a PG-thirteen movie. All that needed to be dropped were any F-bombs. Honestly, it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humour, would have gotten less media exposure, and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent R-rated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up. The humour in this movie is just so awkward that it does't fit in with what general people look for. I bet even the factors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera. Let's put it this way. in the theatre, it will help you laugh because it's on the big screen and others are laughing. When this movie hits Showtime and you're checking it out at two:zero PM on an off-day, you may be inclined to change the channel. The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eve's hotness (who is not quite a ten, but still very good looking). Aside from the main resolution, this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie, where everything else pretty much flies out the window. So there is a main resolution, but what comes of it? It's never really clear-cut, nor does it allow the ending to be ""feel-good"" with the abruptness. There was only one thing worth nothing in this movie, and that was the good soundtrack. Aside from the nice choice of ninety's alternative rock songs, there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie (more so the beginning of it) that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix up/compose. I'll give them props for a great choice of sound. One last thing, this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer, because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion. I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it. But I say hold onto your money. If this was PG-thirteen and you were fifteen years old on a Friday night with a group of friends, I'd say knock yourselves out. Otherwise, definitely pass. It does't try and compete with the R-rated movies of the past few years, and ideally it definitely in't as good.",negative
48786,"The humour of this movie is hard and does not meet the pursuit of ordinary people. The only thing you can see is Alice Eve's love affair (she's under ten years old, but she still looks very good., Trailer for movies, and innuendo for homosexuality.",negative
48786,"I just saw a test tonight. What can I say? It's made to work in the middle trailer, though that does't explain it at all. It had nothing to do with the movie before. Let's see. We have an unprotected protagonist trying to meet this sex girl, but it is not enough for him, please take a look. Our three little friends all have their own ""personality"", one is a close friend, trying to associate with a close friend of the heroine but is always rejected, another friend is a very shy friend, can not bear to see twenty Everything Fourth / seventh is sure and thrown in the same line (in this case list of movies, especially Disney), and the third you will never remember the name but it is there to complete the square and send a message of comfort to those who are ready to listen. Check. We have a girlfriend who has sex with her parents **** - when things get better, stop the relationship in any way, not to mention the family members who are embarrassed on the character's side. Check up. One hour after the movie, everyone is worried, please take a look. We have a ""fun"" time of the movie from continuous curses, people falling for beatings, trailer shows, and fantasy fantasies. Check up. I call it spoiler, but we have an send, which goes on like people think before you watch a movie. Check. Honestly, it is possible. No, wait. It should be a PG-thirteen movie. All that needs to be thrown away is any F-type bomb. Honestly, it will get more publicity among people who like this kind of scandal, and it will get less exposure to the media, so it won’t be like me and should try to promote it to people around you who don’t like R. measurable comedies, such as Superbad and Knocked Up. The humour of this movie is really tough and has nothing to do with chasing ordinary people. I bet these things are always interrupted by the conversations and actions they should have in front of the camera. Let's put it this way. In the theatre, it will help you laugh, because it is on the big screen and everyone is laughing. When this movie is shown on Showtime and you watch it at twopm on a day off, you can tend to switch channels. The only thing you can think of is Alice Eve's sexy (she's under ten, but she's still very beautiful). In addition to the main solution, the film kicked off many small plots along the way, seemingly forgetting to write the many stories they were trying to develop at the beginning of the film, where almost everything came out the window. So there is a better solution, but what? It can never be too clear, and it does’t allow the ending to “feel good” because all of a sudden. There is only one thing about this movie that has no value, and it sounds good. In addition to a good selection of other rock songs in the ninetys, other parts of the film (especially the opening scene) played a song with a beautiful hope that reminded me of something to be mixed / composed by David Holmes. I will give them props and let them choose different sounds. One last thing, this movie may have been shot sometime in late summer, because Pepsi's support for not showing off the yellow bottle hats they had at the time of raising the rock band. I just think you see it, a lot of rock band players will catch it. But I'm stuck with your money. If this was a PG-thirteen and you were only fifteen when you were with a group of friends on a Friday night, I would say you fell for it. Otherwise, it will surely pass. It has’t tried to compete with R-rated movies over the last few years, and it’s certainly not that good.",negative
48786,"mel robbins: This movie has failed in its trailer inside. robbins: It was played in a click-through, and I no longer laughed at the audience. All three of your partners have their own ""personality"", one of whom is a close friend who tries to match the close friend of the main female character, but is always rejected, The other friend is a strange person, can't bear to see all sides twenty-four/seven, and is thrown into a single line (in this case just a bunch of movie reports, especially movies from Disney), and the name of a third person, you won't remember eternal, but fill the square there and send a comforting message to anyone who is ready to listen. Honestly, it will get more publicity among people who like this kind of scandal, and it will get less exposure to the media, so it won’t be like me and should try to promote it to people nearby who don’t like R. measurable comedies, such as Superbad and Knocked Up.

It has nothing to do with the movie before, play-and-click, and I finally got to the point where I stopped laughing, because I was laughing with the audience, but I stopped the movie without realizing it. playing jokes.
