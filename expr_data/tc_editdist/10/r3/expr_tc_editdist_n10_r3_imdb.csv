2091,"Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys. I caught this at an part cinema there in America in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. Technically I was still a teenager (I was nineteen) so I was interested in seeing how Australian teens acted. Script wise there's nothing new there. It shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide etc etc. I always knew what was going to happen before it did but I was never bored. What I found interesting was, despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair, these teenagers karen't much different than American teens. They had many of the same difficulties and hang-ups. Also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and (I heard) it was a faithful adaptation of it. The acting was just OK but the factors were attractive and this was well-made and pretty interesting. So this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it's like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids. I give it a seven.",positive
2091,"One thousand and eighty-one is based on a real sea girl's book. It shows the normal pleasures of youth, including dating, sex, suicide, etc. The work is good, but these things are very attractive.",positive
2091,"The film tells the story of two Australian girls - Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) - and when they were the daughters of two surf men what happened. What I find interesting is that apart from the accents, clothes and hair also have some changes, these teens are not very similar to American teens. It shows common youth issues, including dating, sex, suicide, etc. In addition, this is a book based on the real surf girl and her real-life events, (I have heard) this is her faithful practice. Technically, I was still a teenager (I was nineteen at the time), so I'd like to see how young people behave in Australia. So this is not a mysterious masterpiece, but a very accurate reflection of young people's feelings and attempts to be with well-known children. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, I took this film at a movie theatre in the United States.",positive

2200,"I finally caught up to ""Starlight"" last night on television and all I can say is. . . wow! It's hard to know where to begin -- the incredibly hokey special effects (check out the laser beams shooting out of Willie's eyes!), the atrocious acting, the ponderous dialogue, the mismatched use of stock footage, for the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production. This truly is a one-of-a-kind experience, and we should all be thankful for that. I nominate Jonathon Kay as the true their to Ed Wood!",negative

Unlike the legions of thick-black-framed-glasses-wearing types and pretentious movie critics who praise this name, I just don't see how this guy keeps getting paid to make such stripe. How can Lynch sloppily cobble together leftover footage from a failed TV pilot into a nonsensical, poorly-acted mess & have critics grave about it & actually include it on Year's Best lists? I'm baffled. If you're looking for a good film nor, rent ""Bound"" instead. If you're looking for a good ""puzzle"" movie try ""Memento.""

5437,"I am fully aware there is no statistical data that readily supports the correlation between video games and real life violence. The movie is false and phone because it is in complete contradiction of itself, which is what I tried to emphasize in my original review. The movie fails, not necessarily because I really do think these kids were influenced by video games, but because the movie sets it up as ""random"" and does't follow through. Let me clarify. In Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer, you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous, yet she is so troubled, she really believes them to be true. The viewer can make the distinction however. In Zero Day, the two kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything environmental, which is obviously false since everything they do contradicts this. Neo-nazism, talking about going on CNN with Wolf Blitzer (which is laughable not only because they know this name, but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of this bad movie). etc. This movie does't depict 'reality', it shows nothing but phoniness to prove a point. Unfortunately you fell for the bait and did't see this, and you did't pick up on it from my review either. The entire movie is just taking Michael Moore's hypothesis and applying it to something ""real life"" in hopes of validating and it fails, not necessarily because the hypothesis is wrong, but because the movie is wrong and does't support it. Of course I don't think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people, but if I'm not mistaken, did't video tape exist of the Columbine kids (or some teen killers) shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked for acted like the weaponry in Doom? Hmmmmmmm, the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media, influenced, but obviously balanced for intelligent enough that its not even an issue. Zero Day is a bad movie not because I really believe a correlation exists, but because the film maker does't know what hes trying to say, and the movie does more to disprove this point then support it. It's almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with 'Zero Day' in retaliation. If you want to see the 'mindless' teen killer theory pulled off right, go watch Bully.",negative
5437,"Aileen: The lives and deaths of many killers are funny, but she is very worried. She really believes they are true.

5437,"The movie did't work, not because I thought these kids were affected by video games, but because the movie put it ""randomly"" and did't follow. The whole movie works on Michael Moore's idea of ​​""real life"", with the hope of confirmation, but it fails, not because the wrong idea is wrong, but because the movie is wrong and does not support it. Yes, the difference is that children can be aware of the media and be affected, but they are smart enough that this is not a problem. Zero Day is a bad movie, not because I really believe in the plot, but because the filmmaker does't know what the wants to say, and this movie is even more contradictory and supportive. In ""Eileen: The Life and Death of a Killer"", she realizes that her claims about the police and radio control are absurd, but she is deeply concerned, and believes them to be true. Of course, I don't think kids playing video games can kill, but if I remember correctly, karen't there video cassettes of Columbine kids (or other teenage killers) shooting in the woods? Are they looking for a weapon-like behavior in Doom?

7362,"Unfortunately, this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original. Nicholas Cage, fairly wooden as far as factors go, imbues the screen with a range of skill from, non-plussed to over the top. The supporting cast is no better. The plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse. Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold. It turns out it's just a bill of poor goods. Disbelief cannot be suspended, nor can a befit of a doubt be given. The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and whomever scouted the location should be commended. There was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos, literally, at the send. Disappointed! Wait for the original to come on television, pour a whisky and enjoy.",negative

10015,"This is a perfect series for family viewing. We gather around the TV to watch this on BBC America. It is an up-to-date version of Robin Hood and it appeals to children and adults alike. Our teenager and tween-ager both enjoy sitting with from and dad and watching Robin's next exploits. We can't wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free ""On Demand"" viewing. The wardrobe has a spot of current fashion. There is a moral to each story. It is entertaining. The violence is not over-the-top for needless. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a John William's feel to it. It is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair. There is so much garbage on television from brain rotting ""reality"" TV to senseless violence. You should take this for what it is and that is an updated ""Robin Hood"" not to be compared with the movie exploits of Errol Flynn. This is a gem to be enjoyed by all. Parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that Robin has lost this taste for war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood that would rather attempt to reason this way out of a disagreement than fight. Maid Marian is also an appealing role model for young girls. Rather than stand by and do nothing, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the ""Night Watchman."" The Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked, just as the Sheriff should be and looks like a across between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by an extremely handsome factor, one that makes most women wish the did't have portray the role of a bad ""Guy"". The only question we have is ""Where is Friar Tuck?""",positive

It's interesting. Violence is no more. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, with the feeling of John William. This is the story of the old world, revived in the style of the new world. From rogue “real” TV to pointless violence, there is a lot of rubbish on TV. You have to think that this is a revised ""Robin Hood"" that cannot be compared to the mistakes of Errol Flynn's movie. This is a treasure that everyone can enjoy. Concerned parents about their children seeing so much violence will rejoice that Robin lost interest in war and bloodshed. You are Robin Hood and you can try to try to resolve differences this way rather than fight. Servant Marianne is also a good role model for young girls. He did not stand idly by, but played this part in helping the poor by being a ""night watchman"". The Nottingham sheriff is very crude, as it should be the Sheriff, who looks like the is in conflict between Billy Joel and Tim Curry.

He loves her and marries her. The narrator returned. The story is predictable. Climax is predicted. The first half is boring. It also pulls a lot. But these features and music have been retained. This second season is happy. The music is beautiful with beautiful songs. The cinematography in the first episode looks old but it seems unimaginable. Except for the imagery of the song ""Sochin Ge Tumhe Pyaar"" and a brainstorming song. The clothes are old. Either way check it out with four / ten features and music ratings.",negative
19290,I bought this movie because it is Shah truth khans Debut. And I also want to see how it works. I have to say this role is very good. Divya Bharathi is perfect for this film. Rishi's work is very good. Susham Seth is well supported. Alok’s death is ideal for this role. Amrish and Mohnish also did their part. Dalip is also good at this small role. The factors in the film Mediocre are shining. The direction is neutral. Poor editing. The boring of the story. It tells us about Ravi who is a famous singer. She has a lot of female fans. Among them was Kaajal. Ravi and Kaajal fell in love and got married. Ravi was killed by this cousin. Kajal became a widow. To escape Cousin Ravis. They went to Bombay. He met Raja. She fell in love and got married. Ravi returned. The story is predictable. The send is predictable. Boring the first half. It’s also very dragging. But issues and music saved him. The second half was entertaining. The music is enticing and there are beautiful songs. The cinematography looks old -fashioned but it’s unthinkable. The lyrics of the song are boring except for “Sochenge Tumhe Pyar” and one mind song. The dress is old. However just look at the scores and music Rating-four / ten,negative
23179,"As with all Haneke films, make your own decision--don't be swayed by what you read and if you are interested in someone using the medium of film for their own unique ends, see it yourself. Isabelle Huppert is stunning in this film--combined with Haneke, these two never pull their punches. Haneke reels us in with the lure of golden boy, Benoit Magimel, but this is an anti-romance as much as Funny Games was an anti-thriller. You'll have to force yourself to watch much of it and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release but it's incredibly nervy and thought provoking; Haneke continues to hold up a mirror to how desensitized Western civilization is for has become. People may turn their noses up at this but it's only taking what Solondz did in Happiness a few steps further. While grounded in reality, much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be viewed as emotional metaphor. I'm not recommending it but I would't dissuade you either. it definitely divides people but given it's largely about repression--that's no surprise.",positive
23179,Isabelle Huppert is amazing in this movie. Haneke continued to hold the mirror to show how Western civilization was getting worse. Catharsis is more than any other means of emotional release from a range of chronic stress.,positive
23179,"Like all of Haneke's movies, make your own decision - don't be influenced by what you read. Haneke lured us into the temptation of the golden boy, Benoit Magimel, but this is an anti-romantic movie, just as Funny Games is the opposite of fun. Catharsis is more like a list of anxiety than any other type of emotional release, but it is very difficult and stimulating to think; Haneke goes on to raise a mirror to show how Western civilization has become Dull. People may laugh at this, but this takes Solondz a step further in happiness. Although based on fact, much of Erica's performance (played by Huppel) can be considered emotionally. I'm not encouraging you, but I'm not going to discourage you. It certainly divides people, but when you consider it mostly stress-this is not surprising.",positive
24704,"This sad romance is untellable because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters. So, there are a lot of flashbacks, of are-shooting of the same scene. But, it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result! And it would worth it, because it's for me, just one the best French movie never made! It has everything: Cast: first steps of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such voices, even for a hard-of-hearing! It's symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie! Directing: this camera is bright, alive, plays with the sets for can be mysterious with long close-up ""à la David Lynch"". Cinematography: the light is beautiful, between gold and trust, like their love! A never-seen before Paris: It's a Paris out-of-time of more accurately, a composite of a lot of districts! Huge search there! It's look like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! Music: Not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames. And the song of Charles Aznavour made me discover this great singer! Ah, the story! As I said, it's a love story but rather tragic: Saying that love can be for nothing, that it does't make all people happy for in't guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message in't often told! Love is passion, which is derivative from the Latin ""pain"". You can suffer a lot when you are in love! Because of the Why . ?, of the endless waiting, the black of courage, the indecision. And when you can please yourself, fate, destiny, god (?), devil (?) can stab you in the back , just because you arrive too soon for too late, and above all, because love means two in a world of billions! A lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written! So, what's love? Personally, I lived some moments like this: in a car with the dear one. Her mobile rings and you know it's her ""special friend"" whom she kisses goodbye (and not you, even if we are always together). So, you want to go out of this car to leave them together, to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you can't, because an amazing hard brain just started! I found that this movie depicts those moments of tragedy as no one else!",positive
24704,"This sad love story cannot be told because the director has decided to break the story and give an opinion to each character.

24704,"This tragic love story cannot be explained because the director decided to break the story and give the opinion of each character. So, there's a lot going back, they're in the same place. But, putting all the pieces together to see the results, this will be a fantastic movie moment! It is fitting, for to me, it was the best French film I had never made! It has it all: players: The first step of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such a sound, even to a deaf person! For them, romance with this movie is symbolic! Director: This camera is bright and clear. It can be played with a set and can be a mystery with a close-up shot near ""à la David Lynch"". Photography: The beauty of light, between gold and lettering, as you like! Paris never seen before: Exactly, this is an outdated Paris, made by many regions! Do more research there! It looks like the City of Gotham, where both modern and ancient jones exist at the same time! Music: It's not a big orchestra, but it fits perfectly with the frame. Charles Aznavour's songs made me discover this great singer! Oh, the story! Like I said, this is a love story, but it is very sad: to say that love can be in vain, will not please everyone, but there is no guarantee of a happy, good ending, because these stories do not exist. you are always told! Love is love, from the Latin word ""pain"". When you fall in love, you will suffer a lot! Because why. ?, endless waiting, darkness of courage, uncertainty. When you can please yourself, the future, the future, God (?), The Devil (?) Can push you back! There are so many things to do and so many stories to write! What is love? Personally, I had a time like this: in the car with my loved one. Her phone rang, and she knew it was her best ""special friend"" who did't lie (not you, even though we were always together). So, you want to get out of the car and leave them, you don't want to hear nice words but you can't, because an amazing hard mind has already started! I have found that this movie shows these bad times, no one else!",positive
27350,"Everyone knows about this ''Zero Day'' event. What I think this movie did that Elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were. They showed their life for about a year. Throughout the movie we get to like them, to laugh with them even though we totally know what they're gonna do. And THAT gives me the chills. Cause I felt guilty to be cheered by their comments, and I just thought Cal was a sweet guy. Even though I KNEW what was gonna happen you know? Even at the send of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of three for four I thought this was funny but still I was horrified to see their heads blown off. Of course I was. I got to like them. They were wicked, maybe, but I felt like they were really normal guys, that they did't really realize it. But I knew they were. That's, IMO, the main force of this movie. It makes us realize that your friends, for relatives, for anyone, can be planning something crazy, and that we won't even notice it. This movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. And that's why I can't go to sleep right now. There's still this little feeling in my stomach. Butterflies.",positive

If you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this film--the payday of Motown--or if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about, I suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch. At the risk of sounding cliche, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll reminisce and remember. You'll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight. You'll recall with fondness your best friends from school. It's a feel good movie with an edge of angst and spain and realism--misconceptions, closing friends, deciding what to do with your life. I think everyone regardless of race, page, socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it.

44032,"I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favourite soap opera. Because of this, she goes on a journey to Los Angeles to reunite with her supposed soap opera character lover Dr. Rubell. To add fuel to the fire, she is also being chased by some ruthless `one life not to live' whitman who think she has stolen their drugs. You could say that is how Nurse Betty spends `the days of her life' throughout the movie. This very `ungeneral' situation eventually leads her to the `hospital' set of her beloved soap opera. However, the only problem is that Betty thinks this is all real. It is like her mind is in `another world.' Ok! Enough! I will wipe off my mouth with soap and not mention any more soap names. I have already registered my vote for Renee as a best actress oscar nominee. Also, Greg Kinnear's performance as Dr. Rubell was as good as it gets in this acting biography. To sum it up, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call in for `Nurse Betty.' ***** Excellent",positive

Just the rich sisters kind of thing I think even though Alysons more the actress, in this movie Amanda michalka was okay sometimes but Alysons acting stunk. i think that after high-school musical they needed to come up with something better and this definitely was't it. The story line was't that great and I think they should have gotten two other people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big Alyson Michalka fan and this movie did't make me like her any better. i think they should definitely sick to singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which sadly I did't)",negative
