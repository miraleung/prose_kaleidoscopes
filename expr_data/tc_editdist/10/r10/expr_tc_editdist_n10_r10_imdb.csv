I should have know better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but I loved War Games so I indulged my whim. I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life. From the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game I knew I was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot. The list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so long I would crash IMDb if I tried to post it. To those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me. I am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung.",negative
11554,"I don’t know what else to say about this horrible movie. Honestly, I just have to be angry. When I saw the title of this movie, I would have to know more that it was going to be a scary nonsense, but I love war games, I’ve had fun. I will regret this decision for the rest of my life. From the very beginning, government officials have made it clear that those who work hard can decide who is a terrorist based on how they play video games. The list of the worst, the worst, the discussions and performances is very long, and if I try to publish it, I will affect IMDb. For those who say they have seen a film that is worse than this, please let me know. I really want to see what can be covered in this pile of horse manure.",negative

I should have known better when I saw the title of this movie that this is going to be a very bad thing, but I loved war games so I made my own choice. I will live and regret this decision for the rest of my life. From the beginning when government officials explained that their best computer could determine who the terrorist was the way they played the video game I knew I would ride even though the world forgot that good writing. Is. List of building lines, bad, very bad, conversation, and making it too long. If I tried to send it to you, I could target IMDb. For those of you who say they've seen worse movies, please let me know. I would love to see more of this hot pile of horse manure.",negative
11554,"I don’t know what else to say about this ugly film that has’t been said before. I really need to be angry with myself. I wish I knew better when I saw the title of this movie that it was going to be a bad and bad piece, but I like War Games so I enjoyed my ambition. I will live to regret the decision for the rest of my life. At first when the government explained that their super computer could determine a terrorist how well they were playing a video game I knew I was on a trip even that good script - was forgotten. The list of conspiracy theories is very, very bad, dialogue, and limitation is too long I will fall into IMDb if I try to post it. Those who said they saw a worse movie than this please tell me. I was really interested to see anything on top of the smoky pile of horse manure.",negative
24430,"this is a dreadful adaption of Charles Kingsley's story. The animation is, to put it bluntly, awful. And the songs are a disgrace to film songs, especially the ""high cockororim"" song, which they keep repeating. I feel sorry for Jon Pertwee and David Jason, two of Britain's finest talents, providing the voice for the depressing animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbbins tries this best to perform in this awful production , but fails. Avoid this film at all costs, even if it is the last film on this planet!",negative
24430,"This is a bad sequel to the story of Charles Kingsley. Animation, of course, is dangerous. And these songs are a disgrace to moviegoers, especially their repeated ""cockororim"" songs. I feel sorry for these three great geniuses in the UK, Jon Pertwee and David Jason, who called them disturbing cartoon pieces. Bernerd Cirbins has tried this best at this daunting task, but to no avail. Avoid this movie at all costs, even the last movie on the planet!",negative
24430,"This is a terrible twist in the story of Charles Kingsley. Prostitution, to put it bluntly, is bad. And the songs are a disgrace to movie songs, especially the song ""High Kakorurim"", which they often repeat. I feel sorry for John Pertie and David Jason, two of the UK's greatest talents, who provide the voice for a great image setting. Bernard Sarbens tried this best to make it a bad product, but it failed. Avoid this movie in every way, even if it is the last movie on this planet!",negative
23112,"This one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine film tried to capitalize on the much better Michael Curtiz's film ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's dinner cities today. The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well paired together. The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks. In a way it's curious how carson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right there in New York. It was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!",positive
23112,"Of these, ninety-nine films have tried to use Michael Curtis's best film, ""Dirty Faces with Angels."" As Ray Enright points out, the only thing that excites me is that these children have been softened compared to what is happening to young people in American cities today. The film should be seen only because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed them that they are together. Dead ends are big components of children because the building focuses on them and not on adults. Somehow curiosity about how Carson was used in the same way that luxury homeowners did in New York years later. Turning to property and never considering the social problems that arise from it was a quick way. There is a new reality in today's climate with lots of guns. The little children in this story seemed to be just joking instead of criminals. How time changes!",positive
23112,"One thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine films trying to use Michael Curtis' best film ""Dirty Angel"". As directed by Ray Enright, the only thing that matters is how well these children are performing compared with the young people in the American cities of the evening. The film is worth watching because the appearances of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan have proven to be good partners. Children at the send of the dead play a big part because the theme is more focused on them than on adults. In a way, it is interesting how Carson was used as a wise homeowner in New York in this later years. Never underestimate the social problems it causes, this is the fastest way to change property. In today's world with so many guns, something new has emerged. The child in the story seems to be a prank rather than a criminal. How times have changed!",positive
23112,"This film, one thousand nine hundred and thirty -nine attempted to take advantage of Michael Curtiz’s film that was better than “Angels with dirty faces”. As Ray Enright pointed out, the only thing that is interesting is how distracting these kids are compared to what’s happening to teens living in dinner cities in the United States today. The film was worth watching because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that their marriage went well. Children in the End of Death have key components because the focus is more than on adults. In the same way it is surprising how cars have been used in the same way as some of the poorest landlords in recent years in the same New York city. This is the fastest way to open an asset without considering the social problems it creates. In today’s climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The little kids in the story seem to be joking rather than being criminals. How time has changed!",positive

Found this movie, it was pretty bad. Not her fault, she is only in the first few minutes where she is obviously being the person to pull you in to watch this bad movie. BAD directing. Scenes are looped over and over, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has a very bad breast job yet the other actresses looked pretty good. I really like Yvette but, this was obviously a bad choice of hers. I can't believe I rented this trash to look for her. I hope to find her other movies.",negative

12538,"Lorenzo Lamas stars as Jack `Solider` Kelly an sex-vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save this sister from backwoods rednecks. Atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that Ron Palillo is third billed, and yet has three minutes of screen time, and even those karen't any good.

The gross costs of film production are so low and so bad that Ron Palillo (Ron Palillo) is in third place, but there are still three minutes of viewing time, even those of Karen are not good.

Improved sequence was followed.",negative

46509,"I concur with what mallicka.b has said. The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. Emotions karen't conveyed properly. I guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my view, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can't help it; sorry for that. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed.",positive
46509,"I agree with what mallicka says.b. The way the film is portrayed seems to be an insult to the original theme. Incorrect description of emotions. I think some negative things have contributed to her relationship. In my opinion, compared to Aishwarya Rai, Tabu would be better off choosing a character like this. In some of this shows, the seems to have a little bit of energy, which is not what the movie is supposed to be in the send. I also saw a slight reduction in some of this traits. I am a big critic of Aishwarya Rai :) I can't help it; sorry. ""Raincoat"" is a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. After seeing the raincoat, I saw Choker Bali; I was not impressed at all.",positive
46509,"I agree with what Malika says. The film manages to entertain as well as inform. Emotions are not well expressed. I think some negative sports have also played a role in its intervention. In my opinion, Tabu would be the best choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of this scenes, the looks animated, not limited to the movie the was supposed to be about. I also saw more performances in some of this scenes. I am a strong critic of Aishwarya Rai :) I can't help you. I'm sorry about that. 'Raincoat' was one of the best films of Ritoparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat. I'm not impressed at all.",positive
46509,"I agree with what mallicka.b said. The film is presented in a way that seems a kind of insult to the original content. Emotions are not well correlated. I think two negative performances also contributed to neutrality. In my opinion, Tabu has played a better role than Aishwarya Rai. In some of this scenes, it seemed a bit boring, which was’t the last the film showed. I also saw a bit of rotation in some of this features. I’m critical of Aishwarya Rai :) I can’t help; I'm sorry 'Raincoat' is a good movie for Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I'm not impressed.",positive

41740,"Even though the plot was very well detailed, and the story line was understandable the fact that Steven Seagals voice was dubbed with some one else's through out most of the movie was distressing as you were unsure who was talking . There were many parts where the would start to talk in this deep raspy voice and then the next some one else's voice was doing the talking for him. I don't know the reason however if the had difficulty with this voice during production of the movie I think they could have are shot the events that did not contain this own voice when the had recovered. I have rated this movie three out of ten based on the quality of the film. When one pays for a movie whether for not its at the theatre for on DVD this movie was not worth the admission price that was charged.

41740,"Although the plot is clear and the story is understandable, Steven Seagals' voice has been called out by other people's voices throughout the movie, disturbing because you're not sure who's talking. There are many places where the will start to speak in a low and harsh voice, and then the next person's voice will speak for him. I don’t know why, but if it’s hard to use this sound in the film production process, I think they can do movie heaters without these sounds when they recover. Give me this movie three times (thirteen) based on its quality. When people pay for a movie, whether it shows a DVD in a theatre for not, the movie does not qualify for a nominal fee.

I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie was't nothing close to good, but it manages to keep you interested. What really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the factors. The movie is overlong, has't no ""nice"" shots and no scares, the dialog are dumb and the special effects are crap. The only things good are that, as i said, it keeps you interested ( i guess the book must be good) without using much horror cliches. My Vote four/ten.",negative
36167,"I started watching the movie with low expectations, but I found it because it was adapted from a novel SK (a novel I had never read). I'm glad my expectations are low, because this movie is not a good thing, but it can be interesting to you. It is the work of the director and the things that dragged down this story. The movie is very long, there are no good shots and no fears, the conversation is nothing, and the special effects are a waste. The only benefit is that, as I said, it keeps you interested (I think this book should be good) without using too many clickés. My vote is ten / ten.",negative
19491,"This is a very touching movie. This is a story about a special bond between a child and this grandfather. A villager (Arun Nalawade) brings this grandson, Parashuram, to the city to get this eyes treated. But comes to know that Parashuram (Aswin Chitale) has some rare cancer of eyes and has to undergo an operation and will close both this eyes. The movie is all about the emotions and the turmoil both them go through and how they accept the whole thing. The movie avoid any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Though the movie is in Marathi, language is not a barrier at all. It proves that to make good movie you do not need item songs, superstars and usual marsala. Excellent performances. This is India's entry for Oscars two thousand and four. Hope it gets the nomination at least. Would rate ten/ten.",positive

28421,"Read This:BOYZ 'N THE HOOD IS A SCENE-BY-SCENE, COMPLETE RIP-OFF OF THIS MOVIE. Two friends in the hood, one's focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete. The friend who's an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed. (The athlete just happens to be Washington from 'Welcome Back, Kotter'.)It makes me mad that people don't know this. It blows my mind everytime I go into a video store and Boyz 'n the Hood is in the 'Drama' section while Cooley High is in 'Comedy'. It's an embarrassing disgrace. This movie is both funnier and more dramatic than John Singleton's trip-off. At least Singleton could have had the dignity to speak out that this film was homage to Cooley High, but no, the never said a word.

Every time I walk into a video store, Boyz'n the Hood is in the drama category and Cooley High is in 'comedy', which is shocking. This is a shame.
