1705,"Yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you'll thank me for it. This is the worst film I've seen in quite some time. I came to this board expecting to see the same response I had, but inexplicably, there are several people who love this film and Spacey's performance in particular. Some will chastise me for saying it, but I find Kevin Spacey's acting quite limited despite the world's admiration for him. I felt like I was watching a meaner version of Kevin's ""American Beauty"" role. His character in this film is ridiculously overacted, all the way down to this laughable insults the throws at this assistant. There are all-world trite and boring scenes like when Spacey is tearing into Whaley about bringing him Equal instead of Sweat and Low. Somehow, I suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny, but by this time I was ready to hit the stop button (this is approximately twenty minutes into the film). What about the faux-homage to ""Resevoir Dogs""? Whaley proclaims, ""I think I saw this in a movie once,"" as if the's going to cut off Spacey's year. But what does the use to cut him? An envelope! That's right, the's going to give him paper cuts! That has to be one of Hollywood's all-time worst scenes, and the fact that the factors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling. I will admit that I did't see the send of this film (my DVD mercifully locked up about a half hour before the send), but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that I missed a great twist and everything would have made sense. Well, I don't care what happened in the send, because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue. I even got the feeling that the factors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as I did.",negative
1705,"Whaley announced, ""I think I saw this movie"", as if it would mark the send of Spacey's year. Coming to this board, I hope to see the same response as me, but it is shocking that few people like this movie, especially the performance of Spacey. Somehow, I suspect this show should be interesting, but for now I'm ready to press the stop button (about twenty minutes for a movie). I admit that I did not see this movie when it was sent (my DVD was kindly locked about half an hour before it was posted), but anyone who wants to say this can save me from having missed a great opportunity, everything will make sense. Well, I don’t even care what happens during shipping, because it can never do all the bad work and endless conversations. Some people will blame me for saying this, but I find that Kevin Spacey’s performance is very limited, even though the whole world praises him. This is supposed to be one of the worst events in Hollywood's history, and the fact that things and the director have tried so hard to make it even more frightening.",negative
1705,"Some people will criticize me for saying this, but I have found that Kevin Spacey's performance is very limited, despite praising him all over the world.

1705,"Yes, spoilers may be included in this update, but you'll thank me for that. This is the worst movie I've never seen. I came across this board as I was getting, but not surprisingly, there are a lot of people who like this movie and especially Space. Some people call me Dr. Nate will, but I think this performance is limited, despite the worldwide respect for Kevin Space. I felt like I was seeing the indirect nature of Kevin's role in ""American Beauty."" Her role in the film has been ridiculed in a humorous way, even ridiculed for throwing a helper. There are worldly and boring scenes like when Spacey ripped the wheel by bringing equality instead of Sweet and Lou. Somehow, I suspected the scene should have been funny, but by then I was ready to press the stop button (it's about twenty minutes long). What about a tribute to ""Resevoir Dogs""? ""I think I saw it once in a movie,"" Whale announced, as if it would be determined by the year of the space. But what good is a simple cut? Envelopes! Sure, they'll cut it out of paper! This should be one of the worst situations in Hollywood, and the fact that the character and the director have tried to do it with a straight face is even more shocking. I will admit that I did not see the posting of this movie (my add was shut down about half an hour before posting) but anyone who wants to say so can save me from this line that I Lost a big turn and it all makes sense.

2623,"Hi, Everyone, Oh, Boy. This one is a lulu. It has really bad background music whenever they can squeeze it in. There are three bad guys who, I guess, are the stars of this. They beat people up and chop people up and crash trucks and bulldozers into people. Usual stuff. The woman who is sending them on their emissions is unable to move her mouth when she speaks. It's sort of like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own dummy. She walks like she is balancing an egg on her head. The wardrobe is seventy leisure style for the men and blah for the female lead who is supposed to be a good nurse. The bad novocain mouth woman wears red. A silk frock perhaps, for maybe just a poplin windbreaker that is too big. I actually liked the ending even though it did not make a lot of sense. It lets us in on what happened earlier in the film. The police officers are OK. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. The two bright jones could have worked again in Hollywood. The movie starts interestingly enough and ends with a surprise. The middle sucks. The guy in the diner who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job. He is like a one thousand, nine hundred and forty character factor. Great voice. This one is a bit too long. The lady with marbles in her mouth could have had just a couple of lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. Her scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker. Tom Willett",negative

It's like watching a bad ventriloquist maker become this dummy. He walks as if balancing an egg on this head. The award is wearing seventy men's clothing, and the receptionist deserves to be a good nurse. A woman with a bad mouth with a red dress. Maybe a silk dress, maybe a poplin trench coat too big. I love this ending, though it makes no sense. It allows us to understand what happened in the early days of the film. The police are doing well. Some are bad, some are good, except two are stupid. The two brilliant Jonathan could also work in Hollywood. The start of the movie is very interesting, and the ending is amazing. It sucks in the middle. The man in the restaurant who gave the star a free hamburger did a great job. He is like a thousand and forty-something. a good word. This is too long.

2931,"It's easy to see how this below-average screenplay got by in the early sales-pitch meetings at Regency Films (and later with Fox): across the superhero genre with a comedic take on ""Fatal Attraction"". oilà!

After being approached by G-Girl's nemesis, who wants to zap her powers, Wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned. and in't that better after all? Thurman's early performances in films like ""Henry & June"" and ""Jennifer weight"" showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise; her films with Quentin Tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity, but that came at a price (the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch).

In Fritz Lang's ""Der Mude Tod"" (also from one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-one) Death personified takes a young man away from this sweetheart, but in Lang's film the characters' destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior. Neither of the young lovers deserves to die, but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death. In Victor Seastrom's ""Korkarlen,"" however, repentance is always an option. Destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters' choices. Although scenes of the Phantom Carriage collecting souls are genuinely eerie, these horrific images of Death as the great leveller are compromised by Death's offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale, David Holm, a brutal drunk who, because of a perverse hatred of humanity, spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone the comes in contact with. One New Year's Eve Holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion. As the first person to die on the stroke of midnight Holm must become the driver of the Phantom Carriage and collect souls during the new year. The Phantom Carriage, driven by an old acquaintance who had started Holm on this road to ruin, comes for this soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery. Along the way Holm sees the horror the has inflicted on this family and the people who tried to help him. Perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the Selma Lagerlöf novel on which the film is based. But I would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape this destiny, and to see this repentance come too late to prevent this wife from poisoning this two children and herself, and to see Holm suffer for the consequences of this sins by being made to collect their souls. It would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse the inflicted on others. In the film, however, the unalterable nature of destiny in't the message; redemption is. The driver of the carriage allows Holm's spirit to return to this body, and the rescues this family in the nick of time. His repentance smacks of Scrooge's repentance in ""A Christmas Carol.""

Yes, for me, BT does’t seem to be for me either. The songs in this version are too long, drawn out, boring and imaginative which does not include the film class. The “Kids” version of the ‘Sixty -three’ version is a very funny and true parental joke. Kim's copy is too old, Conrad is * really horrible * to see (when someone took off my shirt I got angry. This kind of director has no idea what sex is.). This Conrad is unplayable, unusable (nor fit) and deliberately hated. If Elvis Presley really had a career it would have ended before they started. In other words, I expected Alexander’s hitting to happen as a dancer and for Daly to act completely like Momma.

Without anything else, I decided to watch it, thinking it was going to be just a horror movie, with a plan similar to Fever Cabin. Man I'm wrong. Dr. said. Chopper made Cabin Fever a must -win for many Academy Awards. Let me remind you, Cabin Fever includes a scene of a thick -skinned boy appearing on the balcony shouting, ""pancakes !!"" The world wrongly placed all its fingers on the maiden's thigh. Needless to say, Dr. The chopper is big, smell. It’s not even a funny laugh. It reminded me of a scary movie I made in the eighth grade, called “The Campout”. Aside from the fact that “The Campout” has great writing (we wrote it an hour before recording), it has better features, visuals, bloody scenes, and camera work. I expected to laugh at a scary movie that was’t well done, but instead I was just wondering why I said, “Did it send in eighth grade?”. The acting is shocking, the various minor incidents and subtitles are discarded and irrelevant, and the violence and violence is minimal. I wish people had died instantly with a small knife wound, and the only weapon the killers had was a small pocket knife. if you’re making a scary movie, somehow give the killer (s) the crazy killing device. Also, why is it so hard for the maiden to break their promise? Great way to show images of some of the girls running to the chest, even if it does’t make sense in the story. And I must say, my favourite line is when white hair says Dr. Chopper, ""I want to introduce you. My bite for dinner."" ""He bites inside"" then continues to pick up trash, throwing Dr. Chopper, miss, and help the killer panic.

7687,"Watched this as a late TV movie last night purely by chance. The blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey, as I tuned in there's the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot was immediately apparent. It turns out that eponymous mother's carpenter love interest is also the daughter's boyfriend, so there's trouble brewing and not too many surprises. But I'd been caught by Anne Reid's compelling performance and I was hooked. The direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves, when she exudes sadness. The sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking. Shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up? Not there and we're treated to a delicious reawakening in the Mother's sexuality. Even more startling are the drawings she's made that (SPOILER!) once discovered confirm her daughter's suspicion that something's going on there. Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter did't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast, but that could be me. With her waves of are-Raph blocks I kept expecting to see Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind. Bradshaw has a rounder happier face that did't carry the danger that emerges as the film progresses. The ending is weak. If the goodbyes for Mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons. Whatever she's done, she's a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for thirty years, and I found the black of sympathy jarring.

The film’s introduction talked about the influence of mother and daughter together as well as continuing the love journey, as I was transferred to a carpenter to work hard in a new heat - Daniel Craig also played a lot - so the strategy is clear. It turns out that a carpenter who loves a mother of the same name is also a girl's boyfriend, so the trouble grows and there karen't many surprises. But I was interested in Anne Reid's fun play, I was interested. When the expressed this frustration, the guide gave him enough space to look in the mirror and adjust the scarf. The sex scene is interesting and breaks the taboos. Shouldn't the bodies of older women be covered? Not only that, we enjoyed the wonderful awakening of your mother's sexual desires. What shocked her the most was that the pictures she had made (spoiled!) Once that confirmed her daughter's suspicion, were what happened there. Cathryn Bradshaw as a girl did’t reassure me like other players, but it could have been me. With the waves behind the are-Raph blocks, I was looking forward to seeing Julia Sawahla, her distressed face more fitting to face my eyebrows. Bradshaw has a around face and fun without the risk of appearing as the movie progresses. The send is too weak. If a mother does not seem to care when her husband leaves, we may be table to see people close to him nodding and understanding their reasons. No matter what she did, she was a widow who had recently lost a loved one in death, she left the lonely home where she had lived with her husband for thirty years, and I found a black sting of sympathy. In a film full of emotions (please note, this is like opening the champagne, you will never open the lid again) the ending is about cold.",positive

The film’s confusion is about the impact of a mother accompanying a woman and going on a romantic journey, as I listen there is a carpenter working hard on a new building - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot is immediately apparent. . A very emotional film (and warned is like opening shampoo, you can’t put the lid back on) the ending is a cold confrontation. once found out that her daughter was suspicious of something going on.

7687,"You accidentally watched it as a TV movie late yesterday. The short version of the film says something about the effect a mother has with her daughter and continues the journey of love, as I heard a carpenter working hard at a new zoo - Daniel Craig Paid and not a little - so the plot quickly became clear that the carpenter's lovely mother carpenter is also the daughter's boyfriend, so there is no problem and not much surprise. But I was caught up in Anne Reid's forced labour and I bowed. The guide gives her plenty of space to look in the mirror and adjust the scarf, as she expresses her grief. The sex scenes were attractive and derogatory. Shouldn't the bodies of old women be kept closed? Not there and we are facing a sweet wake up call for from. Even more impressive is the drawing the (the police!) Found to confirm this daughter's suspicion that something was going on. As a daughter, Catherine Bradshaw did't impress me like other factors, but she did. With her rough block waves I was always looking forward to seeing Julia Swahla, her very strong face that would fit the arguments in my mind better. Brad Shaw has a pleasant around face that did not bear the risk as the film progressed. The result is weak. It does't matter much if she walks in disgrace during Mama's farewell. We can probably look into the eyes of those who say goodbye and see something for their individual reasons.

The film's summary has some meaning for a mother who lives with her daughter and continues the journey of love, as I saw a carpenter working in a new museum - played by Daniel Craig and Not a little - so the plan was instantly successful.

10064,"Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like ""The Shining""? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that the is truly one of the greatest directors and auteur of all time. So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and this family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered this wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as ""scary"". It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. Music has been a major part of Kubrick's movies (two thousand and one: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and the definitely does't disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the stone and this film would not be the same without it. Finally, I must comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, just this stare steals a few scenes of this movie. This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe. There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. R. I. P.

Warriors). I knew Ax was't a healthy man but if the was that unhealthy why bother have him on the card? This would be this last PPV. Eventually, both Legion of Doom and Demolition job out cheaply via double disqualification (two-one adv. Warriors). Perfect applies the Perfect Plex on Texas Tornado for the pin. He then attempts the same on Warrior but Warrior no-sells it and kicks out. Warrior comes back with a splash to pin Perfect and become the sole survivor. five/tenThe Dream Team (Dusty Rhodes, Koko B Ware and The Hart Foundation of Million Dollar Team (Ted Dibiase, Mystery Partner and Rhythm and Blues): The mystery partner is The Undertaker and, on this debut, makes an impact disposing of Koko straight away with The Tombstone(Monsoon still manages to say this correct height, weight and finishing move while pretending not to know who the is) making it four-three to Dibiase's Team. Niedhart power-slams Honky for the pin (three-three) and this career with the WWF is over. Shortly afterwards, it is Niedhart who falls victim to Dibiase with help from Virgil (three-two adv. Dibiase's team). Rhodes next after an Undertaker double axe-handle off the top rope but does't leave quietly attacking Brother Love. Undertaker goes after Dusty and gets counted out despite not being the legal man (two-one adv. Dibiase's Team). Almost straight after, Greg gets caught in a cradle by Hart trying to put the figure four leg-lock on him and gets pinned. It comes down to Hart of Dibiase and after a few minutes of nice wrestling, Bret gets this body-cross reversed by Dibiase for the pin. Dibiase is the sole survivor. At least Hart is put to good use. six/tenThe Vipers (Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, 'Superfly' Jimmy Snuka and The Rockers) of Visionaries (Rick 'Model' Martel, Warlord and Power and Glory): After spending some time in the bring, Marty Jannetty gets power slammed by Warlord as the comes off the top rope for the pin (four-three adv.

Bravo commits career suicide shortly afterwards by allowing Hogan to cradle him for the pin (three-two adv. Hulkamaniacs). Earthquake manages to overcome Bossman with two elbow drops for the pin shortly afterwards (two-two). Hogan gets beat down and FINALLY Tugboat gets a tag (who knew the was there at this point?), the wrestles for about thirty seconds before getting counted out with Earthquake.

Tanaka follows Sato when Santana stuns him with the flying forearm (four-one adv. Alliance). Despite Slaughter getting in the bring against four men, the eliminates Volkoff (who's career is over after this), Butch and Luke in that order with relative please. Finally, Santana beats Slaughter by disqualification when General Adnan hits him with Iraqi flag. At last some interesting booking even though the match was awful. Santana takes the upset victory as the sole survivor and becomes this last finest hour. three/tenThe egg hatches and it's Hector Guerrerro in a silly outfit. He dances with Gene Okerlund and gets booed by the crowd while Piper and Monsoon pretend they are enjoying it. Match of Survival: Ultimate Warrior, Hulk Hogan and Tito Santana of Warlord, Power and Glory, Rick 'Model' Martel and 'Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase: Just merely another catalogue of eliminations as Santana pins Warlord in seconds with flying forearm at least avenging this previous Summerslam defeat (four-three adv. Dibiase's team). Dibiase stun guns Santana afterwards for the pin (four-two adv. Dibiase's team). Hogan kicks out of The Power Plex and proceeds to pin Roma after a clothesline, effectively killing off Power and Glory's push (three-two adv. Dibiase's team). Hogan eliminates Martel by count-out and Dibiase with the leg drop for the pin (two-one adv. Hogan's team). Hogan finally allows Warrior into the match who quickly disposes of former nemesis Hercules after a splash. A very predictable ending to the point of nauseous. two/tenOverall, too many matches and too little time obviously had a detrimental effect as the wrestlers were almost waiting on a conveyor belt to be pinned. Most of the wheels were decimated by Warrior and Hogan which is a poor way to handle a great roster of wrestlers.",negative

This will be the last PPC. In the send, both the Legion of Destruction and the Legion of Destruction were eliminated at an infinitely lower price (the Warriors chose one of the two). Perfect to use the perfect Plex as a pin in the Texas Tornado. He then tried the same with the Hero, but the Hero did not sell it and kicked him out. The hero comes back with a splash to fix Perfect and be the only survivor. Five / Ten Dreams of Dreams (Dusty Rhodes, Koko B Ware, and the Hart Foundation of the Million Dollar Team (Ted Dibiase, Mystery Partner, and Rhythm and Blues): The mysterious partner is Undertaker, and the had a direct impact on Koko when the started using the tombstone ( Monsoon can still tell the exact length, weight, and completion of the action, while pretending not to know who it is) to the Dibiase team by four to three points. afterwards, Niedhart became a victim of Dibiase (three-two adv.

Exhibitors are the first independent team in the history of the Survivor Series. , Dino Bravo, circumcised and uncircumcised, and Haku)). Duggan used it to hit the quake and was disallowed (three to three), then came out with four to two points. Shortly afterwards, Bravo committed suicide by allowing Hogan to hold him in front of this chest (thirty-two for two counts. Hulkamaniacs). Shortly after the earthquake (two-two) the successfully defeated Bossman by two drops of elbow. Hogan was defeated, and the tow truck finally received the label (who knew where it was at this time?), And the fought for thirty seconds before counting the quake. Only Hogan and bars were left. The Barbarian has committed good sins, but the will surely be missed by the huge boots and legs. Hogan is the only survivor. Fourth / Ten Mercenary League (Nikolai Volkoff, Tito Santana and Bushwhackers) (Sgt Slaughter, Boris Zhukov and Orient Express): All mercenaries are painted with a face mask. In the final PPV, Santana quickly rounded out Zhukov in a few seconds (four-three league). There was no manifestation of Bolsheviks. The Bushwhackers beat Sato with Battering Ram, despite Tanaka being an official (adv-on-two adv. League) and will be the last time to appear in WWF PPV because Orient Express is are-packaged. When Santana startled him with a flying farm, Tanaka followed Sato (a union of four-member advertisers). Although Slagina was led by four men, the removed Volkoff (his career ended), Butch and Luke respectively. Finally, when General Adnan struck him with the Iraqi flag, Satan defeated the Slaughter unjustly. Although the game was awesome, there was an interesting booking in the send. Santana claimed the victory as the only survivor, and it was the last and best moment. Three / ten eggs hatched, and Hector Guerrero was dressed in rags. He danced with Gene Okerlund and was ridiculed by the crowd, while Piper and Monsoon pretended to enjoy it. Survival Fight: The Best Fight, Hulk Hogan and Tito Santana of Warlord, Strength and Glory, Rick'Model 'Martel and Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase: is just another form of shouting, because Santana uses flying arms to retaliate at least within seconds Seconds Summerslam lost before team fight -three adv. Dibiase's Team). After the Dibiase gun Santana is the pin (forty-two of the Dibiase group). Hogan built the Power Plex and went on to block Roma behind the line of clothing, blocking power and glory (three-two adv. Dibiase's team). Hogan wiped out Matel with a countdown, and Dibias removed Matel (Hogan's team, a pair of two) with this feet falling. Hogan finally allowed the Warriors into the game, the Warriors quickly confronting the former enemy Hercules after spraying. The most predictable send to the abomination level. In general, too many games and too little time will definitely have a negative impact, as wrestlers are almost always on the conveyor belt waiting to be nailed. Most of the wheels were wiped out by Hero and Hogan, the worst way to handle a large number of players.",negative

The Warrior returns to contention to make Perfect and just a savior. Dream Team (Dusty Rhodes, Koko B Ware and The Hart Foundation of the Million Dollar Team (Ted Dibiase, Partner Mystery and Rhythm and Blues): The secret partner is Undertaker, for the first time, the influences Koko’s casting directly at The Tombstone (Monsoon is still table to tell the exact length, weight and finishing touches these pretend to be the does’t know who the is) which makes him four-thirds of the Dibiase team.

The earthquake was table to defeat Bossman with two elbows pointing at the pin immediately after (two-two) . Hogan was beaten, and the Tugboat finally received a signal (who knows who was the there?), that wrestle for thirty seconds before calculating the earthquake. Only Hogan and Barbarin are left. The barbarian committed some offence but inevitably fell into large shoes and at the point of the foot on the pin. Hogan was the only survivor. Fourteen Coalitions (Nikolai Volkoff, Tito Santana and Bushwhackers) Sgt Slaughter, Boris Zhukov and Orient Express: All Mercanaries wear face masks. Lightning fast pins with Santana handed this Zhukov PPV in the final seconds (four three tips. Coalition). There was not even a single Bolshevik show. The Bushwhackers hit Sato The Battering Ram even though Tanaka is a legal person (four to two. Coalition) and this is the latest WWF PPV feature since the Orient Express is ready. Tanaka follows Sato when Santana surprises him with flying hands (four and one advice. Alliance). As Slaughter skills the four men, the removes Volkoff (who finished the race after that), Butch and Luke respectively as relatives. Finally, Santana defeated the Qualified Slayer when General Adnan hit the Iraqi flag. Finally an interesting yellow though the game is very bad. Santana was alone in the sad savior’s victory and it was the last time at best. Thirteen Eggs are cracked and Hector Guerrerro is wearing silly clothes. He plays Gene Okerlund and people shout at him while Piper and Monsoon pretend to be having fun. Rescue Game: The Last Warrior, Hulk Hogan and Tito Santana as Warlord, Power and Honor, Rick ‘Model’ Martel and ‘Million Dollar Man’ Ted Dibiase: Only another book of annihilation like Santana defeats the Warlord in seconds. less revenge for previous Summerslam defeat (four-three consultants. Group of Dibiase). Dibiase hits Santana's gun after the pin (four two advisors. Dibiase team). Hogan came out of The Power Plex and continued to tie Roma to a clothing line, effectively killing the push of Power and Glory (three mentors. Dibiase team). Hogan removed the count of Martel and Dibiase with a point leg for a pin (two-point. Hogan's team). Hogan finally allowed Warrior in the game to quickly throw the nerves in front of Hercules after the spray. Very predictable send to nausea level. In general, too many games and too little time will clearly have a negative impact because wrestlers will soon have to wait for the cargo belt bottom.

Four / Ten Unions (Nikolai Volkov, Tattoo Santana and Bush Walkers) Tenants (Sergeant Slater, Boris Zukov and Orient Express): All were wearing masks. As Santana, the sharp electric pegs rotate Zukov in seconds in this last PPV (Four Three Advance Alliance). There was not even a Bolshevik show.

Tanaka follows Sato when Santana hits him with a flying farm (with an advanced alliance). Although Slater took the lead against four men, Vokaf ended this career thereafter (Butch and Luke are relatives, respectively).

Here in this she was definitely above average as the former fed (or was it fed on loan?) profile. Her character got along well with the motley bunch of Special Investigation Unit cops she was assigned with. There was't really a goofy character you'd roll your eyes at and just despise which was good. Also good is it takes awhile to know who the murderer is. but when I found out I was't that surprised. Oh well. One more thing that was good was the Los Angeles locations. Quite possibly if this was made today they'd use Toronto for Vancouver but there they really shot in downtown L. A.

He’s a professional TV factor, but nothing special. Here, you are certainly above the level of the former Federal Reserve (or loans?). His personality goes well with the special research team assigned to him. There is really no stupid character that will make you roll your eyes and just despise who is the best. Another advantage is that it takes some time to identify the killer. But when I found out, I was not shocked. OK then. Another good thing is the Los Angeles area. It is possible that this was done today, they will use Toronto in Vancouver, but they shot in downtown Los Angeles. I really like it (even though I hate Los Angeles) and I love this movie.

12791,"Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, center around three ""couples"" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start as far as I'm concerned. Interesting. The couples break down into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being ""harmlessly"" stalked by a gay man. The ""het"" couple really don't have much of a role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex for playing around with each other, but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized. My assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sex/violence are integrated in a couples life. The couple karen't very aggressive and it's not even shot in any kind of erotic way. As characters, they don't add much to the theme for plot. The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an valley. This escalates into violence. And the violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence it release grows as the film progresses. The main problem I had is the violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger. It just does't work. Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters' relationships with violence, this is a major problem. Unfortunately, the make-up does't help either. Sometimes, it's okay, other times it is very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on this face. Confusing.

Perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the send. Shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two. I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It is admirable. Most low budget flicks don't aspire to much. I don't think Calson achieved want the was aiming for.

The couple split up and became a romantic couple, two friends of the opposite sex and a “safe” opposite sex, which is being manipulated by homosexual men. This ""het"" couple does't have many roles in the movie. There are shows where they like to be violent when they make love because they are looked down upon, but they don't seem to have a real purpose. My hypothesis is that they represent everyday examples of how sex / violence enters a couple's life. Karen is not violent, and she does not take any photographs. As characters, they did not add much to the plot. These two male friends form the score of the conspiracy. They engage in some form of sexual assault by forcing gay men to have sex with them in the valley. This is increasing violence. Violence has changed them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. As the film progressed, their demand for violence also increased. One of the biggest problems I have never faced is that violence is rampant. It seems that none of this characters are in real danger.

15233,"Let me say first that this show was top tier when John Ritter was there. Upon this death, the show did drop off a bit, but the producers did't give up on the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast from two thousand and three to two thousand and five. The show center around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, may the rest in peace), this wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson), and their son, Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was on the show, I would shriek in laughter (and proud to admit it, I am), but now that the's gone, I'll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh. I'm very glad that I fell for this show's trance after Ritter's untimely death, because it made the reps with Ritter so much better. Ritter's character is just so well acted and well rounded, that you can't help but love him. He is always bossing the girls around about dating, but the really wants them to be happy. It's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment. Katey Sagal is great as well, and she too is a likable character. After Ritter's death, her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids, but I believe Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson, and Spanjers, because she and Ritter had been friends for a long time. The funniest person on the show would have to be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She is the ultimate blonde: gorgeous, slow, dim-witted, yet she is a smart person. She is off the wall hilarious with her innocent 'blonde' humour and how conceited she is. Amy Davidson can get a tad annoying as Kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. The only fault of the show is that the show never really gives Kerry anything to be happy about. She's always after Bridget, and her character feels like it's just thrown in there. Martin Spanjers as the alone Hennessy son is hysterical, and when Ritter is on the show, the's mostly comic material. Upon the death of Ritter, the show does provide some story lines for Rory. David Spade and James Garner are all nothing but laughs, with the occasional side story for C. J., Spade's character. Garner plays Cate's father, as a bit of background information.

Ritter's role is well-played and broad, and you can't help but fall in love with him. He always gives instructions to the girls around him, but they want them to be happy. This is one reason why my dad hates having a boyfriend. Katey Sagal is also a good, lovely character. After Ritter's death, this character did not give this children a positive impact and energy, but I believe Sagal shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson and Spanjers because the and Ritter had been friends for a long time.

But your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from Different Strokes. There are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. The Quiroz brothers have no clue. First of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliper thespians. Really how hard is it to play a priest for an overbearing mother? Certainly a city the size of San Francisco has a few professional factors willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit. Clearly Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger who play these roles have other talents such as landscaper for waitress they bought to be fine tuning. Joe Rosete as the killer (yes the serial killer is simply known as ""The Killer"") is also pretty awful in a mentally will method kind of way but I am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as this character is written with zero style for personality. A boring almost laughable serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. In addition the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as an ABC Family movie of the week. There is no nudity for violence to speak of and the R rating clearly is for the adult style spacing. This move meanders like an eighty-five year old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and her turn signal on.

Judd Nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side. His life is hell and made worse by this obnoxious and overbearing companion Bill Paxton (who I feel embarrassed for - this was a really tasteless role for a talented factor). A freak accident walters Nelson's career course and mayhem ensues. The attempts at humour were corny, predictable and often base and tasteless. Wayne Newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but the adds nothing - comedically for otherwise.

34330,"In reviewing this film I can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in July, August, and September of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one in that garden spot of the earth, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground was not anything like I remember basic training. But one has to remember at the time this was post Korea which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew them. It was not Vietnam, a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit. The draft at that time was an unwelcome, but accepted as still necessary for the country's defense. Richard Widmark is a veteran of Korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas. The film is about one of this training cycles and the men of the platoon the has to train. They're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade. One thing I will praise Take The High Ground for is the fact that MGM recognized your army was now an integrated one with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the platoon. It was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing. But I will say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured of this smart mouth from day one. Richard Widmark would have not risked death for becoming a eunuch in order to give Jerome Courtland confidence with a weapon. And no way would have the worried so much about Robert Arthur deserting. He's have just let the MPs deal with him. Of course being shot in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas did give Take the High Ground good authenticity. But view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day. I do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you were't worried about them getting on your case for something which was ninety-five% of the time. But there main't no way that Karl Malden would have slugged Widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits. Both would have realized that would have undermined authority, something the military just does't let happen. I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like its talented cast, it's talented director Richard Brooks, even the silly theme by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh from their Oscar a year before for High Noon. The film actually got an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and story by Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufman's vivid imagination.",negative

But people should remember that this was after North Korea, which ended in the latter, but as we know, this was a normal war. The draft at the time was unpopular, but accepted as it was still necessary for national security. Another thing I want to commend for staying on high ground is that MGM recognizes that your army is now a combined force, and that William Hazzard exists as a black worker on the platoon.

Monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is. Cruise mentions that the painting has a ""vanilla sky"".

My favourite thing about “Sorte Nula” is the intricate details that Fernando Fragata goes on to be interested in what’s going on and what’s going to happen next. It is a very detailed and highly developed for love-story-tag-bad-love. What is more interesting and surprising about this is the fact that the characters are in the same situation, none of them know the whole story and it is left to their own assumptions which makes “Sorte Nula” higher than others. This is definitely not a movie you want to go out to relax in the bathroom because there is no doubt that you will miss something important. I feel, one of the main features of the film is that it should be environmentally friendly. Scary but funny.

37674,"I just saw Mar Ardentro and felt that I had to comment on this film. Euthanasia is a difficult topic in any field and unfortunately is can sometimes distort the true value of a movie. Many people have craved about the excellent cast and it's beautiful imagery/camera-work. Certainly Javier Bardem is an factor that brings something extra to each film the makes. To say that the encompasses the real Sampredo is a little silly since I don't think that any of the reviewers have known Sampredo personally. To lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed does't constitute a 'perfect' performance. Bardem just does what the does well. and that's it. The camera-work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself blacks to deliver. Sampredo there is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that the leaves this loving family behind and marries a woman that the only seeks out when the other will not help him in this quest for a dignified death. Now I'm not there to say anything about the right for for against euthanasia. The problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it. The movie's subject is so strong that you're almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter. I find it a weakness for the movie -unintentionally- portrays Sampredo as a unsymphatetic character. Someone who is much smarter then this family as portrayed in the simple cousin that does't ""get"" the double layered poem directed towards him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because HE thinks this life is undignified. A scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the ""wrong"" choice ending up in a far state of dementia thus indicating that Sampredo's choice was the right one. The woman that constantly seeks him out is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by Sampredo when she agrees to help him die. These choices make Sampredo into a calculated figure no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. Argumentive I would say it does't convince fully and I kinda think that Amenabar did't intend on adding this unbalanced element in this film. For a young director it's still an impressive film and it certainly has it's strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo for instance). The camera-work IS impressive and the film is well acted. But ten out of ten. no the movie does't reach that excellence.",positive
37674,"I just looked at Mar Ardentro and thought I should comment on this movie. Euthanasia is a deceptive topic in any field and, unfortunately, sometimes distorts the movie True Value. Most people want the best cast and beautiful pictures / photos. Yes, Javier Bardem is an important factor in the production of each film. It is absurd to say that it involves the real Sampredo, because I don't think anyone who comments knows Sampredo. It’s the kind of show to show off your attraction without walking away, even though it’s not the best thing to do. Bardem did only what the was good at. That's it. The photographic works are beautiful and revoke the emotions and ideas expressed by the darkness of the film itself. Sampredo is described as a man who longed for death so much that the left this loving family and married a woman. Now I am not talking about the right to oppose euthanasia. The problem is, it's hard to run away when you comment on such a movie. The content of this movie is so powerful that you can even discuss a movie with such a powerful theme. I found out that the weakness of the movie-misunderstood - portrayed Sampredo as an uninteresting person. Someone smarter than this family, as the simple cousin described, did not “find” a double poem aimed at him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because they believe that this kind of life is degrading. The combined show with a female lawyer who made the ""wrong"" choice in the movie eventually led to a difficult mental state, thus showing that Sampredo's choice was correct. The woman who continued to look for him was almost ignored by this beautiful lawyer, but when Sampredo agreed to help her die, the suddenly married her. No matter how attractive Baden portrays him, this choice makes Sampredo a well-thought-out person. On the contrary, I would say that it is not entirely convincing. I think Amenabar has no intention of adding to this inequality in this movie.

In the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. it has been my favourite war film). Keep quiet and run deep with some things. There is nothing wrong with having ideas, as long as you use them to cool things. Boy do, Roddenberry and company are doing great things for this. The story begins when the Romulans broke the treaty a hundred years ago and crossed a neutral zone and destroyed a series of external coupons in the area, apparently testing their main weapons and invisible screens (and the transfer of power coordination). . Kirk has to decide whether it is worth the risk to try to stop the Romulan ship, because in reality the biggest risk is to let them go after the invaders have destroyed four military bases. Kirk chose the latter wisely. This is the first time you have seen the enemy of the Federation, the Romulans, a war-like nation but glorious in their own way. They are distant relatives of the Vulcans. However, unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romanians did not abandon their emotions and the violence and imperialist ways, even though they had made advances in technology. All of this is irrelevant to Mr. The most important thing to him - the hatred that Romulans and Spock look like one. Spock saved lives until the was sent (naturally). This is in stark contrast to Captain Kirk and the Romulan Emperor, neither of whom has a desire to do this will. They both just do their jobs. After all, it is mutual respect. This is the first series of Trek to deal directly with discrimination, and it is very clever (as opposed to ""Let it be your last battle"" in Season three). Just like the enemy below, we played an old game of chess between two captains of two very similar ships. You will soon find out that the two managers are very good. very good. If you are going to fight, you will want both of these people to be your leader. They are both respectable and dignified people with a sense of responsibility. However, even though Emperor Romulan is responsible for this homeland, the still finds himself wanting to destroy it before the returns to this hometown, rather than start another war between the stars. However, the will still make every effort to bring it home, just as Kirk tried this best to stop him. In my opinion, this is one of the five Trek. It has it all: lots of movement, scepticism, fun dialogue, great shows (I still think Romulan Director is the best Trek character of Mark Lenard), and the is table to make social comments without over-preaching. It is unfortunate that Roddenberry forgot the last part when making TNG. Look at this article, and look at the enemies below.",negative

24995,"This movie was a real torture fest to sit through. Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self-evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it. When it does stoop to putting in its argument, it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts ; all that's missing is someone crying ""when is someone going to think of the children!"". While watching this movie, I kept thinking ""where'd you hear that?"" for ""that can't possibly be true"" - yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources. And bless 'em, the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and icons of nuclear power; to be fair, that might be the fault of the film-makers, but equally fairly, it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars. As for the performers. Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I've enjoyed, and I'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause. But they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over, now that the sixty have passed them by. Particularly embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor. Nash seems to be trying too hard - the looks like the can't possibly believe the things the's being told (not that I blame him), but desperate to feel noticed and included. James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest ""anthem"" never, ""Stand and Fight"", in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine. In fact, most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being patronizing. Nobody seems worked up by this event, as if it really does't mean much to them at all. It's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be John Hall, of the band Orleans, and responsible for some of the wimpiest MOR pop of the seventy. (Remember, if you dare, ""Dance With Me"" and ""Still the One"".) It's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause there fails to inspire any real passion in the music. The cause is supposedly life-or-death, but everybody sleepwalk through their numbers like they're playing the Catskills. Except maybe Gil-Scott Heron - this protest number ""We Almost Lost Detroit"" is on topic at least, but delivered with all the smugness of a high-schooler impressed with how 'controversial' the's being. Only Bruce Springsteen's performance raises a pulse; I've never been a big fan of the Boss, but the absolutely smokes, no question. Part of me thinks the was taped separately, at another event, and edited into this movie to give wake the audience. Compared to the general blandness and air of self-satisfaction there, it's no wonder Bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll. But even this performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting. I don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a 'seventys film, but the shots are unnecessarily static, broken up only by split-second cutaways to a back-up singer's tonsils. Now, some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with; and *maybe* the film-makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage - but all you have to do is watch ""Rust Never Sleeps"" for ""The Last Waltz"" to see a movie like this done with more skill. And with more exciting musicians. So really, there's only two things to watch this movie for: Springsteen's stellar performance, and as a sad snapshot about a counter-culture in decline.",negative
24995,"This movie is really interesting. Its first mistake was to treat nuclear power as a ""bad thing"", so there was no need to convince the audience to believe it. When it contributes to the discussion, it enables participants to breathe a sigh of relief and present unconfirmed facts; what is missing is that someone is crying ""When do you think about the kids!"". When I watched this movie, I kept thinking ""where did you hear that?"" Because it ""cannot be true"" - but no information is supported by any reliable sources. Bless, the “ordinary people” in the movie are more like Luddites than people who know about the benefits and characteristics of nuclear power; to be fair, this may be the fault of the filmmakers, but equally, it is common. the circumstances of the movie stars. As for the players. Now some of these people are respected musicians and I love their music, and I believe some of them believe this. But they are all like old hippies who need something fun, now they are sixty years old. Especially embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor. Nash seems to be working very hard — it seems impossible to believe what was said (not that I criticize him), but the sincerely wants to be recognized and included. James Taylor has made the most cowardly joke ""National Anthem"", ""Stand and Fight"" in the most disgusting way you can imagine. After all, most of the performance is not dignified without support. No one seems happy about this, as if it does't make sense to them. It’s worth noting that the driving force behind the event seems to be John Hall of Orleans, who was in charge of MOR’s pop music in the seventys. (Remember, if you are brave, ""Dance with me"" and ""Still."") It is worth noting, for it symbolizes that the cause in which you failed to promote any real passion for music. The reason should be a matter of life and death, but everyone sleeps on their numbers, as they play the Catskills. With the exception of Gil-Scott Heron — the number one strike ""We almost lost Detroit"" is at least a title, but with the humility of a high school student, ""controversy"" about the current system. Only Bruce Springsteen's performance is fun; I’ve never been a fan of the Big Boss, but there’s no doubt that the will smoke for sure. Part of me thought it was recorded separately from another event and was edited in this movie to awaken the audience. Compared to the normal and relaxed atmosphere there, it’s no surprise that the Blues have been hailed as the savior of rock music. But even this performance was interrupted by the shooting of the concert. I don’t want seventys movies to have a lot of good lens movements, but these shorts karen’t unnecessarily stagnant, just cut by the tons of the artist that caught us right away. Now, some of them may be because the factors were lifeless in the beginning; and * maybe * filmmakers are more skilled at photographing than at concert shots - but all you have to do is watch ""Rusty Never Sleep"" The Last Waltz ""to watch such movies more creatively.

Like action makers. Now some of these people are highly respected artists and I enjoy my music, and I’m sure some of them really believe in it. But they all come together as old hippies looking for something to work on, now in their sixties. Graham Nash and James Taylor were particularly embarrassing. Nash looks very hardworking-it seems unbelievable what is being said to him (not to blame him), but the closes hope in feeling and being included. James Taylor does what should be the most vocal protest “song” never, “stand up and fight”, as the most painful and fun you can imagine. In fact, most shows are very good when they are not watched. No one worked on this incident, as if it did’t really make sense. It’s worth noting that the driving force behind this whole incident seems to be John Hall, of the Orleans team, who was responsible for some of MOR’s dream pop of the seventies. (Remember, if you dare, “Dance With Me” and “Still the One”.) It’s remarkable because that’s the hallmark of why out there fails to inspire any real ambition.in music. The reason is thought to be life-or-death, but everyone goes through their numbers as if they were playing the Catskills. With the exception of Gil-Scott Heron-the protest number “I’m Near Lost Detroit” was on the subject somehow, but was communicated to all the high school students who were robbed as ‘controversial’. Only Bruce Springsteen’s performance boosts the heart rate; I haven’t been a big fan of Boss yet, but the drinks heavily, no question. Part of me thinks it was especially shot, another stage, edited by this film to wake up the audience. Compared to the overall tip and the air of fun there, it’s no surprise that Bruce is praised as a rock’n’roll savior. But even this performance is holed with lifeless drama shooting. I did’t expect a lot of camera movement to illuminate a ‘seventy film’, but the shots were static and unnecessary, only divided into two second sections divided by the factor’s chin. Now, some of this may be because the factors have no life to begin with; and * perhaps * filmmakers are more proactive in shooting documents than drama scenes - but all you have to do is watch Rust Never Sleeps on “The Last Waltz” to see a film like the one made with additional skills.

As I watched this movie, I kept thinking, ""Where did you hear that?"" ""What could be true"" - but very little information is backed up by reliable sources. And blessedly, the 'ordinary people' in the film are more united as luddites than those who understand the beauty and symbols of nuclear power. Neutrality, it would be the fault of the filmmakers, but as such, it is the common denominator of the Rock Stars. As far as the players are concerned. Now some of them are highly respected artists whose music I love, and I'm sure some of them really do.

James Taylor did what should have been the worst protest song never, ""Stop Fighting"", in the most interesting way you can imagine. In fact, most activities are just as frustrating when not supported. No one seems to have done well with the event, as if it meant nothing to them. It's good to note that the speed that affected the entire event seems to be the lifeblood of the Orleans band, and the Vampest MOR pop of the seventy's is in charge. (Remember, if you dare, ""Dance with me"" and ""You're still one"".) The reason is called life for death, but everyone sleeps at their own number as if they were playing cats skills. ۔ Perhaps with the exception of Gil Scott Heron - this protest number is at least in the headlines ""We're almost the most lost Detroit"", but it's brought through all the high school mess that affects how 'controversial' it is. Is. Only Bruce Springston's performance makes this heart beat faster. I've never been a big fan of the boss, but there's absolutely no question of smoking. My part is that it was filmed separately for another event, and the film was edited to awaken the audience. Compared to the enthusiasm and contentment there, it is not surprising that Bruce was hailed as the savior of Rock in Roll. But this drama is also played with unhealthy concert shooting. I don't expect the film's much-anticipated camera movement from the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, but the shot is unnecessarily stagnant, with only a second's difference in the supporting artist's stone. Now, some of this may be because the players are not alive.

I still think this movie has an obscene video look, and the picture I just took is clear and vivid. you must be affected. and in the final minutes of the movie, this movie is nothing special. Why this is currently rated five.three and popular with critics is beyond my comprehension- this movie is ninety-nine.forty-four% stupid. Gordon Lewis. one hundred thousand, nine hundred and sixty And by one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, Lewis was known for producing an astonishing series of low-cost abusive films, such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER AG YIYA. However, over the years, there have been many fans who have been called ""the father of blood"" - fans who don't care about the functionality of the show and are aware of the groundbreaking in some of the films. But in addition to the huge use of fake blood and real courage, this movie is a waste — you can’t believe the movie’s scores are nine points and ten scores. It’s like putting a velvet Elvis painting on the Louvre! ! The film tells the story of a series of murders that took place in a robbery. When I said it was horrible, it was very bloody and disgusting to one thousand nine hundred and seventy-two people - although the special results seemed very hot by modern standards. So, even though there are some horrible and cruel murders in the movie (I would like to be the narrators — they come from a very sick mind, showing a sickly disregard for women), but at least they won’t make you feel sick. ., For they have acted ruinously on their own part; Obviously, in most cases, they cut rubber dolls and mannequins. But letting them do horrible truths, even if it is not true, is irritating and proves to be immoral. Because the police are stupid, the only hope for this movie is a man named Abraham Gentry - this style and style of speech are very close to the stock of John Waters' first films, David Lokari. Although this performance was good, it was so good and interesting that it rekindled my interest. You can still laugh, and it's amazing that this is the only movie that has never been made! ! It is also strange that many women want him — especially because they do not look that way. The other people in the movie are stupid and stupid. In fact, I hope that more people will be killed — they are there! Their performance is unbelievable at all, and it is clear that the director did not make the film — because most of the scenes in the film are worse than any of Edwood's artistic films ""The ninth project from the outside world."" After all, for most women in a film, the only thing that matters is that they want to appear in the film, so they are willing to release their clothes. Now I know this sounds disgusting, but most of them are unattractive and look like drug addicts, they take off their clothes to prepare for the next one. When the ladies take off their clothes, the men in the crowd will give them money to put it on again (wow-Henny Youngman you should have said it in a movie)! However, considering Lewis's budget, these could be the ""best"" player. In general, a bucket of dirty bile is worse than other movies controlled by a director. It said a lot! It is violent (but stupid), anti-feminist (treats them like meat and things that need to be cut) and is not good at all from start to finish.",negative

Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more. Miscast is Ida Lupino in the leading role! Lupino, a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is there under the illusion she is Rita Hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar-room Torch Singer. Handsome Cornel Wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented Celeste Holm who's role is little more than a bit part. Then we have Richard Widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture! When we first see him the is a nice O. K. guy who runs a thriving Road House. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear - the becomes insanely jealous of this manager (Wilde) when the latter tells him that the is about to marry Lupino. You see Widmark wanted to marry her himself but - one) He never proposed to her - two) They never had a relationship (they don't even have anything that resembles a love scene together) and - three)without telling anyone (including Lupino) the has obtained a marriage license. Wow! So how Widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with Lupino after such a ""courtship"" is anybody's guess. Huh? Well, when Widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie I am sorry to say. From there on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical! His closing this marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing. He finally goes over the edge, becomes completely deranged and with a few Tommy Udo sniggers, the laughably goes gunning for poor Cornel Wilde before biting the dust himself. And if that in't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. There's not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie! Added to this - ninety-five% of the film takes place at night. Besides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette ""Widmark & Lupino At Fox"". Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me! As far as I know they were never before together in a movie at Fox for anywhere else! However this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter know-alls as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and a few others who amazingly cheap praise on this wearisome and cringe - inducing affair. All I can say then it must be me I guess. But ""Road House"" up to now was a forgotten and buried Noir and as far as I am concerned it should have remained so.

Miscast Ida Lupino in the lead role! Lupino, a lady who has spoken out about sexual appeal as a bloody orange, is not under the illusion that Rita Hayworth plays a part in the comedy bar. The beautiful Cornel Wilde as her love is wood as never and completely destroyed is the talent of Celeste Holm whose role is a bit less. So we have Richard Widmark with the funniest part of the picture! The first time we see him the is a good man O. K. which runs a thriving Country House. Then suddenly - and for insufficient reasons - the becomes jealous of this manager (Wilde) when the latter tells him that the is about to marry Lupino. You see that Widmark wants to get married but - one) He did’t propose to her - two) They did’t have a relationship (they did’t even have such a romance) and - three) without telling anyone (including Lupino ) which the received. a marriage license. Sige! So how Widmark achieved something similar to Lupino’s marital happiness after “dating” is everyone’s imagination. Yes Well, when Widmark breaks down all the issues also the film is sorry to say. From there the Widmark brand becomes comedy by accident! His arrest in these first cases was unreasonable and unreliable.

27372,"Ok, after reading a couple of reviews on Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct trip off from Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water. The only part that was a ripoff from Nadia is that the pendant from Nadia and the pendant from Atlantis bear so much resemblance in terms of how it's used, origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied. If you want to consider how Kida and Nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against Disney too(It was kind of weird for Nadia and Kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi, not to mention they both move in a similar style too). As an anime fan I have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in Laputa, the ancient mask from Princess Mononoke, the resemblance of the vehicles to the Garfish submarine in Nadia, etc). The plot itself I believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that Disney can pull it off without the use of Captain Nemo(the main character in Jules Verne's twenty Leagues Under the Sea which is also the main character in Nadia). As for Mylo and Jean wearing similar style glasses. As shown in the novel ""Lord of the Flies"", glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. I think Mylo, Jean, the main character from Stargate and a dozen of other ""INTELLIGENT"" characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses. As for the submarines, and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedo which really resembles what Nautilius does), I want to state that it's a required element for either one if Atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters). As for the crew having some charactistical resemblance with the crew from Nautilius in Nadia, it might be the artwork but I don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me. As an anime fan that rated Nadia as the #one best anime I never watched even now today. I do have my doubts about Atlantis when I first saw the preview. But now that I watched the movie, I once again regained my confidence with Disney and have high hopes for their future movies after Atlantis. Overall, the best Disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better. Also, it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (I was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how Disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing)",positive
27372,"Well, after reading a few comments about Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I just want to clarify the misunderstanding because it starts directly from Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water. The main feature released by Nadia is that Nadia's handle and Atlantis circle are similar in the way they are used, how they originated, and how they were created from the source of life. There is no doubt that it has been released. If you want to think about how Kida and Nadia dress, then you can use it against Disney. style). As an anime lover, I will have to admit that there is a certain level of copying, but this is in the smallest detail, even if there are not many real ideas (such as intricate design on the wall of Laputa, old Princess Mononoke Cover, similar Garfish marine vehicles in Nadia, etc.). The plot itself I believe is a superhero, and Disney can breed without using Captain Nemo (protagonist for Jules Verne ""Twenty under the Sea"" and Nadia's protagonist), This is truly amazing. As for Mylo and Jean they wear the same glasses. In the book The Lord of the Flies, glasses are a symbol of wisdom and wisdom. I think the main characters of ""Stargate"" Mylo, Jean and other ""smart"" characters don't seem to fit in this role if they don't wear glasses. As for the submarine, and the way the sea fights (using those large torpedoes that break out like Nautilus), I want to make it clear that if Atlantis is involved in this conspiracy (after all, it is a sinking city) the important thing is under water). As for the staff with the same characteristics as Nadia's Nautilius, this may be a work of part, but I don't think there is any crime, because the character's personality is very real to me. As an anime fan, rating Nadia as #one of the best anime, I haven't watched it until today. When I first saw the vision, I had questions about Atlantis. But now that I’m watching this movie, I’ve regained my confidence in Disney and have high hopes for future films after Atlantis. All in all, this is the best Disney movie, but I was not shocked to hear their singing in the middle of the movie, and they changed the cheese script to make it better, more engaging. Also, it's amazing that they portray bad people as normal without making them bad in the first place (I want to know who the bad guys are, only a blonde girl who looks like the bad characters of Disney are portrayed (Known as bad looking scary) , but this is in the smallest detail.

The only part that came from Nadia was that the execution from Nadia and the execution from Atlantis were very similar in terms of how it was used, the original and how it was created from the source of life without a doubt. That was copied. If you want to see how Kedah and Nadia dress the same, you can put the same on Disney (it was weird that Nadia and Kedah wore these motorcycle styles in sci-fi adventure Not that they both fit in the same way again). As a mobile phone fan, I have to admit that there is a certain level of copying, but there are only a few details and although many ideas are not original (such as Lapota wall painting, an ancient mask of Princess Mononok, etc.).

I don't think Mello, Jane, the main character of Stargate and a handful of other ""real"" characters would be table to play the role if they came in without glasses. As far as submarines are concerned, and how submarines fight (and the vast torpedoes that do exactly what Nautilus does), I want to say that if Atlantis is included in the application for someone else, it is necessary (finally). , A tropical city underwater). As for the staff, which bears some resemblance to the staff of Nautilus in Nadia, it may be a work of part, but I don't think there is a copyright infringement because the role of this character was before me.

The only part that emerged from Nadia was that the Nadia pendant and the Atlantis pendant were almost identical in terms of their use, their origin and how they were created from the source of life and were undoubtedly copied.

Brilliant performances by the cast we already know from other Schneider movies, especially Helmut Körschgen as the sidekick of zeroSchneider.

Aaron Carter is really an erection, the rest of the cast should immediately remove their agents. The worst movie never. Needless to say, nothing more. This is a no change draw. <c I don't have to enjoy the movie, it's funny; but alas and John Waters pushes the envelope as far as the can. The story includes Babs Johnson (Devine), she is the dirtiest woman alive. She lives in a trailer with her son Crackers and son Cotton. Not to mention Edie’s heavy weight of crazy eggs flying on the bed. Then there’s Connie and Raymond Marble, two dirty twists who envy Babs. They were more interested in him than being the dirtiest person in life. This means that their guardian was pregnant with the abducted women and sold them to babies to lesbian couples, people flirting in public, and even sent Babs an email. Babs fought to prove that the was the most angry man in life. That even includes your relatives, murder and eating dog abuse and other sexual realities that exist. This is an interesting movie for the whole family. (Well depending on where you live?) Watch “Pink Flamingos”, but don’t forget your nice bag. To keep it hooked, amazing sex and body functions check out “Sweet Movie” as well. <c is a movie for the whole family, but don't forget your snow bag. The story is about Babs Johnson (Devine)",negative

I liked the relationship between the two stars.
