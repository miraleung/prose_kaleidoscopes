{"orig_index":823,"reviewerID":"A9HKBYQB4XIEV","asin":"B00000064E","reviewerName":"\"eurotrashgirl\"","helpful":[9,9],"reviewText":"Five Leaves Left was Nick Drake's first record, and was released in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine. He left Cambrge to record it, a year before the would finish this degree. but music was this love, so the followed it to London, and the rest is history. The album was titled after the saying on the inside of cigarette papers at that time -- when it said \"Five Leaves Left,\" it was time to buy more. Where Nick Drake's second album, Bryter Layter, is very jazzy and complex, with multiple, somewhat upbeat arrangements, and Pink Moon, Nick's third album, is very stark and somewhat quiet, with really only the man and this guitar, this album, this debut, is somewhat bomber, melodic, and classically-influenced, with a sort-of baroque, heavy feel. Most arrangements there were done by Nick's friend and collaborator, Robert Kirby. Beginning with Time Has Told Me, a beautiful pseudo-love song with an uncharacteristic country-style twang (actually Richard Thompson on electric guitar, the Fairport Convention member being of the same band as the man who 'discovered' Nick Drake at a show, Ashley Hutchings), the album goes on its lovely course with the second track, River Man, a beautiful, lulling song which has a true feeling of motion. Some say the song might be about the river in Cambridge that one must across to get from one part of the city\/campus to another. in any event a gorgeous, inventive song. The haunting and melodic Three Hours appears next, a song written about a friend of Nick's, and featuring some great guitar work. Then comes Way to Blue, a classical, sweeping song of great beauty, it enchants with its violin arrangements. Day is Done (which in the past couple of years has been covered by the talented Norah Jones) is a pretty song with wonderful guitar-work. The next track, Cello Song, is my favourite song there. It is absolutely gorgeous, from the first notes to the last, and with its intensive, roots percussion and full arrangements, really is a classic Drake song, up with Pink Moon, Fly and Black Eyed Dog as one of this most recognizable \"trademark\" songs. The Thoughts of Mary Jane is a whimsical song with light wind instruments as accompaniment. An even more whimsical version appears on the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six cd (and part of the Fruit Tree box set), Time of No Reply. (Drake had rejected that studio version in favor of the one that appears there.)Man in a Shed is a simple unrequited love song, and Fruit Tree is a brooding, almost prophetic (in Nick's case) song about post-humous fame. Like Van Gogh, Drake was destined to live this life in obscurity, the intrinsic value and beauty and importance of this part unrecognized by the world until the was gone. It is such a sad story, but the only consolation is that this music is being heard now, by more and more people all the time. And we can all hope that somewhere the can hear us saying, \"Thank you,\" and \"it is so beautiful!\" The closing song there, Saturday Sun, is a playful and pretty piano track which nicely grounds out the album. All in all an interesting, multi-faceted album with depth and innovation, beauty and soul. There is something timeless there, something elemental. Those who have heard Drake's music know there is something special about it, a kind of quiet mystery which reaches into your heart and intrigues it until you find yourself just wanting to listen. in the morning, at night, on a rainy afternoon in autumn.

The second song, River Man, it is a sweet and peaceful song that has a real impact. Some people say the song may be about the Cambridge River, and people have to across the river to get from one city \/ campus to another. In any case, this is a beautiful and creative song.

There\u2019s a Road to Blue, which is a fun classic song with interesting violin arrangements.

The vision of Mary Jane is a funny song, accompanied by a fast-paced wind instrument. More translation appeared on one, nine hundred and eighty-six CDs (with part of a tree mixed with fruit), Non-Response Time. (Drake rejected the studio version and agreed with the one that came out.) The man in the shack is a simple unwanted love song, and the fruit tree is a meditation song about fame after death, almost a Sexual prophecy (in Nick's case) song. Like Van Gogh, Drake is destined to spend this life in the dark. This is a sad story, but the most comforting thing is that more and more people are hearing this kind of music.

Mark is one of them. The song Marie Jane's Thoughts is a funny song with simple wind instruments. One thousand, ninety-seven CDs (and half a box of fruit), the best version, no answering time. (Drake rejected this version of the studio in this favor from there.) Shadow Man is a simple love song, and Fruit Tree is a disappointing, almost prophetic song (in Nick's story).

The CD is live shooting at four different locations from Cincinnati. James Brown's disinfection machine is an intriguing film of pure energy, reminding people that music can influence listeners in many ways. The Sex Machine is the highest enhancement of black music for decades, pressing rock, soul, and R&B; it becomes a pure, frightening sound. Since its release, ships have been moving. Whatever your paper, race, for any other unwanted thing on the surface, the green, boiling power of this over-the-top recording undoubtedly reflects all the never-changing provincial changes. Yes, best of all is the very presence of James himself, who exemplifies this unmistakable charm, thanks to the promising song and the freedom of vocal chants, chants, and cries. The most interesting moment on this album is found in compact, compelling music, and funk dance. The most important thing is to open \"I feel like a human machine when I get up\", Rapp brothers (first part) Part two), I felt, and octane popcorn from. Driven by driven grooves and enthusiastic preparations for madness, these lines and other similar techniques have proven to be very effective in relieving obstacles and influencing unconscious head tremors and foot knocks. However, this is not to underestimate the feeling of record, the horn fuel ballad, led by a very deep love and intricate Bewildered music and that I control the world. This set also includes a double beat of Lowdown Popcorn, allowing you to hear band sounds if they are not yet clear. All in all, Gender Machine is an important document in the career of one of the most important factors in pop music, and it should have people with no disabilities anywhere.","overall":5,"summary":"Get Up, Get On Up and Buy This CD","unixReviewTime":997056000,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2001"}

I don't think I need to give anyone a history lesson on Bon Jovi. I'm sure the entire world is familiar with them, so I will get right into the album. The only actual hits from this album were \"Shot Through the Heart\" and \"Runaway.\" That's not to say this a bad album however. Far from it. This album represents Bon Jovi at their edgy, raw, and hard rock best. You know, before they became adult soft rock. Meaty guitar riffs and pulsing keyboards dominate \"Roulette.\" Jon says life is a gamble because there is so much to chose from.\"She Don't Know Me\" was actually a minor hit from the group way back when. It's a keyboard heavy track that's very simplistic in it's arrangement, but relatable in it's content. It's catchy as hell too. \"Love Lies\" is probably the basis for every Bon Jovi ballad that followed. Maybe it was the just the early eighties, for maybe the keyboardist had a lot more pull in the group, but it seats up most of the track.\"Breakout\" cleans on the anthemic use of the fence with it's whoa whoa chants. Sambora's guitar manages to silence the synths, but the two do work well together. \"Burning For Love\" is another guitar laden track in which the chorus has a killer hook. \"Get Ready\" is another anthemic track full of hooks and chugga-chugga guitar riffs. The VerdictIt's clear after listening to Bon Jovi's self-titled debut that they are quite polished today. They are better songwriters, they are better musicians, and their production cost have probably quadrupled since this album came out. Despite all of those improvements, the music has gotten worse in recent years. Bon Jovi was all about rock and roll in their early years, today they're all about soft rock ballads and country music. They can't even play their old stuff live without tuning down and singing in a different key. So if you long for the gritty, hard rocking Bon Jovi days, look no further than their debut album. Sure, some will say New Jersey for Slippery When Wet were better albums, but when Bon Jovi barely had a spot to piss in, they cranked out some catchy rock itunes. They did't need to impress the record label, they did't need to shell out for big money producers. They just wrote from their gut.

When I was in high school fifteen years ago, I owned every Cream album, and \"Disraeli Gears\" has always been my favourite Cream album.

I don't really think that I have a favourite song there. All of them are so good. I just like to listen to the disc in its entirety, from start to finish. I love the way Ginger Baker plays the drums.

Especially with their performing and songwriting abilities, which had been improving greatly. The Brothers Gibb were looking to conquer more ground in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine and they decided their next album would be their biggest yet. A giant lushly produced concept album with orchestration and music of various styles. It looked promising but sadly the production of this album was a major mistake in the Bee Gees career. First of all lead guitarist Vince Melouney left the group in December of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, unhappy with the direction The Bee Gees were taking. Though it was a friendly parting, things only went from bad to worse. Robin and Barry were constantly fighting in the studio and when Robert Stigwood chose Barry's single (over Robin's) for release that's when Robin jumped ship as well. The dwindling number of band members really effected the production of 'Odessa'. It went from a group attempt at a very promising concept album to Barry, Maurice and drummer Colin Peterson (who left in June of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) just trying to finish something that was suitable for release. It's amazing how well this album turned out after all the problems during production. Odessa turned out completely different then it was intended. As a concept album it's a miserable failure, but as a collection of great songs (each great on their own), Odessa is a great album. The quality of the music is what saved Odessa from completely bombing and today it is considered the best of their sixty's albums. Some wonderful music there. It really showed the Bee Gees musical talents were maturing. The hauntingly beautiful title track ODESSA (CITY ON THE BLACK SEA) opened the album with a tragic feel. YOU'LL NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN was another lovely ballad by Barry which fit well into the concept album form. BLACK DIAMOND is one of Robin's finest vocal performances. I love this harmonies near the send of the song. MARELY PURT DRIVE is one of my favourites. The Bee Gees attempt at country rock and quite successful I might add. This should have been a single. It's obvious that EDISON was a concept album song but it's mysterious why the Gibbs recorded a song about the inventor. Nonetheless Barry and Robin's vocals on this one are wonderful on this somewhat jazzy tune. MELODY FAIR is another excellent song that should have been released as a single in America. Maurice's SUDDENLY is a nice upbeat tune that really stands out on this somewhat dark album. WHISPER WHISPER is nothing special until the drum break and bass speed up and by that time the song's almost over. Two more favourites of mine, SOUND OF LOVE and I LAUGH IN YOUR FACE are some of the albums best and strongest songs. Whereas GIVE YOUR BEST is a ridiculous country back novelty tune that is quite flat. NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a powerful pop rock tune. FIRST OF MAY and LAMPLIGHT were the contenders for that album's first and only single and the cause for Barry and Robin's fight. Both songs are strong and wonderful but personally I think Barry's FIRST OF MAY is more appropriate for a single. As for the three orchestra pieces SEVENS SEAS SYMPHONY, WITH ALL NATIONS (INTERNATIONAL ANTHEM) and THE BRITISH OPERA. Well these are beautifully arranged pieces of music but would have fit better on an actual concept album rather than this collection of more for less singles. Still these are worth a listen. Overall Odessa is a wonderful album. Personally I don't think it's their best album from the sixty's (The Bee Gees honest has that honour in my opinion). However it still has some of the best music never produced from that era of the Gibb's career. It's truly a shame this album was never completed as the intended concept album yet we still have these songs which are wonderful on their own. And afterall The Bee Gees were far from over. This album was merely a learning experience for them. They would reunite again and produce a handful of wonderful records in the years to come.

Especially their performance and composition of songs, which improved. The Gibb brothers were looking to get more land in the thousand, nine hundred and sixty -nine and deed their next album would be the biggest yet. A very large and beautifully constructed door with orchestra and music in a variety of styles. It seems promising but sadly the release of this album was a big mistake in the Bee Gees profession. First guitarist Vince Melouney left the band in December, nine hundred and sixty -eight, unhappy with the direction that was heading towards Bee Bee. Although it was a gentle separation, things got worse. Robin and Barry continue to fight in the studio and when Robert Stigwood chooses Barry's solo (more than Robin) to release it is when Robin also jumps on the ship. The reduction in the number of team members is really affecting Odessa\u2019s performance. It came out of a group attempt for an album of very promising ideas that Barry, Maurice and drummer Colin Peterson (left in June, nine hundred and sixty-nine) were just trying to finish a thing that fits the release. It\u2019s amazing how well this album came out after all the problems during production. Odessa has become completely different than before. As an idea album it was a sad disappointment, but as a collection of great songs (each one was great), Odessa was a great album. The quality of the music is what saved Odessa completely from the explosion and now it is considered the best of their sixty albums. There is amazing music. It really showcased the Bee Gees \u2019musical talents as an adult. The beautiful title song ODESSA (CITY OF THE RED SEA) opened the door with a surprising feeling. YOU WILL NEVER SEE that this is another beautiful song written by Barry that perfectly fits the album form. BLACK DIAMOND is one of Robin\u2019s best sound shows. I like this adaptation close to sending the song. MARELY PURT DRIVE is one of my favourites. The Bee Gees \u2019attempt to rock the ground and I was successful. It will be one. Obviously EDISON is an idea album but it\u2019s a secret why Gibbs recorded a song about creation. Yet Barry and Robin\u2019s voices on this one are superb in this bit of jazz tune. MELODY FAIR is another great song that should have been released only in America. THE CULTURE OF MAURICE is a very good tune that really appears on this album quite dark. WHISPER WHISPER is nothing special until the drum breaks and the bus moves fast and at that time the song is close. Two other favourites, LOVE VOICE AT I LAUGH are some of the best and most powerful songs. GOOD GOOD is a funny country with a new, very smooth song. NEVER SAY IT STILL is a pop rock song. FIRST THERE and LAMPLIGHT were the only participants for that album and the reason for Barry and Robin\u2019s fight. Both songs are cloud and surprising but personally I think Barry\u2019s FIRST MAY fits into just one. In terms of the three -part orchestra SEVENS SEAS SYMPHONY, THE WHOLE NATION (INTERNATIONAL SONG) and OPERA BRITISH. So it\u2019s the pieces of music that are well arranged but would be better for the album to be a real idea rather than a collection of more singles. They are still worth listening to. Overall Odessa is a fantastic album. Personally I don\u2019t think this is their best album of the sixties (The Bee Gees \u2019honesty is an honor in my view). Yet it still has some of the best music never made during Gibb\u2019s career. It's really a shame that this album was never completed as the intended album yet we have songs which are amazing in themselves. After all Bee Bee is over. This gateway is for the learning experience only. They will come together and produce a limited number of impressive records in the coming years.

Mainly because of this playing and songwriting skills, the was making great strides. The Gibbons wanted to win one, nine hundred and sixty-eight places and decided that their next album would be the biggest never. A fantastic well-crafted album with orchestration and different styles of music. It looked promising, but sadly, the production of this album was a big mistake in BG's work. Guitarist Vince Maloney first left the band in December one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, unhappy with the way the BJs were going. Although it was a friendly division, things went from bad to worse. Robin and Barry were fighting in the studio and when Robert Stagwood chose to release Berry's song (Above Robin) when Robin jumped off the plane. The declining number of band members has really contributed to the preparation of 'Odessa'. It ended with the band trying to release a very promising album for Barry, Morris and drummer Colin Petersen (released in June one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine). It's amazing how this album came out after all the problems during production. Odessa is very different from where it was intended. As a fantasy album of sad failures, but as a collection of beautiful songs (each in its own way), Odessa is a beautiful album. The quality of the music is what saved Odessa from being completely bombed and is considered one of their top sixty albums today. There's some great music. It really showed the bees' musical abilities. The song titled ODSSA (City on BLACK SEA) opened the album with a sad feeling. You'll Never See My Face was another of Berry's favourite songs that fits the album well. Black Diamond is one of Robin's best songs. I like these games near the song post. My port drive is one of my favourites. I can add to the Bee Gees initiative and a lot of success in Country Rock. It had to be one thing. It is clear that EDISON was the song of the concept album, but it is strange why Gibbs recorded the song by a musician. Yet on this occasion, the words of Barry and Robin are prominent in this special jazzy song. Melody Fair is another great song that should have been released in the United States. Morse's Sudden is a beautiful entertaining song featured on this dark album. The Hisper Whisper is nothing special unless the drums and bass break and then the song ends. My other two favourites, The Sound of Leo and I Laugh in Your Face are some of the best and most powerful albums. While GIVING YOUR BEST is a funny world that has come back with a new less important song. Never AGAIN is a powerful pop rock music. FIRST MAY and LAMPLIGHT were the contenders for this first and only album and were the cause of Barry and Robin's feud. Both songs are strong and amazing but personally I think Berry's first May is perfect for one. As for the three pieces of the orchestra, they are the Seven Seals, and All Nations (Anthem International) and British Opera. These are well-organized pieces of music but may fit better in a real concept album than this small single music collection. However, this should be listened to. Odessa is an amazing album overall. Personally, I don't think it's this best album since the sixty's (DBJ Honest has the honor in my opinion). However, it contains some of the best music never produced since Gibb's career. It's really a shame that this album has never been completed as the desired fantasy album yet we have these amazing songs alone. And after all, the fly was far from over.

Warren G is the immediate difference between him and the others is that the is half the brother of leading producer Dr. Dre, and the is the hell of producer Maxwell. This album is excellent at this work, unfortunately only a good record has been produced. It has a great G-Funk soundtrack and some very sweet lyrics, unlike the usual Gangsta Rap albums at the time. Many of the great songs in the song \"Manage\" featuring Nate Dogg are also worth seeing, including songs by Michel McDonald, \"The Dj\" and the first person \"You See\". However, its running time is very short (most songs are about three minutes long), and two of the twelve songs are graphic and should not be counted. Like this brother, not one of the best Mcs, but the is a great producer! So, you will find a lot of visiting artists. Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, and Ja Skills women's pack are in \"Super Soul Sister\", and nothing else is known. \"Know\", \"What's Next\", especially the most amazing \"And Ya Don't Stop\", are all worth noting to using. \"Manage. The G Funk Era\" is a beautiful album, well-suited for production at the time with amazing songs and the biggest ship shop album of one, nine hundred and ninety-four. \"Control\" and \"This Dj\" are both top ten, and the sound of the entire album is higher than never.

If you find some of G. G.'s other albums like \"Acquiring The Taste\" and \"In a Glass House\" a bit too complex and slightly annoying and headache-inducing, then you will probably like this album. Even though it's not my favourite album of theirs, I WOULD recommend it to someone as an introduction to Gentle Giant, along with \"Freehand\". The line-up on this album was Derek Shulman on vocals and sax, Phil Shulman on vocals and trumpet, Ray Shulman on bass, violin, guitar and vocals, Gary Green on guitar, Kerry Minnear on keyboards, vibes, recorders, etc. and Malcolm Mortimore on drums. Of the three vocalists, Derek, with this almost operatic bass\/baritone, was their strongest vocalist and could project more than the other two. Kerry had a beautiful church boy tenor, though this voice was't as strong in concert. His singing is featured on \"Schooldays\". Phil, who would leave after their next album, had a very quiet and almost inaudible voice. His voice was SO quiet, one needed a microscope for a stethoscope to hear it! You can barely hear him on \"Schooldays\" and the first half of \"Peel The Paint\". Of the songs, the first track has a very complicated, but catchy and slightly dangerous riff to it, that I think is repeated a bit too much. \"Schooldays\" is the most la back and quiet song on the album and has some very typical Gentle Giant vocal grounds. It has a bit of a jazzy feel to it. I could never get into this song for some mysterioso reason! \"Working All Day\" is a bit louder and heavier and has Derek singing along with the sax and\/or tuba line. Kind of funny, actually! I prefer the second half of the album, which starts off with \"Peel The Paint\", which is my favourite song on the album. As stated earlier, the first half of the song is rather quiet and has a barely audible vocal from Phil and some xylophone and\/or vibraphone playing. The second half of the song is very heavy, with a very meaty vocal from Derek and one of the longest and heaviest guitar solos by Gary Green never. This is accompanied by some rather frantic drumming. Gentle Giant were many things in their ten year career, but they rarely never were heavy metal and they really rock out during this song! The last two songs are very pleasant progressive rock itunes and are easy to listen to. \"Mister Class and Quality\" has Derek's strongest singing up to that point, along with a quirky little guitar\/violin and morgan riff. The last song has mellotron and morgan and a very heavy guitar riff. Gentle Giant have released much more exciting and adventurous albums than \"Three Friends\", but this is still a very enjoyable and very musical progressive rock album!

Of the three singers, Derek, who has a bass \/ baritone that almost resembles an opera, is the strongest musician and can make more vocals than the other two. Kerry has a beautiful tenor child in the church, though the voice is not so strong in the concert. His singing appeared in \"Schooldays\". Phil will leave behind the next album, this voice very quiet, almost inaudible. His voice is silent, the wants a microscope to hear with the athoscoscope! You can't hear the first half of \"Schooldays\" and \"Peel The Paint\". Among these songs, the first song is very complex, but the repetition is a bit strange and a little dangerous, I think the repetition is too much. \"Schooldays\" is the quietest and most quiet song on the album, with a world of familiar sound. It feels a little jazzy. For some strange reason, I will never be table to get into this song! \"Working All Day\" is cloud and difficult, and Derek sings in the saxophone and \/ for tuba.

The second half of the song is very difficult, Derek's words are very full, and Gary Green's loneliness is one of the longest and hardest solos. This was accompanied by distorted drama sounds. The Gentle Giant has a lot going for them in their decade-long career, but with a few heavy metals, they rock this song! The last two songs are very popular with savant-garde rock music and are easy to listen to. \"Class Manager and Quality\" has Derek's strongest song so far, with a little guitar \/ violin and Morgan's upgrades.

Gentle Giant has released a more exciting and interesting album than \"Three Friends\", but this is still a very interesting album with savant-garde rock music! Advise!

In terms of O'Jay history this album is linked strongly with their first masterpiece albumBack Stabbersand they do seem like logical extensions; both came during the O'Jays creative and commercial speak and their cultural influence was beyond intense. On EVERY one of the songs Eddie LeVert's operatic gospel shouting will still turn the years of everyone they touch-especially on the title track. That is a musical and cultural \"period\" song about the events of an ancient slave ship, sung by LeVert and the O'Jays harmonies with a dry eye-I just know I could't have done that-singing what they cd on that song would've made me either angry for sad. But in the O'Jays hands their vocals communicate, subjectively. Another aspect of 'Ship Ahoy' as opposed to the previous album is the Philly slickness of even the funkiest songs-on \"Put Your Hands Together\",\"People Keep Tellin' Me\" and even the environmental please \"This Air I Breath\" the peppiness of the music with it's happy Philly orchestration make one not even notice Eddie's line about \"the air not staying in this mouth\". And what can be said about \"For The Love Of Money\"? Nothing that has't been said;O'Jays at their funkiest, hands down. During this time The O'Jays were more then just a great singing trio-they were a musical movement. Like The Isley Brothers,The Blue Notes and The Spinners were musical movements. And the fact that all three of these movements co existed in their classic period all around the same is more then enough to make albums like 'Ship Ahoy' seem overwhelming. But it really in't.

The album has a definite dance vibe, but although disco was at its height of popularity, the album does't fall in the disco category. The songs have fat grooves that make you want to dance, but the score of the songs belong to Mr. Jackson and not the production as is the case with most disco songs. \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" is the album's first track and single. It is a brilliant track with soaring strings and popping rhythms that has a spoken word intro that moves into a high falsetto. Mr. Jackson sings the song in the falsetto, but the interjects spoken word into verses that prove an echo to the lead. The song was a justifiable number one hit. \"Rock With You\" was the second single and is much slower in its beat, but you can still groove to it. It also stopped the charts. \"Working Day & Night\" is a musical workout that sounds like a forerunner of \"Wanna Be Startin' Something\" from Thriller. \"Get On The Floor\" is a fiery call to arms that in which the does't ask that you get up and dance, but demands it. The title track has a funky vibe to it and \"Girlfriend\" is a Paul McCartney song that is pumped up a bit from its slight original, but is still the weakest track on the album. \"She's Out Of My Life\" is a straight ballad that is sung with heartbreaking sincerity. In fact Mr. Jackson literally broke down while singing it and you can hear the sobbing on the song. \"Burn The Disco Out\" closes the album in apocalyptic fashion and is a perfect capper to the album. Off The Wall was a major success that spawned four top ten hits, sold over ten million copies but surprising never hit number one on the album charts, stopping out at number three. Although Thriller became a cultural phenomenon and the biggest selling album in music history for a time, many people consider Off The Wall this true masterpiece.","overall":5,"summary":"Off Is On","unixReviewTime":988243200,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2001"}

The title track has a funky vibe to it and \"Girlfriend\" is a Paul McCartney song that is pumped up a bit from its slight original, but is still the weakest track on the album. \"Get On The Floor\" is a fiery call to arms that in which the does't ask that you get up and dance, but demands it. \"Working Day & Night\" is a musical workout that sounds like a forerunner of \"Wanna Be Startin' Something\" from Thriller.","overall":5,"summary":"Off Is On","unixReviewTime":988243200,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2001"}

S and forty-seven million international, not because it spawned seven Top ten hits, not for any of those reasons. When did music become about record sales and money figures?? This album is a classic not because it sold so many copies and had so many hit singles. If the songs were not hit singles, they still would be classics. It's about the music on this CD, first and foremost, nothing else. Thriller was revolutionary in its time. The sounds and styles incorporated on this album were new at the time, a time of dying disco and underground punk. Thriller succeed in it's ability to transcend racial barriers. The sounds are neither black, nor white. Which, I believe, is Michael Jackson's fundamental achievement in this long career. The ability to transcend racial boundaries. What other artist has done so with such great success?? Whitney Houston?? Prince?? None of them can say that their music had received such high praise from both communities. But it just does't even boil down to that fact. Thriller was not only huge with whites and african americans, it was popular all around the world. One of the first true international success' never. Do I even bother talking about the songs on this disc?? I mean, I think they stand pretty much embedded into anyone's mind over the page of, let's say, eighteen. 'Wana Be Startin' Somethin', 'Thriller', 'Billie Jean', 'Beat It', 'Human Nature'. All classics. However Thriller is not just about the classics. There are a few items on this CD which were never released, and could have been. 'Baby Be Mine' is a fine Michael Jackson mid-tempo ballad. Not exactly written by him, (Rod Temperton can take that claim) but the music there and Michael's voice were pure early eighties R&B.'The Lady In My Life' is probably Michael's greatest love song. His voice on this one is pure vocal beauty. A great song for a great artist born in a great time in music. So if you don't all ready have Thriller, buy it because of the music, not because of the fanfare that goes with it. Five out of FiveP. S - To the individual who wrote their review on this CD on December thirtyth, two thousand stating that Michael no longer holds the record because of Santana's 'Supernatural'. What record persay might that be and comparing these two albums is completely frivolous because Thriller is a great album where as Supernatural is simply a compilation disc. Santana with so and so and Santana with so and so. is the not good enough to be by himself?? That album sucks and should never have TIED Michaels record for Grammy awards won in one night(eight).

When did you start making music about record sales and statistics? This album is not old because it sold a lot of copies and it has a lot of hot songs. If the songs were not played individually, they would become obsolete. It's about music on this CD, for the first time, nothing more. Thriller made changes in this time. The voices and styles included in this album were new at the time, the disco of death and the underground punk. Thriller succeeds in its ability to overcome racial barriers. Voices are not black, and they are not white. That is, I believe, the key to Michael Jackson's long career. The power to across racial boundaries. What other artist has made you so successful? Whitney Houston ?? Prince ?? None of them can claim that their music is so popular in both communities. But that's not all. Thriller was not only great for whites and African Americans, but it was popular all over the world. One of the first real international achievements. Am I bothering to talk about singing on this disc? I mean, I think they're focusing too much on someone's mind on the page, let's say, eighteen. 'Wanna Be Starten', 'Somathein', 'Thriller', 'Cat Jane', 'Beat Beat', 'Human Personality'. It was all old. Thriller, however, is not just about classics. There are some things in this CD that have never been released, and they could have been released. 'BB My' Michael Jackson in the middle of a beautiful tempo belt. It was't well written, (Rod Tamperton can take this claim) but the music and Michael's voice was R&B. 'The Lady in My Life' is probably Michael's greatest love song. In this case, the beauty of this voice is pure. A great song by a great artist who was born in a good time of music. So if you're not all ready for a thriller, buy it for music, not for the fun that accompanies it. Five out of five S - For the man who wrote this review of the CD on December thirty, two, zero say Michael no longer has a record because of Santana's song \"Supernatural.\" How can this be recorded and it is pointless to compare these two albums as Thriller is a good album where the supernatural is just a compilation disc.

There was a big change in youth culture during the latter half of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two. As one decade transitions to another it often takes a couple years for the original flavors of the decade to really sink in. It happened fairly quickly in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. It was even starting in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's really. Yes that's a contradiction. And yes that's the point. Pop culture seemed to be often at odds with itself. And few wanted to admit it. Well Fishbone had nothing to close really. They have the capacity to be cultural commentators. But they had a sound. It was a unique sound. And they revealed in seeing how far they could take it. During their first decade their was still the pressure for that \"hit\" song. By this point, the popular ste had turned abruptly against commercial. That turned out itself to be somewhat artificial. But it was good news to Fishbone. Now withdrawn from the ambition for commercial success they could now just be one hundred% themselves. Now truth be said this album is full of exciting melodies and rhythms. Often highly memorable stuff. But nothing there is approached commercially. It's rather like a nuclear chain reaction of sound between P-Funk,James Brown and Sly Stone with the Mothers Of Invention,Talking Heads and Red Hot Chili Peppers. The concept is the contemplation of \"fantasy tvs. reality\", very much a P-Funk concept to be true. On the other hand the music is extremely manic and often almost improvised in parts. \"Fight The Youhg\",\"So Many Millions\",\"Housework\" and the sexually aggressive but not too profane \"Naz-Tee May'en\" are all extremely bouncy, melodic horn funk at different speeds. There in't too much of the ska\/reggae influence there as before. But the rock did't go an anywhere. It shows up in a very dramatic manner on \"Junkie's Prayer\" and \"Pray To The Junkimaker\". These songs don't even try to glamorize drug addiction and the life it leads to. It just puts it out there for what it is. \"Everyday Sunshine\" throws in the poppy soul\/funk melodic optimism into the equation for the most pop friendly number there. Along with the slower rocker \"Those Days Are Gone\" and faster closer of \"Sunless Saturday\" there are a series of sketches involved with wishful thinking, wherein the narrator ponders \"if I were\" this for that, often with witty results. And they never shy from using that humour to make their points. This album is really dead on the times. It actually finds a group of very individuals and musicians who were seeing the \"alternative\" era, in all it's forms, for what it all too often ended up being: just something new for some people to package and make into a product for mass consumption. Well the true alternatives needed were the lives of people in need of better education and less violent lives. This album explores that with an elaborate pallette of sound, often veering all over the funk and rock spectrum at a moments notice and (as usual) maintaining a certain level of focus within all this musical hyperactivity. This is one of the most challenging and compelling albums I've heard from this era. And it's actually an era I remember quite well. If someone asked me to recommend a record that epitomized what the early ninety's were really all about,I'd recommend this.","overall":5,"summary":"The Right Time And Place For The Truth","unixReviewTime":1327708800,"reviewTime":"01 28, 2012"}

In the second half of the nine hundred and ninety-two years, a great change took place in the culture of the youth. When a decade shifts, it often takes several years for the first taste of the decade to come true. It happened suddenly in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. And it started in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. Yes, this is contradictory. Yes, this is a point. Popular culture seems to contradict itself. Few people are willing to admit this. Yes, fish bones have nothing to cover. They can be cultural publishers. But they have a voice. That's a different word. They revealed this when they saw where they could go. For the first decade, they still felt compelled by this \"popular\" song. Meanwhile, the fashion scene suddenly turned to business. It turns out that this is true of yourself. But this is good news for fish bones. They have now given up their ambitions for commercial success and now they can be one hundred% of them. Now to be honest, this album is full of beautiful songs and rhythms. Usually something is memorable. But there is no commercial communication. This is similar to the nuclear chain reaction to the sounds between P-Funk, James Brown and Sly Stone and the mother of design, Speech Heads and Red Pepper. This view manifests itself in \"good TV. True\", which is the reality of P-Funk. On the other hand, the music is very personal, almost refined. \"Fight Youhg\", \"Too Many Million\", \"Homework\" and sexual assault but not obscene \"Naz-Tee May'en\" are all loosening at different speeds, with the beautiful music of the horn music. No ska \/ reggae impact as much as before. But the rock cd not go anywhere. It comes from the \u201cprayers of drug addicts\u201d and the \u201cprayers of drug addicts\u201d in a very significant way. These songs do not even try to embellish the drugs and the life they cause. Just put it there. \"Every Day of the Sun\" puts the prospect of poppy \/ funk music in a popular digital song. As the slow space of \u201cthose days is gone\u201d and \u201cthe incessant Saturday\u201d is fast approaching, there are also a series of thought-provoking scenes in which the narrator thinks \u201cif I am\u201d., Usually producing humorous results. They were not ashamed to use this humour to express their opinions. This record cannot be updated. It has actually found a group of musicians and musicians who have seen all sorts of \u201cselective\u201d times, because that has ended up being: it\u2019s just something new, something that people can pack into a product that most people use. what is needed is the lives of those who want a better education and a less violent life.

Pop culture seems to contradict itself. And some people wanted to admit it. Well, Fishbone really and't have anything to close. They have the power to be cultural observers. But they were angry. There was a strange sound. And see how far they can go. During this first decade, the was under pressure to using this \"hit\". By this time, the popular tide had suddenly turned to sales. It turned out to be artificial. But that was good news for Fishbone. He has given up the desire to succeed in business and is now almost one hundred% himself. Now the truth is that this album is full of fun songs and blocks. Most memorable things. But there is nothing for trade. It's like a reaction to a nuclear audio series between P-Funk, James Brown and Slystone and Inventory Mother, Speechheads and Red Hot Chili Peppers. This idea is the assumption of \"good TV-truth\", P-Funk's idea of \u200b\u200btruth is very rare. Music, on the other hand, is extremely crazy and is often almost entirely partial. \"Fight the Young\", \"So Many Millions\", \"Homework\" and the intense but not the most insulting \"Naz-T-Maine\" are all bouncing, melodic horn funks at different speeds. There is not as much effect of it \/ greg as there used to be. But the rock did not go anywhere. It looks the most amazing in \"Junkie's Prayer\" and \"Pre-to-Junkie Maker\". These songs do not even try to glorify the addiction and the life leading to it. It just puts you there for what it is. \"Everyday Sunshine\" puts the Poppy Soul \/ Funk Melodic hope on the scale of the most friendly number. With a slow swing, \"Those Days Have Gone\" and \"Sunless Saturday\" are a series of drawing involving aspiring thinking with an immediate view, in which the narrator considers \"if I were\" and often has fine results. There are. And they are never ashamed to use these jokes to make their point. This album is dead from time to time. It actually explores a group of people and artists who saw a \"different\" era, in all its forms, what it used to be: just something new that some people have packaged into a product that is great. Will be used in numbers. Of course some real alternatives were needed who were living the lives of people in need of better education and with less violence. The album discovers that with cool sound, it usually blows up all the funk and rock spectrum during notifications and (as always) maintains a certain level of focus on all this musical inactivity. It's one of the hardest and most stressful albums I've heard since this season. And this is actually a time when I remember well. If anyone tasks me to suggest a record that proves what I did ninety years ago, I would recommend it.","overall":5,"summary":"The Right Time And Place For The Truth","unixReviewTime":1327708800,"reviewTime":"01 28, 2012"}

Over her twenty year career Suzanne Vega has produced a great deal of music that's as good as for better than any of her more famous singer\/songwriter peers, with the difference that she's prepared to push things out to the edge lyrically without closing sight of the fact that what makes a song work is a great tune, an exciting, carefully executed arrangement and. And, when she gets it right, as she does there, the results are quite stunning. And when she steps back into the more folk based style that this type of rock-poetry is usually found - areas that artists like Joni Mitchell & Leonard Cohen pioneered - their unusual and above all superbly atmospheric arrangements turn them into something very different and very special. A beautiful, timeless and unforgettable album that anyone who is into \"good music\" should have in their collection. Perfect examples of how to make songs genuinely thoughtful and almost ecstatically enjoyable at the same time. sincere delivery.","overall":5,"summary":"Beautiful, timeless and totally under-rated classic...","unixReviewTime":1160179200,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2006"}

Unfortunately, this masterwork is usually their first album. Though \"Under the Pink\" (and all subsequent works by Tori Amos) stands as a fine record on its own, it does't quite reach the emotional speaks and valleys of its predecessor, \"Little Earthquakes\". The songs are fleshed out with larger accompaniment than the previous work and deal less with raw emotion and more with the external joys and perils of womanhood. On the plus use, Amos is in great songwriting form, her piano growls and whimpers on command and her voice is both strong and assertive without dominating the proceedings. However, the track listing is at times erratic. On \"Little Earthquakes\", the songs seemed to segue into each other like complimentary dance partners. \"Under the Pink\" is a roller-coaster ride of quick starts and slow crawls, the latter exemplified by the weakest songs, \"Bells For Her\", \"Baker Baker\" and \"Yes, Anastasia\". This said, there are still several tracks there that compensate for all of this stumbling about; \"Pretty Good Year\" remains my favourite Tori Amos song of all time, with a swelling crescendo of strings that drives the emotional impact of her voice home with ferocious urgency. \"Past the Mission\" reads like a Raymond Carver vignette, while \"The Waitress\" and \"Icycle\" display a lyrical savagery only hinted at on her earlier work. This CD spawned two modest hits, \"God\" and \"Cornflake Girl\", and represents her last attempt at straightforward songwriting before diving headfirst into the swampy obscurities of her later work. Personal Favorites: \"Pretty Good Year\", a powerful and haunting masterpiece, and \"The Waitress\", a disturbing look at jealousy in the workplace.

Accepts Unfortunately, this work of part is often their first album. Although \"Under the Pink\" (and all the work after Tori Amos) stands alone as a good record, it does not reach the emotional discourse and the valleys before it, the \"Little Earthquake\". The songs are more meaty than the previous work and deal less with raw feelings and more with the dangers of external pleasures and femininity. On the positive side, Amos is in a good position to write songs, this piano sounds and scream in the bow and this voice is strong and powerful without dominating the process. However, track listings are sometimes incorrect. In \"Little Earthquake\", the songs appear to come together as partners in a dance of praise. \"Under the Pink\" is a fast-paced, slow-moving crawl featuring weak songs, \"Bells for Her\", \"Baker Baker\" and \"Yes, Anastasia\". That said, there are still many tracks where they pay for all these stumbling blocks. \"Pretty Good Air\" is my favourite Tory Amos song so far, with swollen strings that express the emotional sensation of her voice in the house with great urgency. \"Mission of the Past\" reads like a portrait of Raymond Carver, while \"The Waitress\" and \"Aeschylus\" show only the noisy rebellion shown in this first work. The CD included two hit songs, \"God\" and \"Corn Flake Girl\", and represents this last attempt to write straight songs before sinking into the mystery of this latest work.

Your favourites: \"Happy New Year\", a powerful and terrifying artwork, and \"The Waitress\", a disturbing form of jealousy at work. \"Mission of the Past\" reads like Raymond Carver's Vignette, while \"The Waitress\" and \"Bicycle\" only show the insults mentioned in this previous work. The CD has produced two great songs, \"God\" and \"Corn Flake Girl\", and represents this last attempt to write straight songs before going into the swampy secrets of this latest work. Although \"Under the Punk\" (and all the work after Tory Amos) stands out as a good record, it does not reach the emotional discourse and the valleys before it, \"Little Earthquake\". That said, there are still a lot of tracks where they pay to heat all those stumbling blocks. \"Pretty Good Air\" is my all-time favourite Tory Amos song, with twisted strings that revoke the emotional sensation of her voice in a powerful rush at home. The songs in \"Little Earth Quick\" looked different like the best dance partners.","overall":4,"summary":"Tori Amos Averts the Sophomore Slump","unixReviewTime":949104000,"reviewTime":"01 29, 2000"}

They just never stopped no matter how much for how little funk is popular at any given time. After two creatively important albums in their debutEast Bay Greaseand the even more forward thinkingBump Citythe band released this third and self titled album in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. Their previous recording had found the band moving into a more well rounded and soulful sound than just one high octane horn fuelled funk jam after another. And in terms of songwriting, arrangement and vocal harmonies alone this album found them officially at their musical speak. For one thing there's \"What Is Hip?\". With it's stuttering bass line and sharp horn breaks, it is one of the all time funk anthems of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. In terms of funk itself this album represents itself well on that front with one of my favourite jams there \"Get Yo Feet Back on The Ground\" and \"Soul Vaccination\", basically a follow up to \"What Is Hip?\". Actually there are no formal ballads on there either. Just slower paced grooves, interesting since funk has a slower tempo anyway on \"Clever Girl\",\"So Very Gard To Go\" and \"Just Another Day\". \"This Time It's Real\" for it's part is basically a gospel inspired uptempo soul shuffle, not much to do with funk but gives some variety to their sound. \"Will I Ever Find Love?\" and \"Both Sorry Over Nothing\" have a heavier southern soul flavor to them to add to this soulful set. This is one of those recordings that actually sets up the musical pallet for the seventy's funk album. It has the funk itself in fine form, slower grooves that are just somewhat more down tempo and vocal oriented variations on the faster songs and music that reflects that all important khyber of funky soul. And from the very beginning, it's lyrics even seek to ask the same questions the music does. Somehow for other funk is so deep inside the veins of everyone in this band that it got into their identity completely. Even during the disco era and on into the eighty's they either lent out the famous TOP horn section to session work to pay the bills for flat out kept up with their classic sound. So that had funk reliability AND dependability. And that's continued to be their main musical legacy.","overall":5,"summary":"Really Starting To Get Their Feet On The Ground","unixReviewTime":1343606400,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2012"}

No matter how many funk styles there are at any given time, they never stop. After their debut album East Bay Grease and Bump City looking forward to releasing two important and creative albums, the band released their third album with the same name at one thousand and nine hundred and seventy-three. Their previous recordings found that the band moved to a around, more romantic sound, rather than one after another high octane horns featuring funk jam. Only with regard to the creation of songs, the refinement and harmony of the voice, this album officially found them in their musical discourse. On the other hand \"What is a ship?\". With its medium bass line and sharp horn sound, it is one of the most popular funk songs of all time in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. As for Funk himself, this album has worked very well in this regard, including one of my favourite jams of \"Put Your Feet Back on Earth\" and \"Soul Vaccine\", basically \"What a Hip\" Following. In fact, there is no official ballroom there. It's just a slow rhythm. What's interesting is that in any case, Funk has a slow rhythm in \"Smart Girl\", \"So Very Gard To Go\" and \"Just Another Day\". \"This True Time\" is a gospel-inspired quick movement of the soul. It has nothing to do with funk, but it does bring a change in their voice. \"Will I find true love?\" and \"I'm sorry about that\" have a taste for the soul below them, and can be added to this love collection. This is one of those recordings that sets the music tray of the seventys funk album. It has a beautiful kind of funk in itself, a slow rhythm, a slow rhythm to fast songs and music, and a change in voice that reflects all the important blends of the fashion soul. From the beginning, its lyrics even tried to raise the same questions as music. Somehow, some funk is so deep in everyone's veins in this band that it's fully integrated into their entity. During the disco era and the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, they probably borrowed the famous TOP portion of the TOP in conference work to pay for their common voice. So this has a very bad reputation and dishonesty. This is still their main musical legacy.","overall":5,"summary":"Really Starting To Get Their Feet On The Ground","unixReviewTime":1343606400,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2012"}

As for Funk himself, this album has done very well in this regard, including one of my favourite jokes \"Get Yo Feet Back on the Ground\" and \"Soul Vaccination\", basically \"What's a Hip\" Track. With its medium bass line and sharp horn sound, it is one of the most popular funk songs of all time in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. \"This True Time\" is basically a gospel-inspired quick movement. It has nothing to do with funk, but it does bring a change in their voice. It has a beautiful kind of funk in itself, a slow rhythm, a slow slow rhythm in fast-paced songs and music, and a change in voice that reflects all the important blends of the fashion soul. After their debut album East Bay Grease and Bump City looking forward to releasing two important and creative albums, the band released their third album with the same name at one thousand and nine hundred and seventy-three. Their previous recordings found that the band moved to a around, lovely sound, rather than one after the other high octane horns featuring funk jam.","overall":5,"summary":"Really Starting To Get Their Feet On The Ground","unixReviewTime":1343606400,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2012"}

It and\u2019t stop no matter how much funk it was at any time. After two creative albums crucial for their first meeting with East Bay Grease and the thought-provoking Bump City, the team released their third self-titled album thousand, nine hundred seventy-three. Their previous recording got the band to move to a more rounded and soulful sound than a high octane horn that ignited the funk jam afterwards. At in terms of songwriting, editing and sound adaptation only this album has officially received their musical expression. One thing is \u201cWhat\u2019s Hip?\u201d. With a thin bass line and sharp corners, it is one of the part songs of the thousand, nine hundred and seventy. In terms of the funk itself, this album looks great up front with one of my favourite desserts out there \"Get Yo Feet Back on The Ground\" and \"Soul Vaccine\", usually followed by \"What is Hip?\" . Certainly there are no official pools there. It\u2019s just slow, fun while the funk is slow but \u201cSmart Girl\u201d, \u201cSo Very Gard To Go\u201d and \u201cAnother Day Another\u201d. The \u201cThis Time Is Real\u201d part of it is basically the gospel that inspired the uptempo soul transformation, it does\u2019t have much funk but it does give a pretty weird sound. \"Can I still find love?\" and \u201cWe both apologize for nothing\u201d has a more soulful flavor than soul to add to this spacious set. It\u2019s one of those recordings that really sets the music palette for the funk album of the seventies. It has its own funk in a well -made, slow space that tends to drop a bit in the interim and the fast -paced songs and music that showcase all the essential combinations of passionate fun. In the beginning, these are the words you even ask yourself to ask the same as music does. However, the other funk is very deep in the roots of everyone in this group and has completely penetrated their identity. Even during the disco and until the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys none of them lent the famous TOP corner unit to run the session to pay the flat bills to their usual sound. So that had confidence and confidence. And that will continue their greatest musical legacy.","overall":5,"summary":"Really Starting To Get Their Feet On The Ground","unixReviewTime":1343606400,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2012"}

He never stopped, no matter how famous Funk was at any given time. After two major East Bay Grassland albums and a band that Bump Citythe believes has released its third album, the title is one hundred and ninety-three thousand. In their previous recordings, the band was found moving in a around and breath-taking sound instead of a funk jam blowing one high octane horn after another. And in terms of songwriting, arrangement and sound harmony, only this album has formally included them in their statements. The first is \"What is a ship?\" Is. With its strong bass line and sharp broken horns, it is one of the durable, nine hundred and seventy funk songs. The album is well-received in terms of funk, and one of my favourite genres is \"Get You Foot Back on the Ground\" and \"Civil Vaccination\", basically \"What's a Hip?\" Follow In fact, there are no official lumps. The drain is a bit slow, interesting because the funk is a bit stretched, however in \"Smart Girl\", \"So Very Guard to Go\" and \"Just Under Day\". Partly \"this time is true\" is basically a gospel-inspired uptempo soul transformation, not so much fun with funk but a variety of their voices. \"Will I never find love?\" And \"sorry for both\" is too heavy for both to add a taste of Southern Spirit to this spiritual set. This is one of the recordings that sets the music palette for a seventy funk album. It keeps itself in good shape, with slow channels that vary slightly in size and sound in fast songs and music that reflect this important khyber of the funky spirit. And from the beginning, the lyrics of the music even wanted to ask the same question as you do. Somehow the funk is so deep inside everyone in this vein that it has entered its full potential. Even during the discos of the eighties, the released a popular top horn category to pay for flatout bills that go with this old voice. So it was funk and honest with honesty. And that's the legacy of their important music.","overall":5,"summary":"Really Starting To Get Their Feet On The Ground","unixReviewTime":1343606400,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2012"}

Deep Purple are arguably at their speak at this point, on the back of three quite amazing albums, 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head' the Mark II Deep Purple lineup are captured there performing at their very best. The three concerts featured in this album took place on the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth August one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two at Osaka\/Tokyo in Japan and with the tracks they play, DP literally bring the house down and you can seriously feel this when you play this live album with a great atmosphere from the crowd. What therefore makes this live album extra special? Afterall there are plenty of bands who have given really good live performances. The simple fact is that the album is very very honest. There are no studio overdubs, additions of fake cheers for claps for any tampering to speak of with the recording. You are hearing exactly what was been played on the nights of the concerts - this is the real McCoy and it definitely makes the whole thing extra special. My only real complaint with the whole thing is, and its a bit pedantic and is the reason why I gave it four.five stars is the fact that the cd does not give one full length concert but instead five tracks from the atwood concert and the rest from the other two - giving it a kind of best of a live tour feel. You scarcely notice it when listening but from my point of view, I would much rather listen to a concert in its entirety rather than a piecemeal recording (A three CD version of the whole thing is actually available - now that would get five stars!). However case from this minor niggle, you can't fault Deep Purple's performance, it is quite simply amazing. Ritchie Blackmore's guitar playing is sometimes more phenomenal than what you hear on the studio album - this guitar playing live shows why, in my opinion, the is one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. By no means though does the overshadow this fellow DP bandmembers. Ian Paice's drumming is spectacular (more about that later) as is Gillan's amazing vocal range and Jon Lord puts out more than a good dose of great keyboard improvisation. There are a number of issues of this CD. The best version to get of the 'three concert overview' is the twenty-fiveth anniversary edition, the version which I obtained. Aside from being quite cheap to buy, you get a bonus CD which contains 'The Encores' of Black Night, Speed King and Lucille. They are a good addition and pad out the material available. The standard issue contains the seven tracks only and not the encores, plus you don't get the extensive information booklet which comes with all the anniversary Deep Purple remasters. What we hear from these live performances are lots of tracks from 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head'. The only exception to this is 'Lucille' which is a rock in roll song by Little Richard (I think!) - DP do a great improvised version of it, with Gillan's vocals screaming to amazing heights. The original CD kicks off with 'Highway Star' and prepare to be blasted away by the bands heavy ferocity (something which continues right through with very little respite!). Blackmore gives us this trademarks style of playing with the first track, riffing like there is no tomorrow! The 'Child In Time' rendition is a great listen, in some ways has better effects live than in the studio and is a great listen. 'Smoke On the Water', well it never disappoints - you hear the crowd clapping and really getting into the groove on this song! 'The Mule' follows this up and is perhaps, for me the most entertaining on the CD - Ian Paice's drumming on this track is a solo and a half! Ive never heard a drum solo quite like it - full of energy and speed and practically creates a song single handedly - the highlight of the album - the is definitely one of the top rock drummers there is. The last three tracks, 'Strange Kind of Woman', 'Lazy' and 'Space Truckin' all extend into full out jams. 'Space Truckin' at nineteen minutes does go on just a little bit but is still a fun listen. On 'Lazy' there is some whizz keyboard work from Jon Lord - listen to this interesting and cleverly clashing opening. Gillan is always on hand to get the crowd involved, especially at the send of 'Strange Kiond of Woman' where the screams higher and higher with the crowd! All in all, great entertainment and very much a unique and polished (in live terms anyway) performance. A must for any DP fan - it is a capture of DP's greatest line up, the legendary Mark II! Just think that in a year after this concert the Mark II line up was no more . although it was definitely not the send for Deep Purple, no no no, there was plenty of more great work to come!","overall":4,"summary":"4.5 Stars - Come Taste the Band!

Deep Purple can be asa to be their talk on this point. After three major albums \"On the Rock\", \"Fireball\" and \"Machine Head\", the Mark II Deep Purple lineup performed well there. Three concerts on the album were held on August fifteen, sixteen and seventeen in Osaka \/ Tokyo, Japan. With the repertoire they play, the DP really broke into the house, you can feel the essence of Play live record when you create an amazing atmosphere for the crowd. What makes this living album so special? After all, there are a lot of bands that offer very good performance. The simple fact is that this disc is very authentic. No dubbing in the recording studio, and no fake cheers were added to the shoulder to prevent any interruptions to the recording. You can hear exactly what\u2019s being played on concert night \u2014 this is the real McCoy, and it certainly makes every show special. My only complaint about everything is pedantic, which is why I gave it four stars. The reality of the five stars is that the CD does\u2019t offer a full concert, but five songs from the Atwood concert and a break from the other two - offer the best of a live tour. You don't really see it when you listen, but in my opinion, I prefer to listen to a full concert rather than a small recording (three CD versions of the whole thing are available - now five Stars!) Ritchie Blackmore's guitar performance is sometimes even more amazing than what you hear on a studio album \u2014 this video playing guitar shows why, in my opinion, you're one of the most popular guitar players of all time. In any case, this did not cover the DP team member. Ian Paice's drum is excellent (more on that later), however Gillan's amazing range, and Jon Lord's keyboard upgrades are excellent. There are many problems with this CD. The best version of \"Summary of Three Concerts\" is the twenty-five Year Plan, which I found. In addition to the very low price, you can get an additional CD containing \"Encores\" by Black, King of Speed \u200b\u200band Lucille. They are a great complement to filling existing items. The standard version contains only seven songs, no encores, and you won't find all the great brochures that come with a deep purple remake of the anniversary edition. What we hear in these live shows are a lot of songs from \"In Rock\", \"Fireball\" and \"Machine Head\". The send of \"Lucille\", which is a little rock song by Little Richard (I think!) - DP made a big change for the better and Gillan's singing sounded amazingly cloud. The original CD started with 'Highway Star' and was about to be beaten by the group (this kind of thing continued until there was a chance to breathe!). Blackmore gives us this kind of play for the first song, improving as if there is no tomorrow! The performance of 'Child In Time' is excellent, and in some respects has a better impact on life than a recording studio. It's a great listening experience. \u2018Smoke in the Water\u2019, you will never be disappointed - you will hear the screams of the crowd and you will actually enter the most beautiful country of this song! 'Mule' is just a moment away, perhaps the most interesting part of my CD Ian Paice's drums in this song is the semi-solo! I\u2019ve never heard a solo drum like this \u2014 full of energy and speed, almost with one hand composing a song \u2014 it\u2019s the best of the record \u2014 certainly this is one of the top rock songs. The last three songs \"Wonderful Kind of Woman\", \"Lazy\" and \"Space Truckin\" have all been extended to the audience. The nineteen-minute \"Space Truckin\" has a bit of a twist, but it's still interesting to listen to. In \"Lazy\", there are master keyboard functions from Jon Lord-listen to this interesting opening and deceptive beat. Gillan always connects the crowd to the scene, especially in the post of \"Strange Women\", the crowd cries out louder! All in all, a lot of fun and a very different and beautiful (live performance anyway) show. A must have for any DP fan \u2014 the highest level of DP, the famous Mark II arrest! Just imagine, a year after this concert, Mark II's list has ceased to exist. While this is certainly not a deep purple posting, no, no, there is a lot of work to be done!","overall":4,"summary":"4.5 Stars - Come Taste the Band!

You can hear for yourself what was being played on the night of the concert - it\u2019s the real McCoy and it really makes everything special. The only real complaint I have about it all, is that it\u2019s quite a walk and that\u2019s why I gave it four breaks from the other two - which gives the best kind of direct travel feel. You see very little when you listen but I think I would rather listen to a complete drama than record it (Three types of CDs where everything is actually available - now that would get five their star!). However, other than this little niggle, you can\u2019t blame Deep Purple\u2019s performance, it\u2019s pretty simple. Ritchie Blackmore\u2019s guitars are sometimes more surprising than you hear on the studio album-the live-played guitar shows why, I think, it\u2019s one of the greatest rock guitars of all time. They were not even covered by their colleagues in this DP. Ian Paice\u2019s drums were amazing (much then) as well as the amazing sound of Gillan and Jon Lord that made more of a great scale of computer improvement. There are some issues with this CD. The best type available in the \u2018three general overview of drama\u2019 is the twenty-five edition, the type I found.

The original CD starts with \u2018Highway Star\u2019 and prepares to blow up enthusiastic bands (something goes on right away with a bit of a break!). Blackmore gives us this style of trading tokens to play in the first way, torn like no other! The \u2018Baby On Time\u2019 presentation was great to listen to, in some ways it had a better impact in the studio and was a great listener. \u2018Water Smoke\u2019, don\u2019t fail - you can hear the applause of the people and really listen to this song! It is followed by \u2018Fear\u2019 and may be, for me, the most entertaining CD - Ian Paice\u2019s drums on this track are alone and a half! I\u2019ve never heard a drummer alone - full of energy and speed and practical creating a single song - highlight of the album - it\u2019s definitely one of those rock drums. The last three tracks, \u2018Strange Woman Type\u2019, \u2018Lazy\u2019 and \u2018Space Truckin\u2019 were all spread throughout the jam. \u2018Air transport\u2019 is nineteen minutes but still interesting to listen to.

Deep Purple is undoubtedly speaking at the moment, after three amazing albums, 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Heads' Mark II Deep Purple lineup was filmed when they performed very well. The three concerts featured on this album will be on August fifteen, fifteen, seventeen and seventeen in Osaka \/ Tokyo, Japan, in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine, and the tracks they using bring DP home and make you feel good. When you play this live album with the crowd in good spirits. So what makes this live album so special? After all, there are many teams that have proved the best live performances. The simple fact is that the album is very reliable. There are no overbuses in the studio, false greetings to applaud for any disturbance you can talk to the recording. You hear exactly what was being played on the night of the concert - it's a real MacQueen and it makes everything very special. My only real complaint about all of this is, and a little pedantic, and the reason I gave it four stars is that the CD does't offer a full-length concert, but the five tracks of the Atod concert take a break from the other two. This is the best type of live tour. You don't realize it when you listen to it but in my opinion, I would listen to the concert in its entirety instead of a piece of recording (three CDs for the whole thing are actually available - now you have five stars Can be found!). But without this little swallow, you can't blame the deep purple, it's really amazing. Richie Blackmore's playing the guitar is sometimes much better than what you hear on a studio album - this live guitar shows why, in my opinion, it's one of the greatest rock guitars never. However, it does not help DP party members. Ian Pace's drum is as amazing (more on that later) as it is with Gilan's amazing voices and John Lord does more than just a good keyboard upgrade. There are many issues with this CD. The best way to get a 'complete concert view' is to celebrate the twenty-fiveth anniversary, a version I found. Not only is it cheaper to buy, but you also get the bonus CD 'The Anchors' for Black Knight, Speed \u200b\u200bKing and Lucille. They combine well and extract the available information. A standard magazine consists of only seven tracks, not anchors, and you will not find a comprehensive brochure that comes with all the deep purple gifts. What we hear in this livestream are many tracks from 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head'. The only exception to this is 'Lucille' which is a small rock roll role of Little Richard (I think!) - DP is making a better version of himself, Gilan's voices are cloud. The original CD begins with 'Highway Star' and prepares to be blown away by the band's brutal bands (something that runs non-stop!). Gives style, funny as if there is no future! The 'Child in Time' version is a good listener, in some ways it has better live results than the studio and it is a good listener. 'Smoke on the water', it's not at all disappointing - you hear the crowd clapping and really joining in the song! 'The Mole' follows it and is, perhaps, the most entertaining on CD for me - in this song Ian Pace's drum goes alone with half! I've never heard a drum like this - full of energy and speed and creating a song with peace - the highlight of the album - is definitely one of the top rock drummers. The last three songs, 'Woman's Strange Kind', 'Slow' and 'Space Truck' made a big splash. Nineteen minutes 'space truck' is a little slow but still fun to listen to. 'Lazy' has a whip keyboard function by John Lord - listen to this exciting and clever crash unlock. Gilan is always there to add to the crowd, especially when 'Woman's Strange' is posted where the screams with the crowd get louder! All in all, great fun and unique and brilliant performance (in terms of live anyway). All you have to do for any DP fan - this is a great DP line shoot, the famous Mark II! Imagine a year after the concert, Mark II's line was gone. Although it was't a deep purple post by any means, no, no, there was still a lot of work to be done!","overall":4,"summary":"4.5 Stars - Come Taste the Band!

The last three tracks, 'Strange Kind of Woman', 'Lazy' and 'Space Truckin' all extend into full out jams. Ritchie Blackmore's guitar playing is sometimes more phenomenal than what you hear on the studio album - this guitar playing live shows why, in my opinion, the is one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. You scarcely notice it when listening but from my point of view, I would much rather listen to a concert in its entirety rather than a piecemeal recording (A three CD version of the whole thing is actually available - now that would get five stars!). What we hear from these live performances are lots of tracks from 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head'. My only real complaint with the whole thing is, and its a bit pedantic and is the reason why I gave it four.five stars is the fact that the cd does not give one full length concert but instead five tracks from the atwood concert and the rest from the other two - giving it a kind of best of a live tour feel.","overall":4,"summary":"4.5 Stars - Come Taste the Band!

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"The pm\/late seventy's had been such as a mad rush for Fleewood Mac as they endured almost incalculable success with theirRumoursalbum and than two years later saw it somewhat abruptly fall apart with the sprawling, creatively ambitious follow upTusk. After all this whirlwind it was only natural for members of the band, especially Stevie and Lindsey began to pursue solo careers as the decade began. You would think with this odd in between album sandwiching those solo projects and the bands real eighty's comebackTango in the Nightthat this album would be totally forgotten and sometimes it is. It was't until about a decade for so ago that I even became aware they recorded this album. As for what it is I can only say this. If your a Fleetwood Mac fan coming across this album thinking your getting some modernized, forgotten eighty's comeback attempt your in for a huge shock. Between their seventy's work together and solo output all the members of the band were very creatively exhausted by this point (who would'nt be with their excellent previous output) and decided to put out this very low key album as sort of a prelude to a total reinvention. Why is this low key? Well for one this album does't exactly go for broke when it comes to production, presented a very unadorned sound overall with very few frills. Not only that but while all of the songs sound very good and many are quite memorable the band karen't gaining any new ground musically there; selecting to play it safe by maintaining their strengths as opposed to improving on them. The majority of the album follows that patter closely. It's very much rooted in Fleedwood Mac's basic mid\/late seventy's sound but with no frills. Some might view this as meaning the album finds them going through the emotions yet there are some songs that look to a different quality.

After all this, the band members are a natural thing, especially Stevie and Lindsey started doing their own work at the beginning of this decade. You would think that in this strange situation between personal album projects and the real claim of a nightmare back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, this album will be forgotten, and sometimes forgotten. I did't realize they were recording this album until ten years ago. As for the real thing, I can say this. If your Fleetwood Mac fans see this album and think you\u2019re back these days, forgotten from the eightys, you\u2019ll be shocked. During the seventy years of collaboration with solo, all the band members were very tired at this stage (they would not have had their best work never done), and decided to release this very low album as a complete prelude to the revolution. Why such a low key? Of course, the album does not go completely into production, and the full sound is very simple, with almost no additional decorations. Not only that, although all the songs sound good, and most of them are memorable, the band Karen made no progress in music; you choose to act responsibly by maintaining your energy level instead of improving your performance. Most of the album content follows this pattern closely. It is based largely on the score of the Fleedwood Mac \/ after the seventies, but without the frills. Some people may think that this means that the album discovers that they have experienced emotions, but some songs look different in quality. Lindsey's \"Love Book\", \"Empire State\" and \"Oh Diane\" have a soft and lovely stone style, but there are also soft extensions for this unique work, only the whole team emphasizes, and Christine McVie's smoke ball \"More Than Just You.\" A reference to production around the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. This could be called the \"Gypsy\" of Knicks, which is probably the most powerful on this album. Fleetwood Mac won't release another album in six years.

And what an album it is. After one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four's questionable processor DIVER DOWN, not only cd Eddie Van Halen prove this band could write great pop-metal, the showed beyond any doubt Van Halen had some of the best rock the one thousand, nine hundred and heights had to offer. In many ways, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of the most important for the band from a psychological perspective. Van Halen's first three albums were very successful. Eddie went into a dark era of this life, which lead to the creation of FAIR WARNING, one of the dirtiest, mean-spirited rock albums never recorded. Due to the chilly reception this disc got, Roth wanted DIVER DOWN to be more sunny and poppy to make up for the lacking sales of FAIR WARNING. Roth pressured the band to record a bunch of cover songs, with only a few original songs. This resulted in DIVER DOWN, easily the most uneven and weakest of the six Roth albums. At Eddie's disgust, the decided the'd rather make it with this own material than rely on other songwriters, and so took control for DIVER DOWN'S follow up. The Van Halen brothers were so dissatisfied with DIVER DOWN that Eddie founded this own studio, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, and recorded the band's music on this own terms. While this direction for artistic integrity would later lead to the career-killing VAN HALEN III, on one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, Eddie's decision to take control of the band's future paid off in spades. The biggest change to the music from the previous five LPs was the incorporation of keyboards, a decision David Lee Roth was not entirely happy with. Eddie is a classically trained pianist, and had been wanting to bring them in for some time. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is notable for really being among the first pop-metal albums to use synthesizers, which in the ensuing years would be widely employed by any number of bands in the pop-metal genre. Ironically enough, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, the band's next album and first with Sammy Hagar, is a natural extension of the direction Eddie began there. One of the album's biggest songs, \"Jump\", is built around keyboards rather than guitar. The songs of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four are some of the best, shiniest, and just plain fun pop metal around. The title cut is a short one minute keyboard instrumental.\"Panama\" is one of VH's best hard rock songs, and the only song about cars the band has.\"Jump\", the aforementioned song, is one of their most famous songs, and one of the biggest hits of the early one thousand, nine hundred and heights.\"I'll Wait\", another synth song, was a top ten hit about Roth falling in love with a model in magazines and having to deal with that heart break (think The Who's \"Pictures of Lily\", only with less mast involved). Most famous people have to deal with obsessive-compulsive stalkers such as this, I suppose. Lot more scary in real life than in the song.\"Drop Dead Legs\" is another typical hot mama VH song, but non the worst for the wear for common lyrical preoccupation for the boys (read: sex). Has kind of a slow rock tempo that's just dripping with raging . . . hormones and testosterone.\"Hot For Teacher\", with its amazing drum work and blistering guitar, was also a huge hit with an equally famous video. This was years before a lot of the teacher-sex scandals began breaking out all over the US. Don't know what school the boys in the video went too, but my teachers sure as hell did't look like that. That leaves the last two songs. While the whole party atmosphere that so characterizes Van Halen is maintained through the album, there's trouble in paradise. \"Girl Gone Bad\" is about exactly what it says it is. \"House of Pain\" is another troubled relationship, with Roth declaring the'd make it where this woman could never lead this house of spain. [\"House of Pain\" has Roth dumping this girl cause she's a little bit too much into S&M; for this tastes.] This is actually one of Van Halen's oldest songs, written before they got a record deal and resurrected at Alex Van Halen's insistence years after its initial composition. Much like the send of the album, no matter how great the party there's always trouble somewhere. After the band released one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, there was trouble in paradise between the brothers and their gonzo frontman, and David Lee Roth split in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five to forge a solo career. Van Halen hired Sammy Hagar and issued the first Van Hagar album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, and so began the never resolved Hagar\/Roth debate. Ultimately, the whole Roth\/Hagar debate is neither there nor there in regards to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. Had Van Halen called it quits after this record, they would still be remembered as a great rock and roll band, if a little preoccupied with sex and the frat boy image. Without a doubt, this, along with their debut, is easily the pinnacle of their achievements with Roth as front man. Both records are essential staples in any rock fan's collection. As to which is better is hard to say - VAN HALEN is one of the best, most fully realised debuts released by any band. Their sound was instantly defined and had amazing guitar which would prove to be enormously influential, far beyond the scope of most pop-metal bands. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four equally blooms large, influencing and shaping the rest of the decade.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the defining albums of the 1980s","unixReviewTime":1191196800,"reviewTime":"10 1, 2007"}

After the troublesome processor of one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-four DIVER DOWN, Eddie Van Halen cd not show that the team could write a large metal, but there is no doubt that Van Halen has the best stone, nine hundred and nine thousand and the height had to be provided. In many ways, from a psychological point of view, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of the most important in the band. Van Halen's first three albums were very successful. Eddie entered this dark period of life, which led to the creation of the FAIR warning, one of the dirtiest and most infamous albums on the album. Due to the cold acceptance of this record, Roth hopes that DIVER DOWN will have the sun and poppy to make up for the black of FAIR WARNING sales. Roth forced the group to record a group of cover songs, in which a few of the previous songs. This led to DIVER DOWN, which may be the most uneven and weakest of Roth's six albums. Annoyed by Eddie, the decided to use this own resources instead of relying on other songwriters, so the managed the next steps of DIVER DOWN. Van Halen's brothers were so dissatisfied with DIVER DOWN that Eddie founded this own studio, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, and recorded the band's music in this own way. Although this side of perfect part later led to the career of VAN HALEN III, in one thousand and nine hundred and eighty-four, Eddie's decision to control the team's future paid off. Compared to the first five LPs, the biggest change in music is keyboard design. David Lee Roth is not entirely satisfied with this. Eddie is a trained pianist and wanted to introduce them for a while. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four it was one of the first famous metal plates to use synthesizer. In the years that followed, it was widely used by many famous types of metal. Surprisingly, the band's next album \"five thousand\", \"one hundred and fifty Album\" and Sammy Hagar's first album is a natural extension of how Eddie got started. One of the great songs on the album, \"Jump\", is built around the keyboard instead of the guitar. The songs one thousand and nine hundred and eighty-four are some of the most beautiful, bright, simple and interesting instruments. The title clip is a one-minute keyboard tool. \"Panama\" is one of the best VH rock songs and the band's only song about cars. The above-mentioned song \"Jump\" is one of their most famous songs, and it is one of the most popular songs of the first days of the first thousand, nine hundred and Supreme. Another synthesizer song \"I'll Wait For You\" is about the top ten songs about Rose's resurrection in magazine models and has to deal with a broken heart (think who's the \"picture of lilies\" involving the little masters). I think a lot of celebrities have to deal with obsessive-compulsive stalkers like this. It's more terrifying in real life than the songs. \"Drop Your Legs\" is one of VH's hottest from songs, but it's not the best thing for boys to wear (read: sex). There is a slow, cloud rock rhythm. Hormones and testosterone. \"It's hot on the teacher\", with its amazing drum and interesting guitar, is also popular in the same popular video. This was just a few years before the sexual harassment of teachers began to spread throughout the United States. I don\u2019t know which school the boys in the video went to, but my teachers are not like that for sure. The last two songs are left. Although the spirit of Van Halen's band is maintained by the album, there are problems in heaven. \"The Girl Has Gone Bad\" is what it says. \"House of Grief\" is another troubled relationship, and Rose announced that the woman would never be table to lead this Spanish house. [\"House of Grief\" caused Rose to dump the girl because she was a slave to S&M;] Like the delivery of the disc, no matter how big the party, there is something wrong. After the group released one, nine hundred and eighty-four copies, there was a crisis in heaven between the brothers and their lead singer Gonzo. Van Halen hired Sami Hagar and released Van Hagar's debut album from nine hundred and eighty-six to one thousand. Since then, the Chagall \/ Ross dispute has not been resolved. Finally, the entire Ross \/ Hagar debate about one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four did not materialize for take place. If Van Halen had announced this resignation after the record, if they had focused on gender and the image of the fraternal boys, they would always be remembered as a great rock band. There is no doubt that, with their beginnings, they can be the key to their success with Rose as a lead singer. These two records are a must have for any rock collection. As for anything better, it\u2019s hard to say - VAN HALEN is one of the best and most comprehensive releases in any team. Their voices are particulate quickly and have amazing guitars, which will prove to be a major influence, beyond the boundaries of the famous metal bands.

When you listen to the radio program, you will not feel lost. The full version starts with a coat saxophone, and Edit Club just allows the steam to start at the top. Overall, this is a great suit, but you want more. With the exception of the \"interesting life\", the set has nothing really important, and in many cases, it just goes by the popular unwanted trash, such as \"Oliver's House.\" If you only get the title track of the title, you will be much happier and have more excellent content added.

A fun little pop record with lots of fun bits and catchy blocks. The tracks are all beautiful in their own unique way. The love story \"The Belle of St. Mark\" is best told with controlled beats and instruments, but Shelley's voice has a lot of soul. \"Short Berry Straw Cake\" is a hot metal that demands melody. The sound of drains is delicious and attractive. Shelley cries there. \"Afternoon Meeting\" is a sweet and passionate account of the passion. The next two tracks are silly and show Celia like another vanity with an even weaker dialogue. The ending is perfect. With Shelley preparing the long song \"The Glamorous Life\" and performing another hit dance, R&B is stuck around in full and complete cuts. When you listen to a radio program, you don't feel like you're missing anything. The full version starts with Jazzy Sex while Club Edit lets the smoke start from the top. In general, a good set, but you are left wanting more. There is nothing really important on the set other than \"Glamorous Life\" and most of the time they get lost in the unwanted pop trash like \"Oliver House\".

One reviewer mentioned how you can barely understand who plays what in some songs (mainly \"Iscarabaid\" and \"J'Nuh\"), which is certainly true. The vocals, guitars, bass, and drums seem to fade into one beautiful instrument. Some songs such as \"five\/four\" and \"eight\" have severe changes of space in the middle of the song, yet for some reason, it feels natural. This is truly progressive and amazing music. What's even more incredible is that this album was thrown together so that the band could break up. Some songs were originally written for Diary, but for some reason were cast aside. The structures of those songs are very simallar to Diary songs. For example, \"Friday\" has the same buildup to chorus pattern that \"Seven\" had, only it lost the repetition of riffs and lyrics that made that song drag a bit. Indeed, none of the songs there are too repetitious. Every song only has the elements that would improve it, and nothing more. If you like any type of rock music, I highly recommend LPtwo.

Although it is very short (the new tool album doubles its length), LPtwo has introduced all nine songs that were missing from Rock at the time. One reviewer says how can you tell who is playing the other songs (especially \"Scarabid\" and \"Jinna\"), which is very accurate. Sounds, guitar, bass and drums send up being a beautiful instrument. Some songs like \"Five \/ Four\" and \"Eight\" make difficult changes in space during the song, but for some reason, it seems natural. It's consistent and really amazing music. What's even more amazing is that this album was thrown together so the band split up. Some songs were originally written in the diary, but were cancelled for some reason. The structure of these songs is very similar to the songs in the diary. For example, \"Friday\" has a lot of chorus pattern designs for \"Seven\", just to close the repetition of the refs and melodies that slowed the song. Of course, there are no songs that are repeated so much. Every song has elements that will add to it, nothing more. If you like any kind of rock music, I recommend LPtwo. It takes a little listening to get used to it, but it will soon become one of your favourites.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Rock Album of the 90's","unixReviewTime":997056000,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2001"}

I listened to this LP many years, off and on since it's original release and recently purchased the CD version so I may take it anywhere on my I-Pod. It goes without saying it is essential music. The understated vibe whispers classic. The pairing of Getz and Gilberto seems as natural and beautiful as sunsets on the beach on Rio de Janeiro. The soft sensual vocals of Joao and Astrud Gilberto pair well with the robust yet minimalist sax work Stan Getz to create an exquisite recording. The contribution by Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano cannot be overlooked as the helped create the total ambience. Soft romantic melodies results from the joining of these two forces in their respective fields to create the definitive boss nova sound. The model for which boss nova has been defined by is the quintessential \"The Girl From Ipanema\" features the famous duet by husband and wife Astrud and Joao Gilberto that is complimented by the cool tenor sax work by Getz twice on this disc; included is the forty-fiverpm issue that was popular on the airwaves during the time period. It is ironic that Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim did not want her to using on what has become arguably one of the most recognized boss nova songs never recorded. The total recording is a reflection of a turbulent time in the world when peaceful music waft down from Sugarloaf mountain for the world to take notice and they have never stopped noticing. Maybe in your contemporary world of war and chaos we need more of the peaceful vibe of the boss nova again. If you have never experienced this classic recording, check it out, it does still sound good after all these years. Recommended for jazz and Brazilian music enthusiasts.","overall":5,"summary":"View fom Sugarloaf  Mountain","unixReviewTime":1173744000,"reviewTime":"03 13, 2007"}

Certainly this album is a concerted group effort: keyboard player John Hawken provides the evocative \"Heroine's Theme\" that begins the opening \"Autumn\" suite, bassist Chas. Cronk teams with Cousins on \"Midnight Sun,\" and while guitarist Dave Lambert's \"Just Love\" is the track that least fits the overall theme of the album, this \"Hero's Theme\" serves as a nice closing counterpart to the moody opening. Lambert's electric guitar is put to good effect throughout the album, which makes it clear that the folk music origins of the group are now well behind them. Of course the prime tracks are those composed by Cousins, exemplified by the dramatic title track that may well surpass \"Down by the Sea\" as the group's best work (pay attention to not just Hawken's morgan work but what the does on the harpsichord) and the equally frenetic \"Round and Round.\" For those who like Cousins more intimate work, there is \"Lay a Little Light on Me\" and \"The Winter Long\" finale of the \"Autumn\" suite. This was the group's most polished effort to that point in time, and given how much they missed him when the left the group the credit in that regard goes largely to Hawken. This one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four album only made it to #ninety-four on the Billboard album charts (where it actually made more of a splash than in the U.

I saw them when they were on tour in American for this album and the next day after the concert went out and bought all of their albums that had been released to that point and have been doing the same as they come out on CD. Following the final transformation of the group during the production of \"Bursting at the Seams,\" the \"Hero and Heroine\" album solidifies the musical identity that the Strawbs would explore further on their \"Ghosts\" and \"Nomadness\" albums. Of all the progressive rock groups of the seventies, the Strawbs were distinct in their willingness to produce music you would think of as darker for more moody, which may have to do with their grounding in folk music (Sandy Denny once sang with the group in one of its earlier incarnation).","overall":5,"summary":"David Cousins and the Strawbs at their heroic height","unixReviewTime":976665600,"reviewTime":"12 13, 2000"}

This is one of my favourite bands, and this CD is a highlight in my collection. Just to get you off on the right foot, it's a concept album. Take the feel of \"The Crossing\" with it's chilly, crisp take on the old time Scottish feel, and mix in an incredible storyline of war and pride set in the Scottish industrial countryside, and you've got \"Steeltown\". Your journey begins with \"Flame of The West\". a song which introduces the threat if war, and a alone travelling man calling for help from the town square. Listen to the words, feel the emotion, you'll smell the gunpowder, you'll experience the spain of loss, you'll grow from the sense of pride. One of the most heartfelt, and musically compelling pieces \"Come Back to Me\" that has never graced a \"Big Country\" album sets such a vivid picture in your minds eye, it's amazing. It's a shame Utwo's popularity overshadowed this Scottish band during the mid 'eighty's. Although The Crossing was responsible for a couple of hits \"In A Big Country\" and \"Chance\", Utwo had more radio appeal. Nonetheless, Big Country still wins in my book. Steeltown is an amazing album. an amazing story. an amazing display of fine musicianship and song writing. You may ask, after all this praise, why did i give this only four stars? One reason I fell in love with Big Country was due to their \"Scottish sound\". the echo of the bagpipe sound from the guitar. that classic Big Country sound. well, it's a bit lost in Steeltown. There are traces of it. but it is not much of a highlight as it was in The Crossing. It's a small complaint, a minor complaint, but a difference I noticed.

Nobody was more charismatic, emotional, real, deep than Pac. His topics varied from song to song, the was very versatile with every album and song the made. Yeah, the wrapped about commercial stuff but the evened it out with many songs with actual real substance in it. twoPac was really an amazing artist, it's to bad that the was killed so early in this career. I would say this is a classic album but I don't count greatest hits CDs as classics. One thing about this album I did't like was all the other twoPac classic tracks that were't included. But since twoPac had so much material it's really tough to get every single great track the had. All the previously unreleased tracks on this album were great, \"Troublesome 'ninety-six\" being my favourite. twoPac's lyrics were deep, emotional and well thought out. not just a bunch of crap thrown together like most wrappers today do. twoPac was a beast when making choruses. they were't the catchiest but the emotion and rage the brought to some of them are unmatchable by any wrapper. Another thing I really liked about Pac was this ability to really connect with you and make you feel this spain for what the's going though at the time. Some of this songs actually make you think. for make you rewind it like, \"What did the just say?\" twoPac did't have the greatest flow but this delivery was real nice and this average flow was real smooth and easy to listen to. This album easily deserves a five. Almost every song is a west coast classic. I would suggest this album to every and I do mean every single wrap fan. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

Yes it contains commercial content, but you have rated many songs with real content. TwoPac is truly an amazing artist, unfortunately killed very early in this career. I would say this is the oldest album, but I don't think the most popular CD is the oldest. The only thing I don't like about this album is all the other two old Pac things that are not included. But because twoPac has so many tools, it\u2019s hard to find every amazing song. All the songs that could be released on this album are good, \"Problem 'Ninety-Six' is my favourite. Pac's two words are deep, emotional and well thought out. but the emotions and danger they bring in some of them are incomparable in any package. One of my favourite things about Pac is that it can communicate with you and give you an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat was going on in Spain. Some of the songs make you think.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Following a near fatal car accident it was't long before this album was written, recorded and released this album. From the elaborate \"this is your life-done-up-psychedelic style\" tapestry of the album cover this is one of those albums where the artists purest and honest expressions of emotions come out at it's strongest. I personally felt as if I'd known Wonder as an intimate friend all my life upon hearing this album. Not only is it this most personal album by far but the music on it has a certain shine and polish to it that strongly anticipates what was to come from this after. Far, far musically and productionwise from the somewhat more spareInnervisionsthis album basically takes the framework of sound and lyricism of this previous three releases to their logical conclusions. Now while these albums each had growing intimacy about them this took each aspect of that flavor and expanded them out both musically and lyrical all at the same time. Honestly outside of the \"Superstition\"-like clarinet political funk of \"You Haven't Done Nothing\", featuring the Jackson five on backup choruses and the somewhat lusty and similar \"Boogie On Reggae Woman\" this album is lighter on the funk and heavier on the layered mid to low tempo itunes devoted mostly to stylistic and melodic invention. \"Smile Please\" and \"Please Don't Go\" are both fairly basic themes of optimism over loss. However \"Heaven Is ten Million Lightyears Away\" and \"They Won't Go When I Go\" are pure masterpieces. With their layered keyboards, pianos and synths intermingled with the songs lyrical allusions to spiritual and emotional longing. They totally bury any barriers that history created between European classical music and gospel\/spirituals and truly bring out the unity and humanity of their concepts throughout. Everyone has their favourite and mine is \"Bird Of Beauty\". It's a major key latin-jazz-pop style number about talking a vacation from oneself and their problems that my own from used with. let's just say a certain adventurous activity that was filed and had this music added to it. After that we STILL have three more songs to go!

Now word of warning: to anyone who shies away from ultra open and honest emotional expression this is not going to be the album for you. It's Stevie baring this soul to you and the's known for that anyway. But both vocally, lyrically and musically the does that greatly there and does't pull any punches at all.

Not only that but it influenced so much of how musicians all across pop, funk and soul in how they produce music.

After listening to this album, I personally feel like I\u2019ve been treating Wonder as my best friend for the rest of my life. It is not only a personal album so far, but the music in it has a certain cluster and a policy, which greatly predicts its future development. This album is very far from Innervisions that do not work in terms of music and production. It basically uses the sound frame and lyrics of the first three albums and comes to a logical conclusion. Now, although each album has grown closer and closer to them, it has expanded all aspects of this musical and song scene at the same time. Honestly, in addition to the \"superstitious\" political drama, the album features the Jackson quintet as a supporting choir and a powerful one similar to the \"Boogie Reggae Woman\". Funk is lighter and more important in built-in iTunes mid-range, used for style production and music. \"Please smile\" and \"please don't go\" are the basic themes of lost hope. But \u201cHeaven is a Thousand Years of Light\u201d and \u201cThey Won\u2019t Walk When I Walk\u201d are pure works of part. Their interlocking keys, piano, and synthesizers are combined with song, elevating spiritual and emotional desires. They completely bury any barriers caused by history between classical European music and the gospel \/ spirit, and truly produce the unity and personality of their ideas. Everyone has their own tastes, my favourite is \"Beauty Bird\". This is one of the mainstays of Latin jazz music, about talking about my holiday and my use. Let\u2019s just talk about the entertainment that has been maintained and added to this music. Then, we still have three songs to using! There are also two iTunes songs - the quick \"Nothing\" and \"Too Shy to say\", the slow \"Too Shy to say\", both of which deal with the various barriers that people put in place to hide true feelings in love. . Another treble \"Creepin '\" with a bit of atonic, dream wash synthesizer explores the concept of sexuality of unchanging love, and only Stevie Wonder (Stevie Wonder) can use this type of music to tackle any subject. Now a warning: For those who restrict open communication and emotional honesty, this will not be your album. It was Stevie who showed you this soul, and the was still known for it. But whether the sound, voice for music, it is done very well, and there is no impact at all. This album, like a therapist like John Lennon's Plastic Ono, does something people can't do at all: it focuses its human knowledge on the world beyond its title as a warning and instructive story, and This is done in a promising way. Not only that, it also has a profound effect on the way pop, funk and soul musicians make music. Additionally, listening is fun, and you can enjoy a man-made symphony by Stevie Wonder.","overall":5,"summary":"A Change Has Come For Steveland","unixReviewTime":1307577600,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2011"}

Far, musically and productionally far beyond spareInnervisions this album usually takes the form of sound and rhythm from these three previous releases until their logical conclusions.

This is the number one latin-jazz-pop style of conversation about the holiday itself and their problems that I own. let\u2019s just say an interesting performance was filed and added to this music. After that, we still have three songs to go!

And another high-profile line with a small-scale, dream-washed synth \u201cCreepin\u2019 explores unimportant sexual fantasy like Stevie Wonder touched everyone on this topic with this music. Now a word of caution: for anyone who avoids expressing very open and honest feelings this will not be your album. It's Stevie introducing yourself and you are known for that anyway. But both in terms of sound, sound and music that makes it great there and does\u2019t attract any fists at all. Any treat like John Lennon\u2019s Plastic Ono Band album has done something that no one has been table to handle well: focusing on human messages from the outside world is a careful and informative subject that made it very promising.

Even though early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's \"Music Of My Mind\" was a greatcreative stroke and had some memorable material point like the flush & timeless\"Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)\", as well as songs like \"Evil\", \"I Love Every LittleThing About You\", and \"Girl Blue\" to name a few, it was't until late 'seventy-two that it all started reallycoming together for Stevie Wonder, and the began toemerge as a singer\/songwriter\/producer\/arranger\/musical visionary of mythical proportions! He had cut himself away from old stagnant Motownformula which had worked well throughout the sixty's, and arose as a young SUPERSTAR who was in control ofhis own destiny as an artist. Enter, October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's \"Talking Book\", an albumwhich I can remember (at page weight) opening up andreading (sounding out the big words) the lyrics as Idigested each musical morsel. (-:This was the first album that I know of which waspackaged that way. I'm sure there may have been others, but this is first one that I knew of which opened unlike a book with the lyrics printed in the dinner jacket.

For that time, it was a radical statement. This was the height of post-civil rights african-americanupward mobility and aspiration, and so Stevie, Issac Hayes,Earth, Wind & Fire, Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye and otherswere speaking to that generation of young ambitious blacks. With love (in all it's forms)always being the overwhelmingtheme of Stevie's music, this music also spoke to the allow humanity. Also radical was Stevie's openness inincorporating what was considered cutting edge musicaltechnology back then. The use of the mighty T. O. N. T. O., Moog, Mini Moog, and Arp two thousand, six hundred synthesizers along with early seventy'sstandard instrumentation like Fender Rhodes,Wurlitzer, Hohner Dseven Clavinet, was-wah\/fuzz guitar tones, etc. which made this music seem so futuristicand otherworldly for that time. But also it was Stevie's sophisticated, yet highly accessible musical sensibilities whichtouched on many musical genres and had a mass appealwhich than't really seen up until that time. This album was good all the way through. From the immortal \"You Are The Sunshine Of My Life\"to the sparse nasty clarinet-synthbassfunky-wah-wah\/fuzz toneguitar grooviness of songs like \"Maybe Your Baby\" and\"Tuesday Heartbreak\", to the gorgeous and serene \"You & I\", to the jazzy-pop of \"You've Got It Bad Girl\" to the funkopus supreme that is \"Superstition\", whose clarinet lines, moog bass, rhythmic syncopation, and horn lines have beenstudied for years since it's release! It's just amazing, the musical ground that Stevie couldcover (at that young page!) within the span of an album! He just had it all together, and this was this moment in time! The one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's belonged to Stevie Wonder!! His approach to lyrics, composition, production and singingwas just so unique for that time. That's why the used todominate the Grammies & AMA's between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six! He just came with the goods and it was undeniable! Of course, the had lot of help from the great musiciansand singers the worked with during that time to bring hisvisions to life, as well as people like co-producersMalcolm Cecil and Bob Margouleff who were the brainchildrenas well as the octopus-like arms behind the mightyT. O. N. T. O. synthesizer that gave Stevie's music buchan edge over the competition at the time! There were also people like the late Yvonne \"Syreeta\" Wright(once Stevie's wife & a brilliant vocalist in her own right)who would ocassionally serve as songwriting partners withStevie and co-penned some of this more poignant songs fromthe early seventy's like the beautiful and sad \"Blame It On The Sun\"and the moody \"Looking For Another Pure Love\", whichcontains a clever guitar cameo by the great Jeff Beck. Stevie also showed a political bent on the song \"Big Brother\", which would be a are-cursor lot of this later work another landmark albums like \"Innervisions\", \"Fulfillingness'First Finale\", and this magnum opus, \"Songs In The Key Of Life\"where the dealt head on with social issues. Closing out the album is the gorgeous and introspective\"I Believe When I Fall In Love (It Will Be Forever)\", which is a favourite of any true Stevie Wonder fan! I've said it before in other Stevie reviews, and I'll say it again. between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine,Stevie Wonder was in spiritual\/psychic connection within otherworldly creative muse which channelled through him, some of the most innovative and meaningful musicof the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, which has had immeasurable impact on thedecades since then!

Many people consider this important technique to be a matter of packaging and well-being, because the raw and crude humour in Slim Shady LP is very detailed, and some people may not believe it to be true. In this case, Eminem has decided to use the chaos on this second major album, Marshall Mathers LP.

Kelly was just that: R. This was probably this last really solid album. In fact, R. Kelly ('ninety-five) was't one of those. It had some great itunes, maybe three-four, and then the rest was average filler. I hated it on a whole. My mother towns the album and it's not all that! Anyway, TP-two, Strip For You, R&B; Thug, The Greatest Sex and I Don't Mean It start the CD off stupendously. My favourites from there are Strip For You, The Greatest Sex (my favourite of the five, mentions zodiac sign, sexily crooning) and I Don't Mean it, a song about having regrets about doing your lover wrong, and wanting to change it, apologize one, zero, and getting past it. TP-two - a nice, laid-back mid-tempo intro that will get you in the mood to of*** somebody special. for just hot for the moment, all! xxxxxxxxStrip For You - another sexy, chill mid-tempo about stripping before sex. Leave it to Kells to croon this way through a song such as this. A great song. xxxxxxxxxR&B; Thug - nice beat and the vibe; insane. Those two things save it from being a bad song. Lyrics are good, kinda slutty but I like it. xxxxxxxxI Don't Mean It - real R&B.; I miss you, Kells. Stop wrap-singing, and get back to the basics, I BEG YOU! I'd give you ANYTHING for you to do so. xxxxxxxx one\/twoThe Greatest Sex - Really smooth, with nice lyrics. The beat is pretty nice too. I LOVE this CD. It's great! xxxxxxxxxJust Like That - The Ho's were a bit much, but I understand where the's coming from mostly (haven't experienced a real relationship, but have seriously loved twice so. ) xxxxxxxxxxLike A Real Freak - Decent, not this best. The next song is WAY better. xxxxxxxFiesta - THE ultimate party anthem. I'm so glad that the wrote this song. I'm also happy Jay-Z was in the remix. xxxxxxxxxxxDon't You Say No - Pretty good vibe. Nice bass, different from the last song, but so similar to the others. Nice, but there should be more, I suppose. xxxxxxxxThe Real R. Kelly - Uh. Weird, I guess. xxxOne Me - Much better than the proceeding interlude. xxxxxxx one\/twoI Wish - Great insight to R. Kelly's life. I respect him for letting it all out, so we could hear it. The guitar helps the laid-back vibe to it. Mid-tempo with meaning at its finest. xxxxxxxx one\/twoA Woman's Threat - A strong \"ballad(?)\" about a woman who will leave you if you do wrong. Best believe. xxxxxxxxxI Decided - Not much to say, but this track is killer! xxxxxxxxxxI Mean (I Don't Mean It) Solid remix. It is a remix, right? Nice production. xxxxxxxxI Wish - Remix (To The Homies That We Lost) Pleasant, and assisted by a complete orchestra. xxxxxxxxxAll I Really Want - Chill as all get out, but not very distinctive. One of the very weakest tracks there. xxxxxxxFeelin' On Yo Booty - solid mid-tempo. Showcases R. Kelly's frequent freaky ways. xxxxxxxxThe Storm Is Over - a gospel-tinged mid-tempo that's not only true, but inspirational and relate-able. One of the better songs there. My old friend, Derrick's mother, Paulie, adored this one. Probably was her favourite by him. Well, might be tied with I Believe I Can Fly. ^_^ xxxxxxxxx one\/twoOverall, this album is a lusty, even slutty view into this life, this soul and heart.

It does\u2019t have to be attributed to these hands but the fact that Kelly wrote, produced and make any text on this album is important because at the critical stage of the creative control stage it is important for the program to rely on checking the music. Not only that but considering that it is really Worth as following up to two albums- in this case directly from this one one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight double setRand as a sign up to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three thirteen- Is a seventy version of the Marvin Gaye style that is conceptually attributed to an album in which the music and songs originally speak an emotional language.

Kelly writes (and often invents) the types of Kelly where Kelly is naked about the conflicts that require fame and how it separates you from your humanity. It usually takes the days of modern R&B; lifestyle while being a music star is very similar to being a superior model sometimes playing the truth and hope issue to be heard together. It\u2019s likely that when the album is released Kelly will actually remember the friend she left in the remix of \u201cI Wish\u201d and some thorough references to \u201cgoing to church\u201d to open, a recurring idea for R. Kelly that still continues until now. So that does\u2019t mean it\u2019s worth a stylish look because it sits upright, even if the maximum width is in modern terms.

Often (the ballet type number) Kelly is emotionally naked about the arguments of fame and how they separate you from your personality. Basically it takes modern R&B. A way of life where being a music star is a lot like sometimes being the best model and playing the facts and hopes of this story for everyone to hear. So much so that posting an album reminds Kelly of a friend who went with a remix of \"I Wish\" and in some shortcuts constantly refers to \"going to church\" to free herself, a The idea that reappears. Kelly still follows RK today. So it's totally inappropriate as a \"retro\" style album because it sits flat, even the most prominent ballads karen't modern. And considering the title of the poem was probably the best decision. Here or. Kelly's ship shop is based on R&B. Music goes hand in hand with words from a celebrity who is attracted to music at any time. And although there is music in it that you can easily offer to make love to it, listening to it will bring interesting thoughts to your mind.","overall":4,"summary":"If you clean up R.

This cd includes a reprint of the original book along with the vinyl album. Cat Stevens has two great albums - _Tea for the Tillerman_ and _Teaser and the Firecat_ - and _Mona Bone Jakon_ are very close. If you have these three, you already have most of the \u201cvery good\u201d Cat Stevens, don\u2019t think about the other \u201cbest\u201d collections.

This is uneven, and even at best does not approach the stratospheric quality of this previous work. To my mind, the best thing about this last thing is that it\u2019s on top of _Numbers_, an exciting album based on less than a book given by a cat to the original idea. (He also did the drawings, which is amazing. They're on the CD; all of this retouching includes all the original artwork on the doors.

The whole door show came too early: \"Novim's Nightmare\" was far and away the best part, and when I first changed it I played the song it's on this CD a few times and over and over. It's not \"white,\" but it has the same power to make your eyes tear up. \"And it's beautifully crafted and arranged, until it's reachable. by a musical scene involving a nine-beat bar in a rhythmic introduction. (The cat himself made this album, without longtime producer Paul Samwell-Smith, and the stigma, is better than it did. its _Foreigner _.) The that rest of the article is very good, especially the chart. \"Jzero,\" which introduced the prophet stenosis in a story. Haunting \u201cDrywood\u201d does a great job in defining the album\u2019s spiritual pursuit and the attempt to resolve it. \u201cWhistlestar\u201d is table to jump beautifully without being anxious. And twenty -five years later I still don\u2019t know what the inexplicable \u201cBanapple Gas\u201d is in the middle of it all, but it\u2019s pretty cute. Things are a bit thought-provoking, but the quality is consistent and at least there are no bad moments. There were a small number of guests, too, especially David Sanborn and Art Garfunkel. And I have to correct a statement from my review of _Catch Bull and Four_: The cat also picks up the electric guitar for this album. (Clever memories don\u2019t say who played the songs, but I\u2019m sure Cat was working on Gibson\u2019s \u201cDrywood.\u201d) Now there\u2019s a bit of history for strangers: \u201cCat Stevens\u201d is the stage name for to Steven Georgiou, born in the UK to one thousand nine hundred and forty -nine Cypriot fathers and a Swedish mother. Any musician, released these first two albums before the was twenty and on this way to becoming a \u201cpop star\u201d. Later, the fell victim to a horrific case of tuberculosis. When the returned to singing and writing, the Lord decided to translate more and found himself bringing good things without any visible advertisements. That was good for him; the was not particularly interested in business success. But, perhaps surprisingly, these soft acknowledgment songs and the deliberate avoidance of \u201cbusiness-to-business\u201d have become a huge international star. Well, eventually (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven) they converted to Islam and took the name \u201cYusuf Islam\u201d (after Joseph\u2019s Bible translator). At the same time also left the music industry. He has already recorded a few albums about Islam, but the latest commercial collection of this music is _Footsteps In The Dark_ (probably the second volume of \u201cBest Hits,\u201d but really a handful of popular and popular and small iTunes .not available elsewhere). You can feel safe when you ignore the comments of people who think they have become \u201ctough\u201d and \/ for \u201ctolerant\u201d. The simple fact is that almost all of Cat Stevens \u2019albums (except the first two) were full of\u201c spiritual work, \u201dand eventually found what they were looking for in Islam. \u201cRecently\u201d (actually, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty -ninety -nine) Salman Rushdie\u2019s words karen\u2019t what you\u2019d think (especially if you don\u2019t mention Rushdie\u2019s death). He is no longer \u201ctough\u201d for \u201cimpatient\u201d with the rest of us; It\u2019s just a Muslim observer, that is. There\u2019s only a problem with people who think that people looking for things don\u2019t come close to finding something, because that traditional religion is more \u201cpastoral\u201d than non-religious. His songs don\u2019t have to \u201cpass\u201d their creator in order to grow; there is no need to obey Joseph to raise the Cat. And once written at this stage of the \u201cwill\u201d, they are suitable for everyone - not future Muslims.","overall":4,"summary":"A Pythagorean Theory Tale","unixReviewTime":1372896000,"reviewTime":"07 4, 2013"}

I'm a big techno fan, being a DJ, this is a must. Lately I've seen Techno become what wrap used to be. It started as a bunch of kids messing around, turned into an underground sensation, and is slowly working it's way into the mainstream. By two thousand and ten, my theory says, Techno will be the new pop and Paul Oakenfold will be afforded the same respect as 'Old school' wrappers. So instead of nerdy suburban white kids trying to be black, they'll try to be ravers. Anyway, this CD is one never increasing number of evidences for my theory: THe flawless fusion of 'Adult Contemporary' and underground sound. Though if you're a fan of 'Angel' brace yourself for the first minute and a half of the Dusted remix. Each of these songs embraces the emotional turmoil of McLachlan's original prices with the sounds of the city. Even though the titles look a little scary to some of McLachlan's fans, it's okay, Sarah likes these songs. 'Fear (Hybrid's Super Collider mix)' is the perfect example of the agreement of adult angst (be honest, it's true) and teen angst. The Original 'Fear' from 'Fumbling Towards Ecstacy' is sad almost morbid at times, but this remix first respects that emotion then transforms into a upbeat piece, as Hybrid's pals The Crystal Method said: 'Keep hope alive'. Dj Tiesto's 'Sweet Surrender' adds an energy to this song that McLachlan did't and it really compliments the lyrics. If I can make one observance of all of these songs it's complimentary. The techno music really enhancing the emotional intensity of the lyrics, creating the kind of trance symphony that McLachlan's originals did't try, relying more on the emotional intensity created by the solo guitar. My favourite song on this album creates another vehicle of feeling McLachlan did't think of: contrast. The track is 'I Love You (BT mix)'. The original 'Love' is on 'Surfacing' and is an almost lethargicly slow piece that actually blacks the feeling the lyrics would simply.

For two thousand and ten, my theory is that techno will be a new pop, and Paul Oakenfold will be given the same honor as the old school. So in cities that try to be black, instead of white children, they will try to be traitors.

Another way to feel my favourite song on this album is that McLachlan did't think of it: the difference. The song says 'I love you (BT Mix)'.

As did Sinatra, Diana often sings barely above a whisper, but at appropriate times raises her singing voice for dramatic effect.","overall":5,"summary":"The Sound Of Love...","unixReviewTime":1000771200,"reviewTime":"09 18, 2001"}

Imagination, wit, and cleverness in this genre is difficult considering the limited batch of tricks available. I really enjoy electronic music, but only when well done, and thus I'm usually left in want for something new to come along. Thus when a band like Germany's Notwist comes out of the blue to fill such a avoid (though actually being around for quite a few years), it's like an oasis in the desert. They wisely adapt their sound, however, adding guitars and occasional drums onto a IDM style of electronica reminiscent of Aphex Twin to create a lowkey, more organic and pliable sound than most electronic facts. It brings to mind a more restrained New Order for Depeche Mode, with more plaintive, emotive lyrics. The singer is equally sublime and subtle, giving the music the needed oomph to push it all the way across. All of this combines to create a mood evocative of living in today's world- brushed, heady, and floating through aimless. Songs like \"Solitaire\" and \"Off the Rails\" exemplify this the strongest, speaking of desperation and nostalgia while simultaneously coping with newly arriving troubles. The minimalism in their style blends strongly to this feeling of being in limbo. Powerful and captivating in equal amounts. While not a wholly new type of sound, as most bands are dissecting seventy's-eighty's genres at the moment, and sometimes the arrangements are a little less subtle and underdeveloped than desired, the band picks up and runs with the overall sound and concept well to create one of recent memory's most evocative releases.

He drops very complex punches and metaphors. His similes are excellent and this flow is just smooth. Unlike many MC's today, Ludacris created this own style. He is defiantly very talented. Luda makes you laugh with this cartoon-ish wrap. His lyrics are very entertaining indeed. I love this CD. It has been in my collection for over a year now, and I still bump it in my ride for at home sometimes. The production on this album is very nice. The beats are not pop but they are very catchy. I can still there the melodies from \"Saturday\" echoing in my head. The first track, \"Coming two America\" starts off with a quote from the movie \"Coming To America\" (With Eddie Murphy). Then the hardcore, southern beat comes on. Luda drops verses that are fire on this one. Definatly a very nice track. Then is the hit single everyone knows of, \"Roll Out\". This has MAD flow and hot lyrics. The beat is so catchy, the whole song is just banging! After that is \"Go two Sleep\" which is a hot song. It is the type of song to put on when your wrestling for fighting with your friends in the back yard, for on the block. Then it's \"Cry Babies\". This track is hard to forget. Makes me go up to my homie and start beating the living cash*t out of him. \"She Said\" is one of the funniest tracks I've heard!!! Very funny and Luda is playing hot verses there. After that is \"Howhere\" which is the funniest skit I've never heard. It's so funny, I was crying from laughing so much. Then is the theme from Rush Hour, \"Area Codes\" featuring Nate Dogg. This is very hot, I bump this one lot. \"Growing Pain\" is my favourite track on this album. It's very honest and is tight. This is better than the remix that appeared on \"Golden Grain\" (by Disturbing Tha Peace). Ludacris spits fire there. Another skit to knock you off your chair is \"Greatest Hits\". This is so funny! It's too halerious to explain. After that is \"Move Bi*ch\" featuring Mystikal. It's the hottest song to play in the car on high volume when your in a traffic jam and real ticked. Then it's \"Stop Lying\" which is another skit to laugh to. He has the best skits never. Then its the never-so-catchy \"Saturday\". It's a nice track, but I don't really dig this flow there. Though the beat is nice to freestyle on, for just use for your own record. After that is \"Keep It On The Hush\". This one is very low-tempo, and mellowed down. It's style nice and Luda is nice on there. It's funny and has crazy flow. \"Word Of Mouf (Freestyle)\", is hot as hell!! Luda spits some of the best lyrics I've never heard from there. Luda is defiantly hot in freestyling. \"Get The F**k Back\" has a really hot beat, but I don't dig the I-forty's verse. \"Freaky Thangs\" featuring Jagged Edge is a nice club joint for the ladies. Luda's verses is are on fire!!! The last track, \"Cold Outside\" is the only joint I can live without. Overall this record is essential in your Hip Hop collection. The Bonus song, \"Block Lockdown\" is one of the best tracks on this album. I gave this album four.five\/five. There are a couple of songs I could skip over but this is defiantly a hot, hot record.","overall":4,"summary":"Ludacris' best record","unixReviewTime":1070064000,"reviewTime":"11 29, 2003"}

He stopped the complicated boxers and the metaphors. His analogy is very good, and the process is very smooth. Unlike many MCs today, Ludacris has developed this style. She is very talented. Luda makes you laugh with this kind of cartoon pack. His remarks are truly intriguing. I love this CD. It's been in my collection for over a year, and sometimes I still keep it at home while cycling. The production of this album is very good. The bits are not popular, but they look great. I can still repeat the song \"Saturday\" in my mind. The first song \"Two Coming of America\" \u200b\u200bbegins with a sentence from the film \"Coming to America\" \u200b\u200b(with Eddie Murphy). This was followed by a powerful southern rhythm. Luda left a hot line in this poem. It\u2019s definitely a very good track. Then came the famous song \"Roll Out\". This is a MAD broadcast with popular voices. The rhythm is beautiful, the whole song is cloud! Then there is \"Sleep Twice\", which is a popular song. When you fight with your friends in the backyard, this is a song ready to fight on the block. There's also the \"Crying Baby\". This song is hard to forget. Let me go to my friend and start squeezing him for real money. \"He Said\" is one of the most interesting songs I've never listened to! ! ! Very interesting, Luda played famous verses there. Then there\u2019s \u201cHowhere\u201d, the most interesting thing I\u2019ve never heard. Laughter really, I laughed until I cried. Then there\u2019s the fast-paced theme, with Nate Dogg as the protagonist in \u201clocal code\u201d. It's so hot, I always hold this. \"Growing Up Pain\" is my favourite song on this album. It is honest and firm. This is better than the mixture from \"Golden Grain\" (by disturbing the peace of Tha). Ludacris breathed a sigh of relief. Another drawing that makes you fall off your seat is the \"Selected Album\". This is so much fun! It is very difficult to describe it. Then it was \"Submit Bi * sch\" by Mystikal. When you encounter a traffic jam, this is the most popular song played at a high volume in a car. Then there is \"Stop Lying\", which is another laughable joke. He never had the most beautiful painting. Then there\u2019s the \u201cSaturday\u201d that was\u2019t so appealing. This is a good track, but I have never dug in the process. Although the beat is good for freestyle swimming, it is only for you to record. Then it's \"shut up\". This rhythm is very slow and very around. It has a beautiful style, and Luda is right there. It\u2019s fun, and there\u2019s a crazy ride. \"The Voice of the Mouf (Freestyle)\", is hot! ! Luda spat on some of the sweetest words I had never heard. Luda is very popular in freestyle. \"Get F ** of Back\" has a very hot beat, but I won't dig into verses in the I-forty. The \u201cFreaky Thangs\u201d with curved edges are a good club for ladies. Ruth's verse is on fire! ! ! The last song \"Cold Outdoor\" is the most connected thing I could have without it. Overall, this record is essential to your Hip Hop collection. The bonus song \"Block Lockdown\" is one of the best songs on this album. Give me this album four, five \/ five. There are a few songs I can skip, but this is definitely a hot record.","overall":4,"summary":"Ludacris' best record","unixReviewTime":1070064000,"reviewTime":"11 29, 2003"}

I like this cd It's been over a year in my collection, and I still ride it where I sometimes go home. The preparation of this album is very enjoyable. Bates are not pop but they are very attractive. I can still using \"Saturday\" that resonates in my head. The first track, \"Coming to America\", begins with an excerpt from the movie \"Coming to America\" \u200b\u200b(no Eddie Murphy). Then the cutter exploded in the south. Lada dropped the burning verses in the country. Obviously this is a great track. The next most popular song is \"Roll Out\". It has MAD flow and warm sounds. The rhythm is charming, the whole song just beats! This is followed by \"Double Go Sleep\" which is a hot song. It's the kind of song you have to put up where your fight with your friends is fought in the backyard of the block. Then there are the \"Cry Babies\". It's hard to forget this song. You force me to go to your house and start withdrawing money from it. The song \"He Said\" is one of the most exciting songs I've never heard !!! It's funny and Lada is playing hot verses there. Then there's \"Hour\", the funniest scheme I've never heard. It's funny, I was crying with a lot of laughter. Then there's Rush Hour's theme, \"Location Codes,\" which includes NetDog. It's so hot, I hit it so hard. \"Growing Pain\" is my favourite track from this album. It is very reliable and compact. It's better than a remix of \"Golden Green\" (disturbing the peace). Ludacris spits fire there. Another skirt to remove from your seat is the \"greatest hit\". This is so funny! It is very difficult to explain. This is followed by \"Move Bi * sch\" which includes Mystikal. When you are in a traffic jam and really tired, you can play the hottest song in the car. Then there is \"Stop Lying\" which is another way to make fun. He has the best episodes so far. Since then, \"Saturday\" has never been so charming. It's a good track, but I don't really blame the flow there. While freestyle fun is fun, use it for your records. Then click \"Keep it on the hash\". It has a very low speed, and is soft. Nice style and Lida is beautiful there. It's funny and a crazy flow. \"Word of Muff (Freestyle)\", burns hell !! Loda spat out some of the best words I've never heard there. Loda is hot with the insult of freestyle. \"F ** of take back\" has a warm rhythm, but I don't skip verse forty. Freaky Things is a beautiful women's club that includes Jagged Edge. Luda's verses are on fire !!! The last track, \"Cold Outside\" is the only joint I can live without. All of these records are important to your ship shop collection. The bonus song, \"Block Lockdown\" is one of the best tracks on this album. Give me this album four.five \/ five.

Mariah has had an impressive career with a slew of #one hits, but its not only the #one hits that are good, but these other songs that were sorely missed on radio. It does echo of her past compilation from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight #one's, all of the songs found their way there too (with the exception of Whenever You Call with Brian McKnight). Mariah Carey's GREATEST HITS, covers her ten year plus career quite well, offering fans twenty-eight different songs throughout that period. Some of the songs on this collection were never released commercially in the US, for just were not hits at all, but they are still good songs. Nevertheless this is a nice retrospective of a career, and its a must have for fans and new fans alike.","overall":5,"summary":"Well Rounded","unixReviewTime":1009238400,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2001"}

This album looks great commercially, no more embarrassment. It looks like Wu was driving a record ten blocks from shut to shut in another business office. With music, it's best to get grid of all your trash. Poetically still strong now let me forgive everything. On the other hand, you did not sell. This album program is growing significantly by the company. He did some grimes for Shaolin Slim Haddart, the made a full will but - still, I think this album is rich - now - we do - what we want. This is not a bad album at all, this album will attract others who will not listen to you because it has a lot of sound. This album only shows that you can do more than one thing, they can spread and occupy the whole world. In fact, a metal flag, they hoisted and conquered the shipyard's commercial world.

Not in a Rock and Roll fashion, nor a classic seventy's for punk eighty's fashion. Title TK is the perfect combination between folk and punk, where the atmosphere is created by a revolution of riffs and bass leads. The stone of the record is kept top-notch even if sound quality is meant to be non-digital. I have not heard any of The Breeders last albums yet, but him really impressed with the work theyve done there. The Deal sisters eerie singing and monotone backups are wonderful. I love that whole singing-without-moving-your-tounge-punk thing. The guitars create melodious backup, while the drums are kept below simplicity disregarding the time there and there, lifting the whole basement-type-recording a step. Probably the thing you could condemn about this album is the fact that there are only two types of songs. The gloomy-stmospheric type where voice melodies and bass play the lead roles, and the more edgy and rocking jones, where guitars set the stone, followed by playful vocals such as \"ah-ah-ah-ah.\"Songs most notable on the record are \"Little Fury,\" the \"title track\" that sets the atmosphere for the whole record (my personal favourite) guitars there are pretty cool, especially the high toned jones in the background that come out every once in a while, they give ste song a whole happy thing. \"Too Alive\" which is the edgy type of song, \"Put on a Side\" which resembles some sonic youth musically, but is set aside by the sisters vocals, simple. \"Sinister Foxx\" the gloomy stipe where the sister's accent is dramatized by a punk-type pronunciation where certain syllables are pronounced tongueless. And last but not least \"Huffer\" which is the fastest song of the record. Ive found that no matter when i listen to this record it puts me in a lively mood.

The TK title is the perfect combination of human and punk, creating an atmosphere of renewal and renewal in the lead space. Even if the sound quality is not digital, the record label remains high. I had never heard of The Breeders' last album, but the was impressed by the work they did there. Unpleasant singing and unpleasant walks for working sisters are fine. I love to using everything punk without moving your tongue. The guitar creates a fun accompaniment, while the drums are always light, no matter the time and the moment in which, you take the whole place down to record one step up. The fact that you can criticize this album is that there are only two types of songs. Dark and hairy with vocal and bass music as the protagonist, with a more savant-garde and swinging Jones, the guitar laid the foundation, followed by playful vocals such as \"ah-ah-ah-ah\". The record is \"Little Fury\", a \"title song\" that makes the atmosphere of the whole record (my personal will). They sang the song use. The most exciting thing. \"Alive Alive\" is an savant-garde song. \"Set aside\" is similar to music for some teens, but it is thrown aside by the singing of sisters, it's easy. The mournful stone of \"Sinister Foxx\", the little sister's speech is portrayed as punk, and some members are called out. Last but not least where \"Huffer\" is, this is the fastest song record. I find that every time I listen to this record, it keeps me happy. If punk makes you aggressive, then this makes you crazy.

Not in rock and roll fashion, for in the same fashion as in the old seventies. TK's theme is a perfect blend between humanity and punk, where the flexibility of the riff and lead bass creates the atmosphere. Record labels are kept very high even if the audio quality is intended to be non-digital. I've never heard of any of Breeders' last albums, but you're impressed with the work you've done there. The Dale sisters' scary vocals and monotone backups are excellent. I love all those song-out-movements-your-punk-language. Guitars make an excellent backup, while drums are kept down to separate time there and there, the entire under-recording phase is recommended. The only thing you can criticize about this album is that there are only two types of songs. A very dark genre in which vocal and bass songs play a major role, as well as fast and moving jones, where the guitar tones are set, followed by playful sounds like \"ah nah nah nah\". The most notable song on the \"Little Fury\" records is a \"title song\" that sets the record for all (my favourite) guitars, especially the highlands that come out at any given time. \u06d4 City singing is all fun. \"To Alive\" is a disturbing genre of song, \"Put on a Side\" which is similar to other young people's genres of music, but the words of the sisters are set aside. \"Sinister Foxx\" is a nonsensical step in which a sister's voice is played in a punk manner where some members are called silent. And last but not least, \"Huffer\" is the fastest song on record. I have found that even listening to this record keeps me in the right frame of mind.

Some of the notable tracks are Lonely Day, My Destroy Town, Hot Day Waiting and the title track.

There are so many details, nuances and little secrets hidden on this disc that I'd feel rather guilty if I fail to mention them in my review; then again, I don't think it's possible to cover all its depths in a single review. This really is one of those discs you need to buy, give time, study its lyrics, pay attention to the excellent production, clever songwriting and magnificent musicianship. Some Opeth fans think that never since Steven Wilson has been producing Opeth albums they sound too much like Porcupine Tree in some aspects, especially recording techniques and stereo mixing-wise. Well, I'd like to point out that Wilson's collaboration with Opeth has certainly worked both ways; Steven Wilson has definitely absorbed some of their elements and seamlessly injected them in this own music with Porcupine Tree. This is, as many will agree, the heaviest Porcupine Tree album, and it shows right from the first track. \"Blackest Eyes\" perhaps contains the heaviest guitar riff Steven Wilson has never played; it kicks in after the moody bass line a bit like a gigantic rock piece. The heavy approach is further developed on other tracks as well; on the longest song, \"Gravity Eyelids\", which begins really slowly with minimalist songwriting and tribal rhythms, there is a sudden shift of mood as Wilson plays this shuddering guitar riff (in the vein of Opeth) over Barbieri's experimental keyboard arrangement. It's the kind of riff you might hear on a Tool album, except that I'm not a Tool fan, but it works incredibly well there. Buy the album to hear this riff. Steven Wilson's partner in Blackfield, Aviv Geffen, appears on two tracks, one of them being the highly acclaimed number, \"The Sound of Muzak\". This is one of those songs that I could identify with right away, because of its challenging bass line and despairingly intense shifts of vocal melodies. Moreover, this tune is about the current state of the music industry and its lyrics are terribly ironic, which recall Devin Townsend's \"Earth Day\" to me. John Wesley, who has toured extensively with Marillion in this career, also graces this album with additional guitars and vocals, and it's in your best interest to give this music a listen. The band's affinity to Pink Floyd is still evident on some other songs such as \"Lips of Ashes\" and \"Prodigal\". They are both outstanding works of songwriting, musicianship and vocals. There are also two instrumental pieces there. Actually \".three\" in't entirely 'instrumental' as Wilson cutters a few words, but other than that, it has no vocals. It sounds like this huge orchestra performing psychedelic prog; whilst, \"Wedding Nails\" is the band's testimony to creativity. New drummer Gavin Harrison rules this track as the song delves into stylistic changes, maintaining its moody and heavy edge throughout. I am utterly amazed at the band's musical performance; every prog band needs to listen to this track to understand it is possible to write long instrumental songs without being overtly technical. The slower songs add to the album's diversity. \"Trains\" is a wonderful song built around acoustic guitars that pick up near the send thanks to the majestic drumming, \"Heartattack in a Layby\" and \"Collapse the Light into Earth\" both start with sparse piano notes and Wilson singing the most amazing vocal melodies you could imagine. His voice makes my soul cry; it's full of passion and intensity.\"The Creator Has a Masterpiece\" and \"Strip the Soul\" see the band going back to its new-found heaviness. They are among the most progressive songs of the album full of schizophrenic melodies, frenetic interplay, some electronics and echoed vocals. Colin Edwin's bass is so integral on these tracks that it's the bass that carries the song's speed. \"Strip the Soul\" encapsulates a sense of brutal beauty (hence the Opeth element, in my opinion) and another personal favourite of mine. I own the European edition of this album with a bonus disc containing three tracks and a video. The songs are as good as anything else Steven Wilson has written, so if you're a die-hard Porcupine Tree fan, this version is highly recommended. I've been listening to this album since its release, and still give it regular spins. This is a great album that has aged well and stood the test of time for me.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant Beyond Words","unixReviewTime":1110412800,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2005"}

Some Opheit fans believe that since Steven Wilson produced Opheit's albums that in some respects looked like a porcupine tree, especially the recording technique and stereo mixing technique. However, I would like to point out that the collaboration between Wilson and Opeth has worked both ways. Steven Wilson has grabbed some of this belongings and injected himself into the music with a porcupine tree without interruption. This is, as many would admit, the heaviest porcupine tree album, and it appears directly from the original track. \"Very Deep Eyes\" is probably the heaviest guitar piece never played by Steven Wilson. This bus line starts a bit like a big rock piece behind the emoji. Hard track is also developed on other tracks. In the longest song, \"Gravity Islands\", which begins with a small song and the rhythm of the nation, the mood suddenly changes as Wilson takes this shocking riff (Opeth's vein) to Barbary's test keyboard. Runs with Out. It's the kind of riff you can feel in a toolbar album, except I'm not a fan of the tool, but it works great there. Buy an album to hear this sound. Steven Wilson's Blackfield partner, Aviv Geffen, appears in two songs, one of which is the very popular number, \"The Sound of Muzak\". It's one of the songs I can immediately recognize, thanks to its challenging bass line and powerful variations of pitch songs. What's more, this song is about the current state of the music scene, and its lyrics are very vague, reminiscent of Devin Townsend's \"Earth Day.\" John Wesley, who has spent a lot of time with Marilyn on this project, also enjoys the album with guitar and sound, and is delighted to hear the music. The band's relationship with Pink Floyd is still evident in other songs such as \"Ashes Lips\" and \"Prodigal\". Both are great works of songwriting, music and lyrics. There are also two pieces. In fact, \".three\" is completely 'instrumental' because Wilson cuts out a few words, but other than that, the has no words. It's as if this big orchestra is doing a psychological program. However, \"Wedding Nails\" is a testament to the founding group. New drummer Gavin Harrison has mastered the song because the song changes style, keeping it flexible and rigid. I'm totally amazed by the band's music. Every prog band needs to listen to this song to understand the possibility of writing long instrumental songs without high technology. Slow songs add variety to the album. \"Trains\" is a beautiful song played with a sound guitar that sounds close to the Thanksgiving post on lavish drumming. And Wilson sings a wonderful voice. Music that you can think of. Her voice mourns my soul. It is full of enthusiasm and energy. They are one of the most progressive songs on the album, full of schizophrenic melodies, obsessive interplay, some electronics and catchy voices. Colin Edwin's bass is so important to these tracks that it's a bass that has the speed of singing. The \"strip of the soul\" includes a sense of oppression (hence the opiate element, in my opinion) and one of my favourites. I have a European version of this album which has a bonus disc with three tracks and a video. The songs are similar to anything written by Steven Wilson, so if you're a big fan of the Porcupine Tree, this version is highly recommended. I've been listening to this album never since it came out, and I'm still making it permanent.

Where \"Born To Do It\" hobbled from cliche to cliche and sounded as though it was put together by someone still feeling this way through the music business, \"Slicker Than Your Average\" is a much more adventurous offering. Two of the standout cuts there \"What's Your Flava?\" and \"Rise And Fall\" benefit considerably from Craig's discovery of (in the case of the former) creative metaphors to describe women (in this case, icecream flavours) and for the latter the discovery that there are other things to using about.\"Rise And Fall\" also demonstrates Craig's increasing maturity in that it features Sting on the chorus. Sting's experience as a songwriter - which is considerable, no matter what anyone wants to say about this work after The Police - is clearly visible throughout that track. One slight downside of Craig's maturation as a songwriter is the appearance of an expletive (well, that's what it's listed as in the lyrics, it's not exactly clear when the sings it) on the title track. No matter, a bit of swearing there and there never really hurt anybody and for an artist trying to present a slightly tougher image it's probably a sound move. The second event is that Craig David became a famous person in this own right. Where \"Born\" covered very predictable lyrical ground - women and parties - in a rather domestic fashion, \"Slicker\" throws Craig's new-found fame into the mix as well. On tracks like \"Eenie Meenie\", a relatively straightforward song about a relationship gone wrong, Craig is table to outline the perils the faces of girlfriends who have a \"gold-digger's degree\". Fame is also the subject of the title track, a protest at this treatment by those who claim that the's sold out to the RnB world - a criticism not entirely unjustified on \"Born To Do It\" alone. The third event was that garage music, Craig's musical base, became more recognisable as a viable style. The success of facts like the So Solid Crew and The Streets has fuelled a hunger for the sped-up beats of garage - and Craig (who was, after all, discovered by garage impresario The Artful Dodger) does't disappoint. He's always made the point that the in't just a garage act, but including a track entitled \"two Steps Back\" is a sure-fire clue that there'll be some of that about the place. That track delivers on the promise, but to some extent it suffers a bit in that the rest of the album promotes \"Craig David the RnB singer\" and \"Craig David the garage act\" seems a bit incongruous. Perhaps some garage influences throughout the album would have been a better decision. As an album, \"Slicker Than Your Average\" does the job competently and successfully. \"Flava\" and a handful of other tracks are strong enough for consideration as singles, and there are enough slower ballads to keep that sector of the audience happy. The musical backing has improved considerably since the skeletal tracks of \"Born To Do It\", improved to the point that \"Flava\" could almost be mistaken for an attempt at G-Funk at times. That quality is a considerable plus for \"Slicker\". Having listened to the hour's worth of music, though, it is hard to shake the belief that Craig is capable of more - as many of the remixes from \"Born To Do It\" demonstrate - and this is merely a foretaste of what the can do. That said, it's quite a good foretaste.","overall":4,"summary":"Getting there, still some unrealised potential","unixReviewTime":1042761600,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2003"}

Two of them are directly responsible, and the third is not so much. All three have benefited greatly from this album. The first is that Craig's writing is mature. \"You were born to do it\" goes from click\u00e9s to click\u00e9s. Sounds like it was filmed with people who still have an idea in the music industry. There are two great pieces out there \"What is your Flava?\" And the most important \"Rise and Fall\" that Craig found (in the previous case) describing women's design metaphors (in this case, the taste of nice cream), and finally, I discovered that there are other alternatives. \"Rise And Fall\" also showed Craig's growth as the added Sting to the choir. Sting\u2019s experience as a songwriter \u2014 anything anyone wants to say at work after \u201cPolice,\u201d is amazing \u2014 is evident throughout the song. One of Craig's minor shortcomings as a songwriter is the curse on the title track (yes, this is what is listed in the lyrics, and it is not clear when the will using it). In any case, some of the curses are present and have never hurt anyone, which would be a good act for the artist to try to portray a slightly more complex image. The second event is that Craig David became famous for this privilege. Where \"Born\" covers the most imaginative regions of lyricism - women and groups - in a family-like way, \"Slicker\" also includes Craig's new name. In songs such as \"Eenie Meenie,\" a simple song about abusive relationships, Craig is a table used to describe the dangers faced by girls with a \"Gold Digger degree.\" Fame is also the subject of the title track, which is a protest against the treatment of those who claim to have been sold by RnB World - criticism of \"Born To Do It\" but is completely absurd. The third festival is garage music, Craig's music foundation, which is becoming more and more popular as a functional style. The success of realities like So Solid Crew and Streets inspired people\u2019s desire to speed up the tempo of the garage \u2014 and Craig (later, found by garage manager Artful Dodger) did not disappoint. He always points out that it is not just a garage show, but also includes a track called \"Two Steps Back\", which indicates that there will be tracks in the area. The song has kept its promise, but to some extent it has been affected, as the entire album has inspired \"Craig David RnB Singer\" and \"Craig David Garage Behaeve\" which seem to be inconsistent. Maybe some garages from the whole album would be a better decision. As an album, your \"Slicker Than Aver Aver\" has done this job well. \"Flava\" and other songs are powerful enough to be considered solo, and there are songs slow enough to make this part of the audience happy. Since the orthopaedic song \"Born To Do It\", the music support has been greatly improved, and the development of \"Flava\" is sometimes almost as flawed as G-Funk's effort. This standard is very useful for \"Slicker\". However, after listening to the music for an hour, it\u2019s hard to shake Craig\u2019s belief in being table to do more \u2014 as many remixes in \u201cBorn To Do It\u201d have proven \u2014 this is what the can do as a sign of what\u2019s happening. In other words, this leads to progress.","overall":4,"summary":"Getting there, still some unrealised potential","unixReviewTime":1042761600,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2003"}

Two of them are directly responsible, and the third is not. The three have greatly benefited from this album. The first is Craig\u2019s mature text. While \u201cBorn To Do It\u201d jumps on the cliche to hit and sounds like it was joined by someone who still feels this way through the music business, \u201cSlicker Than Your Average\u201d is very fun. Two of those standing there interrupted \"What's your Flavaga?\" and \u201cRise And Fall\u201d greatly benefited from Craig\u2019s discovery of (in the case of the former) creative examples of depicting women (in this case, the taste of nice cream) and the latter\u2019s discovery with other using. \u201cRise And Fall\u201d also shows Craig\u2019s growing maturity which includes Sting in the chorus. Sting\u2019s experience as a poet - visibly, whatever one wants to say about this work after the Police - can clearly be seen that way. One of the small downsides of Craig\u2019s maturity in songwriting is the visual appearance (well, that\u2019s what the lyrics are about, it\u2019s not clear exactly when the sings) the title track. No problem, a little swearing there and there never hurt anyone, the artist trying to show a little solid picture is probably a sound motion. The second incident was Craig David\u2019s popularity. While \u201cBorn\u201d covers a predictable music scene - women and parties - in interior style, \u201cSlicker\u201d also gave Craig\u2019s new popularity into the mix. Streets like \u201cEenie Meenie\u201d, a live song about wrong relationships, Craig is at the table to illustrate the dangers faced by friends with \u201cgold mining degrees\u201d. Popularity is also the subject of the headline, a protest against this treatment of those who say they are sold out to the world of RnB - a criticism that is not entirely based on \u201cBorn To Be Made\u201d alone. The third event was that the music in the garage, Craig\u2019s music base, became recognizable in an accessible format. The success of realities like So Solid Crew and Roads has caused a hunger for garage hits - and Craig (who, after all, was found in the garage impresario The Artful Dodger) did\u2019t fail. He always says it\u2019s not just a garage action, but along with a track titled \u201ctwo steps back\u201d is a fire alarm signal that there will definitely be some in that area. That track offers promise, but to some extent the fact that the rest of the album is promoted by \u201cCraig David the RnB artist\u201d and \u201cCraig David garage action\u201d seems unsatisfactory. Maybe some of the garage effects throughout the album would be a better decision. As an album, \u201cSlicker Than Your Average\u201d does the job very well and successfully. \u201cFlava\u201d and the handful of other tracks are enough to be considered alone, and there\u2019s enough slow ballad to protect that segment of the audience. Musical support has improved drastically since the skeletal tracks of \u201cBorn To Do It\u201d, have improved to the point that \u201cFlava\u201d can be mistaken for G-Funk attempts at times. That quality is longer than \u201cSlicker\u201d. However, when you listen to the price of music on the clock, it\u2019s hard to dismiss the belief that Craig has great power - as many of the \u201cBorn To Do It\u201d remixes show - it\u2019s just a prediction of what the is. doing. with.

Two of them were directly responsible, the third not so much. All three benefited greatly from this album. First Craig's writing is solid.

There are two bright songs \"What is your fluva?\" And \"Rise and Fall\" benefited greatly from Craig's discovery (in the previous case) of creative metaphors to describe women (in this case, nice cream flavors) and finally the discovery that there were other things to use. \u06d4 \"Rise and Fall\" also shows Craig's growing growth. Sting's songwriting experience - great, no matter what you want to say about the work behind the scenes - is clearly seen throughout the song. A distraction from Craig's maturity as a songwriter is the appearance of insults on the title track (well, that's what's recorded as the lyrics, it's not clear when the sings it). No matter, the slightest insult there and there never bothered anyone, and an artist trying to paint a stronger picture can be a sensible move. The second story is about Craig David becoming such a celebrity. Where \"Born\" combines unexpected headlines - women and parties - domestically, \"Silker\" throws Craig's new fame into the conversation. In songs like \"Eenie Meenie\", a straightforward relationship song that does't go well, Craig is on the verge of endangering the faces of young women with \"Gold Degree Degrees\". Fame is also the subject of the song, protesting against the treatment of those who claim it has been sold by the RnB worldwide - a completely unfair critique of \"Born To Do It\" alone. The third incident was that the music in the garage, Craig's musical background, was widely regarded as a functional genre. The success of facts like Hundred Solid Crew and The Streets has exacerbated the shortage of sharp garage equipment - and Craig (who eventually found the Garage Empress Artifle Dodger) is not disappointed. He is saying that the garage game is not just a game, but the inclusion of a track titled \"Two Steps Back\" is a sure sign that there will be more to the place. That song is promising, but to some extent it hurts a bit because the whole album promoting \"Craig David the RNB Artist\" and \"Craig David the Garage Act\" seems out of place.

They have always been innovative, creative, and gone against the downward spiral that ship shop has been taking over the past few years. When I heard about the concept of Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below, I thought it was an excellent idea. Andre three thousand is one of the most underrated RAPPERS in ship shop, and Big Boi's is also very talented. Saying this, I have never been more disappointed in an album, never. Speakerboxxx is a decent album, but much less than I expected from Big Boi. I always thought the was capable of dropping a classic album by himself, but unfortunately the proves that the can't. After the masterful, socially conscious undertones that rules much of SouthernPlayalistic, I thought the would come up with something a little better than War, which is just an uninspired grant. That song encompasses my entire feeling of Speakerboxxx: it had the foundation, but the ideas never came out as excellent songs. Ghettomusik has the same kind of beat that made B. O. B. a classic, but lyrically it's just boring. Tomb Of the Boom makes me feel as if I'm listening to any other southern wrap record released in the past couple years. There are some strong moments on Speakerboxxx, though. \"The Way You Move\" is the way that the entire album should have been done: Laid back with a pinch of Outkast soul. Unwell, Knowing, and a track featuring Jay-Z and Killer Mike are the highlights of this disc. The Love Below is where the album just falls apart. As much as I'd love to say that I just don't understand Andre's disc, for that I don't like this kind of music so I can't really judge it, it's simply not true. The music the is TRYING to make is the music I love. Funk, Soul, with a little jazz thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately Andre just seems to be trying to be weirder than the really is. Hey Ya is meant to be a TRL crowd please, but actually ends up being extremely catchy. Happy Valentines' Day works, and Take Off Your Cool is absolutely stunning. But the rest is just too strange, and Dre just does not have the voice to pull something like this off. You'll have to struggle to get through songs like Love Hater, and the beat and hook for Spread is so unbearable that you can't get through it without reaching for the skip button. By the time you get to the excellent A Life In the Day of Andre (where the finally RAPS), you're ready to just burn the couple good songs onto the send of Speakerboxxx and throw The Love Below out the window.

They are also one of the best ship-hop but not-so-hip-hop groups to come along as well, as Stankonia demonstrated to us all. Within their heavy-hitting hit Ms. Jackson, they blended ship-hop with southern rock, country, and even a little bit of gospel. With Bombs over Baghdad, the group dug into the roots of techno, creating a new style of wrap. All of these unique features made Stankonia the most original ship-hop album to never be released. Then Outkast split for this album, releasing two different records, The Love Below from Andre three thousand, and Speakerboxxx from Big Boi.

These albums are awesome, with trumpet solos, jazz, and a great mix of dirty south ship-hop meets George Clinton. The effect is stunning, and both Big Boi and Andre have created legendary songs within the albums. The most well-known song on Big Boi's album is The Way You Move. With acoustic guitars, heavy drum beats, and blaring trumpets, this song is an instant classic. On The Love Below, Andre had this own hit, Hey Ya. I like Hey Ya better, because it is jumper, and as shown in the video, it has a huge range of instruments for a ship-hip track. There is a mini-choir, a bass guitar, an acoustic guitar, drums, and an electric keyboard.

While the evolution of Outkast as a group has lead to four classic albums, the groups MCs also evolved as individuals. Big Boi emerged as the conscious pimp, both representative and critic of the streets, while Dre began to focus on the more abstract and spiritual. With their latest release, each gets to express this individual vision on a solo disk, yet the results manage to stay within consistent evolution of the group. Big Boi: Speakerboxx - While many considered Dre the innovative half of the group, Speakerboxx proves that Big Boi is every bit the visionary that this more eccentric counterpart is. The production is an aural buffet, filled with funky horn riffs, driving electronic groves and soulful melodies which take southern wrap to a level of musicality it has never before seen. On top of it all, Big Boi's continued growth as an MC is evident throughout, whether the is waxing political (\"War\"), spiritual (\"Church\"), for simply bragging on this pimp game (\"Bowtie\"). And when placed along side the album's A-list guests in straight up spit fests, Big Boi manages to hold this own with the south's cameo king, Ludacris on \"Tomb of the Bomb\", and out shine Jay-Z on the ridiculously funky \"Flip Flop Rock\". And long time Outkast fans will be rewarded with a blast from the past on the contemplatively soulful \"Reset\", which uses the soulfully hairy minimalism of ATLiens, a perfect juxtaposition to the sonic circus that is the rest of the album rest of the album. Taken by itself, Speakerboxx would likely be the best ship-hop album of the year so far. Andre \"Ice Cold\" three thousand: The Love Below - Where Big Boi chose to push ship-hop forward on this disk, Andre's album reaches back to more fully explore the influences from other genres that made Outkast what it is. A concept album, which follows one man's trials and tribulations in the search for love, The Love Below bears more than a passing resemblance to Prince's Parade. The rollicking electro-funk of \"Happy Valentines Day\", the cheeky branch of \"Spread\" and the intentionally vague sexuality of \"She Lives in My Lap\" all draw liberally from the Purple One. But they also pull it off better than the legions of Prince imitators we have seen over the years. In fact, it could be said that Andre made has made the best Prince album in quiet some time. But a closer listen reveals that Dre is far from a one trick pony. The lingering ballad, \"Prototype\" is sublime, in spite of Dre's limited vocal range. \"Hey Ya\" begins as a campy, early Beatles inspired clark, but somehow evolve into a sublime mix of modern rock and classic funk\/soul. \"Roses\" and \"Dracula's Wedding\" are dark grooves that manage to be at once danceable and eerily brooding. And just when the listener is fully absorbed in Dre's new incarnation as a new-funkateer, the disk concludes with \"A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre\", a wrap track that sums up the stories of the album in a concise five minutes and makes us hope that even as the grows more eclectic, the never gives up rhyming.","overall":5,"summary":"Big Boi and Andre 3000: Two Sides of A Platinum Coin","unixReviewTime":1064448000,"reviewTime":"09 25, 2003"}

Most importantly, the continued growth of Big Boi as an MC is evident, either politically (\"war\"), spiritual (\"church\"), for just bragging about this pimp game (\"bow tie\").

Big Boi: Speakerboxx - While many consider Dre to be the creative part of the team, Speakerboxx has proven that Big Boi is every theory to be this super -equivalent.

Big Boi: Speakerboxx - While many see Dre as a new part of the team, Speakerboxx proves that Big Boi thinks it's a very clear partner. Produced at the Oral Buffet, full of funky horn riffs, electronic grooves and entertaining melodies that take the south wind to a level of music they have never seen before.

He featured on the track called \"When The Chips Are Down.\" He only dropped six bars but it was really hot. Then once I find out the's dropping an album I start searching the internet for info on this first single. Then once I found it, I listened to it. My first impression was, maybe this guy in't as good as I thought the was. I really was't impressed with all this, \"Fresh like, such; Impala, such\" type lyrics. But once this actual album was released I picked it up. After listening to the other tracks I realize that is way better than I thought the was. His flow, delivery, rhyme scheme and every thing was just on target. He had good and catchy choruses the whole way through which always helps. Dr. Dre, Just Blaze, Timbaland, Kanye West and Eminem all produce beats on the album. To be honest I really can't think of anything that is seriously wrong with this album. It keeps your interest the whole way through. The one thing Game needs to work on this repetitiveness. For instance, the made numerous references about this shoes, twoPac & Biggie, and the facts like the's the long lost member of N. W. A.one. Intro - Skittwo.

He appeared in a song called \"When Chips Down\". He lost only six bars, but it was really hot. Then, when I found out they were releasing an album, I started searching the Internet for information about it. I found it and listened. My first impression is that maybe this person is not as good as I thought. I was not impressed by all this, \"new, like this; Impala, like this\" kind of song lyrics. But when the real disc was released, I took it. After listening to some songs, I realized that it was much better than I had thought. Good speaking, speaking, rhyme and everything is fine. You have the right and skillful chorus in everything, which is always useful. Dr. Dre, Just Blaze, Timbaland, Kanye West and Eminem all produced beats on the album. Honestly, I can\u2019t think of any serious problems with this album. It allows your interest throughout the process. The game has to deal with this repetition. For example, they often mention shoes, both Pac and Biggie, and long-lost members of the new A. A. Introduction-Skittwo. Westside Story-five \/ Fri-This song is one of the best beats on the album produced by Dr. Dre. When fifty cents send up in the chorus. Three, the game will release three carefully packed verses.

Fifty cents is probably one of the best verses in this work, and the play is also poetic. The choir includes fifty cents and five factors in the play. Top-five \/ five-this song will make you jump. Bangin beats and famous vocals go along with the beautiful music. Drs. Dre in bits six. How We Make-Four \/ Fri-Loyalty Unmarried on the album. The decline in the game is good, but the words could be better, and fifty cents does a good job in this regard. This beat is very hot again, produced by Dr. Dre. Very good choir and song together. Seven. No need for your love \u2014 Four \/ Friday - This song is a good song. Faith Evans did a good job in the chorus. The play was about a past life and a shot before the agreement. Eight. Thug Church-five \/ Friday-Tug service by Just Blaze will surely make you full of energy. The beat will be bumpy, 'The chorus is lovely, the verse is hot. Nine.

A., for example, \"It's not a reward, but about the truth.\" The game could be better with this song. Fourteen. No-five \/ Friday-This is one of Eminem's best beats. The game is hard on honest verses. Going in with a choir is like saying, 'We don't go to great lengths,' we have nowhere to go, then you. Eminem used this to destroy the true verses of the game. They have rumours that Eminem is a ghost writer in the third fifteenth quarter of the Game. Where I come from four \/ Fri-Slow. Nate Dogg sang as usual. The game puts the appropriate verses in it. Sixteen. Special-Friday \/ Friday-I love this song. The choir was very attractive, and Game used an intricate syllabus to erase beautiful verses. This could be one of the best songs on the album. Seventeen. Don't worry four \/ Friday-I don't like all singing, but it does't matter. The play did a good job in this category as usual, Mary J. Blige sang most of the songs. Eighteen. As a dad, as a son of five \/ Fri - this is easily because it is my favourite thing on the album. Busta Rhymes does a good job of chorus. The game runs during the birth of the child. He talked about everything about this idea and what the did. This is a great way to complete a disc.

Another factor that eventually led me to write this review was when I saw that the average rating dropped to four. Five stars. I don\u2019t want to shout at something as trivial as amazon ratings (the average ratings on this site are very confusing for five visual releases), but I have to say what sets the five-star this album apart from five. For one thing, Andrew Bird is really a rare gift. As an factor alone, the is not alone in showing talent, but the is a tangible and real factor. He is a singer, violinist, guitarist, vocalist and of course a great flute player. His ability to manage many talents is evident in the beautiful itunes of the songs that fill \u201cHidden Production\u201d. Many artists seem to prioritize themselves and their abilities when they have such a gift, but Birds does nothing. Each of the fourteen songs on this album are digestible, passionate songs. They love to dance with humour and fun so it\u2019s sad and fun - they help to make this album easier to listen to without getting tired. All of these aspects also make it clear that Andrew Bird has not forgotten the rejection part of ALBUM making, rather than collecting singles and fillers. To describe this album in one piece; sound music of orchestral songs due to the hard combination of guitar and violin; the sounds are very rich and varied, coming from all the depths of the orchestral group as a whole; Words are poetry and drama, but not poetry; the sound is as rich as chocolate and one of the best among modern artists; the hooks are very beautiful and attractive to the best of their ability. I would rate this album nine.three \/ ten.eber, and would recommend it to any adult music fan. It was great that you listened to my advice as I was given my rank as a respected fifteen year old musician. Haha. I may be dark for years, but it won\u2019t take long to recognize the dignity and greatness of \u201cHidden Production Eggs\u201d. A small album of two thousand and five can compete.","overall":5,"summary":"intricate and satisfying","unixReviewTime":1162512000,"reviewTime":"11 3, 2006"}

I think it's different and amazing, especially lovedisc two. Why all the complaints so this is a soft side of Kate Bush. This is exactly what I expect from Kate Bush. When \"Aerial\" was released, I was in no hurry to buy it. I\u2019ve seen a bunch of expected comments and they\u2019ll be serious about any KB album, except for the quality, because it\u2019s Kate. I have read some comments written by adults, saying that they are non-existent, like a goddess returning with a work of part. No sorry. That is still a dream. While Aerial may not be completely disappointed, some people may look forward to it after many years, but this does not bring it back. Now, it could be added to the album. There are so many amazing songs on the album, and Kate's voice still works, unlike other older sisters (poor Susie). He still has a knack for composing amazing songs, though most of them are about the size of a middle-aged voice. Bad songs are clear and painful, and last longer than necessary. Tori Amos tried to mimic Kate Bush's work but ended in failure. On the air, we asked Kate to reciprocate everyone\u2019s admiration for the scary Tori Amos that sounded like \u201cJoanne\u201d. \"I'm a little spit on\", anyone? I can't get in Mr. Barto-lousy ',' Bertie 'also stands for' Pi '. On the bright side, some of the tracks are very fun and amazing. These include the mournful \"Coral House\" and the easy-to-understand songs \"King of the Mountain\" and \"How to Be an Invisible Person\". Kate even managed to make some of the longer songs more interesting, including \"sunset\" and \"Nocturne\". The closest thing to a crazy old Kate is the song titled \"Aerial\". An astonishing number of high and low is close to limitation, with a forced laughter in the middle of the song. I love that Kate is crazy while trying to keep life normal. Although I agree, it has transcended the whole bird theme in some songs. And even though as a two-person album, I give Aerial three stars, if the one I mentioned is released as one album, it certainly deserves five stars. After all, Kate's new music is good, but it's not enough to make me casually praise it as the best thing she never did. While it may not be this best album yet, it is worth having.","overall":5,"summary":"i think this is a great CD","unixReviewTime":1305763200,"reviewTime":"05 19, 2011"}

The album features a promising opening with \"Leap of Innocence\" and \"Stars and Planets\" Powered alternative rock. Well, unfortunately, not this time.

What is still stored in iTunes is huge. Yes, there are filters on this CD, but there are also good jones. \"I Found My Thing\" is a beautiful song, sounding like Sheryl Crow. \"Things that depend on me\" is a good sentence \"I'll be by your side.\" Songs, but if I don\u2019t know what CD I\u2019m listening to, I would swear I heard about Ashlee Simpson there (yes, I know .: X). \"Everything about Me\" (I heard it, and finally heard iTunes) is an unfortunate send to a relationship, probably not. The beat is good, though rustic, some fans of rock pop music may be upset in the middle. \"Lost Tonight\" is definitely another option, with great guitar songs (yes. Didn't I tell you how big Liz is?) And songs, and \"Giving It All To You\". However, there are a large number of fillers that can damage the CD. From cheesecakes (\"stars and planets\") to show that Liz can't do traditional songs (\"near you\", \"man\"), my favourite AAA rock song, nowhere other than my playlist Go (\"Jump Innocent\", \"Spirit\" and the Mountain \u201d). Songs, commercial waste. \"I love you, I love you, guess what, I love you !!!\". Well, not bad, but you get the idea. I said when I heard \"make my coffee. Drink my coffee\", I was completely cold. In the \"One Table\". Fifty cents would do better (I did not mention how weak is fifty cents?). \"Everything to Me\" is a beautiful song, but \"You can never be so real to me? Luckily I found hell.\" I thought, WT F? Or \"Man's Miracle\", when the interprets this love as a myth, there. Do not. Liz Phair is eventually sold on a permanent basis. Will it change?

It was back in two thousand and six. It was't when I first listened to this album--because on first listen, I only liked it. But that was only because I was't quite ready for it. Before long, it drove me nuts. I was bonkers, I went saga-ga, I lost myself in irrational exuberance. It's a hoary click\u00e9 to say something was \"the soundtrack to my summer,\" but this click\u00e9 rings true for this album, for my two thousand and six was very manic-depressive. I lost a good job and a bad one, then found one that was both. I was desperately poor but often incredibly happy; I spent many unemployed afternoons at the neighbourhood coffeeshop hammering away at what I hoped would be the Great American Screenplay, and I gave serious thought to moving to Los Angeles with a U-Haul and my lego to try and sell it. I was in love with the cute nineteen-year-old barista, and I'd take smoke breaks with her and hang out with mutual friends at night, and we'd put on \"St. Elsewhere\" back-to-back, and I'd sip sober sodas while my friends got drunk and did crazy things. And usually I had no desire to live that life again, but every once in a while, that level of insanity looked fun. Vaguely I knew my own decisions and attitudes were none too wise. But fortunately there was an album that felt as crazy as I did.\"Crazy\" of course, ended up being this album's anthem. And it is a true classic, a song for the pages, and it has learned its rightful place on the eternal-DJ-wedding-playlist, somewhere after \"Baby's Got Back\" and \"Billie Jean.\" So I'll probably be dancing to it in my eighties, shaking my moneymaker and saying \"I remember when I lost my mind\" until I do, literally, close my mind. But I must admit, \"Crazy\" almost drove me mad, because it distracted people from an album that is every bit as solid as its most famous song. Most great albums get that way by having a reasonably consistent feel. This one blacks one; it careens across the sonic landscape like a dune-buggy being driven by an over-caffeinated ferret. There are glorious Gospel-tinged melodies, heavenly and happy and reasonably wholesome, and there are also dark and sinister songs like \"Monster\" and \"Online.\" And then there's \"Necromancer.\" I'm tempted to say it's as outrageous a black comedy as anything since Guns in' Roses' \"I Used to Love Her (But I had to Kill Her)\"--but that would be unfair, because this is a much better song. In it, Cee-Lo craps about (and to) a beautiful corpse-bride. \"Did you hear what I said? With this bring I thee wed,\" the says, then comments: \"She was cool when I met her, but I think I like her better dead.\"There are times when the wordplay in't quite as brilliant, but a lot of the less crafty lyrics are at least (for most of us!) easier to relate to. And best of all, Danger Mouse's beats are consistently compelling. \"It's clearly the theory of less is more,\" Cee-Lo says on \"Feng Shui,\" but there more is more; the album's so sonically schizophrenic that you can--and you will--listen to it back-to-back without feeling like it's boring you. And that's quite a feat. With a lot of other artists, even excellent jones, I will close interest somewhere around the fifty-minute mark, look around for something different, and come back to their work whenever I get around to it. But back in two thousand and six, it seemed like every third for fourth time I'd put something on, it was \"St. Elsewhere.\"Anyway, now it is two thousand and weight, and rather than being a relatively irresponsible late-twentysomething, I'm a relatively responsible thirtysomething. The coffeeshop has become a Mediterranean eatery, the barista is gone from my life--but not my cell phone--and I've gone through any number of other crazy infatuation since then. California remains the golden dream while I while away the days in snowy Chicago, waiting tables and writing the Great American Novel and waiting for the day I can sell it. And Gnarls Barkley have a new album, and I don't think it's destined for immortality, but at least I can still seek intercession from \"St. Elsewhere.\" It blew me away in two thousand and six, and I can still listen to it twice without giving the matter a second thought, and I have the feeling it'll be just as good in two thousand and sixteen, for two thousand and fifty-six.","overall":5,"summary":"I remember when I lost my mind!

I lost my job and had a hard time, and I found a job with both of them. I am very poor, but always very happy; I spent a lot of inactive afternoons at a nearby coffee shop. I hope it\u2019s a great American script. it. I fell in love with this beautiful nineteen-year-old barista. I would hang out with him, spend time with friends at night, play \"St. Elsewhere\" and go back, even when my friend was drunk. and madness When things go wrong, I will drink soda soda. Normally I don\u2019t want to live that kind of life again, but every once in a while, that level of madness seems interesting. I am unaware that my decision and attitude are not wise. Fortunately, having a record sounds crazy like me. Certainly, \"Crazy\" eventually became the album's main song. This is a real song, and it has found its place on the DJ's never-ending wedding playlist, somewhere after \"The Baby Is Back\" and \"Billie Jean\". So I can dance with it in my eighties, shake my cash machine and say \"I remember when I lost my mind\" until I did, literally, shut up my mind. But let me admit that \"Crazy\" almost confused me because it distracts people from a solid album like its famous song. Most of the great albums are achieved with a sense of consistency. This one is black and the other one; driven by caffeinated ferret like a dune truck in soundscape. There are songs with glorious gospel color, heavenly bliss and good health, and there are dark and cruel songs like \"monster\" and \"internet\". Then there is the \"Necromancer\". I really want to say this is a funny black joke never since \"Gun in Rose\" I've always loved (but I've had to kill him) \"- but it's not right because it's a better song. In it, Cee-Lo craps (and) the bride of a beautiful corpse.\" Did you hear what I said? With this, I married you, \"they said, and then commented:\" She was cool when I met her, but I think I love her more dead. \" The beat of the Mouse Accident is always interesting. \"This is obviously a very small theory,\" Cee-Lo told \"Feng Shui\", but more; Many, even the best Jones, would be interested in somewhere for about fifty minutes, looking at different things, going back to their jobs as long as I had time. , two thousand and six and hardship, not latex - twenty, I the is the most responsible person. The coffee shop became a Mediterranean restaurant, and the barista disappeared from my life - but my phone has not been found and many other crazy things since. While I spent time in snowy Chicago, California is still a golden dream, waiting for a table and writing great American novels and waiting for the day when I can sell it. And Gnarls Barkley has a new album, I don't think the'll die, but at least I can still ask to be prayed for \"in St. Petersburg\". two thousand and sixteen has blown me away, I can still listen twice without thinking about it, and I feel like it will be as good as two thousand and sixteen, two hundred and fifty-six.","overall":5,"summary":"I remember when I lost my mind!

Recently, the took me to peanuts. I breathed a sigh of relief, I went into the saga, lost myself in unimaginable joy. It\u2019s an exciting one to listen to something called \u201cmy summer sound,\u201d but this click is true for this album, my two thousand and six failed. I lost a good job and a bad job, then I got one for both. I was very hard but mostly surprisingly happy; I spent many idle nights at a local coffee shop throwing away what I hoped would be American Screenplay, and I seriously considered moving to Los Angeles with U-Haul and Lego to try to sell it. I love the good teaching of nineteen year holds, and I go with my friends at night, put them on the back to back \u201cSt. Wherever\u201d, and I drink conscious soda.

But I have to admit, \u201cCrazy\u201d almost drove me crazy, because it kept people busy with each album as hard as the most popular song. Most large albums find that way with a sense of constant consistency. This one is black; it\u2019s interested in the overall sonic look as a dune-buggy driven by more ferret-caffeine. There's a melody of glorious Gospel songs, heaven's fun and reasonably healthy, and there's also dark and evil songs like \"Monkey\" and \"Online.\" Then there's \"Necromancer.\" I try to say that she is as bad as a black comedian like everything since Guns in 'Roses' \"I loved her (But I have to kill her)\" - but that would be unfair, because this is a very good song. .

And most of all, beating Dangerous Mouse continues to attract attention. \u201cObviously the view is a little more,\u201d Cee-Lo says in \u201cFeng Shui,\u201d but there\u2019s more; The album is so schizophrenic that you can - and will - listen to it without getting bored. And that is tangible. With many other artists, even the best jones, I would close my interest near the fifty minute mark, look around for something different, and return to their work whenever I approach. But at two thousand and six, it seemed three times to the fourth time I posted something, it was \"St. Elsewhere.\" However, now I am two thousand pounds, and instead of being irresponsible late-twenty, I am very responsible for thirty things. The coffee shop has become a Mediterranean seafood restaurant, teaching has been lost in my life - but not my cell phone - and I\u2019ve experienced a number of other crazy loves since then. California will be the golden dream when I\u2019m not on snowy days in Chicago, waiting at tables and writing the American Big Book waiting for the day I can sell.

That is, until now. After Thorgerson\u2019s success on Muse\u2019s previous album Absolution (including confused underground characters not covered by ethereal shadows), the three Devons once again called on Thorgerson to wear a sleeve for Black Holes and Revelation as a hero. with a view as internal music. Based on biblical and conspiracy theories, the following picture of the engineering powers of the global struggle in the Mars desert is colourful, detailed and superior. Perfect, therefore, as at the sight of a massive album with Mr. Snuffleupagus. In Dark Holes and Revelation, Moses finally found the musical energy to satisfy their intense ambition for the entire album. While Absolution marked the house directly, this time Moses won the ride on a suffering horse. Opening Arrow finds Muse maestro Matt Bellamy engraved on this keyboard as Phantom Of The Opera aware that Armageddon is near and beloved every minute, screaming at criminals who are about to burn in Hell and cling to corruption of the world. From the very beginning of the bombshell, it got bigger and bigger. Supermassive Black Hole is fun and worthy of its own electronic dance, Starlight is an emotional and beautiful point for everything Muse has never done before and Map Of The Problematique offers an introduction to Depeche Style , drums and series. The guitar cut is intense. Another area is kitchen time, as every device, production method and style of music rises to achieve all they have done. Not only was Muse enough to steal the name of one of Coldplay\u2019s best songs, they also provided their policy of injecting cables into the Middle East, Mexican horns and bassline that seemed to be imported directly from Atlantis. . Using the spirit of vocalist John Williams and the Queen promising extra work, Moses created a huge album based on the complexity of the coming revolution and fall of humanity. All the best in the new Pink Floyd.","overall":5,"summary":"Their most eclectic album to date","unixReviewTime":1159142400,"reviewTime":"09 25, 2006"}

Like \"Yankee Beyonc\" \", a love song between two different couples behind the American Revolution. Apostolic fashion is also done - and Melloy and Laura Veer meet. It must be as disturbing as hell, and it seems. It's just that they're just trying hard to do it, but somehow it turns out to be successful, and even better. So go for the whole album. These words ( \"curlews record their arabesque\" -!) saved it the most never. The band includes a wide range of instruments - glucanspell, strong and harmful - but they can match it to a particular song context, rather than throw it away. Although the most common but clever method is sometimes found compared to the Neutral Milk Hotel, it is clear how different the two bands are. For one thing, Melloy in't an insight (like NMH founder Jeff Mangam), but the's a good novelist for March. Maybe one day Meloye will open the great American novel, but until then, this well-crafted drawing of the characters works well for him. I hope that in the future they will somehow be table to maintain their desire and make memorable songs. Naturally, I also hope they don't give up their style of reselling. One of the songs there, \"Valencia,\" has unconventional music like Kink's \"Victoria\" and will impress like a well-crafted college effort. The song, however, is a love of \"Romeo and Juliet\" that will be destroyed by violence, which is nothing but pure melody. Although I can see why so many people are fed up with their Fe, Anglophilic sensitivity, I think they are at least somewhat helpful. Also, the album is a must, in which beautiful songs are stopped by blue melodies. Although sometimes it seems like the team wants you to tell them their mistakes against humility, even though they try very hard to use it. And let me tell you, if you think Melloy's sharp, greedy voice is hot, I'll make it sound like Barry White!","overall":5,"summary":"The Decemberists do \"major label\" right","unixReviewTime":1161302400,"reviewTime":"10 20, 2006"}

It's a pure demonstration of what makes this band so unique: their ability to tell amusing for affecting stories within the context of a pop song (and to find endless ways to work in crossword puzzle words like \"parallax,\" \"ziggurat\" and \"fontanele\"). Their songs are by turns tuneful, eccentric, amusing, moving, literate, obscure and most often just plain memorable - unlike anything you're likely to hear on the radio for as background for a car commercial.

Once Dem Franchize Boyz came out with there white tees and Lean Wit It Rock Wit, you know it was going downhill. There are too much stupid is*** coming out from the south mainly because of all the dances there making up now. Theres a freaking new dance coming out too quickly, while there are still good south wrappers like OutKast, UGK, Scarface, Lil' Wayne there are about five times as many crappy wrappers in the south than there is any good wrappers. And not only the south but also the Bay Area (my area) as much as I love the Bay, there are too much crappy artists than there are good, its a real shame. I mean its a good thing too have diversity in Hip Hop but this is way too much of the same, if its not about money and girls, its about a new dance there trying to put out in the mainstream. It's Truly Horrible, but at least we still have artists that are still true the the roots of Hip Hop like Nas, Common, KRS-One, Rakim, Kanye West, The Game, DMX and so on. Now for the album, with so much controversy over Nas about Hip Hip dying there were so many speculations about this album, Like is this album gonna help bring back Hip Hop for Is it another Illmatic etc. But I have to say that this album is the best I've Heard in a while. There is a lot of good material there that you can't miss out on. Nas as always spits well on each and every track its too bad that the productions could't be better. The productions on this album is okay but only about half of it is good. This album has a good balance of guest appearances, there are wrappers like Jay-Z (is old rival), The Game, Kanye West, Snoop Dogg, Will.i.am, Tre Williams, Kelis (his wife), Marsha from Floetry & Chrisette Michele. Its kind of having two thousand and six's best wrappers on one album. Get This Album. MY FAVORITE TRACKS--------------------------------------------one)Hip Hop Is Dead feat. Will.i.am - the title song is one of the best on the album. Shows how hungry Nas is right now, ironicly having a rock-ish beat instead of a traditional Rap beat. Nas tells it like it is and proves how Hip Hop is dying.two)Black Republican feat. Jay-Z - The collabo everyone been waiting for, there really no better to debut there new reconciliation with a strong track, the title itself should really catch your attention. The Godfather mafia type beat is sick as hell, honestly it could have been a all bit better but beggars can't be choosers.three)Still Dreaming feat. Kanye West - One of my favourite songs, the beat is so relaxing and play back, Kanye & Nas spit exceptionally well. But the thing special about this track is Chrisette Michele's amazing voice, she has which an amazing voice it; is like a breath of fresh air.four)Can't Forget About You feat. Chrisette Michele - The second single off the album, the song is great with \"Unforgettable\" lyrics by Nas. Amazing singing by Chrisette Michele doing a sample by Nat King Coles \"Unforgettable\". Great Song.five)Play On Playa feat. Snoop Dogg - A lot of people don't really like this song, but I can't really see why, the beat is so gangsta and Snoop brings a much appreciated flavor to everything. I guess its because of the beat by Scott Storch, the beat could put you to sleep. But Nas and Snoop spit fire on this track.six)Hustlers feat. The Game - A beat produced by Dr. Dre, of know its a classic. The Game shines on this more than Nas but still good lyricism by Nas. This song has the best of the album on it and it does; it hurt to have the Doctor's Advocate.","overall":5,"summary":"You Know He's Right......","unixReviewTime":1187049600,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2007"}

And you ignorant people can face the fact that Hip-Hop is dying, not just because of certain genres of music, but also everything in Hip Hop. Once Dem Franchize Boyz released a white T-shirt with Lean Wit It Rock Wit, you knew it was going to go down. There are a lot of idiots coming out from the south, mainly because the local dances are now painted. There\u2019s an awesome new dance that is coming up fast. Not only in the south, but also in the Bay Area (where I live), as I love the Bay, there are worse artists than good artists, which is really a shame. I mean, the Hip Hop diversity is also a good thing, but it's very similar. This is very bad, but at least we still have artists like Nas, Normal, KRS-One, Rakim, Kanye West, Game, DMX, etc. Now with this album, there is a lot of controversy over Nas's death of Hip Hip, and there are a lot of ideas about this album, as this album will help bring back Hip Hop by another Illmatic and so on. But I have to say that this album is the best I've never heard in a while. There are so many good things you can't miss.

Michel. It has two thousand and six best folding sheets on the disc. Get this album. My favourite song -------------------------------------------- one) Ihip jumping is a death knell. Will.i.am-The title song is one of the best songs on the album. To show how hungry Nas is now, oddly enough, the uses rock beats instead of wrap. Nas tells for sure and confirms how Hip Hop died. two) The work of the Black Republic party. Jay-Z-The collaboration that everyone expects, there really is no better reconciliation and a stronger track to start, the topic itself should grab your attention. The rhythm of the godfather mafia is sickening to death. Honestly, it would have been better, but the beggars have no choice. C) A dream job. Once West \u2014 one of my favourite songs, the beat is relaxing and playful, Kanye and Nas spit very well. But the special thing about this song is the amazing voice of Chrisette Michele, she has an amazing voice; it is like breathing fresh air. Four) Don't forget your game. Chrisette Michele-The second single on the album, Nas's \"Unforgettable\" words are sweet. Chrisette Michele played Nat King Coles' beautiful song \"Unforgettable\". Great song. five) Play on Playa feat. Snoop Dogg \u2014 A lot of people don\u2019t like this song, but I don\u2019t understand why beating is such a thing, and Snoop brings a special flavor to everything. I think because of Scott Storch's rhythm, rhythm will make you fall asleep. But Nas and Snoop are shining on this path. six) Hustlers feat. A game-beating game created by Dr. Dre, who knows it's a classic. The game is brighter than Nas in this regard, but Nas's words are still very good. This song contains some of the best songs on the album, and it's true; it hurts to have a doctor's spokesperson.","overall":5,"summary":"You Know He's Right......","unixReviewTime":1187049600,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2007"}

So all you idiots are just experiencing the truth, Hip-Hop is not just dying for the kind of music that comes out but everything Hip Hop. Once Dem Franchize Boyz comes out with white tea and Lean Wit It Rock Wit, you know it\u2019s down. A lot of stupidity is coming out in the south because of all the dancing today. There\u2019s an exciting new dance coming out fast, while there are still some great recordings in the south like OutKast, UGK, Scarface, Lil \u2019Wayne there are about five times more than those crappy recordings to the south than a good recording. Not only in the south but also in the Bay area (my area) as I love the Bay, there are more artists than the good jones, it's a pity. I mean it\u2019s very good it also has Hip Hop variations but it\u2019s a lot the same way, if it\u2019s not about money and women, it\u2019s about a new dance from there that happens and tries to produced in general. It's really scary, but at least we still have real Hip Hop artists like Nas, Common, KRS-One, Rakim, Kanye West, The Game, DMX and more. Now with the album, with a lot of controversy about Nas about Hip Hip dying there is a lot of speculation about this album, Like will this album help to bring back Hip Hop for Illmatic otherwise it is not. But I have to say that this album is the best I\u2019ve heard in a while. There are so many great things you can\u2019t miss. Nas as usual to spit properly with every trace of it is so bad that the product cannot be good. The release of this album was good but only half of it was good. This door has a nice balance of guest looks, with recordings like Jay-Z (former rival), The Game, Kanye West, Snoop Dogg, Will.i.am, Tre Williams, Kelis (his wife), Marsha from Floetry and Christette Michele. It\u2019s like having two thousand and six best recordings on one album. Hel Albumkan. MY FAVORITE SEARCH ---------------------------------------------- -----isa) Hip Hop Is Dead feat. Will.i.am - The title song is the best on the album. It shows how hungry Nas is right now, surprisingly beating the rocks instead of the traditional wrap beat. Nas told the same story and explained how Hip Hop dies.two) Black Republican feat. Jay -Z - Collaboration that everyone is waiting for, there is really nothing better than the beginning of that new reconciliation with a solid path, the title itself should really attract your attention. Defeating the Godfather type mafia is spain of hell, it\u2019s actually better than anything but beggars can\u2019t be voters. Kanye West - One of my favourite songs, The Beating is a very relaxing and replay, Kanye & Nas spit in particular. But what\u2019s special about this track is Christette Michele\u2019s amazing voice, with that amazing voice; it is like a breath of fresh air.afar) Can't Forget About feat. Christette Michele - Second door, very good song with Nas\u2019s memorable songs. Chrisette Michele\u2019s amazing songs that make Nat King Coles \u2019example\u201c unforgettable \u201d. Heesta Wanaagsan.five) Play On Playa feat. Snoop Dogg - A lot of people don\u2019t really like this song, but I can\u2019t really see why, the beat is gangsta and Snoop everything brings an appreciated taste. I think because of Scott Storch\u2019s beating, the beat could have fallen asleep. But Nas and Snoop spit in this path.six) Hustlers feat. Game - Dr. Hit. Dre, who knows that's normal. The game shines brighter than this Nas but it\u2019s good literature for Nas. This song has the best album and says; It hurts to have a Doctor Advocate.","overall":5,"summary":"You Know He's Right......","unixReviewTime":1187049600,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2007"}

So all of you ignorant people face only reality, ship shop is not just about some kind of outgoing music but everything about ship shop. Once the Dam franchise boys came out with white tires and Lian Whitt at Rock Whitt, you know it's going down. A lot of idiots are coming out of the South, mainly because of all the existing dances. A great new dance is coming soon, while there are still some great Southern wrappers like Outcast, UGK, Scarface, Lil Wayne. There are probably five times more wrappers than any beautiful wrapper in the South. And not just in the South, but in the Bay Area (my place) as much as I love Bay, there are a lot of artists who are more crazy than good, real shame. I mean a good thing and a variety of ship shop but it's very similar, if not about money and girls, it's about a new dance that is trying to emerge from the mainstream.

Great to remember. Nass, as there is always a scent on every track, is so bad that this product would not be better. The composition of this album is good but almost part of it.

It shows how hungry Nas is right now, surprisingly wrap culture is killing rock cash instead of wrap. Nass has said the same thing and proves how ship shop dies. JZ - A collaboration that everyone expects is nothing better than a new reconciliation with a strong song, the title itself should get your attention. Godfather mafia type rhythm is sick, to be honest it would be better but beggars can't choose. Three) Steel Dream Fat.

But the special thing about this song is the amazing voice of Cresset Michelle, she has an amazing voice. Like fresh air.ezine) can't forget about your accomplishments. Crescent Michelle - Single out of the album, the song is great with Nass's \"unforgettable\" melodies. Chrisette Michele's amazing singing made Nat King Coles an example of \"unforgettable\". Ingoma Emnandi.five) Play on Playa's exploits. Snoop Dogg - A lot of people don't really like this song, but I don't really see why, the rhythm of gang and snoop brings out the best in everything. I think because of Scott Storch's rhythm, the rhythm can put you to sleep. But Nas and Snoop spit on the song. Drama - Rhythm produced by the doctor. Fear, who knows you're old. The game is featured in this over the top Nas but still interesting Nas songs. This song is the best of the album and it does; Being a doctor's lawyer was painful.","overall":5,"summary":"You Know He's Right......","unixReviewTime":1187049600,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2007"}

Williams \"John\"","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"Brimming with heartbreak, solitude, and foggy memories, Feist's \"dreams\" still sound distant on The Reminder, the singer's outstanding third album. Mostly written on the road, the new LP gets its inspiration from the disconnections of non-stop, intercontinental hotel-jumping. Talking about her ephemeral lifestyle in an interview with Pitchfork last year, Feist said, \"You just never set roots; you take pleasure in simple conversations, because you know you're not going to have much more than that.\" Though she's trekked on her own and with bands including By Divine Right and Broken Social Scene for more than a decade, the thirty-one-year-old songwriter sounds desperate for something more than \"simple conversation\" there. Unlike the half-covers\/half-original split of Let It Die, every song but one was at least co-written by Feist on The Reminder. (And her buzzing take on the traditional playground using-along \"Sea Lion Woman\" makes it distinctively Feist-ian anyway.) Whereas her last album's smoothed-out eclecticism could be both daunting and empty, The Reminder is equally diverse yet more full-blooded. From the indie pop of \"I Feel It All\" to the creeping electro-ballad \"Honey Honey\", the album rambles effortlessly; its musical palette is wide enough to stave off repetition yet innate enough to offer an intense cohesiveness. The record's keen combination of off-the-cuff production and no-fat songwriting is likely linked to its method: With several songs whittled down over years of performances, Feist-- aided by her usual one-named conspirators Gonzales and Mocky, along with Jamie Lidell and others-- recorded them in less than a week in a manor outside Paris. Fleeting touches from horns, glockenspiel, makeshift choirs, and other subtle accoutrements never announce themselves ostentatiously. Instead, the LP relies on a modest refinement that breaks with current singer-songwriter trends that promote infinite ambition in lieu of the basics-- melody, arrangement, feeling. Hardly the first singer-songwriter to love, live, close, and remote, Feist once again elevates herself above countless other diary-keeping tunesmith with a voice that could make even Dick Cheney sweep. Marked by specks of Dusty Springfield's soul, Bj\u00f6rk's confrontational adventurousness, and Joni Mitchell's warmth, the singular allure of Feist's vocals is difficult to deny for overstate. You might hear her over cappuccino-machine hisses in Starbucks, but her direct-line moans easily cut through the biscotti muzak. And on The Reminder, her whisper-to-wail control-- exemplified by stark heart-tuggers \"The Water\" and \"Intuition\"-- is even more striking than before.\"With sadness so real that it populates the city and leaves you homeless again,\" coos Feist on \"The Park\", a desolate, lovelorn lament. The song-- with its references to a relationship torn by distance, omnipotent nature (a carefree bird can be heard mocking Feist's sadness in the background), and a hazy \"past\" that offers partly-forgotten flickers and flashes-- is a fitting summary of The Reminder's wounded pleas. Leery of a sixth sense, the songstress concludes \"Intuition\" with a question, \"Did I miss out on you?\"-- its insolubility packing more cache than a hundred clear-cut break-up songs. Such eternally spotty \"what if?\" queries need't always strike such odour chords. On the shaggy, Broken Social Scene-esque romp \"Past to Present\", the refrain (\"There's so much past inside my present\") has the singer embracing yesteryear with a proud vitality. But no matter where she sits on love's teeter-totter-- down on the after-the-fact apology of \"I'm Sorry\" for aloft in heady infatuation on \"Brandy Alexander\"-- her philosophy-of-self is sound. After inconclusively trifling though her personal history for twelve songs, Feist finally seems to reach an Emersonian transcendence on finale \"How My Heart Behaves\": \"I'm a stem now. fanning my yellow eye,\" she sings over wafting piano and sharp. Though the song reads like a zen tutorial to her own unsettled emotions, it still finishes with a query: \"What grew and inside who?\" What she's referring to in't exactly clear-- and that's the point. Pasts pass. People stay, go. But finding sanctuary within half-realized dreams and faces? Timeless.","overall":5,"summary":"A Classic!","unixReviewTime":1218672000,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2008"}

Williams \"John\"","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"Filled with heartache, loneliness and vague memories, Feist's \"dream\" still sounds far from the artist's third best album. Largely written on the road, the new LP is drawing inspiration from the intercontinental Hotel that never stops jumping. In an interview with Pitchfork last year, Feist said of this short life, \u201cYou never had a root; you like simple conversations because you know you won't have them. \u201d Although the had been travelling alone for more than a decade. , And tours with groups include By Divine Right and Broken Social Scene, but the thirty-one-year-old songwriter seems interested in more than just \u201ceasy conversations\u201d there. Unlike Let It Die's semi-cover \/ semi-original split, every song except at least one song was written by Fist at Memorial. (In any case, the \"wife of the lion of the sea\" buzzing in the usual playground makes it different.) Although the smooth eclecticism of her last album may be shocking and insignificant, the memory is equally different, but especially complete bleeding. From the indie pop music \"I Feel All\" to the creepy electronic ballad \"Honey Honey\", this album is powerless; Its music palette is wide enough to prevent repetition, but it is enough to provide a strong connection. The skillful combination of this record of improvement and writing non-greasy songs can be attributed to its style: Feist has cut a few songs over the years - with the help of this regular mentors Gonzales and Mocky of the same name, and Jamie Leigh. Jamie Lidell and others \u2014 they recorded on a manor outside Paris in less than a week. Touching horns, crayons, temporary choirs and other delicate instruments do not show. Instead, LP relies on humble improvement, breaking the current meanings of the artist-songwriter, which promotes unwavering ambitions rather than the basics - music, refinement, emotion. Feist is not the first singer-songwriter to love, live, intimacy, and diversity. Characterized by the fragments and fragments of Dusty Springfield's soul, Bj\u00f6rk's spirit of dealing with Joni Mitchell's warmth, Feist's unique singing appeal is undoubtedly exaggerated. You can hear him blowing on the Starbucks cappuccino machine, but this direct whining can easily get into Biscotti Muzak. And at the Memorial, this work ethic \u2014 taking \"water\" and \"intuition\" as examples \u2014 is more remarkable than never. Homeless again, \"Feist murmured\" in the park \", a dark, loveless song. a fitting summary of the Memorial's request for remembrance. The woman subtly of the sixth sense, the singer ended her \"intuition\" with the question, \"Did I remember you?\" This always twisted kind of \"what if?\" The questions are not always about the smell. In a broken, broken social situation \"from the past to the present\", the choir (\"a lot more than now\") makes a singer. sorry then, because of the extreme fascination of \"Brandy Alexander\" - this philosophy is rational. a brief study of the personal history of the twelve songs, Feist seems to have finally reached Emerson's transcendence finally \"How My Heart Beats\": \"I'm a stem now. Fan my yellow eyes, \"he sang on a wavy piano with a sharp voice. \"The point the is referring to is not very clear - the point. The past is passing. People stay and go. But find a place of protection from dreams and a half-face? Forever. Feist's entire song is a masterpiece that combines the development and production of oil-free songs. It may be associated with its own style. The memorial. Murmured in the \"park\", it was a dark, lost mourning. Providing a forgotten light and brilliance - yes. Acknowledged the proud power Accept the past tense ; you like simple conversations because you know you won't have anything else. Feist rarely becomes a singer - the first song they love, live, close, and familiarize themselves with.","overall":5,"summary":"A Classic!","unixReviewTime":1218672000,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2008"}

Williams \"John\"","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"Filled with sadness, loneliness and foggy memories, Feist's \"Dream\" can still be heard far from Remembrance, the artist's third best album. Highly documented on the road, the new LP moves to send the rise of non-stop, continental hotels. Talking about this endless life in an interview with Pitchfork last year, Feist said, \"You can never take root; you enjoy simple conversation, because you know you have it. Nothing more can happen. \" Although travelling alone with groups that include By Divine Wright and a broken social scene for more than a decade, the thirty-one-year-old songwriter there seems more anxious about anything than \"easy conversation.\" Unlike the partial \/ half-cover version of Let It Die, Fest wrote everything except a song in memory. 'Blood. From indie pop \"I Feel It All\" to Crepey Electro Ballad \"Honey Honey\", the album runs without power. Its music palette is wide enough to prevent repetition but enough to provide a deep connection. The combination of record-breaking non-cuff production records and non-oil songwriting may be linked to this approach: With fewer songs over the years of singing, Fest-his regular conspiracy theorists Gonzalez and Mookie, and Jamie Ledell and others recorded it in less than a week at a grocery store outside Paris. Endless touches of horns, lucan spells, temporary choirs, and other hidden definitions have never manifested themselves in entertainment. Instead, LP relies on modest development that contrasts with current artist-songwriting trends that promote endless desires rather than basics - music, planning, emotion. No longer a singer-songwriter for first love, life, closure and distance, Feist elevates himself above songwriters who keep a diary with a voice that can sweep Dick Cheney. Dusty Springfield's soul points, Bj\u00f6rk's beauty, and Joni Mitchell's warmly marked, Feist's voice are hard to deny because of the exaggeration. You can hear him snoring with a cappuccino at Starbucks, but this straight line moans easily cut the biscuit joke. And as a reminder, this control over whispers - expressed by hard-hearted \"water\" and \"intuition\" - is even more shocking than never. Homeless and, Kos Fest on \"The Park\", a deserted, loving cry. A little - reasonable. Summary of corrupted memorial applications. The sixth sense I miss you? \"If?\" Questions should not always touch such a scent. In the busy line, the broken social scene \"from the past to the present\", the words (\"I have a lot of past now\") is an artist who embraces the proud past of years but it does't matter that Where you sit in love - this true apology \"I'm sorry\" for being too interested in \"Brandy Alexander\" - this self-made philosophy makes sense. After slowly playing the history of this twelve songs, Feist finally appears to have reached the conclusion of Emerson's escape thought of \"How My Heart Beats\": \"I'm a jerk now, I'm blowing my yellow eye,\" He sings a fiery and fast song. Although the piano reads the song as a zen lesson in its volatile emotions, it still ends with the question: \"What grew and within whom?\" It's not clear what the's talking about - and that's it. The past is passing. People stay, go. But finding a shelter within dreams and a full face is partly? It never ends.","overall":5,"summary":"A Classic!","unixReviewTime":1218672000,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2008"}

The song-- with its references to a relationship torn by distance, omnipotent nature (a carefree bird can be heard mocking Feist's sadness in the background), and a hazy \"past\" that offers partly-forgotten flickers and flashes-- is a fitting summary of The Reminder's wounded pleas.

It was really hard for me to digest the complete album thinking that i was not expecting this kind of sound, but when i started to listened it more and more i now i just LOVE IT !!! All the songs are dark, cold and desperate, the voice of the vocalist is really nice, sometimes sweet and sometimes aggressive, just as the melodies of the disc. It has that \"krautrock\" for \"alernative\" songs like SILENCE for my favourites like THE RIP and PLASTIC:You will find also electronic songs like WE CARRY ON, it is definitely one of the best songs i have heard in all my life !!!! you must listen it !! And there is another one called MACHINE GUN, really dirty electronic and maddening but really great. The three last song are SMAL, MAGIG cdOORS and THREADS, all of them are really great and sometimes maddening too because of the vocal attempts of the lead singer and some electronic and extra dark sounds. This is definitely, a must have, one of the best albums i have heard; i can understand that a lot of Portishead fans are dissapointed just because this is not trip-hop for something like that but if you are \"oppen mind\" you will enjoy this album.

This band has talent and chose a fantastic name to \u2018Beach House\u2019 instead of the songs enticing a dark night inside. Pop record producer and producer Chris Coady has worked on similar TV shows, Yes Yeah Yeahs, and We Are Scientists. Recorded in a church, the natural retreat is a natural blend well blended with the peaceful voice of Victoria Legrand and the bright instruments of Alex Scally. On the twenty-first of October, two thousand and one pounds, less than a year after Devotion hit the shelves, Beach House released a \u201cUsed to Be\u201d now featuring Teen Dream. Despite a difficult track and one of the worst on the album, Beach House showcases a new level of originality with the remnants of their third gift. Opening \u201cZebra,\u201d a widely acclaimed track reminiscent of Fleet Foxes \u2019first showy inception, Beach House explored the depths of the new avenue they found on recording along with a simple rock setting album. The next song, \u201cSilver Soul,\u201d uses the same reverb according to taste and adds many of the mixed digital effects found in the rest of Teen Dreams. Creativity takes on \u201cNorway\u201d, a melody that opens wide at Charlotte Gainsbourg IRM. With curved airport wheels that are continuously controlled, the melody continuously maintains the sounds as the instruments swing around the designated field. Although difficult to hear at first, the further listening, the brighter the idea becomes clearer, the feeling of clues begins to emerge from the rest. The album\u2019s final track, \u201cCaring,\u201d does a great job of bringing the music into a full circle and giving the listener a complete and satisfying conclusion. In the music industry leading to the success of singles, Teen Dream is a complete and rare work that performs to the best listener when it is heard live. In a release like this, Beach House probably won\u2019t play in the large venues that are often heard on the radio, but speaking can be a powerful force and I have no doubt that Teen Dream will speak to a lot of people.

Warparint was heavily influenced by a number of the best bands of one thousand, nine hundred and twenty - jones who made excellent dense production. Teams like the Cocteau Twins, Sunday, Kate Bush, Dead Dance and Even Therapist, among others, are on the mind when the Nine Ends go.

Warpaint made the mistake of leaving some of their best songs on their most important record and preferred something that was recently recorded, after the launch of Mozgawa. While that move could lead the team to break the joint they think they need before they can start, the result is a first start that could easily be a double record. After all, a fool is a difficult introduction to a group of this most beautiful days.

I have listened to it on a daily basis during that period. I believe this is important to know since most Neko songs take a while to digest. Neko Case is finally back after more than a four year absence since her latest release, Middle Cyclone, which dates back to March two thousand and nine, with the long titled The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You. The Neko Case sound is very much still intact. There is, is my view, a gradual change still taking place in her emphasis. While her earlier recordings were more country oriented, her (fantastic) two thousand and six Fox Confessor Brings the Flood veered towards salt-country with some eccentric twists. That album nailed such a combination perfectly with some incredible itunes such as Star Witness and The Needle Has Landed (heavy Neil Young influence). Middle Cyclone was similar but something of a Fox-Lite experience, being more pop music oriented but yet warmer. It was a mixture of clear cut pop itunes like This Tornado Loves You (why it was not promoted more is still a mystery to me) and more complex jones like Prison Girls and The Next Time You Say Forever. The eccentric style from Fox had thus paved the way for a warmer and straightforward production. The Worse. is in a sense a continuation of this process. The first glimpse of the album is Neko's voice singing When you catch life, you look like your mother. There are some very tender songs on this album, as if Neko was being intent on opening her heart in some instances to her listeners. That being said, it is a real grower and is on par with Middle Cyclone in my opinion. That is not to say that Neko has lost her sense of adventure in production; cases in point are Afraid (resembles some Middle Cyclone songs) and the joyful closer, Ragtime. The album drifts like Middle Cyclone between slow and fast itunes. This works better on this album than Middle Cyclone, which was in my opinion the main flaw (minor one) on that album. In whole this is a great set. The one sore exception is Nearly Midnight, Honolulu. Besides the unnecessary overuse of the F-word, the song sounds more like an experimental itunes best left for friends having a beer together rather than a tune stuck in between other great (and mostly warm) songs. It could also be slightly longer; thirty-eight minutes of material is rather short. It is a bit tempting ducking a star because of these two aspects. In whole, I strongly recommend this album. Those yearning for a more Fox type of album may be disappointed since it steers more towards Middle Cyclone.

Having said that, it is a real farmer, in my opinion comparable to a hurricane.

The disc goes between slow and fast iTunes, like a Medium Storm. This works better than the Central Hurricane on this album. and it's better to leave it to your friends to drink beer, than to be caught in the middle of some great (and especially hot) iTunes songs.

The Nico Case returns more than four years after its latest release, Middle Cyclone, in March two thousand and nine, entitled The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You. The sound of the Nico case is still perfect. In my opinion, the emphasis is on gradual change. Although this previous record was very popular in the country, thousands of this (good) Fox Confessors flood the salty land with some twists and turns. The album combines such a perfect combination with other amazing iTunes like Star Witness and Needle Hayes Landing (Neil Young's Heavy Effect). Central Storm was similar to the Fox Lite experience, which was a very pop but hot pop music. This pop-up was a mix of iTunes poppies like Lee Tornado Lose You (why more promotions in't a mystery to me yet) and complex junk like Jail Girls and The Next Time UC for Ever. In this way, Fox's vertical style paved the way for hot and straight products. even worse. In a sense, the continuity of this process. The first impression of the album is singing Nico's voice. When you hold on to your life, you look like your mother. There are some very soft songs in this album, as if Nico intends to open this heart to this audience in some matters. That being said, this is a real farmer and in my opinion the equivalent of a moderate storm. This does not mean that Nico has lost this sense of humour in the production. For example, fear (like middle cyclone songs) and a nearby pastime called Ragtime. The album runs like a middle ground between slow and fast iTunes. It works better than medieval on this album, in my opinion there is a small (minor) mistake in this album. This is a great set. The only spain that was almost there was Nearly Midnight, Honolulu. Aside from the unnecessary use of the word F, the song sounds like a test iTunes left with beer by friends instead of the sound trapped in other beautiful (and often hot) songs. It can be a little long; Thirty-eight minutes of luggage are short. It is tempting to look at the stars because of these two factors. Overall, I highly recommend this album.

It works better on this album than Central Cyclone, which I think is the biggest (minor) flaw of that album. Although this previous recordings focused on the country, the (notably) two thousand and six Fox Confessors brought Flood to the salty country with a slight twist. This does\u2019t mean Neko has lost this sense of productivity; The cases that point to it are Fear (like some song in Middle Storm) and near-joy, Ragtime. There is, in my view, a gradual change that is still happening in its strength. The first scene of the album is Neko\u2019s vocal song When you last a lifetime, you\u2019re like a mother. <c The long title, Your Favorite Things, Is Harder for Me, I Love You More, is available to listen to through the release about two weeks before the official release.","overall":5,"summary":"The Warmer Side of Neko","unixReviewTime":1380067200,"reviewTime":"09 25, 2013"}

While her previous recording loved the country, she turned to the salty country in return for two thousand sixty Fox Confessor Brings the Flood. This does not mean that Nico has lost this sense of humour in the production. Things are terrible in terms of points (like some medium storm songs) and a fun point of view, Ragtime.

Next to keep the momentum going is Jaheim with this latest effort Appreciation Day, an album that makes the point that the stressed in a song the put out a while in putting that woman first and appreciating all she gives. Not only for the moment, but as time goes on. A very intimate picture is what Jaheim paints with these songs about connectedness, sensuality and treasuring your lady like the gem she is. Like all the R&B; CDs of this year especially this summer, the soul is being restored in R&B.; Time has been reversed to vol' school roots, even if just for a year. Age Ain't A Factor seems like such a great way to kickstart the album in telling that no matter the number your page displays, I love you even more than before if possible. Lines like Like a wine, you get better with time your beauty is rare, and I swear you look better with every year and sexual speak, full figure physique\/These young girls can't compete show this is not exactly for the younger heads unless you are ahead of your time. To truly love someone is to appreciate how they grow and change for the better as time goes on. From there the takes to breaking the perfect man portrait in He Don't Exist and the Shirley Murdock As We Lay-sampled Morning talking of making love until and being on my mind in the morning. Reading your woman like a book with the signs she gives and being in tune with her is the focus on What She Really Means, something us men should pay attention to more. P**** Appreciation Day may be a favourite after listening to the CD. The detail the goes into about the smell, taste and feel of the female morgan is tracy without being tasteless though. Has all the makings of being a late night, candle-burning slow jam. Like how the never says the word, but you know the reference as it's censored in the chorus. Pleading and begging your way back into your woman's heart has almost gotten too cool for school these days, but that's where Jaheim takes it on Baby Xthree. If she's the one, you sometimes got to do such and show her that you care that deeply. For real! The intimate Shower Scene brings a scenery to life vividly again with the details of making love in the shower as water runs over your bodies, but won't get your hair wet (humor for the black woman. DON'T GET MY HAIR WET! LOL). A track that seems out of place but gives the album a grounded feel is Florida, an code to Trayvon Martin. Jaheim places in context as if the is sitting down talking to the state and wondering why no love for your young black kids as Trayvon never got to live out this dream. Love that Jaheim takes upon himself as an artist to keep Trayvon's memory alive and this story a continuing voice. May it be a moment in time we never forget and learn from. When arguments get out of control and words do actually hurt is the basis of Sticks N Stones, getting into how the littlest of fights can tear apart what you try to build. Have to be careful with what breaks your filter and makes it out of your mouth because throwing the one dart to pierce her heart can be the one you regret later on as she gets gone. Chase Forever brings everything to a lovely close in staying after that one no matter how long to let her know she is more than worth your efforts. Jaheim is a long time veteran in R&B;, crooning this way into the ladies' hearts. I've seen him do this thing, but never have I appreciated this gift until buying this CD. Not only does the have a gift vocally but this writing style brings everything to life and gives the album even more light. Touching on all points of a relationship whether in tune, fighting, making love, growing old together gives the album a balanced and well-rounded feel. Absolutely LOVE this CD!!! As I stated in the open, the return of real R&B; is right in front of your eyes from the male side of things thanks to the likes of Joe, TGT and now Jaheim.

The next thing to keep the momentum going is Jaheim's latest effort, Thanksgiving Day. This album emphasizes the pressure on the song, puts the lady first and thanks her for everything. Not only now but also over time. Jaheim paints a very close picture of these songs, these songs are about communication, sex and the lady you value, as it is precious. Like all R&B; this year, especially the CD of this genre, R&B is reviving its soul. Time is back to the root of the school, even for one year. Age is not something that seems to be a good way to start an album, it tells us that no matter what number is shown on your page, if possible, I love you more than never. Like wine, you will get better over time. Your beauty is rare, I swear you will look better every year, sex, a fat body \/ the inability of these young girls to compete shows that this is not good for young people at all. , unless you are ahead of your time. Loving a person truly appreciates the way the for she grows and develops over time.

The woman who reads it to you as a book, the qualities she offers and the compatibility with her is a concern for her true meaning, and we men need to pay more attention to this. P **** Appreciation Day might love it after listening to a CD. Details about the smell, taste and feel of Mrs. Morgan are Tracy, but they are not boring. It has all the hallmarks of slow-burning jam burning candles at night. It's like never saying a word, but you know the reference because it's checked in the chorus. These days, begging and begging to get back into your wife\u2019s heart is almost cool, but that\u2019s exactly what Jaheim welcomes to Baby Xthree. If this is a person, sometimes you have to do this to show that you care. monkeys! The nearby bath area also clearly shows having sex in the bathroom, because water flows through your body but does not wet your hair (humor of black women. Do not wet my hair! Haha). Another track that seems outdated but brings a strong feeling to the album is Florida, similar to Trayvon Martin. Jaheim is in a situation, as if sitting down and talking to the world, wondering why the does't love your little black child, because Trevon will never be table to understand this dream. I love Jaheim as an artist for keeping Trayvon\u2019s memory and the voice that goes on in this story. May this be a moment we will never forget and learn. When an argument gets out of hand and the words get hurt the foundation of Sticks N Stones, get a deeper understanding of how a small argument can tear up what you\u2019re trying to build. Be careful what breaks your filter and let it out of your mouth, for throwing a spear into this heart may cause you to regret it. No matter how long it takes to let him know you deserve your efforts, Chase Forever will leave all good send behind him. Jaheim is a veteran of R&B and gets into the hearts of ladies like this. I've seen him do this before, but before I bought this CD, I did't really appreciate the offer. Not only does the have a talent for sound, but this style of writing brings everything to life and makes the album easier. Touching all aspects of a relationship, whether it\u2019s forgiveness, fighting, making love, for growing old together, gives this album insight and understanding. I love this CD! ! !

Like all R&B; This year\u2019s CDs, especially this summer, are back in R&B .; Time was made root by the school in vol, even though it was only a year. Age Not Faith seems to be the best way to start an album by saying that no matter how many pages you have, I love you more than never if possible. Lines like alcohol, you will be fine when your beauty is rare, and I swear you are beautiful every year and sex talk, full physical appearance you are ahead of your time. True love for someone will appreciate how they grow and change for the better over time.

The very close up dance scene are-shows life visually in the details of the love bath as water flows through your body, but does\u2019t wet your hair (joke for the black woman. LOL).

When \"Mechanical Bull\" came out last Fall, I immediately bought it (as a KOL fan from the first hour), listened through it start to finish once, and immediately dismissed it as disappointing. Then a curious thing happened after seeing them bringing many of these songs live.\"Mechanical Bull\" (eleven tracks; forty-two min.) starts off with \"Supersoaker\" (onest single), which sounds like a throwback to their early days (when they were (incorrectly) branded \"the Strokes of the South\"), and one of the best itunes of the album for me. After a lazy \"Rock City\" we get a much better, urgent \"It Don't Matter To Me\", borderline hard rock, really, but surely another highlight of the album.

After another lazy track (\"Wait For Me\"). wait are we seeing a pattern there?, comes a nice \"Family Tree\". And so it goes. Good track, not so good track, etc. \"Tonight\" is THE best track on there, which sounds like it came from \"Because of the Times\" for \"Only By the Night\". \"Coming Back Again\" is quite nice too. The album closer \"On the Chin\" is the proverbial \"pensive\" ending. (The \"deluxe\" edition adds two more tracks.) Bottom line: this album is up-and-down, with a number of great tracks, but too uneven and hence, IMHO, KOL's least appetizing album to date. (For the record: \"Because of the Times\" remains my favourite KOL album.)I was in Washington DC last week on business, and noticed they played the Verizon Center. On a whim, I went to see them (the arena was nowhere near sold out, it turned out). The band was in great form, blazing through nearly thirty tracks in almost two hours. I have seen these guys in concert many times over the last ten years, and live they still bring it, no doubt. Most interestingly, all weight for nine songs they played from \"Mechanical Bull\" sounded much better live than what you hear on the album. In particular \"Tonight\" and \"Family Tree\" were simply fantastic and blended in nicely with the older songs they played. So in the send, I have become more positive about this album than I was when I first listened to it last Fall.","overall":4,"summary":"Okay album, but it sounds so much better live","unixReviewTime":1393459200,"reviewTime":"02 27, 2014"}

After the boring \u201cRock City\u201d we get a very good, quick \u201cI don\u2019t matter To Me\u201d, hard rock border, really, but really another one out the door.
