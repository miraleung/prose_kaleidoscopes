The ""cliffhanger"" scene at the send had me laughing until my insides hurt. The script was dreadful enough, but coupled with Sean Young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fake shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing got made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star factors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions.",negative

612,"This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you haven't seen either movie and want to but don't want the spoilers, please don't read this review! While this movie is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the movie is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions. The factors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed. Neither can pull off the smarmy, snooty rich-kid attitude that the original factors did. It's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim -- not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the send of the movie? He supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with Reese Witherspoon's character).

2923,"Kennedy-Miller could hardly have done a better job at tackling a very challenging exercise: making dry political events work as human drama, and providing an even-handed representation of explosively controversial subject matter. The key to its success on the first count is brilliant acting, although I was less impressed by Max Phipps' performance as Gough Whitlam than some other commenter there. The clear standouts for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the easiest casting choices in history - Hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. On the second count, the series avoids the ""myth of objectivity"" strap through a narrator who particulates the sympathies of the director (Phillip Noyce, who more recently demonstrated this left-wing credentials in Rabbit Proof Fence), while being carefully even-handed and sympathetic in its dramatic portrayal of all parties. The adherence to the Lady Kerr/Lady Macbeth theme popular among Labor partisans was perhaps a little partial, though not ruinously so.

However, there is one sour note for which the producers were perhaps not entirely to blame - the portrayal of the Jim Cairns/Juni Morosi affair. Those who come to the series with no background to these events will get the impression that Cairns and Morosi were the innocent victims of a smear campaign by a prurient gutter press. The producers may have been restrained in this respect by Australia's stultifying defamation laws, and the recently demonstrated willingness of Cairns and Morosi to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would eventually admit to a year before this death). However, more could have been made of the bizarre fashion in which Morosi managed Cairns's office as Treasurer.

The key to its success in the first instalment was excellent performance, though I was very impressed with Max Phipps' performance as Gough Whitlam compared to other reviewers there. To me, the best are John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must be one of the simplest in history — Hunter cannot be more accomplished in this role.

3015,"While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early one thousand, seven hundred and ninety's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home. Scenes are are-set from the novel, and lest we forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. For example, the film puts the big Darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a Neoclassical temple, as opposed to inside the Collins' parsonage: Why did Jane Austen put it in the parsonage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total, if brutal honesty to each other in this scene, the Collinses have never shared an honest word. Why the brain and the outdoor proposal? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama, one expects her to cry, ""Heathcliffe"" at any minute! Austen has been Bronteized! Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant factor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that this terrible dancing with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another favourite of mine from MI-five on A&E; in P&P, however, the is more the young Heathcliffe, never smiling--though Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit, and she realizes this when she sees this wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley--a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust. And much of Austen's dialogue is changed to modern speech. Mr. Bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him.

For example, the movie puts a great view of Darcy's proposal in a storm in front of the neoclassical temple, instead of getting inside priest Collins: Why did Jane Austen put it in the priest's house? It's because even though Lizzy and Darcy have been inseparable in this area, Collins has never spoken honestly. Why the brain and the external motion? It looks like Jane Eyre is meeting Rochester! When Elizabeth walked through the air and stood on a cliff to watch the panorama, people were expecting her to shout ""Heathcliff"" at any moment! Austin is doomed!

First off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this milk. Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in your lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking film in many ways. However, don't be too fooled by its real intent. It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with this aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together this dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. One other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.",positive

The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an eighty-five/one hundred on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is ""universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing. First, I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to Ultimatum.

If you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching Bourne take down this enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy. Jason Bourne is played very well by Matt Damon. Damon does nothing to deserve an Oscar nod, but this work there is good enough to hold it's own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. The agency tracking Bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down. I won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. However, it would't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. Ultimatum would't have been charmed at all if the story was a little more up front. It seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $sixty-nine million, and -box office total now is up to $two hundred and sixteen mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August three.

Most people seem to agree that the ultimatum was a movie success: the movie was released for sixty-nine sixty-nine million, and the total office space has now reached twenty-six two hundred and sixty-six - and is currently in heaters since August three.

However, it would't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an eighty-five/one hundred on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is ""universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like I was. If you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching Bourne take down this enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy. First, I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to Ultimatum. You will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of Ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.",positive

A simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore. It's not something you'll send up writing books about but it's nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema.""Meatball Machine"" follows the well known plot. Boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date. Boy finally meets girl. Girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg. Boy, in turn does also transform into said thing, and goes on a quest to save this love. Will the succeed? Who gives a damn, as long as there is carnage and death I'm satisfied. The plot is simple, relatively clickéd but it does it's job well enough setting the movie's course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. There is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives. And yes it too luckily shows more violence. I'm happy. Acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film. It's not exactly painful for the years but it's not exactly good either. The movie's main attraction besides the violence and gore (like I haven't mentioned that enough already) are the cyborg designs. Done by Keita Amemiya who's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video-games is well known. The necroborgs as they are called in ""Meatball Machine"" look stunningly detailed. Without the usage of CGI Amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal, painfully awesome in their appearance. Able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws, rocket launchers, blood-firing shotguns and so on and so on. Though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, necroborgs are A-movie class.""Meatball Machine"" is ""Tetsuo The Iron Man"" mixed up with ""Alien"" all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode. It's an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking.",positive
7956,"""Meatball Machine"" directed by Judai Yamaguchi (battlefield baseball) and Junichi Yamamoto is clearly the one, nine hundred and ninety-nine film Yamamoto of the same name. I suspect that I will never have a chance to see the actual report, so I will stick to this comment. First, what is a ""meatball machine""? A simple movie to analyse a low-cost budget, full of the effects of beauty and blood. It's not something you can write a book about, but if you're into this type of movie, it's still interesting. The ""meatball machine"" follows a well-known conspiracy. The boy loves the girl, but the is not good enough to date her. Eventually the boy met the girl. The girl was infected by an alien creature, who turned her into a deadly robot. The boy, on the other hand, became obsessed with her, and continued to want to keep this love. Will it succeed? Who cares, as long as there is murder and death, I am satisfied. The plot is very simple, just click, but it does a good job, pushing the movie system directly into the bloody conflict between the two main characters. There is a plan that focuses on how the virus that infects girls enters their lives. Yes, fortunately it showed violence. Very happy. Doing something you would expect from a splash movie without a budget. It has’t been painful at all for years, but it’s not very good with it. In addition to violence and bloodshed, the main attraction of this movie (as I haven't said enough) is robot design. Completed by Keita Amemiya, she makes unique creations and costumes for movies and video games, popularly known. The person called Necropolis in the ""Meatball Machine"" looks very detailed. The design outside of CGI Amiaia is an amazing combination of flesh and metal, and the look is awesome. It can turn various body parts into cool weapons, such as saws, rocket launchers, guns, etc. While you can easily see how cheap this movie is, Necropolis is an A-level movie. The ""meatball machine"" is a blend of ""Iron Man Iron Man"" and ""Aliens"", all in a low budget and additional acuphup mode. This is a very interesting movie that ignores the special effects of today and proves that the platform is still working.",positive

I doubt I'll never get a chance to see the real thing so I'll just comment on it. The first is the ""meatball machine""? A simple low-budget industrial splitter with very little automation and movement effects. It's not something you'll send out to write books, but it's still fun when you dig into that kind of cinema. The boy loves the girl but is afraid to ask her out on a date. Eventually the boy meets the girl. The girl is affected by an unknown worm that makes her a deadly cyborg. The boy also turns to say something and keeps trying to save this love. Will you succeed Whoever punishes, as long as there are murders and deaths, I am satisfied. The plot is simple, comparatively clicked, but the direction of the film works well enough to settle the bloody conflict between the two main characters. This is a short essay that focuses on how the parasites that affected the girl entered her life. And yes and fortunately it shows more violence. I'm happy. Imitation is what you would expect from a budget movie. It's not that bad these years, but it's not really that good. The most interesting movie without violence and adventure (as if I'm not saying that's enough) khyber design. Created by Keita Amemia, who specializes in creating unique creatures and whose costumes are popular for both movies and video games. The so-called ""meatball machine"" looks like Nikroberg with amazing details. In addition to using the CGI Amemia design, it is a wonderful combination of meat and metal, which is very impressive in their appearance. It can turn different parts of the body into cold weapons such as saws, rocket launchers, shotguns, etc. Although you can easily see the cheapness of the movie, the Nekborgs are A-movie category.

The movie started out interesting, then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn? Yep - same thing there. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept, then had no idea what to do with it. I've gotten deeper thought provocation out of Transformers two.three). Yes - we get the dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the story jumped around way too much, did't elaborate on the current story marc, and took a(forgive me)completely insulting direction.four). The ending did't make sense. Not at all. None. This movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy one hundred and one.

13207,"Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds. The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf who delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting this way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with this slap-stick performances in ""Even Stevens"" this demonstration of this maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten year old candy threatens to steal every scene in which the appears.

14702,"Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this never bothered me anyway, since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's seven and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good. The story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They then discover the prisoner has made it too, the's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems. The effects, except for the gunfights, are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it. Computer effects look a bit dodgy at times, but serve their purpose well and add to the story, lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings. Films like I, Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot, like all too many of Hollywood's offerings. Whilst none of the factors get Oscar material, it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes does't outstay its welcome. The characters don't get fleshed out much, but then they did't in Predator either, which it resembles in feel. Big man Mike Mitchell is a good stand in for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn. Some people may be annoyed at the black of explanation towards the send, but I like it. Unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained, it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all, and I'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further. A cracking little film from an enterprising team, done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. If this is what they can do on a shoestring I'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash, and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first.

Not that this has never bothered me, because I love low-budget novels like Doctor Who, Seven Dark and Black Star. Hell, even though the outside is not a big deal on a budget, so while money can help, making things better requires more than just spending money. The beginning of the story is easy. A group of soldiers are paid to move the prisoner to the scene. Their ship was attacked and forced off land. Then they discovered that prisoners had succeeded. Without being shot, these effects are small and can be added to a movie without supervision. Special computer effects sometimes seem complex, but they work well, add color to the story, and add a vision of the future throughout the system. Movies like ""Me, Robot"" can benefit from this approach, unlike many Hollywood products, based on style, using special effects instead of designs. While none of this has been successful in Oscar-winning material, its script and photography are strict, and one hour and ten minutes does not exceed its popularity. The characters don’t get much fat, but they don’t in Predator, which feels the same. Older Mike Mitchell replaces it with Arnie, the perfect combination of mind and muscle. Some people may be annoyed by the black statement posted, but I like it. Unlike movies and movies that make things obscure, it is not so secretive that you can never fully comprehend it. An amazing film made by a group who are interested in spending an hour in a small but interesting way.

14702,"I had the opportunity today to see it at a friend's house, and you were very impressed with what the reached on a small budget. It should definitely not bother me anyway, because I love low-budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake’s Seven and Star Dark. Hell, even Outland in’t a big budget issue, so even if money helps, it requires more than throwing money at things to improve. The story is straight to the beginning, with a group of mercenaries being paid to escort a prisoner into an open space. Their ship was attacked and forced to land on the nearest planet. They realize that the prisoner is the same, this is the case of the cold peanut and that is the beginning of their problems. The impact, other than the shot, is minimal and adds to the film without being missed. The computer effects can seem a bit tedious at times, but they serve their purpose well and add to the story, giving an idea of ​​the future of the case. In films like mine, Robot can take advantage of this technique instead of becoming a more narcotic form and replace it with a particular effect in a scene, as all Hollywood demands breeding. Although none of the points received the Oscar equipment, it was heavily written and shot an hour and ten minutes did not survive its reception. The characters don’t show up much, but then they also don’t get any Predator, which seems like a sensation. The great Mike Mitchell stands out for Arnie and a great combination of thoughtfulness and courage. Some people may hate the black description of the post, but I like it. Unlike many movies and shows that leave things unintelligible, it’s not a dark thing you can’t control, and I’d love to see a series of further exploration of foreign behavior. A little cracked film from a business team, made in a cheap but fun way to last an hour. If this is what they can do with a shoelace, I’d love to see what they can do with it for more money, and hopefully the film industry and the closet chair critics don’t beat all their creativity first.

Well, even outland was not a big budget issue, so although money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to get it right. The story goes straight to the beginning, a group of mercenaries is paid to transport a prisoner into space. Their boat is attacked and they are forced to live on nearby land. Then they find out that the prisoner has done it again, this is a cold case of stones and this is just the beginning of their problems. Other than gun battles, the effects are minimal and increase the film without suppressing it. The results of computers sometimes seem small, but they serve their purpose well and add to the story, lending the process to the future. Movies like mine, robots could benefit from this approach instead of being more stylish and incorporating special architectural effects like all Hollywood offerings. While there are no features that trace the essence of the Oscars, they are well written and shot and do not sit for an hour and ten minutes without being welcomed. The characters don't get much flesh, but they're not in Predator either, which is similar to the feeling. Great man Mike Mitchell is a great position for Arnie and a great combination of brain and intelligence. Some people may be annoyed by the darkness of detail about posting, but I like it. Unlike many movies and programs that don't explain things, it's not so secret that you can't handle it, and I'd love to see another course where the status of aliens is constantly explored.

15169,"Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line, it creates the impression that this doubts in this regard are historical fact, when in reality, both Brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that the had been called to lead the church. As a member of the church, the single most disturbing aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the portrayal of Brigham Young as one that had ""knowingly deceived"" church members into believing the had been called to be Joseph's successor as the prophet. The point is important for Mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of your faith: that God truly speaks to prophets today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet of God. I think that a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial, since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early Mormon church. Whether for not you believe this statement for not, just know that the film does not accurately portray what Brigham himself believed. I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the LDS faith. Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather the led them confidently by inspiration.",positive

17415,"A seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating. The premise seems simple enough: Yentl, a girl interested in studying the Talmud, wants to go to school. But only boys are allowed to study, so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in. She does and becomes close friends with Avigdor, who is to be married to a beautiful woman named Hadass. Hadass' family learns Avigdor's brother committed suicide, and the wedding is called off. Yentl, now calling herself Anschel, is then selected to marry Hadass. She does but it is never consummated. Yentl/Anschel and Avigdor go away for a few days, and Yentl/Anschel reveals her secret to him. The movie ends with Avigdor returning to (and marrying?) Hadass, and Yentl going to America to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise. The plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over two hours long, but there are several things that ruin it. For starters, there is the constant SINGING. (I can already hear the critics shouting.) Yes, I know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers. But the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them. The songs become tedious after a while, and there in't as much dancing as one would expect. Many of the songs are forgettable, with no real memorable lyrics, and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice-over. Only one song stands out from the rest, ""Papa Can You Hear Me"". It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so Streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes. Chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is, so the songs really karen't necessary. Second, Streisand's makeup, which can be seen during her scenes as a man (the lipstick, enhanced flashes, and traces of blush are all obvious) makes it hard for the audience to believe in the Yentl/Anschel character, that she is actually serious, and fooling her new friends, colleagues, and even Hadass, into believing she is a man. Yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing. There seems to be a contradiction, as her character talks, for rather sings, of how she does't think she can pull it off, but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing. This means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences, such as her actions, which are clear giveaways. The facial differences alone cannot be included, as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives for friends did't have a beard for other facial hair. Nevertheless, in the one thousand, nine hundreds, if a woman dressed as a man, but wore as much makeup as Streisand's character did, and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men's clothing, it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage. Chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town, for even the country. Therefore the ""feminine"" makeup on Streisand does not blend to the character's credibility, and only weakens the plot. If it was only applied to make Streisand look more beautiful, it should have been scrapped. Thirdly, when Yentl/Anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the send, we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as Streisand's and only when they learn the ""truth"" do they become a little wiser. By now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom-made vehicle for Streisand to fuel. Lastly, there are those who are fans of Streisand who will find no fault with this film, its plot, for the songs. To those I must respectfully disagree. While she has excellent vocal and acting abilities, I am not a ""fan"" of her style of singing. However, I have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals. There are even some songs of hers that I like, so I am not a ""hater"" nor have set out to bash her. I have written this review from an honest perspective, from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - several times even - and has noted the problems within. If Streisand was interested in creating a great for even believable film, she could have done so there by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented, beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn. This movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities, make her appear self-absorbed, and thus turn the film into a laugh-fest unworthy of her fans for audience.",negative
17415,"A seemingly endless movie, worth a series of articles. The foundation seems simple: Yentl, a Talmud-loving girl, wants to go to school. But only boys were allowed to study, so after the death of this father, the decided to pretend to be a boy and go to school. He made and became a close friend of Avigdor, who was to marry a beautiful woman named Hadas. Hadas' family heard that this brother Avigdor had committed suicide and that the marriage had been cancelled. Yentl, now called Anschel, was chosen to marry Hadass. He did, but the did not finish it. Yentl / Anschel and Avigdor left for a few days, and Yentl / Anschel revealed this secret to him. The film ends with Avigdor returning (and marrying?) Hadas, while Yartre travels to the United States to continue this studies, though the will have to continue to pretend. In a film that was more than two hours long, the plot above seemed appealing at first, but many things went wrong. For starters, there is a regular PAYMENT. (I've heard critics.) Yeah, I know this is music, so there has to be a lot of songs and dances. But without direction and distribution, the film could have been improved. After a while, the song got boring and did't dance as much as people expected. Many songs are easily forgotten, there are no songs that are not memorable, and those songs that have any meaning are easily replaced by the voice. There is only one great song, “Daddy hears me”. Clearly, most of the others did it deliberately, so that Streisand would have reason to demonstrate this ability to speak every five to ten minutes. Anyone who has watched this movie may already know a great singer and factor, so these songs are not really necessary. Second, Streisand's makeup can be seen in the playground (traces of lipstick, expanded glitter and clear blush) makes it hard for listeners to believe in the role of Yentl / Anschel, in fact, and Trick this new friends, co-workers, even Hadas made him believe the was a man. However, we are requested and are expected to believe this. There seems to be an argument because her character is talking instead of singing, thinking she can’t do it, but the shocking thing is that everyone seems cheated because she’s wearing men’s clothes. This means we have to believe that some characters are so inexperienced that they can't see any difference, like this behavior, which are obvious gifts. Facial differences cannot be put on alone, because some of the characters in the movie mention that some of their male relatives and friends do not have a beard to change some facial hair. However, in the nine thousand nine hundred, if a woman dresses like a man but wears the attitude of Streisand, and wants to pretend to be a man because she wears men's clothes, it will be considered unacceptable and irritating. He may be forced to leave town, for go to another country. Therefore, Streisand's ""feminine"" make-up does not involve character fidelity, and will weaken the plot. If it is used to make Strisand look even better, it should be discarded. Third, when Yentl / Anschel himself revealed this true identity to the sender, we were asked to believe that some of the characters were not as intelligent as Streisand, and only if they knew the ""truth"" would they be smarter. It is becoming increasingly clear that this is all the design until it is downloaded so that it is nothing more than a vehicle designed for Streisand to fill Streisand. Lastly, there are fans of Streisand who will not choose the movie, plot and songs. For those I should not disagree respectfully. Although she has excellent playing and acting skills, I am not a “follower” of her singing style. However, I love many other things, including music. There are some of this favourite songs, so I'm not a ""hateful person"", and I did't intend to criticize him. I wrote this review from an honest point of view, to someone who had done this best to watch this movie — even many times — and recognized the problem. If Streisand was interested in making a great movie for a credible movie, the would have done it instead of adding a needle to this needs to show and prove that the is talented, beautiful and intelligent almost all the time. The film is nothing more than damaging this power and making him look like a selfish person, thus turning the movie into a laughing stock for unsuspecting fans.",negative

However, in the thousands and nine hundred, if a woman dresses like a man, but wears Streisand's makeup, and wants to impersonate a man because the is wearing men's clothes, it will be considered unacceptable and irritating. There seems to be a clash because her character speaks instead of singing, she thinks she can’t do it, but surprisingly, everyone seems to be deceived because she’s wearing men’s clothes. Lastly, there are Streisand fans who have no qualms about the movie, the plot and the songs. Third, when Yentl / Anschel himself revealed who the really was to the sender, we were asked to believe that some of the characters were not as intelligent as Streisand, and that if they knew the ""truth"" they would be smarter.

The film ends with the return of Avigdor (married?) Hadass, and Yentl going to America to continue this education even though the has to do it secretly. The above story seems interesting at first for a two hour film, but there are a lot of destructive things. For starters, there are regular songs. (I can already hear the screams of the critics.) Yes, I know it’s music so there are probably many more songs and dance figures. But the film would have been better if it had been directed and played without them. The songs become more tiring afterwards, and there is no dance as expected.

Then we were asked and we were expected to believe that. They seem to be in conflict, as her character speaks, rather than singing, she thinks she can’t escape it, but what’s surprising is that everyone seems stupid because she’s wearing a masculine outfit. This means that we are then expected to believe that other characters are rational and not see other differences, such as this actions, which are clear contributions. Facial differences alone cannot be included, with other factors in the film noticing that some of their male relatives have no other facial hair.

How did lee and griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? Which of the two were of***ing the girl under the tree? It was unclear. And, There seems to be some law in hollywood about southern accents, and rarely do you hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south., despite the awful, ""this must be how they sound, just soften the ""r"""" approach to dialogue, so many times the factors lapse out of it altogether. Aleksa especially sounded like a new york street tough during ""emotional"" scenes, and nobody sounded mississippian at all. Walt Goggins' character was supposed to have been from Morgan city, Louisiana yet sounded nothing like that city's blend of new orleans and cajun accents. The other bothersome point seemed to be an surge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual urges inside him. Before I start a firestorm there and am accused of homophobia, I've enjoyed many films with gay love themes, notably ""punks"" ""when love comes"" and ""b monkey"". But this seemed to be some man's wish about all young men. Well, Tennessee williams has already covered this ground, and did a far better job of it.

The inventor, however, is convinced that the never-lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many, and refuses to give in to the demand of others, despite being threatened with violence and offered ₤two hundred and fifty, zero in compensation. The all-powerful bosses of textiles industry, headed by the frail Sir John Kierlaw (Ernest Thesiger), unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention, which could completely cripple their businesses, never goes into full-scale production. Throughout all this troubles to announce this invention to the media, only one person offers Sidney her complete sympathy and support, Birnley's daughter Daphne, who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with Sidney's plight anyway. 'The Man in the White Suit' is a clever and hilarious comedy, made great by a witty script (written by John Dighton, Roger MacDougall and director Alexander Mackendrick) and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable Alec Guinness.",positive

The only good thing about Dhol was one for two of the scenes which were funny, though not witty, and secondly, except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma, the acting was decent. Speaking of the acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with the others in the movie), then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above. The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that the was cloud in this jokes and even in this acting. The grandma, firstly resembled a ghost, plus she was not funny at all but rather silly. The plot was the same, seen before one. Four boys behind girls and in need of money, but with a few twists. There is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb.

Its hilarious feature hurt my surroundings, the dress was't too bad, and historically, I did't close much weight. I also noticed the fact that England did not have proper field pipelines until a long time ago, but anyone who does not enter England at the last minute will not see for be bothered. Worth to see I highly recommend this movie.",negative

43471,"The plot of "" Astronuat returns to Earth as a mutating monster "" died out in the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty mainly down to the scientific fact that travelling outside the Earth's orbit does't humans cause to turn in to mutated monsters , and that the first film to use this plot THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT was the only decent sci-fi movie to use the idea . So the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start . Alas watching THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN it seems the plot is the least of its problems First of all this is an incredibly badly made movie . The budget is in single figures and I'm talking about lira not dollars . There is no cinematography to speak of and there's countless editing blunders . For example a photographer takes this ( Barely legal ) model for a photo shoot . Cut to a shot where the sun is directly behind model , then cut to shot of photographer where the sun is directly behind him, then cut back to the model where the sun is . The black of budget drags the film down in other aspects too . According to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers could't get any stock footage of Saturn so when astronaut Steve West mentions how beautiful Saturn looks we get footage of the sun . Actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human factors would't be employed by a porn studio . If I was appearing in this I would't be scared by the eponymous monster - I'd be terrified of splinters from the rest of the cast . Perhaps we should be slightly forgiving though since the obvious black of budget manifests itself in things like the factors having to wear their own clothes . A general for instance does't wear this nice fancy dress uniform complete with medals - the wears a denim jacket and baseball cap There has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level . The stone is set early on in the film where Mr Melty murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital . Instead of the police getting a call saying there's been a murder Dr Nelson just decides to track down this patient on this own own same as the'd look for a missing cat . It's also strange a thoroughly decomposing homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone noticing , but this is typical of a film where horny seventy year holds stop their car down dark roads for a quickie and people nonchalantly mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there's a monster on the loose . THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is Z grade rubbish . I can certainly understand why people enjoy this movie because it does reach the heights of "" It's so bad it's good "" but apart from Rick Baker's sometimes impressive make up effects it's nothing more than a very guilty pleasure",negative

43471,"The ""Astronaut Returning to Earth as a Mutated Monster"" strategy, one, nine hundred and fifty mainly because people travelling outside the Earth's orbit would not lead to the science of turning into a dynamic monster. The truth, and the first film QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT to use this conspiracy is the most noble concept used by science films. It's weird that a rotten killer can go on the road without being noticed, but this is a common movie where seventy hungry and thirsty stops in a fast-paced dark way, people say strangely that their wives are pregnant and forgot to tell the police that there is a big monster. Cut out the lens of the sun directly behind the model, then cut out the lens of the photographer directly after the sun, and cut back on the model where the sun is. I certainly understand why people love this movie because it reaches the length of ""very bad, beautiful"", but without the positive influence of Rick Baker sometimes, it is nothing but guilt. and the baseball cap should be suspended to make you doubt that the movie could work, but it fails at all levels. According to the trivia paper, the budget was too low for the manufacturer to get anything from Saturn, so when astronaut Steve West described what Saturn looked like, we got a shot of the sun. After all, because porn studios do not use human resources, the performance of the sun in a movie is a major attraction.",negative

Nine hundred and fifty, primarily in the scientific fact that travelling without orbiting the earth does not transform humans into monsters, and the first film to use this episode, QUATERMASS TEST, was the culmination of a venerable sci-fi. Film to use the idea. It's also amazing that a rotting deadly animal can walk on the road without anyone noticing, but it's like a movie in which a horny seventy-year-old woman crashes her car into the dark streets of a high-speed street and People accidentally talk that this wife is pregnant while the police forgot to tell her that she is a free beast. Cut and paste the image where the sun is directly behind the model, then cut the photographer where the sun is directly behind it, and cut the model where the sun is. I really understand why people enjoy this movie because it reaches a high level of ""it's so bad it's good"" but sometimes the impression of giving results without Rick Baker is just too much excitement for the culprits. It's not about. That such a film works but fails. At each level. According to Trivia Page, the budget was very low. The producer could not get any share of Saturn, so when astronaut Steve West said how Saturn looks like, we get pictures of the sun.

In the same unfinished schâteau the built, a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story, as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical anthropologist tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group.

Truth be told, the TV series itself was an entertaining, adult, non-PC scandal that could have been reasonably tolerated in a half-hour situation, but has been tripled to pay more than believed. Ironically, the Hammer films tried this because it is almost identical to a realistic horror film, with antiquity, computer attacks, unbridled slaps, and exorbitant production costs.

27029,"Horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies. I'm not very fond of them myself, but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of British horror cinema. The House That Dripped Blood is a horror omnibus, featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a Scotland Yard officer by an estate agent. This film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, whom horror fans will recognise as one of Lee's co-stars in the greatest British horror film of all time; The Wicker Man. The first segment of the film, titled ""Method For Murder"" tells the story of a horror storywriter, whose creation; a strangler named ""Dominic"" is brought to life by this own imagination. This story builds suspense very well; through this girlfriend, the, and the audience is lead to believe that what the is seeing is a figment of this imagination. This story certainly in't very original, but it makes up for its black of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it's final twist; which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise. The second story, titled ""Waxworks"", stars Peter Cushing and is my least favourite of the four. This tale follows the story of Phillip Grayson (Cushing), a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in. Inside, the discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess. Quite what the woman's relationship with Phillip entailed is never really explained, but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details. Cushing is later joined by this friend, Neville Rogers (played by Joss Ackland) and that's when the tale really starts to pick up. The setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film in't a new idea; the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six horror film, ""Chamber of Horrors"". Although the one there in't as grand as the one in the aforementioned film, the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect, much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia, brought about by the limited area of the museum. Peter Cushing is always interesting to watch, and seeing him avoid an axe-wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan. Despite being my least favourite, this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down. The film continues with ""Sweets for the Sweet"", which is without doubt the best of the omnibus. This story stars the legendary Christopher Lee as a seemingly overprotective father. The beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out. It leaves the audience guessing; we know that there is something wrong with either the father for the daughter, but we don't know who, for what, it is. Christopher Lee, as usual, portrays this character with a great degree of sinisterness; the audience is left to simmer over this actions regarding giving this daughter a doll, and the fact that she in't allowed to go to school for have any toys. The card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the send, epitomised by the truly chilling line in which Lee tells this babysitter that the is, in fact, afraid of this daughter. The ending to this section is superbly played out, in my opinion it's one of the finest endings to any horror story never told, and will stay with you long after the send credits roll. The omnibus finishes with ""The Cloak"", which is definitely the most comedic of the four. This tale is about a whammy horror film star that, unimpressed by this latest film's technical side, goes out and buys himself a cloak. Naturally, this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak. Unlike the other three tales, this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs. That is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film. The ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film, which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film. Also, look out for the little jibe regarding Christopher Lee in Dracula. A nice touch, I think. Overall, if you want a horror omnibus, you really cant go wrong with The House that Dripped Blood. The third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed.",positive
27029,"Broad horror films were very popular in the seventys. I don’t really like them, but there is no denying that they are an undeniable part of British horror movies. The ruined Blood House is a scary place with four stories surrounding the most horrible old house in the country, which was told to a Scottish Yard official by a real estate agent. The movie stars three horror movie stars; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt. Frightened fans see him as one of Lee's co-stars in a horror British film. The first part of the film is called ""Ways to Kill"", which tells the story of the author of a horror story and this creation; a strangler named ""Dominic"" was brought to life by this vision. This story sets in motion scepticism; through this girl, the audience and the audience believe that what they are seeing is a myth of this vision. This story is certainly not from the beginning, but it does its original darkness with a fabricated spirit and a final twist; the result is very good, which is really shocking. The second story is called ""Waxworks"" and the stars are Peter Cushing. Here are four of my favourite stories to see. This story tells the story of Philip Grayson (played by Cushing) A man discovered a wax museum and decided to enter it. Inside, we found an acquaintance of this, and later we learned that the was a murderer. The content of the lady's relationship with Philip has not been fully articulated, but the story is more based on suspicion than the details of a suspicious plot to create suspicion. Cushing later joined the friend, Neville Rogers (played by Joss Akrand), and that's when the story began to heat up. The wax museum is full of horror movie killers. This is not a new idea; the same arrangement worked best for the horror film one, nine hundred and sixty-six ""Trembling Room"". Although not as popular as the movie above, the setting power is used to produce the same negative effect, most of which is caused by a form of claustrophobia, which is brought to the museum by a limited area. Peter Cushing is always funny, and seeing him avoid lunatics with an tax is healing the horrible fans. Although it is my favourite, this story is still interesting enough to dispel this myth. The film goes on to say “good fun”, which is undoubtedly the best kind of show. The story plays Christopher Lee famous as a father who seems to be safe. The beauty of this story lies in the way it is interpreted. Get the audience to guess; We know that the girl's father has a problem, but we do not know who the is for who the is from. As usual, Christopher Lee portrayed the character in a very negative way. The act of giving the girl a doll, and not being table to go to school because of any toys, made the audience laugh at these actions. The card is the main reason holding on to the chest as close to sending, showing really cold lines. The send of this section is very good, in my opinion, this is one of the best ending to any scary story that has not been told, and will be with you long after you submit a list of credits. The full show ends with ""Dress"", which is the fourth joke. The story is about the horror stars of a recent movie that has no interest in technology. Naturally, this outfit turned into a real vampire costume. Unlike the other three stories, this one seems to be a joke. However, this is not a bad thing, because a lot of humour is funny and goes against the whole film. The send of the story coincides with the send of the movie. For a very good movie, this is a very bad and funny ending. Also, note the slightest mockery about Christopher Lee in Dracula. Nice touch, I think. Overall, if you want a horror movie, ""House of Blood"" is definitely not going to go wrong. The third story alone makes this movie very important in your time to watch it.",positive

27029,"Scary omnibus movies were popular in the seventies. I personally don’t like them, but it’s an undeniable and great piece of English horror cinema. The Bloody House is a scary omnibus, made up of four stories surrounding an old creeping country house and told by a real estate agent to Scotland Yard. The film is titled Three Famous Star Cinemas; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, who will be recognized by horror fans as one of Lee’s stars in the greatest British horror film never; Like Wicker. The first part of the film, titled “The Killing Procedure” tells the story of a sad author, who is the creator; a strangled man called “Dominic” is revived by this fantasy. This story well builds scepticism; through these friends, this, and the audience lead them to believe that what is seen is the imagination of this imagination. This story in’t really original, but it creates original ambiguity through the environment it creates and the latest twist; which will work well and come as a real surprise. The second story, titled “Waxworks”, is played by Peter Cushing and is my favourite of the four. This story follows the story of Phillip Grayson (Cushing), a man who finds a museum and decides to enter. Inside, the finds a woman who knows him and eventually finds out the is a murderer. Of course what the woman’s relationship was with Phillip in’t really explained, but the story relies on secrecy to generate suspicion rather than provide plot details. Cushing was later joined by this friend, Neville Rogers (played by Joss Ackland) and that’s where the story really began to take place. Setting up a waxwork museum full of murderers in a horror film is not a new idea; the same avenue was used to make a huge impact in one thousand, nine hundred and six and six horror films, “The Horror Scene”. Although one is not as big as the one in the film we mentioned, the power of the scene is used to reduce the traumatic effects, which are often achieved with a feeling of claustrophobia, caused by the museum’s limited space. Peter Cushing is always fun to watch, and seeing him avoid a mad and male tax is a cure for a panic attack. Although I love it, this story is still fun and exciting enough not to underestimate this biography. The film continues with “Sweet Dessert”, which is undoubtedly the best omnibus. This story describes the legendary Christopher Lee as a father who looks very protective. The beauty of this story comes from the way it is played. This leaves the audience to guess; We knew something was wrong with the girl’s father, but we did’t know who the was. Christopher Lee, as before, describes this character in a very serious and innocent way; Viewers were allowed to take care of these actions about giving this girl a doll, and the fact she was’t allowed to go to school to get playful. The card is exactly why it was kept close to the chest on the right near the transmission, marked by the actual cold line that Lee told the nanny that the was, in fact, afraid of this girl. By the send of this episode, it played out great, I think it’s one of the best at the send of any horror story that has’t been told, and it will stay with you for a long time after the submission points have been submitted. Omnibus completes “Bed”, which is definitely the fourth joke. This story is about a horror film star, who is not amazed at the technical side of this latest film, who comes out and buys a sheet. Usually, this fabric turns out to be a real vampire fabric. Unlike the other three stories, this one seems to be often played with laughter. That’s not a bad thing although most of the jokes are funny and serve as a nice contrast to the rest of the film. The ending of this story is great in conjunction with the ending of the filmmaking story, which is a horrible but funny ending that ends in a very good film. Also, check out a little bit about Christopher Lee’s Dracula. Nice touch, I think. In general, if you want a very good omnibus, you really can’t go wrong with Bleeding House.

31057,"This is one of those wonderful martial-arts movies that begin with two posses of tough gang members facing off in a park; and when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts, it turns out they all know karate and young of! The never-wooden Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, deadpan, good cop, this time in Los Angeles. She and her police partners are trying to break up a counterfeiting bring, and when that plot line is exhausted, the story just switches over to something else, and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy, great-looking tycoon. Within the film's obviously rock-bottom budget, there's some helicopter action, some speedboat action, some car chases, a brawl where Cynthia beats up everyone in a country-western bar, some swimming-pool scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis, and a surprisingly good horseback chase. About a dozen and a half cops get gunned down. A lot of plot twists happen that just don't make any sense; don't worry about them. (And counterfeiting currency is a federal crime, so where the hell is the FBI? I guess they were too busy.) The fight choreography was done by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent co-star Richard Taylor, whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and frankly she could use it; she seems tired and bored, and does her best acting in GUARDIAN ANGEL when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues. The dog almost out-acts her! She also wears some of the most god-awful clothing any leading lady has never worn in any movie: loose, baggy-leg jeans with pale acid-washed areas over each buttock were the most shocking. The other factors are all over the map. You can picture many of the minor characters being cast this way: ""Hey, me and some other guys I know are going to be in a movie. You wanna be in it too? No, dude, I'm serious!"" Then there are the slumming professionals: the most fun is Lydie Denier, the stunning French model and veteran of ""Red Shoe Diaries,"" ""Baywatch,"" ""Melrose Place,"" and of playing many, many other variations on the sexy French bombshell; there she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in BAISEZ-MOI for an ""Alias"" episode and not some direct-to-cable trash like this. There's also the tall, dark and handsome Daniel McVicar, now a regular on ""The Bold and the Beautiful,"" John O'Leary, who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again there, and Aharon Ipale, the veteran Arab character factor perhaps best known as ""Pharaoh Seti"" from THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL must be the most laughable entry on their resumes. I gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters, who are enthusiastic martial-arts students, both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change. They're still a bit too young to care what a low-quality picture this really was, and just enjoyed cheering Cynthia on as she did her swivel-legged, high-kicking, stick-fighting thing.

She also wore the most awesome outfits that any heroine did’t wear in any movie: loose, loose-fitting jeans, with light-weight straps on each waist, the most shocking.

For these professionals, the GUARDIAN ANGEL should be the funniest thing in their are-launch. Give me this movie a higher level than it should be, because my daughters are passionate about fighting karate and they all love to see a woman kicking her butt and having great transformation actions.

He and this police comrades try to break into the counterfeit money, and when the building block is removed, the story changes easily, and Cynthia becomes the guardian of the rich, good-looking man. Helicopter action within the film's budget, some boating action, chasing another car, a controversy in which Cynthia skills everyone in the western part of the country, some scenes of a swimming pool with a bamboo in Thong Bikini, And amazingly good horse racing. About a dozen police officers were shot. Don't worry about the many irregular structural changes that occur. (And counterfeit money is a corporate crime, so where is the FBI? I think they were very busy.) This fight was fought by Cynthia Rothrock, often star Richard Taylor, who was smart and beautiful in front of the camera. In a nutshell, this will be the best movie.

A young man Vinay, superbly played by a newly face lifted Dev Anand at page forty+, is estranged from this police officer Dad and finds a job in a jeweller's store. Soon random people come up to him and call him Amar. Using just a few pithy moments the presence of a ""doppelganger"" is established. Then a woman Shalini (Vyjayantimala) comes forward and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar) who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar the makes him take this shoe off and prove that the is not Aamr, the six toed one. The jeweller's super cute daughter Anju (Tanuja) is completely enamoured with Vinay. Amidst all this confusion there is a Jewel thief on the loose and the is stealing at will. Slowly we learn from Vinay's encounter with a super hot night club singer (Helen!) that the thief is Amar the doppelganger. Many many good looking women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) are after the hero. The police force, including Vinay's Dad, are completely befuddled. Vinay is slowly falling for Shalini/Shalu and her brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to Sikkim as that is where Amar's next heist is to occur. The rest is for you to watch - the duplicate, the girls, the men who hang on to Vinay's every word thinking the is their boss Amar, the loving brother sister duo - nothing seems quite right, and it takes the deft story telling (and direction) by Vijay Anand to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner. The movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously weave into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in Sikkim. I was not a big Vyjayanthi fan but she is quite competent there, although at her chubbiest. She is table to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way, but is best when she is sorrowful for dancing. Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in this film. I so badly wanted her to get the man. Dev was, well, Dev. If the were not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder always lower than the other) I would wonder who they had found to imitate him! Yet this style, charm and charisma were unfailing. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! Ashok Kumar was simply awesome - Dada Moni did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history books. SD Burman spun magic with numbers like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen in a blood red rooster limitation dancing on a bar top), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera, and my personal favourite seductive number Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye.

He was accompanied by this beloved brother (Ashok Kumar), who was very convinced that Vinay was indeed Amar, which led him to take off this shoes and prove that the was not Aamr, a six-toed shoe. The beautiful jewelry girl Anju (Tanuja) is obsessed with Vinay. Throughout the chaos there is a thief who is wide open and sweaty. Slowly, we learned about Vinay's encounter with the hottest nightclub singer (Helen!) That the thief was Amar's rock. Many beautiful women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) follow this hero. The police, including Vinay's father, were completely confused. Vinay is slightly in love with Shalini / Shalu, and this brother seems to be blessing the union. Work was sent to Sikkim because that was where Amar's next robbery took place. Some are based on you - reports, girls, men clinging to all the names of Vinay think this is their boss Amar, this loving brother - nothing seems right, It requires the telling of intelligent stories (and guidance) by Vijay Anand to send this story in a very interesting way.

I am not a big fan of Vyjayanthi, but the is very strong there, even though the was the richest man. That's the table, in addition to the chaos in the story in a subtle way, but the best one when it's sad about dancing. Tanuja is beautiful as a button, and I love her in this movie. I sincerely hope she finds that man. Dev, cum, Dev. If they don’t walk like a person with a birth defect (one shoulder is always less than the other), I want to know who they found to be like!

He is forty-eight years old, looks like a god, and this dancer is almost twenty years old to him. I’m happy to say that all the songs are being sung now, which is good because it sounds better how you sit. Each song is different and the visual effects are amazing. The inferno remix of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys touched me again.",positive

The show ‘Live to tell’ was amazing and I was amazed, ‘Isaaq’ is unique and beautiful and rich in political symbols, the Horn of Africa, the American eagle being liberated. It’s the kind of drama that only comes out every twenty years, and Madonna’s Confessions will surely be remembered in the dance floor season as one of the highest points of her career. He was forty -eight and looked holy, the had been with the dancers for almost twenty years. I’m also very happy to report that all the songs were sung directly, which is good because it really looks so good. Each song is unique, the scenes while amazing. Once again I admire the seventy remix inferno music.",positive

The performance of 'Live to tell' was fun and to my surprise 'Isac' was unusual and beautiful and full of political symbols, an Arab horn, a free American eagle. This concert is a kind of concert that comes every twenty years, so Madonna's confessions in the Dance Age will surely be remembered as one of the highlights of her career. She is forty-eight years old and looks spiritually beautiful, she continues with dancers who are about twenty years younger.

And then I was inspired by the inferno remix of the seventies.",positive
