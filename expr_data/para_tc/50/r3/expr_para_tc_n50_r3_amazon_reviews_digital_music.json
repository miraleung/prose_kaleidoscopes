This album may be one of the most neglected albums in your time stores. It is a pity that Source cd not provide these five microphones, as all shipping record records are worth more than any other record. If you do not have this album yet. Then explain it.

I, along with a legion of long-time fans, grieved the loss of this incredible singer and performer. Initially, this death at that particular time in this career seemed terribly unfair. After stagnating during the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy and early one thousand, nine hundred and heights, Orbison was back and perhaps even better than never in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. His collaboration with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, George Harrison, and Jeff Lynne in the form of The Traveling Wilburys had put him back in the national spotlight, and many of us longed for the new album soon to be released, an album we had heard nothing but incredibly good things about. Then, suddenly, the and the voice that touched your hearts for so many years, was gone. We, the fans, should have been rewarding Roy Orbison for all of the memories the gave us in song, yet, never the selfless and humble man the was, Orbison actually presented all of us with a final, precious gift in the form of the album Mystery Girl. Roy's wow Barbara deserves your heartfelt thanks for bravely putting the finishing touches on this album after her husband's death. Mystery Girl is simply an incredible album featuring a reenergize Roy Orbison easily uniting this unique voice to a modern sound that appealed to any number of years; the released tracks from this album found sample playing time on both pop rock and country radio stations. Perhaps the first single, You Got It, got too much attention, as it was nearly played to death over the course of the first half of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, but that is just a tribute to the wonderful beauty and infectious beat and rhythm of this song co-written by Orbison and Wilbury buddies Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty. The second track on the album, In the Real World, marks an abrupt change in stone; bringing to mind Roy's classic song In Dreams; Orbison captures your heard on the first note and soars with it through the clouds that only the possessed the means of exploring. This haunting track is, in my opinion, the best song on the album. Roy decides to rock a little bit on (All I Can Do Is) Dream You before stopping to wax poetic and heartbreaking on the slow ballad A Love So Beautiful, a song featuring a little musical support from co-writer Jeff Lynne and George Harrison. California Blue (another Orbison-Lynne-Petty venture), The Only One, and Windsurfer are great songs in their own right, but special attention must be shown the remaining three tracks. Careless Heart is a beautiful song of love and loss that seems to convey a sense of the type of feelings we felt over the loss of this man taken much too soon from your midst. She's a Mystery To Me, written by Utwo's Bono and The Edge, presents Roy with a slightly different type of song that the easily makes this own, hitting the high notes perfectly on the choruses. Then there is The Comedians, a song written by Elvis Costello; this is vintage Roy Orbison, delivering a strikingly visual display of betrayal and loss, the very subjects Roy seemed to understand more than any other singer out there. Mystery Girl is a very special album that Roy Orbison fans will treasure and play often for the rest of your lives. I wish Roy would have lived to see the incredible reception this album received from fans, but one can take comfort in the fact that Orbison left this world on top where the always belonged.","overall":5,"summary":"A final, precious gift from Roy to his fans","unixReviewTime":1055376000,"reviewTime":"06 12, 2003"}

This CD is wonderful for you I have every album they make and listen to every opportunity I get. I have this CD and there is also what I think - this is the first Heatwave. This is probably the first time that hard -hitting characters have never entered a recording studio and are made up of multiple plays - dance music \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d, an part based on the tune \u201cAin\u2019 it No Half Steppin \", an unforgettable soul of dessert\" Ever and Ever \"and cut. The interesting thing is how much, for the rest of this band, Heatwave is trying to copy KC & The Sunshine Band, BrassConstruction, Rufus and other funk and disco bands of the time. It does\u2019t look personally like the best albums like \u2018Central Heat\u2019 and \u2018Hot Assets\u2019 because Heatwavedown showcased their jazzier standards preferring simple party music. While iTunes like the soft \u201cLay It On Me\u201d and the funkof which means \u201cSuper Soul Sister\u201d don\u2019t sound very good this group won\u2019t develop, and I\u2019ll point out that I\u2019m very biased in this opinion . too! And close the door, the nonsense of \u201cBeat Your Booty\u201d is the only shame - the only real thing in Heatwave because it\u2019s step and unbelievable words. So I suggest to anyone interested in Heatwave music (and you should be) first pick up \u2018Central Heating\u2019 and then carefully leave the thousands of them, nine hundred and eighty-two \u2018Now\u2019 ( that is if you still have the table to turn) and get the latest \u2018Hot To Handle\u2019 because it\u2019s just not the complete picture of Heatwave\u2019s funk dance routine as it used to be.

In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, Streisand was still releasing one album a year, but the fact that the released Superman just six months after \"A Star Is Born\" is very unusual, especially since the soundtrack is still on the chart. He is ranked among the best. Success has already begun, and Superman's songs continue to prove that Barbra, a singer who cd not make a chart of independent songs ten years ago, is now entering a new category, and has been welcomed by radio. The media referred to the six-month release of \"Born Star\" and \"Superman\" as \"one Streisand Punch and two Punch!\" There karen\u2019t many teenage musicians (if any) who can release a album titled \u201cSuperman\u201d - -But it seems worthwhile. Streisand is known for this bravery, wearing white pants and a white shirt with a Superman logo on this seemingly appropriate album. The title and photo show that the entertainment queen has a ball. Although the had a successful career before seventy-seven years, it seems the has reached a high level. This is very appealing to this fans, and very annoying to this critics. Now that I\u2019ve used Streisand\u2019s official packaging and a lot of inside photos of Steve Shapiro, let\u2019s start listening to music. Streisand has finally released a full-length pop album, this album is in perfect harmony and right for him. These songs include popular songs, such as the song \"My Heart Is Mine\", ranked fourth on the Billboard Top one hundred Singles Board, and fun sonatas, including \"Love comes from the most unexpected place\", made of Prolific Gold Carnes, Rock and Back. From the opening title song, Streisand's song rises above the clouds, so that when the sings the words \"I'm Superman\" with a strong belief, you believe you're Superman! The whole album is very interesting; it\u2019s like cotton candy in summer games. The only thing that says \"Can't believe what you're reading\". Although the song was composed by Streisand, the lyrics are also great, and the details of this life are explained in the tabloid, but the guitar instruments are not crooked when repeating popular rhythms. On the other hand, another song written by Songbird is a beautiful ballad \"Answer Me\", which was written for A Star Is Born. Although it did not complete the film with sound, fortunately it finally appeared on this album. Top hits such as \"I've Found Love\" and \"Cabin Fever\" capture Streisand's play, and because of this outstanding success in the genre \"A Star Is Born\" (although many critics say so), so the continues to show. its versatility as a top musician and can capture almost all musical styles. Speaking of which, the even covered Roger Miller's little country song \"Baby Me Baby\". Two of the highlights are the last two albums of the album, the brilliant Billy Joel of \"New York State of Mind\" and Rupert Holmes' independent holy code \"My Own Lullaby\". Billy Joel's performance on Streisand's brilliant speech \"New York State of Mind\" was \"delighted\", and the latter remarked: \"My mother now knows I have succeeded because Barbra Streisand has recorded one of my songs.\" Barbra Streisand has done a very good job. He conquered almost all entertainment entertainment. It was a matter of time before the took control of the world of pop music. If there's one word to describe Superman Streisand, it's \"confidence.\" This is one of the best albums in Streisand Records.","overall":5,"summary":"One of her best!","unixReviewTime":1248048000,"reviewTime":"07 20, 2009"}

Michael turned into both a zombie and a werewolf in the over, and it is safe to say this video changed the music video industry forever. The duet The Girl Is Mine probably inspired Brandy & Monica's song The Boy Is Mine, and is a great song that is both humorous and serious at the same time. There was a guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen in the song, and in the video Michael brought two real life street gangs together for a huge dance scene. One of my personal favourites is Track #one, Wanna Be Startin Something, which has infectious opening that will be stuck in your head for a very long time. MTV has even picked Michael Jackson's Thriller video as the best video of all time at some point for another.

In the course of this life the released exactly one album; it could have been the first of a stunning catalogue, and there's no telling what the might have done if the than't drowned in a boating accent. Oh sure, there are a couple other releases to give some hints; a live album for two, one compilation of unreleased tracks-in-progress, and one disc of assorted early demos. (I guess the never made quite the same posthumous-productivity deal with the devil that Jimi Hendrix did.) But this is the only finished product we have to listen to, and as much of a treasure as it is, to me it seems simply a warmup for some future masterpiece we'll never hear. Grace is hard to describe easily. At heart it's basically rock and roll, but. it's rock with one foot in the blues, one foot in the folk tradition, its hands reaching out to space and its voice in the heavens. Ahhhh. Jeff does things with this vocal cords that seem to push the boundaries of what's humanly possible. It's undeniably distinct from the first time the eerie wails of \"Mojo Pin\" slowly bloom into existence, eventually giving way to a slow-burning verse full of raw emotion. His high register may take some getting used to, but Jeff's singing does tricks and turns I've rarely heard from anyone. reaching its speak midway through the album in the lonely desolation of this most well-known cover, \"Hallelujah.\"Like many others, I'm particularly partial to that one. (Hey: if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best, and lyricists don't come better than Leonard Cohen.) This track best demonstrates just how special this talent was - with just a guitar and voice the pours this entire heart out for the world to hear, managing to sound soul-weary, powerfully spirited and nervously frail all at once. I could easily imagine the wistful \"Lilac Wine\" being an exceptional standout ballad on an album from anyone else, but there it has to take second place. Even the half-cliched lyric of \"Lover, You Should've Come Over\" sounds nothing but compelling just due to Jeff's soul-baring vocal performance. Incidentally, that tune has one of the most fitting uses of an morgan I've heard in a rock song; it starts with a creepy Phantom-of-the-Opera stone, but mellows out into something that sounds almost like an accordion. Perfect. Only four stars, then? Well, as much as I'm tempted to give a perfect rating because so much of Grace still blows me away (and considering the special rating usually reserved for talented artists who die young), I still can't call this one perfect. \"So Real\" drags with repetition at times, and the degree of contrast between the whisper-quiet verse and the crashing drum-filled chorus can grate on my nerves. \"Corpus Christi Carol\" is too much like a church hymn for my taste. (Go figure, meh?)Jeff and crew liven things up now and then amid all the easy-paced ballads. \"Last Goodbye\" is surprisingly sunny, jogging along with a bouncy beat and a happy string arrangement, though the major-keyed melody in't enough to hide the sadness in the words. \"Eternal Life\" can be a downer, but it's a downer with a lot of lively singing, mad kicking drums and some killer guitar hooks. True to form, it slides into something slower and almost spooky with \"Dream Brother.\" Like the rest of the disc, that one leaves me with an unshakable sense of something almost foreboding, yet hopeful in the middle of it all. There's something otherworldly about it all. OK, looks like I've been long-winded enough. Grace in't an album I can wholeheartedly recommend to anyone at all, but I can state that if you've got an year for a fine musical performance and a real feeling for soul-stirring music, you'll probably be well-served there.

It is a rock, one foot in the blues, one foot in the traditional tradition, its arms outstretched in space, and its voice is in heaven. Tshotsho. What Jeff did with this cord seemed to violate the human limit. It is undeniable that this and the strange wailing of the first \"Mojo Pin\" erupted quickly, and finally gave way to a burning verse full of ancient emotions. His top list may take some time to get used to, but Jeff\u2019s singing is something I rarely hear from anyone. In the loneliness and desolation of this famous cover \"Hallelujah\", talk in the middle of the album. Like many others, I prefer it.

I can easily assume that the coveted \u201clilac wine\u201d is the best ball on anyone\u2019s album, but let it be in second place. Because of Jeff's voice performance and, even the semi-cliche \"lover, you have to come over\" sounds very appealing. By the way, this song is one of the best Morgan songs I've never heard of rock songs. It started with the powerful stone of the Phantom-of-the-Opera, but gradually turned into something almost like a cone. you are the best. Only four stars, right? Well, although I would like to give a perfect level, because most of the Graces are still shocking (and considering the special standards are always reserved for talented young artists), I have not yet called it perfect. \"Really\" sometimes vitals and repeats, and the difference between the quiet verses and the audible chorus of the songs can make me nervous. \"Corpus Christi Carol\" is like church music to me. (Think about it, meh?) Jeff and the staff work from time to time on all the slow-moving ballads. \u201cFinal Farewell\u201d is an unexpected day, running with fast rhythms and lively arrangements, although a great music song is not enough to hide the grief in the songs. \"Eternal Life\" can be a stressful place, but it is a distraction for cloud singing, crazy kick drums, and other guitar-killing pins. As a form, it slides into something slower and almost scary with \"Dream Brother\". Like any other CD, it gave me a steady feeling, a warning that was almost completely dangerous, but there was hope in the midst of it all. All of this is like another country. Well, it looks like I'm tall enough. Grace in is not an album that I would recommend wholeheartedly to anyone, but I would say that if you have a year to enjoy great music and really feel awesome music, you can find good service there.

Jeff does something with these sound strings that seems to be pushing the boundaries of what people are capable of. It\u2019s undeniable that at first the ugly cry of \u201cMojo Pin\u201d slowly erupted, and finally it gave way to a verse that was gradually fiery and full of raw emotions. His top record may be pretty adaptable, but Jeff\u2019s songs produce deception and satire No one has never heard of. It takes him to the middle of the desert through this sad cover album, \"Hallelujah.\" Like many others, I exclusively belong there.

This track clearly shows how unique this talent is - with a guitar and a sound pouring in. wholeheartedly it. out to be heard by the world, look tired, energetic and emotional at the same time.

Only one album has been released during this lifetime. It would be the first of its kind in an amazing catalog, and there is no indication that it could have done so had it not been for the sinking of the boat. Oh, of course, there are some other releases to offer some suggestions: a dual live album, a collection of releases released, and a disc for various original demos. (I don't think there has never been such a production deal with the devil created by Jimmy Hendricks after this death.) But it's the only finished product we should listen to, and with as much wealth as this To me, it's just the warmth of some future part that we'll never hear. Kindness is hard to appreciate. However, there are basically rock and roll. There is a rock with one foot in the blues, one foot in the tradition of humanity, its hands reaching to the sky and their voice is in the heavens. Ahh. Jeff works with vocal strings that seem to push human boundaries. It is undeniable that this is different from the first time that the terrible cry of \"Mojopin\" slowly comes into being, finally offering a slightly warmer verse full of raw emotions. His high record may take some time, but Jeff's songs have some tricks and twists that I've never heard from anyone. It reaches its climax on the album in the solitude of this well-known cover, \"Crescent.\" Like so many others, I love it. (Hey: If you're going to borrow, borrow from the best, and songwriters don't do better than Leonard Cohen.) I can easily assume that the smart \"lilac wine\" on the album has a great ballad from someone else, but there it should take second place. Even half the song \"Honey, You Should Come This Way\" sounds like nothing more than pressure from Jeff's breathing work. Obviously, this track has the best use of Morgan I've never heard in a rock song. It starts with a terrifying rock, the Phantom of the Opera, but Melo comes out of something that looks almost like an accordion. That's exactly right. Only four stars, then? Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds pretty crap to me Maybe it's perfect. \"So real\" pulls again and again, and the level of difference between a silent verse in a whisper and a chorus full of exploding drums can affect my emotions. \"Corpus Christi Carroll\" is very similar to the church hymn in my taste. (Isn't that right?) Jeff and the team are fixing things and then all the blades move smoothly in between. \"Final Farewell\" is surprisingly sunny, with a cheerful rhythm and cheerful chord arrangement, though a big key song is not enough to hide the sadness of the lyrics. \"Eternal Life\" may be short, but it's a sculpture with a lot of passionate singing, crazy kick drums and other guitar playing hooks. In fact, it got a little stuck and almost messed with \"Dream Brother\". Like all discs, it leaves me with an immovable idea of \u200b\u200bsomething terrifying, but optimistic in the midst of it all. Everything is different. Well, it looks like I've had enough.

The album was initially released as a holdover until the band's next studio album would be released later that year (the classic Hotel California) but this Eagles Greatest Hits would sell so consistently that it would hit #one immediately on the US Billboard Album Chart and stayed there for five weeks. Plus, the album would get the first Platinum album award just introduced earlier in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six by the RIAA for a over a million copies sold and to date is the best selling album of all time there in the US alone with over twenty-nine million copies sold. It overtook Michael Jackson's Thriller in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine as US album sales champ and it is because The Eagles were mainly about the music whilst the late Michael Jackson's personal and legal troubles would cost him from popularity in the US and blacklisted\/tarnished (until this suite in June of two thousand and nine boosted this dead album sales as the was in debt and past this prime) whilst The Eagles continue to thrive, even now in two thousand and eleven. Back to this Greatest Hits (which I've owned on weight-track, LP, cassette, CD and (the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine) remastered CD, the album consists of ten tracks from the band's first four studio albums. The one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two self-titled debut is represented by the Top twenty hits \"Take it Easy\" (reached #thirteen), \"Witchy Woman\" (which hit #nine) and \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\" (which hit the Top thirty).one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three's Desperado is represented by its title cut (a classic album cut that is great despite the fact it was int never a hit) and \"Tequila Sunrise\" (a song which tanked on the singles chart), both classics.one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four's On the Border is represented by the rocker \"Already Gone\" (the Top forty hit from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four) and the band's first #one single \"Best of My Love\".one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five's chart-topper One of These Nights is represented by the #one funk-laced title cut and the Top five smashes being the country tinged \"Lyin' Eyes\" and the ballad \"Take it To the Limit\". Drummer Don Henley, guitarist Glenn Frey, guitarist Bernie Leadon and bass player Randy Meisner plus late arrival guitarist Don Felder on these highlights from The Eagles' first four albums created timeless classics that are still getting airplay on classic rock and\/or album rock radio plus again new fans today.

Of course, if you are a fan, then you probably already have heard this album a thousand times and agree with me, but if you are the latter, you will be surprised at how intense and how artistic this album is. Up until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine Phil dominated both TV and radio airwaves with this suave and cool music videos and songs, ranging from the sweet rock coolness of In The Air Tonight to the bubbly pop of Two Hearts. But Seriously gave Phil a new credibility. Here the is more than just that, the is a perfectionist artist. The first single showed, for the first time, Phil Collins singing a different tune from this past hits, a song about the poor and homeless, Another Day In Paradise. The song became a worldwide anthem that year sparking repeated airplay and learning the grammy for best song. For many, this song is the highlight of the album. But in truth, its just one of a lot of highlights. Actually, the entire album was the highlight of the moment. The maturity of That's Just The Way It Is, Father To Son, and All Of My Life can easily cast over Another Day In Paradise. The sweet love ballad Do You Remember?, which appears in the soundtrack of Nicholas Cage's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety bomb Fire Birds, is deliciously good. The chilling rock epic I Wish It Would Rain Down that features guitar work from Eric Clapton dawns as a remarkable highlight on the album. Colors follows in the theme of Another Day In Paradise as a moment to give a thought to the poor and homeless. The album's closer Find A Way To My Heart, another track that was featured in the soundtrack to the Nicholas Cage flop Fire Birds, is an excellent pick for the closing of such a genuine album. The song opens up with some really cool electronic sounds and then slowly escalates and progresses into one big bang of a song. Phil Collins still is around today, still making music but nothing as good as But Seriously. You might still think this earlier stuff from the early eighty's was amazing, but seriously, this is Phil Collins' best album!

Yes, if you are a fan you may have heard this album a thousand times and agreed with me, but if you are the last album then you will be amazed at how strong and talented this album is. From the cool rocking of The Air Tonight to the popping pop of Two Hearts, one, nine hundred Phils hosted both TV and radio stations with these cool songs and music and songs. But deep down, it gave Phil a new please of life. Here's more, a perfect artist. The first show of its kind, for the first time, Phil Collins sang a different song from the previous one, a song about the poor and homeless, another day in heaven. The song became an international song that gave birth to warplanes again and again this year and learned to using the best song. For many, this song is different from the album. But really, it's one of the best. In fact, the whole album was the highlight of the season. Just the way it is, father to son, and the maturity of my whole life can easily pass another day in heaven. Nicholas Cage's Firebirds Music, One Thousand Bombs, and the Ninety-Nine Do You Remember? The beautiful song is incredibly interesting. Kolk Rock I Wish It Dai Rain Down, featuring Eric Clapton's guitar performances, begins as a salient feature of the album. The color follow the theme, another day in heaven as a reflection of the poor and homeless. The upcoming song Find the Way My Heart, another song featuring Nicholas Cage Flop Firebirds, is a great way to close out a real album. The song opens with really cool electric sounds and then slowly rises to the cloud sound of the song. Phil Collins still exists today, still making music but not as good as but deeply.

It's maybe Tori's best lyrically! Tori branches out and uses the Bosendorfer instead of the piano. It's very interesting the creativity in her music on this album.'Pele' offers us eighteen songs, all captivating and unique. I cd't know about Tori until about three years ago so I bought all her previous albums at once. thing is, this used to be my least favourite. I gave it ONE listen (stupid, I know) and I was so wrapped up in 'Little Earthquakes' and 'From the Choirgirl Hotel' that I never picked it up again. Until earlier this year and I discovered how amazingly beautiful and harsh this album really is. The album opens with the short \"intro\" 'Beauty Queen', showcasing Tori's vocal range and depth. 'Horses' is beautifully written, it's a slower song and sucks you in to the rest of the album. 'Blood Roses' is lyrically my favourite. It is absolutely different and Tori's vocals are amazing: 'I shaved every place where you've been boy' - pooh. 'Father Lucifer' is another slower song featuring some controversial lyrics. 'Professional Widow' - what to say about this - everyone knows 'Widow', it's a downright raw emotional song that is perfect for after the breakup. Get your danger out. 'Mr. Zebra' is a short, sweet sounding song but I haven't actually grasped the true meaning of it. yet. 'Marianne' is slow, a tragic sounding song. 'Caught A Lite Sneeze' is absolute brilliance! Her voice will capture you 'beauty, stumbling down, did't know your love was so small, could't stand at all, Mr. St. John just bring your son'. 'Muhammad My Friend' has always been a favourite of mine, it's beautiful lyrically and pleasant musically. This one tells a story unlike any other. 'Hey Jupiter' is probably one of the best songs I've heard in years. It's gorgeous and this song could ONLY be done by Tori, nobody can match her vocals. No one. 'Way Down' is another short song like 'Mr. Zebra', nothing bad there. 'Little Amsterdam' is another one of my favourites, her voice again 'Mama, it was't my bullet' her presence is felt through her voice and lyrics. Chills! 'Talula' has got this crazy Harpsichord going on, very strange musically but nothing blacks lyrically. 'Not The Red Baron' is a quiet, slow song and tragic, when Tori sings 'just another pilot down' - it sends chills down your tickling spine. 'Agent Orange' is a weird song, I must confess. It's a short song, again but unique and fun to listen to. 'Doughnut Song' is ridiculously good. These are the kind of songs you get warmth from and you just want to tell the world about it. 'In The Springtime of this Voodoo' is fun to listen to, it's upbeat and extremely different. 'Putting The Damage On' is like 'Doughnut Song' - it's beautiful but this one is more tragic, 'boy you still look pretty when you're putting the damage on' . pooh. Lastly, 'Twinkle' a nice song and the perfect ending to a great, powerful and music breaking record. Tori Amos has become my favourite female performer, she's the most talented woman on this planet and I've loved everything she's done.

Earlier this year I noticed how beautiful and rough this album is. The album briefly opened with \"Introduction\" \"Queen of Beauty\", which shows Tori's range and depth. 'Horses' are well written, a slow song that will immerse you in another album. \u2018Blood Roses\u2019 is my favourite wording. This is completely different. Tori's singing is amazing: \"I shaved all over the place where the boy was born\" - Bah. \"Father Lucifer\" is another slow-moving song that contains conflicting lyrics. \u2018Professional Widow\u2019 \u2014 how to put it - everyone knows\u2018 Widow \u2019, this is the first emotional song, most suitable for a song after a breakup. Discard your risk. Manene. Zebra 'is a short and sweet song, but I have yet to discover its true meaning. Even thought. 'Marianne' is very slow, a song that sounds sad. 'Lite Sneezing Catch' is so fun! His voice will catch you beautiful, you will stumble, I don't know if your love is small, I can't stand it at all, Mr. John is taking your son '. 'Muhammad My Friend' has always been my favourite, with music and fun, and music is fun. This story is a special story. \"Hey Jupiter\" is probably one of the best songs I've heard over the years.

Cold! 'Talula' performed this crazy harpsichord game. It's very unusual in music, but it's not dark in song. 'No Raron Baron' is a quiet, slow and scary song, as Tori sings \"Just another pilot\" - it will make you pitch. 'Agent Orange' is a strange song, I have to admit. This is a short song, but it's also unique and interesting. \"Donuts Song\" is very fun. These are songs that you get warm to, you just want to tell the world. \u2018During the Voodoo Spring\u2019 season sounds exciting, hopeful, and very different. 'Putting Damage On' is like a 'Doughnut Song' - nice, but this is even sadder, 'boy, when you do damage, you still look good'. Phoh.

{"orig_index":15128,"reviewerID":"AC0Z6U9OWFRT0","asin":"B000002KH3","reviewerName":"Daniel Maltzman","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Van Halen's self-titled debut is undoubtedly one of the finest albums in the history of rock. Only Guns N' Roses debut, \"Appetite for Destruction\" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) can possibly compete with \"Van Halen\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight) in terms of greatness in the hard rock genre. \"Van Halen\" is the definitive rock album that set the stage for almost every hard-rock band from the one thousand, nine hundred and heights. Poison, RATT, Quiet Riot, Warrant, Cinderella, Dokken, LA Guns, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, and many more, all took their cue from Van Halen.\"Van Halen,\" is the prototype that set the stage for the decade to follow. Every singer wanted to be like Dav Lee Roth, and every guitar player wanted to be Eddie Van Halen. Dave and Eddie were gods, truly rock in' roll icons if never there were any. Van Halen's debut introduced the world to Diamond David Lee Roth. Roth is truly a maverick in the annals of rock. As journalist Malcolm Dome writes \"Roth was not merely a frontman, not just a vocalist, but a volcanic eruption of cabaret, Vaudeville, rock in roll and Las Vegas\" (Excess All Areas, Castle Communications, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four). While the band and the songs on Van Halen's debut are top notch, it is Roth that gives them the magic touch. If Sammy Hagar had been Van Halen's vocalist in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight \"Van Halen\" would have been a great album, no doubt, but not the masterpiece that it is. Without Dave, Vince Neil, Brett Michaels, Sebastian Bach, Kid Rock, Anthony Kiedis, among others would have had to look elsewhere for inspiration. Van Halen's debut showcased Eddie Van Halen. With \"Van Halen,\" Eddie reinvented the language of guitar. His trademark tapping and laser-fast hammer-ons became the blueprint for a generation of future guitar players. Steve Vai, George Lynch, Zack Wylde, Jerry Cantrell and Billy Corgan among others were all heavily influenced by Eddie Van Halen. Drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony provided a stunning rhythm section. Alex Van Halen's drumming was intense, without being bombastic. While Michael Anthony in't the most famous member of VH, this playing was the glue the bound the sound together. And with Eddie Van Halen on guitar, a flashy bass player may have been too much. Most importantly, Anthony's signature high-pitched background vocals and harmonies were the perfect counterpart to Roth's bluesy baritone delivery. Together, the four members were an unstoppable, rock in' roll machine that bulldozed over all competitors and created six of the best albums in the history of rock. As Roth once commented, if you put a Van Halen album in your shelf, it will melt all the other records in your collection. Roth has commented in this autobiography, \"Crazy from the Heat,\" (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven) the band sounded as good as it did because they played live in the studio without a lot of overdubs. He points out that while the band would record a song three for four times, the first take was usually the best, because it was \"distraction fee, fear free\" and the band was not self-conscious. Roth notes how with classic Van Halen, you can hear and make out each individual instrument-guitar, bass, drums, vocals, very clear and separate. Nowhere is this more apparent than on Van Halen's debut. Roth also notes in this book that the two major albums popular at the time of the recording of \"Van Halen\" were \"Saturday Night Fever\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven) and \"Nevermind the Bullocks, there's the Sex Pistols\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven). Roth notes that \"Van Halen\" was somewhere in between both albums. It was danceable, celebratory, and polished, yet intense, fast, and furious. Every song on \"Van Halen\" is a winner. Every song is a highlight. Every song is catchy and melodic with a good hook and groove. It's no small wonder why almost every song from \"Van Halen\" is a staple on any classic rock station. The mid-tempo, bluesy, \"Runnin' with the Devil\" gets the album off to a great start. The backwards car horn intro, pounding bass, high-pitched screams, and killer solos were the perfect way to introduce to the world to the mighty Van Halen. With \"Eruption\" Eddie shows this chops in this mold-breaking solo. A cover of the Kinks \"You Really Got Me\" proves to be better than the original. The opening riff of \"Ain't Talkin' `Bout Love\" is one of the most well known intros of all-time. From the classic opening, to Dave's cocky delivery, to Eddie's killer solos, this remains an all time classic. They don't make songs like this anymore. The rapid-fire \"I'm the One\" takes \"Van Halen\" into warp-speed. Alex's jazzy drumming, Michael Anthony's background harmonies, and Dave's bohemian delivery over Eddie's full-throttle assault makes this song head straight for the jugular. The do-wop ending right before the grand finale is the perfect touch. The album slows down a notch for the cocky-but-sensitive \"Jamie's Cryin.\" High on melody, no one could using this song like Dave. This song is so catchy you'll be singing it in the shower after just one listen. The sci-fi themed \"Atomic Punk\" grabs you by the collar and refuses to let go. It has a crazed, paranoid, chaotic feel, without loosing structure. The triumphant \"Feel Your Love Tonight\" is a celebration of the splendour and naivety of youth. No matter how old you are for where you are in life, this song will make you feel good. The album slows down for the subdued \"Little Dreamer,\" which is one of the only real cheerless song on the album. An code to a closer with lost dreams, Roth seems to pity the protagonist. This song, with its eerie background vocals is haunting and submissive yet powerful and edgy. The mood lightens up a bit for the tongue-in-cheek \"Ice Cream Man\" which adds a bit of humour to the album.\"On Fire\" is one of Van Halen's most underrated songs. It's one of the heaviest, most rocking songs they have never recorded. But in an album chock-full of classics, it's easy to see why it has been overlooked. I have listened to \"Van Halen\" hundreds of times and have never grown tired of hearing it. In addition, there are a lot of subtleties going on, so whenever I do listen to it, I often hear something new that I haven't heard before.\"Van Halen\" is flawless and sounds as good today as it did in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. In terms of instrumental firepower, showmanship, tight compositions, melody, and overall memorable songs, few albums can compete. While every rock fan should own the first six Van Halen albums, \"Van Halen\" is absolutely essential to any good collection. The two thousand remaster addition of \"Van Halen\" is an improvement over the original CD release. Now every nook and cranny can be made out and enjoyed for years to come. In the years to come, the universe will continue to expand, suns will die and turn into black holes, politicians will lie and be embedded in scandal, trends will come and go, bands will rise and fall, but \"Van Halen\" will never be outshone.","overall":5,"summary":"The album that broke the mold","unixReviewTime":1130544000,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2005"}

Also, the album cover is instantly recognizable; it's now a classic album cover (I've always liked it, not sure why but the smoking angel painting always looked amazing to me). As you probably know by now, \"Jump\" was the huge hit from this album. \"Jump\" relied heavily on synths, a catchy chorus and a dose of metal. Perhaps I've heard it too many times by now but it's still an amazing song and I can't deny it's a classic. \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" the song is just a one minute synths intro to \"Jump\" and does't have much significance besides being an introduction, nothing great about it either but it does set the listener up for the next song. Sounds kinda futuristic. \"Panama\" is one of my favourite Van Halen songs, this is quintessential Van Halen with the band at its very best. The intro gets you right into it and the breakdown at the send is fantastic with the engine noise and all, I can't say enough good things about this song. If you think \"Jump\" is a bit two commercial \"Panama\" will be right in your valley. \"Top Jimmy\" is another one that is loved by fans, an excellent song what can I say? \"Drop Dead Legs\" sounds like it was influenced by Led Zeppelin which I suspect was the case since the band are after all, fans of Zeppelin! Listen to that riff and drum beat and tell me it does't sound even a little like LZ, good track. \"Hot For Teacher\" is pure VH, fast, dirty, upbeat and sexual, how can you not like it and be a Van Halen fan? After all these years I'm willing to bet they're still \"for teacher\", Dave sounds amazing there. \"I'll Wait\" is another synth-driven song and being slower-paced has some characteristics of a ballad but it's a really a great slow rocker with some excellent lyric. An underrated song in my opinion. \"House of Pain\" closes the album nicely, hard rock to the chore and a fitting way to send a fantastic album. Not to put down the band's other albums but one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of two essential Van Halen albums (the other one being the self-titled debut) that should be part of a good rock `n' roll\/metal music collection. If you're new to Van Halen this is a fine place to start, I'd still recommend starting with the band's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight self-titled debut but you can't go wrong with one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four was the last studio album to feature \"Diamond\" David Lee Roth on vocals who was at the top of this game, the following year Roth and Van Halen would go their own ways. I have nothing against Sammy Hagar and love myself some Van Hagar but when it comes to VH it does't get much better than this!

The debut was fun and catchy even if silly, \"Broken Frame\" was kind of unfocused but had a couple of highlights, and \"Construction Time\"'s singles were classics but otherwise was mostly undistinguishable.twenty-three years later, people can probably still identify with \"Some Great Reward.\" Why is this? Not only is this a classic example of a well-done industrial-pop Mode album, the lyrics are simple and are easy to relate to. In fact, the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in \"It Doesn't Matter,\" \"Stories of Old,\" and \"Somebody.\" two of the three selections are sung by Martin. \"IDM\" is an awesome dreamy song, in a way unlike anything I've even heard from this band since. It's about appreciating the time they have, even if they know it may not last forever. And there's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on \"Stories of Old,\" possibly my favourite from the record. \"Somebody\" is one of the more famous tracks from the album, and is well-executed, along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix. It is a beautiful soul-searching track. That does't mean the other six songs karen't any good; they are. And perhaps more than that. The weakest cut, by default, is \"Lie to Me,\" and I enjoy that one, as that even has lyrics someone can relate to. Experiences have a lasting impression, and I'm sure we've been around those. The album has an awesome opener with \"Something to Do,\" one of the most stadium-ready songs of DM's early career. The record also has the band's breakthrough hit \"People Are People.\" The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite, but what's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song. The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener's attention. It was a hit that was meant to happen. Then there's the awesome Wilder composition \"If You Want.\" The track is electronic and somewhat space-y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album, in between the somewhat shocking (at the time, at least) \"Master and Servant\" and \"Blasphemous Rumors.\" \"Master\" starts with a trade-off a capella with Martin and Dave saying \"it's a lot,\" ending it with \"like life.\" It's a dark song for sure, the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs, and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme. Then there's teenage angst and irony in \"Blasphemous Rumors,\" which has kind of interesting samples and electronics. I don't really think it's intended as an anti-religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy, like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong. Still, an enjoyable track. There are no negative reviews for this record and the people who do in the future are probably just trying anyway. This began DM's cult success of the mid-'eighty's, and rightfully so.

The lyrics are simple and still enticing and make a great addition to the album, between the somewhat surprising (so far, at least) \"Master and Servant\" and \"Blasphemy.\" \"Master\" begins with a capella exchange with Martin and Dave saying \"it's a lot,\" and ends with \"like life.\" This is definitely a dark song, the first time that masochism has been tolerated by DM songs, and Martin will continue to write a few more songs on the subject. There\u2019s also the danger and resentment of teenagers at \u201cInsulting Gossip,\u201d which has some sort of interesting specs and electronic devices. I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant to be a counter-religious song as it\u2019s a disastrous trajectory, that how anything can go wrong will ultimately go wrong. Still, happy ending. There have been no negative reviews for this record, and manufacturers will likely still try it out in the future. It started with DM\u2019s success in worship in the pm \u2019eightys, and rightly so. Completely cheaper, because if you want better sound, you can go for the CD \/ DVD format.","overall":5,"summary":"Mode's first masterpiece.. it's a lot like life","unixReviewTime":1172966400,"reviewTime":"03 4, 2007"}

The first one was entertaining and catchy though it was silly, the \"broken frame\" was less focused but had a few highlights, and the singles for \"Construction Time\" were old but otherwise incomprehensible. Twenty-three years later, people probably don't. It's still about \"some great reward.\" why like this? It's not just an old-fashioned example of a well-crafted industrial pop-mode album, the characters are simple and easy to relate to. In fact, the central medium of the record has its own trinity of relationship songs \"It Doesn't Matter\", \"Old Stories\" and \"Someone\". Two of the three selections are sung by Martin. \"IDM\" is a beautiful dream song, unlike anything I've heard from this group. It's about appreciating the time they have, for knowing that maybe we can't live forever. And \"Old News\" has a different approach to commitment and compromise, which is probably my favourite of the record. \"No\" is one of the album's most popular songs, and it's well-designed, with some interesting patterns in the mix. A beautiful song that seeks the soul. That does't mean the other six songs are wrong. Of course. And maybe even more. The weakest cut by default is \"I'm flying\" and I enjoy it, because it has words that anyone can understand. There is a lasting impression of experience, and I am sure we have always been in it. The album is a great opening for \"To Do Something\", one of the songs that paved the way for DM's first work. The record also includes the band's hit song \"People Are People\". You may not like the band and the lyrics are mediocre, but surprisingly many bands still cover this song today. Pipes connected to the song draw the listener's full attention. It was a hit that was about to happen. Then there's Wilder's amazing design, \"If You Want It.\" The track is electronic and says place-y. Simple but catchy melodies add a nice touch to the album, including some shocking (at least) \"King and Servant\" and \"Blasphemy Rumors\". \"Master\" begins with Capella trading with Martin and Dave and ends with saying \"a lot\" like \"life\". A very deep song, for the first time Moscowism will have a theme in DM songs, and Martin will write some theme tracks. Then there are teenagers' danger and frustration at \"blasphemous rumours,\" which are both interesting and electronic. I don't think its purpose is to using against religion because it is a series of catastrophes, as if everything that goes wrong with a person goes wrong. Anyway, great track. There are no negative reviews for this record and those who will do so in the future will try anyway. It started with the success of the DM program in the pm-eightys, and rightly so. This is very expensive, because if you want a well-crafted sound, you can go for the CD \/ DVD version.","overall":5,"summary":"Mode's first masterpiece.. it's a lot like life","unixReviewTime":1172966400,"reviewTime":"03 4, 2007"}

While this era produced some of the most potent music of this career it cd't do a lot for him as a commercial entity. By the time this was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one Prince obviously needed to find a way in which to keep following this creative muse and continue being relevant as a marketable commodity, a title even at this point the was starting to deeply present as this considered (and still considers) himself a serious musician and not a commercial shill. He did this first by forming the New Power Generation, a band who not only came at Prince's eclectic musical nature from a ship-hop friendly standpoint but had another great asset in the person of the powerful, gospel drenched singing of vocalist Rosie Gaines. For some reason Prince was under the impression that the'd abandoned the R&B;\/funk crowd who'd initially made him famous by diversifying this music with so many other things into it. So at this point the is looking to bring that sound firmly back into this orbit. But being who the was Prince not only could't make a record exactly the way the used to but since diversity was so much a part of this musical identity that had to be maintained as well. And it was just as well as this album succeeded upon every intention it had in bringing him back to the top of the charts and producing more hits. True ship-hop is something Prince had toyed around with during the Nude tour but there it takes on a new meaning as it's grooves all come to you through that source. The overall production on this album is hot, slick and very elegant actually and that brings everything to life. \"Thunder\", with it's electronic polyrhythms and electric guitars as well as \"Daddy Pop\", the stop and start groove of \"Walk Don't Walk\",\"Push\",\"Live four Love\" and even the full on wrap of \"Jughead\" all really maintain the directness and technically pristine sound of funk all with enough of the stiffness of some ship-hop beats to bring the two related styles back into complete sync for Prince there. I am not sure how I feel about \"Gett Off\". Now it's quite a groove I'll give it that but the drum track is a little bass and overwhelming to make it truly funky. More of a ninety's ship-hop backdrop really. He also delivers three excellent and diverse slower grooves such as the sensitive but passionate title song, benefiting greatly from Gaines and the strong, soulful chorus. \"Strollin\" also has a strong hook plus a glossy, swinging jazz styled arrangement with some great high basslines to boot. \"Insatiable\" takes us to Prince's moaning\/groaning sexual suite type slow jam place that connects him very much to where the's come from in that area in the past. Of course the three remaining and more midtempo itunes there are the most compelling and inwardly diverse. \"Cream\" finds another great balance between a bluesy funk\/rock arrangement and it's playfully seductive lyric. It also makes for a great hit for this album as well. On \"Willing And Able\" and the topical \"Money Don't Matter two Night\" Prince is mining into a moody blend of funk and folk\/rock that actually showcases a sense of personal uncertainty as Prince begins this second full decade as a recording artist. So Prince managed to succeed in both the commercial and creative aspect on this album and even managed to try out some new ideas into this sound along the way. And because of that this album is a lot more ageless than a lot of other music from this particular era.","overall":5,"summary":"A New Power Generation Give Us The World","unixReviewTime":1281830400,"reviewTime":"08 15, 2010"}

In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, Prince's second movie, Under The Cherry Moom was filmed. This movie was a disaster and some people cd't even see it.

Parade was released the same time this second movie was filmed. This weird but, funky album was not really a big success for Prince. The album was underrated at the time, and it still is. When I listened to this album, it made me think of The Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper. The first three songs are weird to me. 'Christopher Tracy's Parade' is a funky, psychedelic number, which is a great opener to this album. 'New Postion' is a jazzy funk number with Sheila E. singing and playing the drums. 'I Wonder U' is a Lisa and Windy composition that sounds truly druggy with laid back rhythms and strange lyrics. 'Under The Cherry Moon' is very melodramatic with a sad mood in the song. I mean it's really not one of my favourites but, I listen to it anyway. 'Girls And Boys' is a hard funk tune with amazing synthesizers and electric drum beats. It's a more upbeat tune. 'Life Can Be So Nice' is another funk cut that has a chorus accompanied by a nice, catchy rhythm. Then there's 'Venus De Milo', which is a piano instrumental with a lot of smooth strings. 'Venus De Milo' are one of my favourites on this album. 'Mountains' is a upbeat, psychedelia soul cut with synth drums and other goggles of instruments. 'Do U Lie' is another depressing and moody song. I hate this one, but it really does't bother me that much. 'Kiss' is everybody's favourite song by the Purple One himself. The funky guitars and the muted drums are great. How does Prince do it? 'Anotherloverholenyohead' is a strange, European-funk number. 'Sometimes It Snows In April' is a ballad that employs country music to express deep loss so poetically and personally. Parade should've been a double album even if the whole album was forty-five minutes, in my opinion. At the time, The Revolution was delving into jazz and this album is really an experimentation of jazz and soul.

'Life can be beautiful' is one of the funk cuts, the chorus of which is accompanied by a beautiful, charming rhythm. There is the \"Venus de Milo\", a piano instrument with many smooth strings. 'Venus De Milo is one of my favourites on this album. \u2018Mountains\u2019 is a trustworthy, intellectual object with artificial drums and other physical instruments. \u2018Are You Lying\u2019 is another disturbing and moody song.

'Christopher Tracy Parade' is a funny, sensible number that opens this album very well. 'New Postin' is a jazzy funk number in which Sheila E sings and plays drums.

I mean, it's not really one of my favourites, but I listen to it anyway. 'Girls and Boys' is a funky funk song with amazing synthesizers and electric drum bits. Great song. There is another funk kit with 'Life can be great' course that goes with a fun and charming rhythm. This is followed by Venus de Mello, a piano with many smooth strings. Venus de Mello is one of my favourites on this album. The 'mountains' are proud, the spirit of psychedelics cut through the synth drums and other metal mirrors. \"Do You Lee\" is another sad and volatile song. I hate it, but it does't bother me much. 'Kiss' is Purple One's favourite song. Funny guitars and silent drums are great. What did the prince do? 'Anotherloverholenyohead' is a rare, European funk number. 'Sometimes It's Snowy April' is a song that uses world music to express deep and poetic losses. The parade should have been a double album, even if the whole album was forty-five minutes long, in my opinion.

Between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine and one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine the not only produced three hit albums for Michael Jackson, the also produced hit albums for others, including George Benson, Donna Summer, James Ingram, Patti Austin, The Brothers Johnson, Rufus & Chaka Khan and Ernie Watts. In this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety documentary \"Listen Up\", which documents a lot of the making of this particular album, Jones tells of how overwork and exhaustion ultimately led to a nervous breakdown and two separate aneurysms. By the time the was ready to make this album, which the describes as this project of a lifetime, music was undergoing a revolution. Disco was long dead and buried, ship-hop was emerging as the predominant force and the smooth jazz-influenced beats Jones was reputed for were falling out of favour. To give him this due the approached the situation gamely. The title tune, \"Back On The Block\" was a brave kiss with wrap if not a particularly wise one. The song, which features big guns of the time such as Melle Mel, Big Daddy Kane, Ice-T and Kool Moe Dee is always fun to listen to but I never heard it played on the radio for at any clubs for parties. \"Jazz Corner of The World\", this attempt to marry wrap with jazz was more interesting and featured jazz luminaries like James Moody, Miles Davis, George Benson, Sarah Vaughn, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and Josef Zawinul alongse Kool Moe Dee and Big Daddy Kane. It's heady, exciting stuff to listen to even now, seventeen years later. If nothing else, Q certainly knew where music was heading. The production on this CD is stunning beyond belief. \"Wee B. Dooinit\", featuring Siedah Garrett, Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau, Ella Fitzgerald, Take six and Sarah Vaughn is a completely capella performance. McFerrin produced the percussion and bass sound effects and I still wonder exactly where Q placed the microphones. There are some other great songs. \"I'll Be Good To You\" featured lead vocals by Ray Charles and Chaka Khan. The album version was good enough but I remember getting the twelve\" single which had the same backbeat as Soul II Soul's \"Keep On Movin'\". (Now THAT was a huge club hit). \"The Places You Find Love\" featured lead vocals from Chaka Khan and Siedah Garrett, with background vocals from Howard Hewitt, Jennifer Holiday, James Ingram, Dionne Warwick, Luther Vandross and the Andrae Crouch Singers among others. Apart from her brief stint with the Brand New Heavies, Siedah Garrett's work with Quincy Jones (here and on Michael Jackson's \"Bad\") have produced the only performances of hers I've managed to find bearable. She seems to have taken the place formerly occupied by Patti Austin in Q's workplan and to give her the credit she's due, she does the job well. She does the vocal arrangement on the majority of the songs and where she took lead vocal duties, like on \"I Don't Go For That\" and \"One Man Woman\", she gives a barnstorming performance. But for me, the album was made by \"Setembro (Brazilian Wedding Song)\" featuring Take six & Sarah Vaughn, with Gerald Albright on alto sax, George Benson on guitar, George Duke on fender Rhodes and Herbie Hancock on keyboards. The song attained iconic status when John Singleton used it in this classic movie \"Boyz N The Hood\". (It was the song playing during the love scene between Nia Long and Cuba Gooding, Jr). It's one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've never heard. Q's take on Joe Zawinul's \"Birdland\" featuring Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, George Benson, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and James Moody, is also a personal favourite. This album is also noted for introducing the world to (the then angelic-voiced) Tevin Campbell. He did the tearjerking \"Tomorrow (Better You, Better Me)\" with background vocal help from the `children's choir'. And last but by no means least, the album also produced the perennial slow dance song, \"The Secret Garden\", featuring El DeBarge, James Ingram, Al B. Sure! and Barry White. That one still moves people to this day. This review is long but I feel to pass this project off with a few lines for a paragraph for two would not be doing its magnitude justice. It's not my all-time favourite Quincy Jones record but I can totally see why the considers it so significant. It is so significant. Getting all these legends of the past and of the future was a huge achievement all by itself. Who else could possibly have gotten all these people into the studio at the same time?","overall":5,"summary":"His project of a lifetime?","unixReviewTime":1159228800,"reviewTime":"09 26, 2006"}

Austin, The Brothers Johnson, Rufus and Chaka Khan and Ernie Watts. In the nineteenth and nineteenth film \"Sun\", which writes a lot about the making of this album, Jones tells us how much work and fatigue has led to neurological disorders and two different aneurysms. By the time someone was ready to make an album, which was described as a lifelong project, the music had changed. The disco was dead and buried long ago, the plane shop was emerging as a major force, and the smooth beats inspired by the Jazz Jones were no longer popular. Because of this to approach the game situation. The title track, \"Back on the Block\", was a bold, touching kiss if not the most subtle. It's always fun to listen to the music with the big guns of the time, Big Daddy Cane, Ice-T and Cole Moody, but I haven't heard it on the radio at any of the club events. The \"Jazz Corner of the World\", wedding and jazz-wrapping effort was exciting and jazz stars such as James Moody, Miles Davis, George Benson, Sarah Vaughan, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and Joseph Zavinol and Cole Moody and the big daddy.

McFarran made the sound bass and bass sounds and I still wonder where Q put the microphone. There are some beautiful songs.

The album version was pretty good but I remember I got twelve \"with the same back beat with Civil II Civil's\" Cape on the Moon \"(now it was the club's biggest song).\" The Places You Find \" Some of the best lyrics of \"Love\" were by Chaka Khan and Syeda Garrett, with background lyrics by Howard Hewitt, Jennifer Holay, James Ingram, Devon Warrick, Luther Vendros and Andre Crouch Singers.

He performed the song \"Tomorrow (Better You, Better Me)\" with the background sound of \"Children's Choir\". Finally, the album also produced a never-ending dance song, \"The Secret Garden,\" featuring LD Barge, James Ingram, LB Shaver! And Barry White. Which is still mobilizing people today.

I absolutely loved The Real Thing, and even more so, loved watching MTV VJs flounder as they had to repeatedly play \"Midlife Crisis\", the first single from this album, despite thinking to themselves, \"Eww[. ] is dark! And gross! I don't like this!\"And thus was most of the mainstream's response to Angel Dust. Where The Real Thing promised a new wave of melodic weirdness, Angel Dust seemed to suggest that this band was actually. well. just on Angel Dust. However, fans of music, and not simply trends, recognized and continue to recognize the absolute brilliance of this album. If you are looking for a good reason to pick this album up, I have over one hundred and ninety that average out to give this masterpiece a five star rating; many written within the past year. This is a testament to this album's widespread appeal, and reassuring longevity. In many ways, Angel Dust is The Real Thing on steroids, and the results are much like hitting an extra thirty-five homeruns a year: quite exciting and frightening at the same time. The riffs are better, the bass pounds louder, the drums accentuate the never-so subtle tribal rhythms of this band better than before, and Mike Patton, possibly the most underrated influential rock musician of your time, displays such a range of feeling and technique that I simply cackle to near suffocation when I hear people drool over Mariah Carey's high-pitched squeal of limited emotion.

The album has an electronic feel to it, easily addictive with its textured background music and inspiring lyrics. The album spawned four singles (plus one in the UK). Those included Frozen, the albums first single a wonderful ballad with haunting lyrics and music. The A-se for Frozen was the indian influenced Shanti\/Ashtangi, another wonderful song. The second single was the title track, one of the best songs on the album (they are all gems) its an upbeat song about how in life we move so quickly, yet live life to its fullest. Its B-side was the non album track Has To Be. The third US release was The Power of Goodbye, another fine ballad, and the A-Side was the haunting Mer Girl, where Madonna relives her mother's death. This is probably my favourite song on the album, because it tells such a story and makes you think. I think it should of been a single personally but its not very commercial at all. Nothing Really Matters was the final single, check out the remixes they are the best. To Have and Not to Hold was the A-side.

{"orig_index":21099,"reviewerID":"ATFCYBLE6TSTC","asin":"B000002VT6","reviewerName":"Bucky Erdstein","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I was looking for an album that had some great songs, and there it is. One of the things that amazed me about Sarah McLachlan's music was how long it took me to appreciate her \"surfacing\" of the thousand, ninety-seven and seven. After buying this best part called \"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\", although I must have liked this album, it looked very different. I bought \"Touch\" and \"Afterglow\" at the same time and enjoyed it the most, which surprised me as it is one of Sarah's most accessible albums. I just bought a \"Solace\" six months ago and gradually I liked it. Listening to Surfacing over and over again made me realize the beauty of this album and now it is probably my second favourite album of Sarah. My first, and always will be, messed up towards ecstasy. The album still holds Sarah McLachlan's record, selling just over a million copies in the United States alone. Open the number. One thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven sold strongly in the first week of the general release on July two and firmly over the next three years. This was partly due to Lalit Mela, who was first Sarah. By the send of the thousand years, nine hundred and ninety, Sarah had gathered many followers, from young to old. Why? Because this songs touch your emotions and come from the heart, and we can all relate to them at other times in your life. Moments of frustration, moments of joy Sarah sings it all, and in a very different voice in the industry. The album opens with the hit song \"Building a Mystery\". It's one of Sarah's biggest radio hits to date and it's easy to watch because Sarah's voice is so beautiful there. I did't like singing in the first place, but obviously it grew in me. \"I Love You\" is an amazing song and was definitely one of Sarah's favourite songs never. A lot of people ignore this song and say it's boring, but I don't understand why. Well, it's fun like hell, but it's also very comfortable! This song creates a beautiful atmosphere with instruments in the background. Sarah's voice expresses this in a song, she has made a great song that I think I have never heard. \"Sweet Devotion\" is definitely the highlight of the album for me. It starts with playing and turning off the cloud electric guitar, before the drums come and Sarah starts singing. A beautiful song in the middle of the temple that moves fast in space because of the drum. The chorus is amazing and I like the way Sara draws the theme of the song. \"Adia\" is another fun song but it takes time for you to grow. This song is sung by a lost friend whom Sarah misses very much. The chorus is beautiful and the most prominent is the song, \"We Are Born Innocent.\" At this point, the first four songs may sound the same when you listen to the album for the first time, but repeated listening will separate them. \"Do What You Do To Do\" is an amazing, very simple song that focuses on Sarah's songs. In fact, it is the melody that moves the course up and down, which is the most memorable truth about this song. The song itself is simple and fun, which somehow works of part. It comes in the form of \"Witnesses\", definitely one of Sarah's favourite songs. This song is about five minutes long and it has tremendous blood in it! The song is very simple and straightforward but also very fun and drawn. You hear Sarah singing, \"Shall we go to heaven, as we did there?\" And you can't help but think of images of hell on earth and fire in slow motion. The song is almost as dry and empty as a hot desert, and Sarah's voice adds to it. In this song, this voice has a green, dry sound. \"Angel\" is next and that's it, Sarah's fans consider it the biggest song. I had already learned everything about singing this song before I heard it, which raised my expectations. I slowed down a bit, but the singing has grown too much for me. It may be the easiest song on the album but it packs the biggest cartoon with Sarah's lyrics. \"In the hands of an angel, I fly from there. You feel from this dark, cold and infinite hotel room.\" I don't know why but this song always reminds me of the scene of Return of the King where Frodo and Sam were taken home by these big birds after destroying the bring! \"Black and White\" is a song that has a great rhythm on the album. It's very interesting in itself and I like the way Sarah sang, \"Everyone loves you when you're young. Everyone hates you when you're bored. Everybody hates you. Awaiting your registration. So don't embarrass them. \" Have you never felt that you have high expectations, and you think you can't achieve them? Or does the just not pay attention when you tell him to do something? Listen to this song and you will connect with it. \"Full of Grace\" is the next song and definitely features the album. This song is very special to me because it was the first song I heard from Sarah in two thousand when I started watching \"Becoming Part Two\" the send of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Two. As Buffy recently skills her boyfriend to save the world from disaster, she looks at her school, her friends at a distance, before she turns to Snydell, whose So we think it's good. There is emotion in the song and the way it deals with Buffy's violence is amazing. For those who did't know me, Buffy had sex with her boyfriend Angel (a vampire with a spirit), which turned her off and she turned into an evil vampire. For months, the abuser and this friends planned to send the world to hell. He opened the door of hell, which was closed with the blood of the one who opened it. At the last moment, the spirit was restored, but Buffy had no choice but to kill him because Jehovah had opened the door. Spain must be very strong to do this, and this song means nothing at all. The album ends with \"The Last Dance\", a beautiful musical song. It's a little over two and a half minutes long, and the way the piano dances around other instruments when it's very comfortable. All grades: ten \/ ten I can only say that this is my second favourite album by Sarah McLachlan. It's also great if it were't for Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, I'd keep it with Sarah as my favourite. I would say that if you want to get into Sarah's music and start with fumbling first, then move on to surfing and afterglow. The album continues with Sarah practising piano ballads with soft strings, but with quality they are easily accessible. It's not always a good thing, but with Sarah it's even more beautiful.","overall":5,"summary":"Great Singer","unixReviewTime":1360800000,"reviewTime":"02 14, 2013"}

You want a giant on this CD. Talk about Spain and the problems of life. It is difficult to choose a song, but the most beautiful is the beloved mother. Add all these words to their meanings. When you listen to this album with the previous album, there is a big difference. twopac sounds are very mature in this album. To get out when the was shot and thrown into prison, it was Twopac who faced the world, and Twopac succeeded. I think a lot of people who hate Topopac because of all the controversy around him and the crime that has been committed, after hearing the news, fall in love with him. I would love to introduce him to the shoot and all the did with a proper beat. It's amazing, predicting my death when death is near, if I die, it would be amazing. One of my favourite songs is against the world. If your parents are comfortable with you and your life is not easy, you need to listen, especially what you said when you sent it. There are many tears that speak of Spain and the suffering, but it does not sound weak. I love the difficulty in the game because you have strong blocks on the album and you talk about killers and liars. I like a criminal because the has a good rhythm and two conversations about people who want to kill him. One of my favourite songs is temptation. That song is very strong.

To a vast extent, it does need to be remembered that at the time this album was released, the wrap-metal explosion than't happened yet and the idea of having frantic metal drumming and guitars with a wrapper going over the top was still quite new. Without bagging this album - it can quite easily be seen that three hundred and eleven are trying to work out the boundaries of the genre.

On many other tracks - \"DLMD\" for example - it seems that the band has started with a great idea for a song but unfortunately the mix of styles has prevented the song from going anywhere much. One of the biggest problems with this album is that none of the songs seems long enough. This in't just due to the speed at which they are played - barely any make the three minute mark.

This excellent boxed set from Hip-O gathers these four albums that have been in and out (largely out) of print for the last thirty years. The sound is exceptionally good. Remastered under the supervision of Bill Levenson, these have a nice dynamic range and the don't have any weird EQ effects to mar the sound of the reissues. I should note for purists that Rhodes has gone on record that the did't care for the sound on these but the also admitted the did't listen to them in depth and I suspect the just wanted to remaster them himself. I can't give you a comparison to anything other than the albums \"Listen, Listen: The Merry-Go-Round\" anthology and Rhodes self titled album that was issued in Japan about seven years ago. In comparison to both of those the respective albums as presented there sound quite good with nice clarity and and the black of any noise reduction, nice dynamic range, the use of the original masters for all four albums makes this a must have if you're a fan of Emitt's work and don't have it on CD. These definitely sound better than my old worn out copies of the albums on vinyl (with the exception of \"Mirror\" which I never had on vinyl)Rhodes has always reminded me of early seventy's McCartney backed by Badfinger for even Badfinger's own Pete Ham. Rhodes who played all the instruments, sang all the vocal parts (save for some female backing vocals), engineered and produced the album himself ended up as a staff producer at Elektra Records after getting burned by the music business (he did't have the rights to any of this songs until recently for example having signed them away as a seventeen year old when the was with The Merry-Go-Round and labouring under an unfair contract for years). The four albums \"The American Dream\", \"Emitt Rhodes\", \"Mirror\" and \"Farewell to Paradise\" all appear in full (\"American Dreamer\" also includes a track that was taken off the early pressings and replaced as well as its replacement track). We also get the single A-side track \"Tame the Lion\" a topical song written in response to the Vietnam War but that still has relevance today. There karen't any previously unreleased for rare tracks. Levenson has stated that the goal of the album was to get ALL of Rhodes officially released material back into print in one boxed set. \"The Emitt Rhodes Recordings\" accomplishes this goal with extremely good sounding remasters plus two bonus tracks. This is packaged in a double digipak with the albums arranged by their recording dates ( \"The American Dream\" is first). We also get a booklet that is good but does leave a bit to be desired. It's not nearly as good for comprehensive as the booklet that came out with the Rev-Ola reissue of \"The Merry-Go-Round: Listen, Listen\" set (which also includes \"The American Dream\"). It might have been nice to have a contemporary interview with Rhodes for this set.

To the purists let me note that Rhodes has published them, the does't care about these sounds, but the also admitted that the did't listen very carefully.

Rhodes played all musical instruments, sang all parts of the voice (except for certain women's songs), designed and produced the album, after being burned by the music industry, eventually becoming the producer of Elektra Records (he did not have any rights to these songs until recently, for example, when working with Merry-Go-Round for many years under an unfair contract, signing these songs when they were seventeen).

Strengthened under the direction of Bill Levinson, they have a good range of flexibility and they don't have weird EQ effects that would damage the are-release sound.

It's almost like the glue for every music collection. Ronstadt's clearly moving into Rock, but retains some of her Country roots. \"You're No Good\", her first #one single, is breath-taking, there's so much power in that song. No one's done Paul Anka's \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" as well as Linda Ronstadt. It's simply gorgeous. One her best J. D. Souther covers is \"Faithless Love\". She rocks up \"The Dark End Of The Street\", with a passionately aggressive (vocal) performance. In my opinion it tops the version done by the Flying Burrito Brothers. The title song, actually named \"Heart Is Like A Wheel\" is hauntingly beautiful. It has cello, viola, fiddle arrangements that alternate, with a sweet harmony vocal from Maria Muldar, and outstanding orchestration from David Campell (whose arranged strings for her since). I'd take Linda's version of \"When Will I Be Loved\", over any other, any day. It rocks hard, and became one of her top singles. \"Willing\" is great. The duet that started the magic was \"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)\", sung by Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris. The song deserved the Grammy it won. The simple arrangements fit \"Keep Me From Blowing Away\". \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" is one of the best closing songs on her album catalog. Gregory Rose's string arrangements on \"You're No Good\", \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\", \"\"The Dark End Of The Street\", and \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" are marevlous. With an exceptional array of musicians, thoughtful production, and brilliant performances from Ronstadt, HEART LIKE A WHEEL is unbeatable. It's the album that made Linda Ronstadt a star.

No one can complete Paul Anka's \"No Matter What\" with Linda Ronstadt. Very cute. One of the highlights J. D. Souther covers \"Unfaithful Love\". You have moved \"Dark End of Street\" with a roaring sound (voice music). In my opinion, it surpasses the Flying Burrito Brothers version. The title song, titled \"Heart Like a Wheel\", is so beautiful that it will never be forgotten. It has alternating arrangements for cello, viola, and violin, as well as fine material from Maria Muldar, as well as excellent orchestral music from David Campell (he has prepared strings for her never since). Any day, I will choose Linda's version of \"When Will I Be Loved\". It changed and became one of this main songs. \u201cDetermination\u201d is good. The couple who started the magic said \"I Can't Help You (if I still love you)\", sung by Linda Longstatt and Amy Lou Harris. This song is suitable for successful Grammys.

Gregory Rose's string arrangements \"It's nothing\", \"It does't matter\", \"The dark send of the street\" and \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" are excellent.

This music is almost like glue for the whole music collection. Stonestat is clearly on the rocks, but preserves some of its roots. \"You Don't Care\", her first single, Breathing, has great power in this song. No one told Paul Inca \"it does't matter\" and Linda Ronstad. It's just beautiful. One of this best books is J. D. Souther says \"Faith in Love\". He hits \"Dark End of the Road\" with a love play (in words). In my opinion, this is beyond the version made by Flying Barretto Brothers. The title track, actually called \"Heart Like a Wheel\", is amazingly beautiful. It features cello, viola, fiddle arrangements in turn, with the sweet melody of Maria Molder's harmonies, and an excellent orchestration by David Campbell (who has been arranging the ropes for her never since). I'll take Linda's version of \"When I'm Loved\" more than any other day. It moves hard, and it became one of this top songs. \"Confession\" is good. The magical duo began with \"I Can't Help You (If I Still Love You)\", sung by Linda Ronstadt and Emilio Harris. The song deserved a Grammy winner. Simple preparation is equivalent to \"Cape May Air\". \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" is one of the best songs from their album catalog. Gregory Rose's preparations for \"You're Not Beautiful\", \"It Doesn't Matter\", \"Dark End of the Street\", and \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" are amazing. The album that starred Linda Ronstadt. An album that will complete your collection. Well \", her first #one song, is breathtaking, this song has a lot of power. No one has done Paul Inca's\" It does't matter anymore \"with Linda Ronstadt.

He looks comfortable in this role at the moment. He can talk about Vancouver's \"Just to Get a Rap\", the can talk about my \"Step in the Arena\" for the soft \"Love Sick\" where all these songs are refreshing to listen to. At a time when the uprising was very political and violent, the gang star took another big step. Jazz will play a key role in air travel in the years to come. As you already know, Premo Drum has become one of the ninety most influential producers with beautiful cut words. He could cut patterns like any other, and it's not uncommon for him to work with big names like the infamous B. I. G. and Jay-Z. Even Janet Jackson and Lamp Buzzick put it together to reunite their hot songs. Step into the arena where daily operations and hard work are learned. These three records are this best work. Prime as a producer just got better, but little attention disappeared. Step in the Arena was something new and different. His next record may be technically complete, but nothing new. It's just too strong. If you are one of those who have recently received Gang Star, I would suggest that you go back to the beginning - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety one and step into the arena. Other highlights of Gangstar: Daily Operation (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety two), Hard to Earn (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety four)","overall":5,"summary":"Step In The Arena; My personal favourite","unixReviewTime":1143590400,"reviewTime":"03 29, 2006"}

I was never too fond of the title track, but the lesser known tracks called \"The Life Auction\" and \"You and I (When We were Young)\" and \"Grace Darling\" are their absolute best. I did't care how expensive these Strawbs imports were, I had to get my Strawbs albums on CD quickly before they changed their minds and suddenly discontinued them. \"Lemon Pie\" and \"Starshine\/Angel Wine\" could have easily been great pop chart singles, but that never happened. In fact, nothing never charted on the Billboard Hot one hundred pop charts from the Strawbs. Some of their albums charted, but no singles. This album of \"Ghosts\" charted #forty-seven in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, which was their higher charted album in the US. They started going downhill from there. After their \"Nomadness\" album, the Strawbs continued to have band member changes and they drifted further away from both of their Folk and their Progressive influences and started to sound more like a typical pop music group that was already the sound that was saturating the pop music charts. It was all so easily dismissible since the Strawbs were so strong during their A&M; days. Only true Strawbs loyalists continued to buy the Strawbs albums (I'm guilty of this too, nowadays) even after A&M; gave up on them. Their immediate follow-up albums (from the Oyster label) were \"Deep Cuts\" and \"Burning for You\". There are a few good itunes, but these albums are easily and regrettably forgettable. The album afterwards, called \"Deadlines\" ended strong. Their songs \"Deadly Nightshade\" and \"Words of Wisdom\" are two of Dave Cousins best songs never. Strawbs continued to perform and release albums in later years. Dave Cousins still likes to find old band members who probably have nothing better to do, and they've done some shows and released some albums. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, their album \"Don't Say Goodbye\" and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's \"Ringing Down the Years\" are both pretty good. I think these two albums are better than their albums from the late seventies after \"Nomadness\". But, alas, they were running out of creative ideas yet again, and started to close their appeal once again. What's frustrating about the Strawbs is that Dave Cousins likes to keep are-recording earlier songs, like the thinks the's improving on them. I wish the would't do this. In two thousand and two, Dave Cousins got together with Rick Wakeman and recorded another album together. Rick Wakeman left the Strawbs back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one to join Yes and to do solo projects. And even on this Cousins and Wakeman album, Cousins still did some are-recordings that Rick Wakeman had nothing to do with back in their heyday. Dave Cousins seems to be the only member of the Strawbs that was on every Strawbs album. All the other members just came and went over the years. But, I'm sure that every Strawbs fan will agree that the Strawbs best albums were the albums of the A&M; years (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five). If you can find it, look for their double CD called \"Halcyon Days\" (the US version). It is the very best of the Strawbs put together all in one great double CD package. In fact, it was done so well that it is very obvious that A&M; have no intentions of releasing their albums separately. You'd have to buy their expensive imports as I have. I hope someday they will release the Hudson-Ford albums on CD. These two guys contributed to what made the folk side of the Strawbs so strong back in their earlier days. Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, the Strawbs, Yes, Pink Floyd, Triumvirat, King Crimson, The Moody Blues, Rick Wakeman, and Monty Python's Flying Circus. These were the strongest influences in my life as a kid. The Strawbs are still performing shows throughout England. They have a following just like the Grateful Dead had there in America. I'd like to see them come do a show there in California. Perhaps they could do a double billing with maybe Blackmore's Night. That would be a great show where they would actually compliment each other being seen together. What do you think?

Two thousand two, Dave's cousins \u200b\u200bmet Rick Wakeman and they recorded another album together. Rick Wakeman left Strabus one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one to join and work solo. And even on this album, Cousins \u200b\u200band Wakeman, cousins \u200b\u200bstill make records that Rick Wakeman did't put back in this heyday. Dave Cousins \u200b\u200bseems to be the only Strabus member in the entire Strabus album. All the other members arrived and left in just a few years. But, I'm sure every Strabus fan will agree that Strabus's best albums were A&M. One thousand nine hundred and fifty five, nine hundred and seventy five). If you can find it, look for a double CD called \"Halcyon Days\" (US version). The best strawberry pack in a large packet of two CDs. In fact, it is so well done that it is very clear that A&M has no intention of releasing their own album. You have to buy their expensive imported goods as I do. I hope that one day they will release Hudson Ford albums on CD. It was the two men who made the Strabus side so strong in their early days. Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, The Straubs, Yes, Punk Floyd, Treum Virat, King Crimson, The Moody Blues, Rick Wakeman, and the Monty Python Flying Circus. These were the most powerful effects of my childhood. Straub is still playing shows all over England. He has fans in the United States like Dead Thanksgiving. I'd love to see them do a show in California. Maybe they can charge twice for Blackmore Knight. It would be a good show if they complimented each other and looked at each other. What do you think Straubbus fans should watch Black Moor Night.","overall":5,"summary":"This was my favorite album for many years back in my Progressive Rock days","unixReviewTime":1167350400,"reviewTime":"12 29, 2006"}

It seemed to cover so many genre's of dance from techno to house, trance to the all star rock mix with a heady array of guest vocalists. The opener features a strong dance beat with vocoder vocals, long before Daft Punk made them extremely fashionable again. Track two is a total hard house track. Massive in clubs, it's where this track can be appreciated most fully. A heaving drum machine belting out huge beats, backed by throbbing bass electronica and a disaffected female vocalist asking us repeatedly \"Who's Under The Influence?\"-well with tracks like this I am for starters! The threerd track features the first of many outstanding contributions of guest vocalists. On this occasion Bernard Sumner manages to make this track a hybrid of all that's good from New Order to the duo themselves. Hope Sandoval, old favourite Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream,Oasis' Noel Gallagher and most amazingly Mercury Rev's Jonathan Donahue feature on this album. The Donahue track is totally different to anything else on this album. Of the other tracks \"The sunshine underground\" is this pc.d.'s Private Psychedelic Reel-it's an astounding weight minute piece that builds up quietly and slowly and steadily gains momentum until a spectacular and long climax. It's like the chill out track in the middle of the pc.d. The huge hit \"Hey Boy Hey Girl\" is the best commercial dance track never released by The Chemical Brother's. Based on pure electronica, techno and unusually for them very little distortion you'll find it hard to sit still listening to this track. This is my favourite of their pc.d.'s.

The launcher features a powerful dance rhythm with Wooder's melodies, long before daft punk made them extremely fashionable again. The two tracks as a whole are a difficult home track. It's great in bands, that's where this song can be fully appreciated. The heavy-duty drum machine, which emits large beats, is aided by the beating bass electronica and a relentless female artist who repeatedly tasks us \"Who is under the influence?\" - To begin with such tracks! Track III includes the first of many wonderful guest name contributions. On this occasion, Bernard Sumner managed to make this track a combination of all the good things from the New Order to the two. Hope Sandoval, Primal Scream's former favourite Bobby Gillespie, Ovis' Noel Gallagher and Jonathan Donahu's amazing Mercury Rio feature in this album. The Donahue track is very different from anything on this album. On some of the \"Sunlight Underground\" tracks of pc.d's private psychedelic trail - it's an amazing piece of weight loss that grows quietly and slowly and reaches an amazing and far-reaching climax. It's like a cool track between PCDs. The hit movie \"Hey Boy Hey Girl\" is the best dance genre released by The Chemical Brothers. Pure electronic, techno-based and rarely a minor distraction for them will make it difficult for you to keep quiet and listen to this song. This is my favourite PCD. It could not have been the limit and youth of its predecessors - but it brought its unique voice to its final fulfilment.","overall":5,"summary":"I Surrendered Long Ago!","unixReviewTime":1012780800,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2002"}

The three September one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four repetitions featured guitar and vocals, mud guitar and vocals, JT Brown of tenor saxophone, Sam Lauhorn and Peavey Madison guitar, harmonica James Cotton, piano and Larry of Otis Pan's SP on drums. All three are direct blue calculations; all good. The sound quality is very good, and the total playing time of the disc is just over forty-eight minutes.

Like I said, all the songs are awesome, there are no skits, so you don\u2019t have to skip anything. The most striking songs are; L. I. Q., their noses, rich experience, pearl, this is your life, rules and regulations, play with my brothers, and famous people in the slums. Jayo Felony, C-Bo, Sauce Money, Fat Joe, Cash Money Millionairs, and of course Click, there are many great cameos. I\u2019m from the Bay Area, which is probably why I really like the E-forty, but I love all kinds of packaging. In my opinion, people always say that there are too many cats to imitate in packing games.

The closeness of the distance is that, \u201cno one is coming\u201d is in danger of instability, and Gillan\u2019s prose is always smart. Finally, Warner Archives and Rhino Records provided \"Fireball\" with the appropriate treatment; this revised package contains the song \"Strange Woman\", and two songs left on the album (one of which is \"I'm Alone\".

Their punk fuelled music combined with progressive sound-scape's make for what is for what was one of the best bands of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. Relationship Of Command is a true testament to this legend as it is by far the best release of the bands career. While the bands first three records, Acrobatic Tenement, In\/Casino\/Out, and the Vaya EP were all great records Relationship Of Command is by far superior. Here Cedric and Omar's tag team had come together in full swing insuring their position as one of rock music's most dynamic duos. After this release however the band would separate and Cedric and Omar would go on to create the largely successful and amazingly original The Mars Volta. Relationship Of Command begins with the pile-driver of a song `Arcarsenal' which could't be better for starting the album. Fast vocals and even faster guitar make this song a sure win. `Pattern Against User' keeps the album going in full swing with awesome guitar work and out of this world vocals, truly one of the best songs the band never made. `One Armed Scissor' was the bands closest song to a hit single, because it was actually played on the radio and on TV regularly. It's probably the best song the band never recorded. It contains and instantly memorable chorus which is always a good thing. `Sleepwalk Capsules' is very stop and go and contains a lot of time changes and rhythm switches which makes for one interesting song that never gets boring. If `One Armed Scissor' in't the bands best song then `Invalid Jitter Dept.' easily fills the shoes, its one of the more brilliant songs you could never hear in your life. Performed mostly in spoken word with a semi-chorus in the mix. A social political poem in true punk fashion and performed wonderfully, those who had the luxury of seeing the band perform this track live are few and lucky. `Mannequin Republic' is a very intense track with lots of yelling, not screaming, yelling, but the does it while singing so Cedric's voice still sounds fantastic and never gets annoying. `Enfilade' begins with a really strange phone call intro the goes into a techno beat then a Mexican samba all before hurdling the listener into a full speed sound attack on the years, and it's fantastic, truly was a sign of things to come in The Mars Volta. `Rolodex Propaganda' aside from having a pretty cool title is a very cool song as well complete with over the top vocals accompanied with incredible guitar playing by Omar. `Quarantined' is slower then the rest of the songs on the album but don't let that fool you this song is just a great and just as powerful as the rest of the songs on the album. `Cosmonaut' is a lot like `Mannequin Republic' but with better music and over all it's a lot better. Next us `Non-Zero Possibility' is a slower more space piano driven song. It was also the real send to the album, but if you buy the record instead of down loading you get the two extra bonus tracks `Extracurricular' and `Catacombs.' `Extracurricular' is very guitar driven and very good. `Catacombs' is excellent and is a very cool way to send the album. Relationship Of Command is like I said the best album your going to get from the great At The Drive-In. But I would recommend checking out all of the bands albums as they are all great as well as the two Mars Volta albums. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"The Mars Volta 1.0","unixReviewTime":1154390400,"reviewTime":"08 1, 2006"}

Their punk-powered music combined with continuous sound made it one of the most popular bands in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. The driver relationship is a true testament to this myth, as it is the best version of a team work to date. Although the first three records of the band, Acrotic Tenement, In \/ Casino \/ Out and Vaya EP are all good records, Command Relationships are much higher than other records. Here, Cedric and Omar's label team are all out to secure their status as one of the most dynamic duo in rock music. However, after this release, the team will be divided and Cedric and Omar will continue to create success with the amazing first Mars Volta. The conductor's relationship began with the piledriver of the song \"Arcarsenal\", which could not have been better at the beginning of the album. The quick vocals and the guitar quickly made this song a success. The \"Anti-User Model\" made the record famous by playing the best guitar and world voices. This is one of the best songs I have never released. \"Armed Scissor\" is the closest band to a single person because it is often played on radio and TV. This is probably the best song the band has never recorded. It contains and is quickly remembered, which is always a good thing. \"Sleepwalk Capsules\" is a very stop-and-go, it contains a lot of time changes and a rhythm of change, which makes the interesting song never boring. If \"One Armed Scissor\" in't the band's best song, then \"Invalid Jitter Dept.\" easily fills your shoes, one of the most interesting songs you have never heard in your life. It is done mainly in spoken language, mixed with semi-chorus. A real punk-fashionable social welfare poem that came out handy. \"Republic of Mannequin\" is a very sharp song, there is a lot of shouting, not crying, but shouting, but doing this while singing, so Cedric's voice still sounds sweet, and it will never be annoying. \"Enfilade\" starts with a very unusual call, then goes into an electronic beat, then a Mexican samba, and then allows the listener to enter into a quick, cloud sonic attack and a sign of what is to come. Mars Walter. In addition to having a cool title, \u2018Rolodex Propaganda\u2019 is also a very cool song with high lyrics and Omar\u2019s amazing performance. \"Isolation\" is slower than other songs on the album, but don't let it fool you this song, this song is as good and powerful as other songs on the album. The \"astronaut\" is very similar to the \"Mannequin Republic\", but the music is better, and generally better. Our next song \"non-zero chances\" is a slow-paced piano song. This is also a real release of the album, but if you buy the record instead of downloading it, you will get two additional bonus songs \"Extracurricular\" and \"Catacombs\". \"Outdoor activities\" are run by the guitar, which is very good. \"Catacombs\" is a great and cool way to send albums. The command relationship is like the best album I\u2019ve never mentioned, you\u2019ll find the best album on Drive-In. But I recommend looking at all the band's albums because they're all good, and there are two Mars Volta albums. highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"The Mars Volta 1.0","unixReviewTime":1154390400,"reviewTime":"08 1, 2006"}

Their punk mixed the music along with producing a progressive soundtrack for what was one of the best bands of the thousand, nine hundred and ninety. Command Relationship is a truly dark testimony of this legend as it is the best performance of the team\u2019s career. While the first band of three records, Acrobatic Tenement, In \/ Casino \/ Out, and Vaya EP are all major records that Order relationship is higher. Here the band Cedric and Omar gathered to secure their place in one of the most active rock music. After this release however the team will split up and Cedric and Omar will continue to make a big part of the success and originality of Mars Volta. The command line starts with the pile driver of the song \u2018Arcarsenal\u2019 which is not good for starting an album. The fast space and even the fast piano make this song a definite success. The \u2018anti-user style\u2019 keeps the album well with the amazing guitar work and beyond the sounds of the world, it is definitely one of the best songs the band has never done. \u2018An Armed Scissors\u2019 is the closest song to a single play, because it\u2019s actually played on radio and TV regularly. Probably the best song the band has never recorded. It contains and instantly memorable chorus which is always a good thing. \u2018Sleepwalk Capsules\u2019 is a stop and going and consists of many time changes and rhythm cycles that make a song fun and never boring. If \u2018Armed\u2019 does\u2019t include the best songs then Invalid Jitter Dept. it fills the shoes, and is one of the best songs you will never hear in your life. Consists of mostly spoken words with an integrated group-course. A social political poem in a very authentic style, those who have the pleasure of seeing the band performing directly in this song are few and far between. \u2018Republic of Mannequin\u2019 is a very serious road with very noisy, no shouting, shouting, but when singing so Cedric\u2019s voice is still amazing and not angry. \u2018Enfilade\u2019 starts with a surprising phone call, and goes to the result of beat technology after samba Mexico before the listener throws a cloud sound attack over the years, and surprisingly, it really marks things to come on Mars Volta The \u2018Propaganda Rolodex\u2019 apart from owning a good title is a superb as well as complete song above high pitch along with Omar\u2019s amazing guitar. \u2018Quarantine\u2019 slows down the rest of the songs on the album, but don\u2019t be fooled this song is as big as any other album. \"Cosmonaut is very similar to Mannequin Republic but with better music and better. Next to us 'Possible Non-Zero' is a piano short song. It's also the actual message sent on the album, but if you buy of the recorder instead of downloading it you will get both the Extracurricular bonus and Catacombs. The \u2018Out-of-curriculum\u2019 is very good guitar. The Catacombs are great and a great way to send an album.

While the first three record bands, Acrobatic Tent, In \/ Casino \/ Out, and Via EP were all excellent records, command commands are very high. Here Cedric and Omar's marking team were fully assembled, confirming their position as one of the most powerful rock artists. After this release, however, the team will split and Cedric and Omar will continue to build the first successful and amazing Mars Volta. The command relationship begins with the conductor of a great song, 'Arcarsnell', whose album is not the best to start. Fast songs and fast guitars make this song a sure victory. 'User Representation Pattern' continues the album with amazing guitar work and, without the words of the world, is truly one of the band's best songs. 'An Armed Scissors' was very close to a hit song, as it was played on radio and TV all the time. The band has recorded perhaps the best song never. There is also a memorable course that is always beautiful. The 'sleepwalk capsule' stops and moves and has time-changing and rhythm changes that make for a fun, timeless song. If `One Armed Scissor` is not the best song` Invalid Jitter Dept. It fills shoes easily, it's one of the best songs you've never heard in your life. This is mainly done with the sound spoken along with the semi-course in the mix. Very few people are interested in watching the band using this song live while performing a sociol-political poem and amazing in the style of a real punk. 'Manicone Republic' is a powerful song with a lot of screaming, not screaming, but singing while doing so so that Cedric's voice still sounds sweet and never gets angry. \"Enfilade\" begins with an unusual call to enter the techno beat and then Mexican samba listeners before the full audio attack takes place over the years, and, interestingly, it's coming to Mars Volta.

'Quarantine' is slower than the other songs on the album but don't be fooled by it. This song is as sweet and powerful as the other songs on the album. 'Cosmonaut' is very similar to 'Manicone Republic' but with better music and the best. The next 'non-zero possibility' is a slow song that plays the space piano. And it was a real post on the album, but if you buy a record instead of downloading, you get two bonus tracks called `Extracurricular 'and` Catacombs'. The 'extracurricular' guitar is very driven and very beautiful. 'Catacombs' is a great way to send albums. The command relationship is like I said the best album you will find great drive in them.

Also, my three favourite Blur songs are not featured on this CD (I'm Just A Killer For Your Love, Brothers & Sisters, He Thought of Cars). I strongly believe they bought to have been included, though, because these tracks seem to most clearly display Blur's skills in that they all have amazingly catchy rhythms, dandy lyrics, and are completely original and unique. Contrary to what others say, I don't think Blur is anything like Oasis. Sure, they're both British, but Blur has much more originality, more noise, and a bit more cleverness (although I do really like Oasis too). Anyway, the Best of Blur does have its upsides too. It does after all include the non-album song \"Music Is My Radar\", and compile a few of the band's best songs. There is of course the track that made them famous: \"Song two\", as well as their mellow yet really good song \"Coffee and TV\".

His fourth album \"The Great Depression\" proves why the was prevalent back in that time. When I heard \"Who We Be\", I had to snatch this one up in a heart beat. Along with \"Who We Be\", the other lead single was \"We Right Here\", which was pretty decent sounding to some people. What would really get my attention throughout this album was the energetic the songs would sound. That should't be a surprise because that's X speciality when rhyming. \"Bloodline Anthem\" was a one of those songs with an energetic sound to it. \"When I'm Nothing\" would be another as X rhymes over an old school R&B; beat. I'm feeling the beat to the song \"I'ma Bang\", which is another dope song. There are a few soft sounding songs on there also. Two notable jones were the grandma dedication \"I Miss You\" and the song \"You Could Be Blind\". There are a few bonus songs there that appear after \"A Minute For Your Son\". The first would be \"Next Out The Kennel\" featuring the new group Bloodline freestyling over old DMX songs while DJ Kay Slay hosts the song. The next song \"Problem Child\" would feature Drag-On and Mysonne, a decent sounding song to me. The last song \"The Usual Suspects II\" featuring Mic Gerinmo and Big Stan a dope song that I'm feeling real well. Only few problems I have with the song is the song \"Number eleven\" that really goes no where. Also a loaded number of bonus songs at the send of the CD should be placed throughout the CD would have been nice also. Other than that, great DMX album. I recommend this to people who are fans of DMX, as this proves one of this better albums.

His fourth album \"The Great Depression\" revealed the reason for this popularity at the time. I said when I heard about \"who are we\" my heart pounded. Along with \"Who We Are\", one of the leading jones says \"We're Here\", which sounds good to some people. The thing that caught my attention the whole album was that the songs sounded so powerful. This should come as no surprise, for this is a special X rhythm. \"Blood Song\" is one of the most lively songs. \"When I Have Nothing\" will be another X rhythm of classic R&B; hit. I hear the rhythm of the song \"Ima Bang\", another drug song. There are also soft-sounding songs there. Two famous Joneses \"I Miss You\" and the song \"You Can Be Blind\" were sung by their grandmother. Some bonus songs appeared after \"Your Son's Minute\". The first is \"Next Out The Kennel\" The new Bloodline band has freely released an old DMX song, and DJ Kay Slay is holding the song. The next song \"Children's Problem\" will feature Pull and Mysonne, and this song sounds great to me. The last song \"The Usual Suspects II\" was sung by Mic Gerinmo and Big Stan, and I felt very happy. The problem I have with this song is that the song \"Number eleven\" has nowhere to go.

The thing that draws me the most to this album is that the songs will get excited. This should not come as a surprise, because if there is a contract, it is a special X. \"Bloodline Anthem\" was one of those songs with a strong voice. \"When I'm nothing\" may be another X-locks in the old R&B school.

Two of Jones' most famous songs were \"I Miss You\" and the song \"You might be blind\". There are some bonus songs that appear after \"Your Son's Minute\". The first will be \"Next Out The Kennel\" featuring a new band Bloodline free styling on old DMX songs with DJ Kay Slay in charge of the songs. The next song \"Child of Trouble\" will be played by Drag On and Mason, which I like. The last song \"The Usual Suspects II\" which includes Mic Gerinmo and Big Stan is a song that does't feel right.

I. is a tight wrapper that only people from GA for the South ( in most cases) has heard of. His flow is sick and this country accent rivals that of Bubba Sparxxx. His lyrics are some of the better that come from the South; not quite spectacular but they are tight nonetheless. His beats are impressive though, with everyone from Organized Noize to The Neptunes contributing to this man's success. These producers realize the potential that T. I. has and they blend him some excellent tracks to rhyme over. PA ( Parental Advisory ) and Jazze Pha ( who's had success with Nappy Roots, Jim Crow, Too Short, Ludacris, Eightball & MJG and others ) also give him the star production that most underground wrappers never see. He makes many references to many places in ATL like Campbellton Road, Old National, Bankhead, College Park etc. etc. and is really fun to hear him talk about places I know and have been. Props to T. I. for prepping it right. T. I. sounds far from an amateur on this debut album I'm Serious. His rhymes as mentioned before are tight as anyone's, and the has a superior dirty south flow. The voice is tight and the can flow fast for slow which means the does't use the same flow throughout the cd, which means a less boring listen. The production is off the hinges. The title song featuring Beenie Man, is a definite club banger, placed by the always-tight Neptunes. In fact this is one of the Neptunes best beats and Beenie Man delivers on the chorus. Whatz Yo Name also placed by the Neptunes, crafts a very soothing uncharacteristic beat from them that shows their versatility. T. I. trips up this verses as well. Jazze Pha places Chooz U which is another one of this trademark futuristic riding beats. T. I. again shows this skills on this track; this storytelling is off the hook. This is one of the best songs on this album. Still Aint Forgave Myself is an code to this fallen homies and this guilt of being the one that lived. Outstanding. The best song on the album though, has to be the Too Short collaboration Hotel, with PA giving T. I. one of their best beats. The beat is just so relaxing and pimped out. T. I.'s storytelling is at the forefront on this song and the does't disappoint. He even outshines the Original Pimp Too Short at this own game, and that is a feat that few others have accomplished. Overall T. I. is lined up to be the next great thing that the South has to offer. Maybe with this next album the will blow up. This cd is competing with Slimm Cutta Calhoun's debut The Skinny for best Southern Debut of two thousand and one.

The production is outside the belt of the title track featuring Beenie Man, a certain club banger, set by the poor Neptunes. It\u2019s definitely one of Neptune\u2019s best beats and Beenie Man offers a chorus. The name Whatz Yo was also put on by Neptunes, a very relaxed undisclosed artist who presents their performances. T. I. also upholds these verses. Jazze Pha sets Chooz U one of this business\u2019s reputation for future hits. T. I. are -demonstrated these skills in this way; This story has come out. This is one of the best songs on the album. Still Aint Forgive Myself is a rule for these dead people and the sin of being alive. Excellent. The best song on the album, however, has to be the Short Collaborative Hotel, where T. I.\u2019s PA gives one of their best beats. The beat is very relaxed and made. T. I.\u2019s story tops this song and does\u2019t fail. It\u2019s even higher than the original Pimp which was very short in this game, and that\u2019s a success that few more have achieved. Overall, T. I. is set to be the next big thing the South has to pay. Maybe the next album will explode on this cd it will be competing with Slimm Cutta Calhoun for her debut album This album is a must for ATLiens anyone who loves dirty music in the south.","overall":5,"summary":"GA Represent folk","unixReviewTime":1019347200,"reviewTime":"04 21, 2002"}

If \"jagged\" was a protest album, with intriguing questions, \"supossed former\" was a peaceful CD after the storm she went through, I can define \"under drug swept\" as a nice try of calais to find out who she is.\"twenty-one things I want in a lover\" is a song that talks about Mr.perfect in calais'point of view, which is something impossible to find in real life. \"Narcissus\" talks about an mature man, who is not ready to have a relationship. \"Hands clean\", the first single, is an immediate hit. It's pure pop, simple and direct, though it is based on a relationship calais had with an older man when she was very young. It's written like a dialog: the speaks, she answers him. \"Flinch\" is a great ballad, very powerful, showing how hard a breakup can be. It's kind of mellow and sometimes boring, but it's great. \"So unsexy\" is very interesting song, showing calais as a critic of herself, with all women's insecurities and doubts. \"Precious Illusions\" has a great chorus, and is very constructive. \"That particular time\" is a slow song, which repeats the title over and over, so that you can assimilate what calais is trying to say. \"A man\" is calais seeing herself as a man, with all masculine desires and lots of chauvinism sentences. \"You lowe me nothing in return\" is a balance of failed relationships, with spain and reciprocal offences. A great lesson to be learned. \"Surrendering\" is a great song with calls attention because of its structure. It starts slow, growing towards the great chorus. \"Utopia\" is the perfect song to understand the actual world conflicts, so that calais put it in her official site right after sept eleven attack. Alanis is a great artist and this CD is a must-have item for all those people who appreciate good music and like to question themselves about life issues, just like calais does.","overall":5,"summary":"third studio album ..new phase for alanis","unixReviewTime":1015372800,"reviewTime":"03 6, 2002"}

True, simple and true. It reveals a new dimension to life in Calais. After the violent \"Sawtooth Pills\", peace of mind \"supposedly predecessor's infatuation\", Calais returned with this new song The most interesting thing about Calais Love is that the is close to the community, revealing all this experiences in human relationships. I think this is a great psychological treatment for her, because making music is a way to express her personal problems and help people find a way out. If \"Jagged\" is a plaque with interesting questions, and the \"forerunner\" is a quiet CD after the got the storm, then I would describe \"back drugs\" as good and come and try to find out who you are. \"Twenty-one Things I Want From A Lover\" is a song about a perfect gentleman from the point of view of Calais, unattainable in real life. \"Daffodil\" tells a mature man who is not ready to date. The first single \"Clean Hands\" was immediately liked. This is pure, simple and direct pop music, even though it is based on Calais' relationship with an older man when the was very young. It is written that it is a conversation: speak, you answer him. \"Flinch\" is a large, very powerful ballad, which shows how difficult it is to split. It\u2019s small and boring at times, but it\u2019s okay. \"Unsexy\" is a very interesting song that portrays Jialai as her critic, with all women's insecurity and scepticism. The song \"Precious Illusion\" is great and very uplifting. \"That Season\" is a slow song that repeats the title over and over again to understand what Calais is trying to say. \"Man\" is Calais who sees himself as a man, with all the masculine desires and many chauvinistic judgments. \"You don't give me a refund\" is a measure of failed relationships, Spain and resentment. A good lesson. \"Dedication\" is a great song that attracts people's attention because of its structure. It starts slowly, moving towards the cantata side. \"Utopia\" is a good song to understand the conflicts of the real world, so Calais posted it on this official website shortly after the September eleven attacks. Alanis is a great artist. This CD is a must have for anyone who appreciates great music and loves to ask questions about this life, like Calais.","overall":5,"summary":"third studio album ..new phase for alanis","unixReviewTime":1015372800,"reviewTime":"03 6, 2002"}

Although it started as part of a new Wave \/ pop sound in the late one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, the cars' unique bass line, rhythm guitar, and brilliant keyboards to describe thousands, nine hundred and eighty. The ongoing bass and guitar improvisation featured their first song \"Just What I Need\", which gave the girl in a lazy song, a left-handed compliment and a visual insight: \"I don't care if you come there and ruin me\" Everything. time \"and\" It's not the perfume you're wearing \/ not the ribbon on your hair. \"Accompanied by the tool and the harmony\" Girl of my best friend \"\" Coming again while dancing under the stars \"is a sign She exploded in a boom in the city of heartbeat.\" Allow fun times rolling \"has a different consistency and is another word for cars. Judging a team based only on the top forty hits on the top ten is not always a good barometer. In their ten-year career, there were not many car teams, and only four of them entered the top ten. Their fourth album \"Shake It Up\" has done this. The first of these is \"Shake It Up\". Its running synthesizer and hopeful drum sound, and Ocasek's unusual sound, to me are examples of the sound of a Car. rhythmic guitar, and heavy guitar. This is my second favourite song, and without of which omits the normal car sound, a clear sound is reflected there. I remember this in a video where Ric Ocasek became a flying insect. This comes from their Heartbeat City, their part album produced by Mutt Lange. And my favourite Car song, one of their main charts, Ben Orr-sung ballad \"Drive\" is ranked third on the charts with the support of its many air synthesizers. The girl in this song seems to really want to be looked at in a fast-paced lifestyle, with the phrase \"You can't keep thinking there's no problem \/ Who's going to kick you out of the house tonight?\" These verses include questions for the girl. \"Who will take care of your dreams \/ who will block your page when you shout?\" The single Orr \"Stay the Night\" later experienced the same feeling. #seven \"Tonight She Comes\" is the fourth and final of ten singles. A new song for some of the biggest Hits is as fast as Easton's cool guitar solo \"Can You Think\". The new wave dies. In addition to \"Drive\", they seem to be out of luck with bloody songs such as \"Since You Gone\" and others aimed at the \"I'm Not\" keyboard. Heartbeat City, \"Magic\" has received some very interesting notes with its open sound of old page and heavy guitar, though the space is much slower than \"You Can Think\". \"Hello again\" is fine, but its twenty # display shows that the album sells more and is \"simplified\" when \"Why can't I get it\". As for their last Top forty hitting song \u201cYou Are The Girl\u201d, it\u2019s similar, but more refined and systematic. The song itself is more appealing, more romantic, and has more songs, \"Why not show that smile as you did before?\" and \"You are the girl of my dreams\". I chose it because it gave birth to a crazy sci. -fi \/ foreign videos of women. Compared to the great anthology, Complete Greatest Hits is a low value and therefore a high collection of beats. It provides the essentials on a single CD, including the location and release date of the album and single songs.","overall":5,"summary":"Great sounding collection","unixReviewTime":1404604800,"reviewTime":"07 6, 2014"}

Sister's voice Through, simple and fast and dynamic jones, where the guitar stops the rock, followed by playful songs such as \"ah-ah-ah-ah\". There is simplicity and carelessness, which raises the whole sub-recording step by step. Not in rock and roll fashion, for seventeen for eighteen punk classics. TK's theme is a perfect blend between humanity and punk, where The flexibility of the rough and lead bass creates the atmosphere.

The gloomy-stmospheric type where voice melodies and bass play the lead roles, and the more edgy and rocking jones, where guitars set the stone, followed by playful vocals such as \"ah-ah-ah-ah.

However, I must say that upon hearing this classic album \"Green Street\", I was highly impressed. Recorded for Blue Note in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one, \"Green Street\" finds Grant Green performing in a stripped down power trio setting. Because of the absence of other instruments such as piano for horns, this gives Green plenty of room to show off this relentless guitar chops. Most of the pieces are on the bluesy side such as the opening title track, \"Grant's Dimensions\" and the cover version of the standard \"Alone Together\". His version of Thelonious Monk's \"Round About Midnight\" shows off a tender yet still blues-oriented side of this playing while \"Green With Envy\" reminded me a bit of the instrumental\/fusion side of the Allman Brothers Band (for some reason the Allman's \"In memory of Elizabeth Reed\" came to mind while listening to this track). Rounding out the disc are two bonus alternate takes of \"Alone Together\" and \"Green With Envy\" which are a bit shorter than their master take counterparts. As mentioned above, I'm not overall familiar with Grant Green's music but have found this release to be highly enjoyable.

It was't until this year, while watching an episode of the WB's \"Smallville\" that I was reintroduced to Cash. On one particular instalment, Cash's \"Hurt\" was played. I was blown away by the poignancy of the singer's performance, knowing that the had lost the love of this life: wife June Carter. I had to have the entire album. Cash sounds like a man that has seen it all, the good and the bad, the highs and the flows, and is still standing. Unfortunately, this own demise was a few months away when the made the recording. But, if this was to be this \"last hurrah\", the came out triumphantly. Taking a stab at popular favourites (\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" \"In My Life,\" \"Danny Boy,\" \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\"), the singer infuses new life into them, as only Cash could. Dusting off this spurs, Cash magnificently takes on some true country and WESTERN with \"Desperado,\" \"Sam Hall,\" and \"Streets of Laredo\". My favourite is \"Personal Jesus\" and after one listening, you'll understand why. Cash must've held back the tears as the sang \"We'll Meet Again,\" the last cut on a triumphant disc.

Kim took that beat and made it hers. Go on, girl!******three.\"Doing It Way Big\"-A track for the haters. Kim is wrapping about everything she has. I know you haters can't stand it.******six.\"Shake Ya Bum Bum\"-What is a doing on there? I love it. This is the clean Kim that we really don't know that well.******seven.\"This Is Who I Am\"-This is a great song where Kim puts herself on the table for us to see that she's doing what she does, and if it were any different, it would't be her.******eight.\"The Jump-Off\"-This is the song that turned me onto Lil' Kim. She is hot on this track (visually and lyrically) and I love Timbalands beat. We need more stuff like this.******nine.\"This is a Warning\"-Kim singing about of**king you up if you across there.

She trips it right.******eleven.\"Thug Luv\"-The best part of this song is Kim. Whew, that girl spits fire.

Kim and her man talking' about robbing. Ain't gangsta love so romantic?******fourteen.\"Heavenly Father\"-Another song about Kim putting herself out for us as the listeners to get closer to her. It is a very intimate song, and one of my personal favourites.******fifteen.\"Tha Beehive!\"-Kim is hot on there. She is introducing her new crew on her, and in my eyes, she is the only reason to listen to this hot track with a banging' beat. One of the best.******sixteen.\"Came Back For You\"-This is strictly a song for the fans who love your girl. She proves there she got love for you. It's a great closing track, I think, leaving you to want more.***All in all, this is one of the best female CD's out there.

I know you evil people can't stand it. ******Six. \"Shake Ya Bum Bum\" - what are you doing there? I love it.

Jin and her husband talked about the robbery. Is a gangster's love romantic? ******Fourteen. \"Heavenly Father\" - another song about Kim who is close to us as a listener. This is a very private song and it is one of my favourite songs. ******Fifteen. \"Tha Beehive!\" -Kim is very hot there. He introduces this new employees, and in my opinion, the is the only reason to listen to this famous song with a beating beat. One of the best. ******Sixteen. \"Back to You\" - certainly a song dedicated to the girls' fans who love you. He has shown His love for you. I think this is a great ending song that makes you want more. *** All in all, this is one of the best female CDs. Lil'Kim proves the's a sleeping link in the music industry's skirts, and I'm very happy the can stay.

Ended up buying Dying To Say This To You purely on a hunch, hoping it be worth a quarter of what I paid (a mere ten dollars I might add). To say I was in dire need of some good music was an understatement. I enjoyed Dying. endlessly and figured \"why not get Living In America, it's only weight bucks\". Turns out that, too, was a great choice because I enjoy this CD just as much as I do Dying. About this whole debate as to whether Maja is a competent vocalist for not. My opinion is that yes, she's got a good voice with some interesting lyrics. Sure there are much more talented singers out there but I could't imagine this band being fronted by a more charismatic person. Maja really does beg your attention, good for bad. So the CD starts off on the highest of notes with Seven Days A Week which really feels like a rock song from years past. This song is where you'll decide very quickly if you like Maja for not. The title track, Living In America, is quite possibly the best song featured. With driving guitars (well, driving in The Sounds' case), a memorable chorus, and some nice electronic sounds, if you're looking to get into The Sounds, just listen to this track. Rock'n Roll is a nice slower track where Maja kind of puts her voice on display, a good song to listen to if you're looking to mellow out. Reggie has that 'familiar' feel to it thanks to the chorus, a great track nonetheless. Riot is another terrific song. It's an in-your-face type track with some pretty good lyrics and a great beat. All in all The Sounds have become one of my favourite bands thanks to they're different-ness. Listen to the radio for a day. I am willing to bet that you won't hear anything like them, but of course I haven't listened to the radio in close to a year, so then again, maybe there is. But nevertheless, The Sounds are nothing short of a great band and I hope they'll be around for a long time to come. My favourite songs are Seven Days A Week, Living In America, Hit Me!, Rock'n Roll, and Riot. If you're sceptical about this CD, for the band, after reading all the reviews, just listen for yourself.

Eventually, I bought \u201cDeath Says This To You\u201d directly with intuition, hoping its value was a quarter of the price I paid (I could only add $ ten). To say that I need good music is a misnomer. I love to die. Continuing to think about \"why not stay in the United States, this is weight loss\". Obviously this is a good choice, because I love this CD as Death. The whole conversation is about Maja being a talented artist. My point is, yes, this voice is very good and the words are very interesting. Yes, there are many talented musicians out there, but I would not think that the leader of this group is an attractive person. Maja tasks for your attention, better for worse. So this CD starts with a high note seven days a week, and it sounds like a rock song a few years ago. If you don\u2019t like Maja, this song is where you quickly decide. The title track \"Life in America\" \u200b\u200bis probably the most preferred song. With guitar (well, driving in the case of Sounds), a memorable choir and amazing electronic sounds, if you want to get into Sounds, just listen to this song. Rock'n Roll is a beautiful slow song, Maja showed her voice in it, this song is beautiful, if you want to be soft. Reggie has a \u201cnormal\u201d feeling in it because of the chorus, but nonetheless, this is a big hit. Riot is another fun song. This is a face-to-face song with some very beautiful lyrics and amazing rhythms. All in all, because of their diversity, Sounds has become one of my favourite bands. Listen to the radio all day. I bet you won't hear the same sound, but I certainly haven't listened to the radio for almost a year, say it again, maybe there is. Despite this, Sounds is still a big deal, and I hope they can last a long time. My favourite song is seven days a week, I live in the US, beat! , Rock Music and Controversy. If you are in doubt about this CD, then to the group, after reading all the comments, please listen to them yourself. I love Zandi, but that does't mean you will love it.

It also turns out that this is a great choice because I enjoy this CD as much as I do with Death. It\u2019s about this whole debate about whether Maja is a talented vocalist. My opinion is yes, the got a good voice with interesting words. There are definitely more talented singers, but I can\u2019t imagine this group standing in front of the more glamorous. Maja really begs for how you feel, good for evil. Then the CD starts with the top lyrics of Seven Seven Days that really feel like a rock song over the years. This song is where you quickly decide if you like Maja. The title track, Living in America, is probably the best song never made. Driving guitar (well, driving in the case of The Sounds), memorable chorus, and great electronic sounds, if you want to get into The Sounds, just listen to this track. Rock\u2019n Roll is a slow and beautiful track where Maja shows off her voice, a great song to listen to if you want to melt.

I ended up buying Death To Say This To You Just, I hope it will cost a quarter of my payment (only ten dollars that I can add). The fact that I needed really good music did't mean much. I enjoyed death. Endlessly and I thought, \"Why don't you get to live in the United States, it's just weight loss.\" It turned out that, again, it was great because I enjoy this CD as much as I die. It's all about whether Maja is a talented artist. My opinion is yes, you have a good voice with good words. Of course there are a lot of talented artists out there but I could't imagine the band being run by a passionate person. Maja needs your attention, good and bad. So the CD starts seven days a week with the most notes, which sounds like songs from previous years. This is the song where you will soon decide if you don't like Maja. The title track, Living in America, is probably the best song never. With driving guitar (well, driving in voice mode), an unforgettable course, and other fun electronic sounds, just listen to this track if you want to get into the sounds. Rock in Roll is a beautiful slow-paced song in which Maja blends her voice, a beautiful song you can listen to if you want to relax. Reggie has a 'normal' feel to it because it's a beautiful song. Mischief is another great song. It is a facial expression with beautiful words and beautiful rhythm. Overall the sounds have become one of my favourite bands because they are different. Listen to the radio all day. I'm willing to bet you can't hear anything like that, but I haven't heard radio in over a year, so, maybe it's there. However, voices are no small feat for a large group and I hope they will be there for a long time to come.

Lamb of God have the potential to both move metal forward while also staying true to the classic death and thrash of the heights. This album gets pretty interesting as it goes along, with unexpected song structures that bring out the fearsome chops of the musicians. The true hero of the band is the relentless and airtight drummer Chris Adler, who especially shines in \"Blood of the Scribe\" and \"One Gun.\" Guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler also really stretch out on those two songs, plus other winners like \"The Faded Line,\" \"Omerta,\" and \"What I've Become.\" However, even though these two guys have real power riffs, like most modern metal guitarists they seem to have lost the part of the solo. This is a bit embarrassing because the two best solos on this album are actually from heights thrash heroes Alex Skolnick and Chris Poland, who are guests on the instrumental title track. The music of Lamb of God is true to the standards of real metal, but they also have the weak point shared by just about every metal band we have these days \u2013 the vocals. I have nothing against Lamb of God singer Randy Blythe, and in fact the has a fair amount of flexibility, and even subtlety in a few places. But the pretty much refuses to get out of the standard metal screaming and growling \"cookie monster\" mode (a tragic corruption of Phil Anselmo that a billion singers are doing), and this holds back Lamb of God's forward momentum. The politics of this album's lyrics are also a bit muddled and unfocused, though they are certainly forceful.

Better than Wonder Whats Next and better than # otherPoint. My favourite song is Breach Birth, because the chorus is great. Panic Prone is another good choice, much like Dos (still Chevelle's best song) \"This Kind of Thinking\" has all the hard music, love singing and deep vocals that were famous in the beginning. The first person \"Vitamin R\" is great, but this song makes you want more. And you will hear great songs like the opening song \"Clencher\". I expect Chevelle to be better at releasing this album, because most bands tend to do this when the previous album was a real thing for them. But Chevelle has made another rock record, which only softened a few songs. This disc could be harder than \"WWN\". Songs like \"One Know All\" and \"Tug-O-War\" are amazing! The whole plate is like this! But one of my favourite ways is \"Panic Prone\". A slow and moving song like \"Closing\". Then in the \"emotional drought\", the group received an angry and epic voice, like the one in the \"Lateralus\" Tool. Although I like the band's first album (Point #one), it may still be my favourite because it's still a long way off. \"Wonder Whats Next\" may still be my favourite thing, but it could be because I've been listening to it for the past two years and I've only been listening to \"This kind\" for a week. Either way, I believe all Chevelle fans will I love this.

Things that seemed to come from the heart and soul, not exactly pop music with southern voices. John Butter of can.com has a new country CD, \"Hank\". He is not afraid to use drugs and admire these pictures. Butter: \"It's a young man at home singing at a bar with noisy, devoted fans\" is also a sound experience, many sound itunes make noise. The so-called \"pure\" of the CD album \"Straight Hell\" Version. I found it in a used box at a local music store. To the best of my knowledge, the \"Clean\" version completely removes one track from Disk One and removes a few words from the other tracks. It's not hard to keep in mind when listening, so the research did't bother me. In fact, on page sixty-five, I don't care about the dialogue between the songs anyway. I consider myself a follower of Hank III, and I wish him well. He's so long now that I think the deserves more viewers. At Disc One, the gifts are usually high quality honky stock rock that celebrates drinking, smoking, love, screaming and fighting figures. Some of them were written by him, and although very different from this grandfather's best, the will remember some of the ways of Hank Jr. The tumultuous decades will hold it back, and if you don't take bragging about emotions too seriously, it will put you on the highway and make you smile. Disc two, in my opinion, is a sadly missed opportunity. It has songs, with very little consistency, and if done with extra care, will have a positive effect on the Hank III catalog even if it is released on its own. Instead, it comes with unpleasant distorted sounds that last a long time, and it sounds like a drunken and homely record of friends who are too bad to entertain instead of annoying. \u06d4 Disc two won't get much repetitive drama, but there are times when it reminds me that this boy's skills are more flexible than the \"drunken, drunken non-commercial artist\" we put on. There is nothing wrong with limited commercial music: grandparents live in the area with their best work, as Willie, Whelan and many others did. Disc Two often sounds complete and funny, except when Hank III sings a good song. Disc One is a sensible edge, musical part and interesting arrangements, and for me the second CD is a failed test that should be heard once and for all. Bought it because Hank III deserves promotion, even the best. He is indeed a man, but the great hereditary property of the family has not overwhelmed him. I'm anxious to see what has been brought to the audience ten years from now.","overall":5,"summary":"Hell Is Right! For Me It's Freezing Over!","unixReviewTime":1176595200,"reviewTime":"04 15, 2007"}

The second half of its two thousand and five output, Hypnotize, to me, is much more of a logical step from Toxicity than the very good, yet still regressive, Mezmerize. Where that album toyed with a more tempered and simplistic formula, Hypnotize is a lethal dose of aggression and mayhem filtered through a refreshing maturity in the songwriting department. Possibly throwing a middle finger to the critics who question the musicianship of the group, Hypnotize contains System of a Down's most impressive technical performance since its self-titled debut, hands down. I mean, in no way has this become a technical band, but the songs are far more dynamic, the time signature changes more frequent and complex, and the riffs noticeably more intricate.

And speaking of Daron, the primary songwriter for the band is featured more prominently on the vocals there, and though this has already tragically and predictably led to tabloid-maniacal fervour over the possible dissent in the ranks (see aforementioned The Washington Post eleven\/twenty\/five article), Malakian's added vocal role takes nothing away from Serj's ability to command attention. Instead, the two attain a level of harmonization not present on any previous releases, and the result is SOAD's most impressive vocal performance yet. This obvious cognizance and intent is what leads me to praise this release as a more fitting their to the genius of Toxicity.

Whether it's the to be expected quirkiness of tracks like \"Vicinity of Obscenity\", for the cohesion of the title track, System of a Down has reaffirmed the widespread accolades it received for its monumental Toxicity.

He has released an album of fine part, set at one thousand, and \"Hundred and Fifty\" \"The Night Fly\" - inspired by Gary Katz, former producer of Staley Dean. Although this record was considered very important and commercially successful, it took some time to set the first - a long record. In fact, eleven years had passed since the recording of the release of the second album, \"Kamkariyad\" - another fantasy album that was replaced by car parts. \"Comcast\" is best known for the album that brought Staley Dean back to the studio, as another member, Walter Baker, was one of the album's producers and composers. A few years later, when Staley Dean regained two albums on Reprise Records - two thousand Grammy-winning \"Two Against Nature\" and two and three thousand \"Everything Must Go\". Two thousand six, thirteen years later, Fagan released this third solo album - a dead tops and an old page, \"Morph the Cat\". The album begins with a song titled \"Morph the Cat\", a song about a cat-like ghost wreaking havoc in the city. He sings with the group in the song \"H Gang\" - a short story group whose story is told in the form of a movie. In \"What I Do\", she sings about talking about music with the late Ray Charles. The jazzy \"Bright Night Gown\" tells three different stories about different people and their encounters with death - in the form of illness, robbery and drug use. In \"The Night Belongs to Mona\", Donald sings about a woman who committed suicide, and tells the story of the US government's occupation. Violently in \"My Shut the Garden Door\". Although most of the songs are about death, only one song from the album is beyond imagination. He sings the funny \"Security John\" song, in which Donald is playing with a female security guard at the airport after the cargo is stopped by an X-ray machine. Overall, \"Morph the Cat\" has a good record of Donald Fagan, but it would have been better if some of the songs had been shortened. Still, it's nice to have an album with the creative and realistic mindset of one of Rock's most influential rock songwriters.","overall":4,"summary":"Donald Fagen conceptualizes death on \"Morph The Cat\"","unixReviewTime":1325635200,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2012"}

Not only the album sold better then expected, The Game would also become one of the hottest new artist to emerge from the Hip Hop scene last year.

It's quite a shame cause fifty Cent contributed lot to this debut. However, the guest list is rich on this album also, Busta, Snoop, Jamie Foxx and Xzibit can't go wrong!. Based on the material it's quite obvious that The Game tries to make the best out of the situation and releasing an album that is almost a copy of this debut (even the album cover is). More hard beats and thug life from Compton that is. Now that in't neccesary a bad thing but it does't offer much new ideas, just like fifty Cents Sophmore album.

This is Nas song all the way though, but in thanks the's not even included on the back-cover. Overall, The Game got few new ideas but the recycled concept that worked on this debut seems to work again. Listing to it all (sixteen songs) is hard though, Game constantly mentions this influensts and this past and it's get very trying after a while. It does have it's standouts though and The Game's personality and charchter are just as interesting as it was on this debut. This album is definitely alright, but if Game wants to remain in the spotlight in the future the better stand on this own feet and create a more personal sound with far more dilemmas then this two first albums have dealer with.","overall":3,"summary":"A Tribute to Dre and West Side!","unixReviewTime":1163462400,"reviewTime":"11 14, 2006"}

There are no songs I\u2019ve seen that use the unique tech sound you hear from Summer Two Worlds and nine PM Movin \u2019Melodies, as it\u2019s not suitable for the flow of this collection, and it\u2019s good to listen to. slightly different from there. Another voice was performed by Karen Ires, Jan Lochel performed three songs, Jeppe Ridervold performed three songs. Jan's voice is nothing special. Women\u2019s voices work better with traditional music technology. The second CD is a good ambient CD, like the atwood CD in both worlds. While the atwood CD is all that non -voice, it makes me ask that the first CD had more sound than it does. It\u2019s very similar in the same world to the overall style of song selection, but it would be nice to have a straightforward CD full of audio songs. The atwood CDs seem to have early [noticeable] effects though, but they don\u2019t penetrate too much to leave a steady and steady wave. I was surprised that this album was called Trilogy because you only get one for two CDs, not three. Having many of the guest performers produce three songs helps turn the CD into one in a trilogy, but otherwise it\u2019s mostly high-tech songs with some great jones Heather Nova, and Justify ( Unspecified Vocalist), Desperate Religion (Vocalist Karen Ires), and The Beautiful World without a voice will also appear on the first CD. Nothing sticks to the atwood CD for me, but it\u2019s definitely not a bad CD. This is one of those CDs I like to read a book near the pond on a sunny day. Also, if Two Worlds is part II of the series and the Trilogy is Part III, it's not clear which CD is meant to be \"Part I.\" ATB and Heather Nova clearly have a good relationship considering that she has done two songs about The Two Worlds. din. So, we can certainly expect amazing things to happen with these two. Now if only Mensano could release this Heather Nova album there.","overall":5,"summary":"Great Album !!!","unixReviewTime":1244419200,"reviewTime":"06 8, 2009"}

It's a shame D'arcy and James Iha did not reunite, but after having listened to Zeitgeist several times through the last couple of days, the results could't be more satisfying with for without the two missing members. Ok, wok, that was a lie. I miss them! Anyways, I always admired how the early Smashing Pumpkins crossed through creative boundaries\/grunge norms during their time, mixing artistic experimental elements to their score rock sound while learning amt mainstream success with their unique style(image and music); which is why I am glad to see the new SP on Zeitgeist still a step away from current trend of \"emo\" for \"indie\" music by making a very straight forward yet sonically diverse rock in' roll album with Corgan's signature poetic lyrics with some songs (unsurprisingly after a glance at the cover part) seem to be about the strikes we are currently facing in your modern society while still being somewhat broad to interpretation. This is probably the Pumpkins most solid rock record since \"Gish\". The songs of Zeitgeist? \"Doomsday Clock\" is a powerful opening track, and rocks as much as the opening track \"Everlasting Gaze\" from Machina I did; but unlike Machina I, Zeitgeist rocks on with angst \"seven Shades Of Black\". \"Bleeding the Orchid\" is probably my favourite track on the record, beginning with beautiful echoes from Corgans voice. The song is very \"Adorish\", but with fantastic Camberlin drumming! A dream come true. \"Thats The Way(My Love Is)\" Is a cheerful sounding rock tune some what reminecent of \"Siamese Dream\" with some experimental elements, and ends beautifully. The mood is ruined(in a good way!) as \"Tarantula\", the first album single, rocks your brains out with its anthemic chorus and Corgans squealing guitar. \"Starz\" is a very stop-and-start song with cloud and quiet parts. I think Jimmy shows off lot in this track :). \"United States\", probably my atwood fax. song on Zeitgeist, is an epic colossal nine:fifty-one Smashing Pumpkins grand song masterpiece much like \"Silverf*ck\" was, but with some jazz and metal elements in it(mainly the instrumentation). The song is angry! \"Neverlost\" to me is kind of sappy softy with a bubbly noise(zilaphone?) in the background. \"Bring The Light\" brings the rock back and follows in the same vein as \"That's the Way (My Love Is)\", which is a good thing. \"(Come On) Let's Go!\" demands your attention like \"Tarantula\" did and rocks just as hard. \"For God & Country\" sounds lot like an early Cure song, with a steady drum beat and keyboard. The songs lyrics (to me) are very inspirational and have a hopeful message in them. ahhhh. the final song \"Pomp And Circumstance\" is the most old SP sounding song on the record and continues the SP's reputation of ending records with painfully beautiful grand finally song. Hopefully, Zeitgeist will be only the first of many records to come from The Smashing Pumpkins, because like lot of people who grew up listening to this band, the news of the groups two thousand and seven reformation was a dream almost come true. Maybe in the near future D'arcy and Iha will rejoin, but if not, whatever. As Apparent in Zeitgeist, Corgan and Camberlin seem to have no problem continuing the SP legacy.

It is unfortunate that D'arcy and James Iha never met again, but after listening to Zeitgeist several times over the past few days, with the exception of the two missing members, the results could not be satisfactory. Yeah, wow, that's a lie. I miss them! In any case, I have always recommended how the former Smashing Pumpkins transcended the design boundaries \/ grunge standards of their time, incorporated artistic materials into their rock of musical notes, and at the same time learned common success with their unique style (images and music). ; That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to see that the new SP at Zeitgeist is one step away from the current \u201cemo\u201d of \u201cindie\u201d music, and has produced a straightforward but unique disc that contains the lyrics of Coron\u2019s poems and specific songs. (Not surprisingly after looking at the router section) It seems to be the strike we are facing now in modern society, but the explanation is still broad. This could be the Pumpkins' hardest rock record since \"Gish\". A song of the spirit of the times? \"Doomsday Clock\" is a powerful opening song, as shocking as my opening song \"Everstanding Gaze\" in Machina; but unlike Machina I, the Zeitgeist moves with \"seven dark shadows\". \"Bleeding Orchid\" is probably my favourite song, which begins with the sweet sound of Corgans' voice. This song is very \"religious\", but with the amazing Cumberlin drums! The dream is coming true. \"That's the Way (My Love Is This)\" is a happy rock song, reminiscent of \"Siamese Dream\", with some experimental elements and a beautiful ending. The air is spoiled (in a good way!) Because \"Tarantula\", the first one on the album, shocks your mind with the chorus of the national anthem and the playing Kogans guitar. \"Starz\" is a very central song, with bright spaces and atmosphere. I think Jimmy has shown a lot in this song :). \"America\", may be my Fawood fax. The song on Zeitgeist is nine outstanding songs: fifty-one Smashing Pumpkins songs are excellent, like \"Silverf * eck\", but have some elements of jazz and metal (mostly musical instruments). The song is cloud! \"Neverlost\" to me is a soft and soft background with a bubble noise (phones?). \"Bring light\" replaces rock and roll, and like \"That's the way (My love is)\", this thing is fine. \"(Come) Let's go!\" It demands your attention like a \"tarantula\", and it moves very much. \"To God & Earth\" sounds very much like an instant healing song, with stable drums and keyboards. The lyrics of this song (mine) are encouraging and have a message of hope. Tshotsho. The last song \"Pomp And Circumstance\" is the oldest SP song on record, and continues the SP fame to send the record with a sad and beautiful song at the send. I hope the Zeitgeist is the first of many Smashing Pumpkins records, because like so many people who grew up listening to this band, the news of the band\u2019s transformation in two thousand and seven is almost a dream come true. Maybe in the near future, D'arcy and Iha will rejoin, but if not, that's fine.

It's a shame that DRC and James never met again, but after listening to Zeitgeist several times over the past few days, the results have not been satisfactory except for the two missing members. Well, that was a lie. I miss them!

Added artistic features for That's why I'm so excited to see the new SP in Zeitgeist, with straightforward but diverse rock in-rolls with Corgan's signature poems and lyrics, far removed from the current trend of \"emo\" in \"indie\" music. The songs (not surprising after looking at the cover) seem to be facing these attacks in your modern society when they are still broad in definition. This is probably the strongest record of pumpkins by \"Gush\". Zeitgeist songs? \"Dom Day Clock\" is a powerful opening track, and it runs like Machine I's opening song \"Everlasting Guys\". But unlike Machina I, Zeitgeist angrily attacks with \"Seven Shades of Black\". \"Bleeding the Orchid\" is probably my favourite song on record, starting with the beautiful melodies of the word Corgans. The song says a lot of \"Adorish\", but it has great Kimberlyn music! A dream came true. A rocky rock song similar to \"Thats The Way (My Love Is A)\" \"Siamese Dream\" has some searching features, and it concludes well. Things are getting worse (well!) Like \"Tarantula\", the first solo album, it shakes your mind with your anthem and playing the Corgans guitar. \"Stars\" is a separate song with clouds and quiet parts. I think Jimmy is showing a lot in this line :). \"America\", maybe my Atwood fax. The song for Zeitgeist is a nine-song track: Fifty-one Smashing Pumpkins like \"Silverf * eck\", but with jazz and metal elements (especially instruments) on it. The song is angry! To me, \"Neverlost\" is a kind of soft noise in the background (zila phone?). \"Bering the Light\" returns to the rock and follows it as \"This is the way (my love)\", which is great. \"(Come on) let's go!\" It needs your attention as Tarantula does and moves hard. \"For God and Country\" sounds like the first healing song, with a strong drum beat and keyboard. The lyrics (for me) are very inspiring and have a message that you hope for. Ahh. The last song, \"Pump and Circumstances,\" is the oldest SP vocalist in the record, and at the send, it continues the SP's record-breaking completion with a particularly sweet song. I hope Zeitgeist will be the first of many records to appear in Smashing Pumpkins, because like many people listening to this group, the stories of two thousand seven revolutionary groups were a dream come true. DRC and Iha may rejoin in the near future, but if not, anything. As seen in Zeitgeist, Corgan and Kimberlyn seem to have no problem continuing the legacy of the SP. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"The (new) Smashing Pumpkins Return!","unixReviewTime":1184112000,"reviewTime":"07 11, 2007"}

It is a shame that DRC and James never met again, but the results were unsatisfactory. \"Doomsday Clock\" is a powerful opening track, and it moves like a machine. I jumped down, screamed, cheered, danced a little. On this day, Samsung Pumpkins played a farewell program in the metro. Despite the fact that this group helped explain my early youth, it abused my page in the last few years of the twentieth century. Over the years, I lost interest in band music and became disillusioned with Billy Corgan's singing style. So on this glorious winter day of two thousand, I celebrated the fact that the music group would no longer be there to erase my memories. I now remember my one hundred, nine hundred and ninety-six tablets without the constant interruption of new albums and songs. And on June twenty-one, two thousand and five, Mr. Corgan illegally announced that a band was being formed to make a new album, and I felt a little out of place. So now, after seven years of peace, Smashing Pumpkins is back. And not only has their list changed, but so has my opinion of them. As expected, the Pumpkins changed their stone dramatically. The sound of this strong salty rock, which I loved so much in the early nineties, had long since faded away instead of this heavy, constant sound. This is confirmed by \"Zeitgeist\", \"Central Peace\" of \"United States\", a ten minute epic that could be a deadly weapon of this tool if it were not for the words of Corgan that remain in the nose. Even the softest moments of the album are extremely painful, almost almost obscure clouds. Drummer Jimmy Chamberlain looks better than never on this album, perhaps released by the band's new direction. Since the band split into two thousand, my dislike of Billy Corgan's voice has only been reinforced by this solo album and Forgotten Zwan. So I did't expect Morgan to be surprised when I first heard \"Zeitgeist\" and surprisingly the has't been so surprised yet. Most of the time, it looks like these words are very different from other bands on the plane. Take, for example, the \"hour of judgment\" in which the difference between accent and band is noticeable. At the same time, however, Coron's lyrics have an extraordinary appeal to those who emerge as the album progresses. I was surprised to learn that although Morgan's words had bothered me from the start of the album, I would have stayed with him completely by the send of the album. They don't bother me at all anymore. The album begins with a very impressive \"Doomsday Clock\" in which Corgan sings in anticipation of the demise of a civilized world: \"Kafka may be proud to know that I am confident in posting.\" That's how I was shocked! \" Chamberlain's brilliant drum not only makes the song a good start, but also takes it along its length. \"That's the way it is (my love)\" is not very popular all around. The cat's voice play is not fun at all, and the music is worth forgetting. There is some relief that will be found in heavy synthesizer, however, in my opinion saving the song is not enough. Fortunately, the next two tracks, \"Tarantula\" and \"Starz\" are enough to clear your mind. \"Tarantula\" is an endless rock song that features really impressive guitar playing (in depth, someone calls and finds this song in the next guitar hero) and found the cat singing \"We're Real\" If the real never existed, and just because we say, \"Every living soul is doomed, we are a victim of someone else.\" It did't matter to me when I first heard it. It has since become my favourite song on the album. Going forward, despite the fact that \"Stars\" shared the name of the television network, it soon became my favourite song. On \"Zeitgeist\". Part of the song when Billy sang \"We are the stars, we are\" is so well-crafted that it is quickly absorbed into your memory. Add it to the last thirty seconds and amazing songs, and you've got yourself one of the best Pumpkins songs of the last fifteen years. And \"Bring the Light\" is a religious song in which the cat sings \"You can spit in the dust and mix my money and your blood\" before revealing the title, \"Son of God.\" This is what it is. What did I learn from \"Zeitgeist\"? I've learned that just because a band artist has't released a decent album in over a decade does't mean it's \"lost.\" Most importantly, however, I've learned that Smashing Pumpkins are back for good! The band has lost two very important members, but under the direction of Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlain, I can say that Jeff Schroeder and Ginger Reis performed well. Despite the fact that \"Zeitgeist\" may have a few longest tracks (depending on which version you buy), there is no doubt that it is the best rock album of two thousand and seven so far. This announcement is coming to you because of someone who did't expect much from \"Zeitgest\" and ended up getting something good. For fans of Smashing Pumpkins, you must buy! Recommended for fans of Smashing Pumpkins, even those who never got tired of the band after \"Adore\" and \"Machina\". Keywords: a. Two \"hours of doomsday\". Three \"Tarantula\". Four \"stars\". Five \"America\". \"Bring Light\" Seven out of ten stars","overall":5,"summary":"The (new) Smashing Pumpkins Return!","unixReviewTime":1184112000,"reviewTime":"07 11, 2007"}

The album has received grave reviews and (in terms of indie releases) commercial recognition. Bone Ivor recently released the \"Blood Bank\" EP, and two new tracks on \"Dark Night Was\" are in the second part of my favourite track album: \"Creatures of Fear\". Team \"Instrumental Release\" as a separate song, followed by \"For Emma\", which is a traditional song from the album. For example, \"Flume\", the first two lines say \"I'm the only one my mother \/ coffee\", that comes to you. I like the \"Flow\" launcher, in which Justin's voice is cloud, almost angelic, never ending. Bone Ivor has recently released two new tracks on the \"Blood Bank\" EP as well as the \"Dark Was the Night\" charity completion. I recently learned elsewhere that this album now sells over one hundred and twenty-five copies, zero, which is an amazing number for this type of indie music release. I will finally get a chance to see Bon Ivor at a June concert in Bonnaro, and I don't know what to expect, but it's definitely one of my most watched shows this year. \"For Emma, \u200b\u200bForever Forever\" (nine tracks; thirty-seven minutes.) *** One \/ two With this word, I have automatically thought of Van Morrison. It was before I knew you had the root noise. When I started the album, there were some signed guitar sound guides who also opened Van Morrison's beautiful Austral wax. Twenty seconds later I was expecting to hear the tragic words of a well-known trademark, but instead I was treated like a beast with a beast. I sat there for a moment, almost confused, thinking, \"Well, that's not bad.\" Bon Ivor is not the first artist in the world, and the songs are very low level, but the word, these songs make Emma what she is. And it's a good start to what should be the brightest work of songwriting. \"Flume\" is the biggest point of the album, unfortunately for us in the beginning. However, the way Bon Ivar's voice moves, a play in which the words are pointed out and without stress is disturbing. And while iron and wine have a clear influence, there is no need to overdo it. There is a significant difference in their delivery which is almost irrelevant. Iron & Wine has a tendency to make songs more difficult from the beginning as the song progresses. However, Bone Ivor is very satisfied with the simple string of this guitar, even if it is just a few basic options. I'm fine with that too - Stephen. ]","overall":4,"summary":"One year later: the phenom keeps growing","unixReviewTime":1235174400,"reviewTime":"02 21, 2009"}

However Hank III adds a bit more punk into the mix on DRRP. The album starts off with a well-placed shot at the Grand Ole Opry and their poor treatment ofHank William Sr.'s legacy. While some may say that it's just another \"been there, done that\" salvo from Hank III against the establishment I can understand where the's coming from. For I know of similar scumbags in another business entirely who are willing to craft a false image and profit off of others' work. Hence, Hank Williams still in't reinstated while they keep this likeness outside their door. From there it's just one great song after another. There's much to appreciate about this album that does't have an over-produced feel. The instruments actually sound lively and not compressed. There is a lot of breathing room for the sound to develop. And what more can be said about the GG Allin tribute, \"P. F. F.\" Actually it's more like two tracks together as one of the same track: One at very high tempo with the full band and the other half being a slowed-down acoustic version, with each separated by a soundbite from GG Allin himself. Four tracks, \"Wild & Free\", \"Six Pack Of Beer\", \"If You Can't Help Your Own\" and \"Workin Man\" are true anthems for us who work for a living. Two more, \"Candidate For Suicide\" and \"Stoned & Alone\", capture the essence of melancholy with the former wry and somewhat exaggerated while the latter being slow and deliberate in getting the feel of feeling down and alone just right. \"Height Line\" is downright sinister in its own right while \"three Shades Of Black\" is a bit more stripped down in production and serves as a dark anthem for Hank three and this friends (\"Me & My Friends\" is by far more upbeat). \"I Wish I Knew\" is a great song about a breakup, a perfect song for real country radio as hinted at on this\"Lovesick Broke & Driftin'\"album. This is a great followup to\"Straight To Hell\". As someone who has witnessed this evolution from merely being the son of Hank Williams Jr. for the sake of \"brand recognition\" on the\"Three Hanks\" albumto this I can't wait to see what else the can do with this own style of country music.

Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","helpful":[135,149],"reviewText":"More than a singer, a songwriter, for an instrumentalist; Colin Meloy has always been a storyteller. From The Decemberists' humble debut in two thousand and one, this has always been the case. It is for that reason, perhaps, that it's perplexing that it took the group this long to release a concept album, a record that tells one story throughout its length. two thousand and six's brilliant The Crane Wife came close, with a story told over several tracks. Even with that under their belt, however, tackling a rock opera, a genre notoriously riddled with incoherent storytelling and major disappointments, is quite the mountain to climb - even for Meloy. Still, if any artist in today's musical world could right this troubled format, it would be Meloy. Fortunately, the has outdone not only the artists that have tried this method before, but even himself in the process. The Hazards of Love tells the story of Margaret, a meek villager who falls in love with William, an inhabitant of a nearby magical forest. Margaret soon discovers that she is pregnant with William's child and sets off into the forest to find him. But as is so often the case with Meloy's stories, their love and future are threatened by William's jealous mother, the Queen of the forest, and a crazed, murderous widower. The album's first weight songs set up the love story between the two central characters, while the album's second half brings the action to the story, ultimately ending with a beautiful, touching finale. As already noted, the album's greatest strength is the story that it tells. Obviously, this should come as no surprise to any seasoned Decemberists fan, but the elongated format provides Meloy the opportunity to tell this story differently than has been done in the past. One of the devices that Meloy relies heavily on is foreshadowing, something that can't really be done on a single song. Throughout the tale, subtle imagery and lines are implemented that hint at the fate of not only William and Margaret, voiced by Meloy and Becky Stark respectively, but their antagonists as well. The implementation of foreshadowing blends itself to repeated listening, and as the puzzle pieces all fall into place over time, I've found myself smiling at the intricacy of the tale. One of the perils of concept albums that The Decemberists have overcome with The Hazards of Love is that they have kept the story about as coherent as possible. If one were to go back and examine all the \"great\" rock operas and concept albums of the past (Pink Floyd's The Wall, for The Who's Tommy), they are likely to find that the stories are weak, confusing, and stimulate little emotion from the listener. The Hazards of Love exceeds where these albums have failed, and though it's difficult to make a call on it this early in the game, it may be the greatest story that Meloy has never told. Without question, though, it has already risen to the upper echelon of my \"favorite concept albums\" list. A lot of that has not only to do with the story, but with the music as well. The Decemberists have taken a great risk in making this album as they have, relying heavily on aspects of progressive rock and metal. With the exception of \"Isn't it a Lovely Night,\" there is little on The Hazards of Love that hardens back to the band's Victorian-era styling of past albums. This is a rock opera, after all. With that leap comes the threat of alienating many of the fans that they have gained over the years. This album is awash with grandeur and bombast that would have never even have been considered for previous Decemberists' records. But all of it has its place on the album, and all of it feels appropriate for the story being told. For example, The Queen, voiced by Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond, is always accompanied by heavy metal riffs that mirror her evil, dark presence in the story. A lot of credit should be given to Meloy and Chris Funk who absolutely make these portions of the album feel natural and exciting, rather than forced. And while I'm dishing out praises, Shara Worden is a revelation as The Queen! Her few moments on the album alone make the whole thing worth listening to! In truth, every musician who has least their talents to the creation of this album has done a fantastic job. I do feel, however, that Jenny Conlee might have been underutilized this time around, as her skills are sort of downplayed throughout the album to make room for Meloy and Funk. There are moments where she shines, like on the instrumental \"The Crossing,\" but these are scarce on the record. And yet despite all the musical changes that have been made to the band's sound to make this album work, I can't help but love every second of it! A Decemberists record for not, this is a fantastic work of part that I've listened to over and over again for the last few weeks. It is an album filled with beauty, emotion, and of course, Meloy's dark-twisted humour! I get chills when Shara Worden hits that last note of \"Repaid,\" I chuckle at the ultimate fate of The Rake in \"Revenge!,\" and a little bit of me breaks every time I hear the gorgeous finale, \"The Drowned\" (possibly the best song Meloy has never written). This is an album that begs to be heard. It is one that is deserving of every positive word that it receives from myself for any other fan. The Decemberists have risked their reputation to release a record that is markedly different from anything that we have never heard before. The result is something far too beautiful for words, too poignant for further commentary. My words send there.

This has been the case never since the members of the group began submissively in December two thousand and one. Perhaps for this reason, it is puzzling that the band took so long to release a disc that tells the story throughout its length. The two thousand and six Craft Crane Wife is nearing its send. The story tells a few songs. However, even under their belt, facing the rock opera, a well-known genre full of unconventional stories and great disappointment, is a mountain to climb \u2014 even to Meloi. However, if any artist in the music industry today could fix this troublesome format, it would be Meloi. Fortunately, the not only excelled at the artist who had tried this method before, but even excelled in the process. \"The Danger of Love\" tells the story of a humble president Margaret falling in love with William, a president of a nearby forest. Margaret soon learned that she was pregnant with William's baby, so she went to the forest to find him. But like Meloi's story, their love and their future are threatened by William's jealous mother, Queen of the Jungle, and insane widow. The first difficult song of the album supports the love story between the two middle characters, while the second half of the album brings action to the story, which ends with a beautiful and moving ending. As mentioned earlier, the biggest benefit of the album is the story it tells. Obviously, this should\u2019t surprise any experienced December Pie fan, but the clean format gives Meloy a chance to tell the story in a different way than before. One tool Meloy relies on is foreshadowing, one that no human could never accomplish. Throughout the story, subtle images and lines depict not only the future of William and Margaret, announced by Meloi and Becky Stark, respectively, but also by their opponents. The implementation of previews and repeated listening are combined. One of the dangers of a sensible album over December and the dangers of Love is that they keep the story as closely as possible. If you look back at all the \"big\" operas and previous visual albums (Pink Floyd's Wall, Who's Tommy), they will find that these stories are weak, confusing, and insensitive to the excitement from the listener. The dangers of love outweigh the failures of these albums, and while hard to remember from the beginning of the game, this could be the biggest history Meloy has never talked about. However, there is no doubt that it has climbed to the top of my \"favorite album\" list. Many of them are related not only to stories, but also to music. December Pie has taken a huge risk in making this album, relying heavily on savant-garde stone and metal objects. With the exception of \u201cIs It a Lovely Night\u201d, there is nothing in Love Hazards that can return to Victorian style in previous band albums. After all, this is a rock opera. With this jump came the threat of separating the many fans they had acquired over the years. The album is full of majesty and emotion, which has not been considered in previous December records. But all of these have a place in the album, and they all fit in with the story. For example, the queen proclaimed by Sarah Warden of my bright diamond always makes a heavy metal, showing her ugliness and darkness in the story. Great credit should be given to Meloy and Chris Funk. They certainly made these parts of the album feel natural and interesting, not forced. When I compliment, Sarah Warden's revelation as queen! Only a few minutes the was on the album that made it all ready to listen! After all, every musician with a little talent for making a record has done a great job. However, I feel like Jenny Conlee can\u2019t be fully utilized at the moment because her skills have been featured throughout the album to replace Meloy and Funk. Sometimes it shines, like the music of the instrument \"Crossing\", but these things are rarely seen in records. However, without all the musical changes made to the band\u2019s voice to make this album a success, I can\u2019t help but like every couple! None of the December albums are a good work that I've been listening to for the past few weeks. This is a disc full of beauty, emotion, and of course the darkness and twisted humour of Meloy! When Shara Worden hit the final note \"Repaid\", I shuddered. I was joking about the send of Rake on \"Revenge!\". Every time I heard the beautiful ending of \"Drowning\", I felt like I was going to be disturbed. The song Meloi did not write). This is the album to listen to. This is a good study for every other fan I have found. December jeopardized their dignity and issued a record very different from the record we had never heard before.

From early December two thousand and one, it always happens. For this reason, perhaps, it is surprising that the group took so long to release the concept album, a record that tells the whole story at one length. Two thousand and six glitter Crane's wife approached, with a story in many ways. Even under their belt, however, dealing with the rocky outcrop, which is a popular form of non -fiction and huge disappointment, is a mountain to climb - even Meloy. However, if any artist in today\u2019s music world can improve on this challenging style, it\u2019s Meloy. Unfortunately, The turned out not only artists who have tried this method before, but even himself in the process. The Dangers of Love tells the story of Margaret, a quiet villager who falls in love with William, who lives in a nearby magic forest. Margaret immediately found out she was pregnant with William\u2019s baby and moved into the woods to look for him. But as often happens in Meloy\u2019s stories, their love and future are threatened by William\u2019s jealous mother, the queen of the forest, and a mad widow. The songs of the first album set the love story between the two characters in the middle, while the second part of the album brings action to the story, which eventually ends in a beautiful and poignant ending. As we mentioned earlier, the biggest strength of the album is the story it tells. Obviously, this should\u2019t surprise any December fan, but the long format gives Meloy a chance to tell this story differently than never before. One of the things Meloy trusts is photography, something the can\u2019t really do with a song. Throughout the story, deceptive images and lines are implemented depicting not only the fate of William and Margaret, announced by Meloy and Becky Stark respectively, but also the opposite. The practice of self-expression is a combination of repeated listening, and as all parts of the puzzle unfold over time, I find myself smiling at the complexity of the story. One of the dangers of the idea albums that the winners of December\u2019s Dangers of Love surpassed was to keep the story as close as possible. If one has to go back and look at all the \u201cbig\u201d drama with rocks and ideas at the door (Pink Floyd\u2019s Wall, in Who\u2019s Tommy), they\u2019ll probably realize that the story is weak, confusing. Is, and revoke a little emotion. from the listener. The dangers of love are greater than where these albums fail, and although it\u2019s hard to call it early in the game, it\u2019s probably the biggest story Meloy has never told. However, no doubt, it has already climbed to the top of the \u201cmy favourite opinion album\u201d list. Many of them are not only making the story, but also the music. In December, they took extreme risks in making this album as they did, relying heavily on the advanced parts of rock and metal. Aside from \u201cIsn\u2019t This a Night of Love,\u201d there\u2019s little about the Risks of Love that complicates the Victorian era structure of previous albums. It\u2019s a rock opera, after all. That jump comes with the threat to take away many of the fans they\u2019ve met over the years. This album is so beautiful and so beautiful that it was\u2019t even considered in the previous December record. But they all have their place on the album, and they all feel fit for the story being told. For example, the Queen, voiced by Shara Worden of My Most Beautiful Diamonds, is always accompanied by heavy metals that reflect her evil, dark presence in the story. A lot of credit should be given to Meloy and Chris Funk who completely make these parts of the album natural and interesting, rather than compulsive. And as I commend, Shara Worden is a show like a queen! Just a few minutes at the door makes everyone to listen! In fact, every musician with the slightest talent to create this album has done an amazing job. I do feel, however, that Jenny Conlee may not have been put to good use at this time, as her career slowed down throughout the album to accommodate Meloy and Funk. There are moments to illuminate, such as the \u201cIntersection\u201d device, but these are rarely recorded. And despite all the musical changes made to the band\u2019s voice to make this album work, I can\u2019t help but love every second of it! December record no, this is an amazing piece of work that I have listened to many times over the past few weeks. It\u2019s an album full of beauty, emotion, and of course, Meloy\u2019s twisted dark jokes! I was thrilled when Shara Worden hit the latest version of \"Retreat,\" and I laughed at the latest episode of \"Revenge!\" It's Rake.

The first songs on the album set a love story between the two central characters, while the second part of the album carries the action of the story, and ultimately ends in a beautiful, touching touch. For example, the Queen, voiced by Shara Worden of My Most Beautiful Diamonds, is always accompanied by heavy metals that reflect her evil, dark presence in the story. However, even under the belt, dealing with rock opera, a popular genre full of irrelevant story and extreme frustration, is a mountain you can climb - even Meloy. It is for this reason, perhaps, that it is surprising that the group took so long to release the concept album, a record that tells the whole story at one length.","overall":5,"summary":"Simply Incredible!

Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","helpful":[135,149],"reviewText":"In addition to artist, songwriter, instrumentalist; Colin Melvey has been a news reporter. This has been the case since the beginning of December two thousand and one. That's why, perhaps, it's weird that the band took so long to release a fantasy album, a record that tells the same story in the middle of its length. Two and a half thousand smart cranes reached the wife, telling the story of several tracks. Even if they're under their belt, however, playing rock opera, a genre known for its unconventional storytelling and great frustration, is a mountain to climb - even for the melodies. However, if an artist in the modern world of music can fix this difficult format, it can be a melody. Fortunately, it has surpassed not only the artists who have tried this method before, but also the process itself. Dangers of Love tells the story of Margaret, a gentle villager who falls in love with William, who lives in a nearby magical forest. Margaret soon finds out that she is pregnant with William's baby and goes to the forest to look for him. But as is often the case with Melloy, this love and future are threatened by William's proud mother, the Queen of the Jungle, and the mad and murderous widow. The first heavy metal albums set the stage for a love affair between two middle factors, while the second part of the album brought action into the story, ending with a beautiful, touching ending. As already noted, the great strength of the album is the story it tells. Of course, this should come as no surprise to any experienced December fan, but the expanded format allows Melloy to tell a different story than in the past. One of the tools that Meloi relies on the most is the image, something that does't really happen in a single song. Throughout the fairy tale, subtle images and lines are used to illustrate the fate of not only William and Margaret, presented by Melloy and Becky Stark, respectively, but also by their opponents. The introduction to simulation involves listening over and over again, and as the puzzle pieces unfold over time, I find myself smiling at the complexity of the fiction. One of the dangers of The Decemberists by The Hazards of Love's astonishing albums is that they keep the story as united as possible. If one goes back and discovers all the \"big\" rock and brain albums of the past (Pink Floyd's The Wall, For The Whose Tommy), one may find that the stories are weak, confusing, and very emotional. Are provocative. To the listener. The Hazards of Love went through where these albums failed, and although it's hard to call them at the start of the game, this will be Mello's biggest story never. Without a doubt, however, it has already moved up my list of \"Favorite Albums\". It has a lot to do with not only the story but also the music. The December artists risked their lives to create the album, as they relied on things that influenced progressive rock and metal. Aside from \"Isn't This a Sweet Night\", there's very little in The Hazards of Love that's hard to go back to the Victorian-era band style of past albums. This is a rock opera after all. Then comes the danger of separation, which many fans have experienced over the years. This album is full of splendour and a bomb that could never have been imagined with the previous record of December. But it's all in the album, and it's worth the story. The Queen, for example, described as the Shara Warden of My Brightest Diamond, is always accompanied by heavy metals that reveal her ugliness, her dark presence in the story. Great credit goes to Melville and Chris Funk who made these parts of the album more natural and enjoyable rather than compelling. And while I was mapping, Shara Verdon is a revelation as a queen! Her few moments on the album alone make everything worth listening to! In fact, every artist with so little talent has done a great job building this album. However, I have heard that Jenny Conley was probably not used to it, as her skills were reduced throughout the album to make way for Melloy and Funk. There are times when it shines, like in the song \"The Crossing\", but it's rare on record. Yet despite all the musical changes in the band's voice to make this album work, I can't help it every second. The record of not having December, this is the best work I have heard many times in the last few weeks. An album full of beauty, emotion, and of course, Melloy's curved jokes are black! I get cold when Shara Warden hits the last note of \"Rapid\", \"Revenge!\" I laugh at the send of The Rack, and whenever I hear a good ending, it breaks down a bit for me, \"The Drown\" (probably the best song Mellowe never wrote). This is an album that says listen. It deserves all the beautiful names it gets from any other fan. The December hunters risked their reputation to set a record we had never heard before. The result is so beautiful that words cannot be written, which is so impressive that you can comment again. My words send him there. Key Songs: One. \"You would't want love (Margaret in Taiga),\" they both said. \"What you want comes with a wave \/ came back\" three. \"Queen's Rebellion \/ Crossing\" Four.

The music to this collection is very original and a great symbol of the eclectic mix of music that is coming out of the current British music scene (as many know the leader singer Florence Welch hails from England). Like many reviewing this collection, I was taken in by her song \"Rabbit Heart (Raise it Up)\". She mentions in the song \"this is a gift\", so the meaning of the song most likely implies something positive. There is also the catchy and energetic \"Dog Days Are Over\" (which is a great poppy song). I admit that I am still making out the full meaning of the \"Rabbit Heart\" song.","overall":5,"summary":"Raise Up Your Mood with this Collection","unixReviewTime":1293062400,"reviewTime":"12 23, 2010"}

This band has talent and chose a fantastic name to \u2018Beach House\u2019 instead of the songs enticing a dark night inside. Pop record producer and producer Chris Coady has worked on similar TV shows, Yes Yeah Yeahs, and We Are Scientists. Recorded in a church, the natural retreat is a natural blend well blended with the peaceful voice of Victoria Legrand and the bright instruments of Alex Scally. On the twenty-first of October, two thousand and one pounds, less than a year after Devotion hit the shelves, Beach House released a \u201cUsed to Be\u201d now featuring Teen Dream. Despite a difficult track and one of the worst on the album, Beach House showcases a new level of originality with the remnants of their third gift. Opening \u201cZebra,\u201d a widely acclaimed track reminiscent of Fleet Foxes \u2019first showy inception, Beach House explored the depths of the new avenue they found on recording along with a simple rock setting album. The next song, \u201cSilver Soul,\u201d uses the same reverb according to taste and adds many of the mixed digital effects found in the rest of Teen Dreams. Creativity takes on \u201cNorway\u201d, a melody that opens wide at Charlotte Gainsbourg IRM. With curved airport wheels that are continuously controlled, the melody continuously maintains the sounds as the instruments swing around the designated field. Although difficult to hear at first, the further listening, the brighter the idea becomes clearer, the feeling of clues begins to emerge from the rest. The album\u2019s final track, \u201cCaring,\u201d does a great job of bringing the music into a full circle and giving the listener a complete and satisfying conclusion. In the music industry leading to the success of singles, Teen Dream is a complete and rare work that performs to the best listener when it is heard live. In a release like this, Beach House probably won\u2019t play in the large venues that are often heard on the radio, but speaking can be a powerful force and I have no doubt that Teen Dream will speak to a lot of people.

The record did very little for me, coming off as a half-developed batch of impersonations. So when KMAG YOYO (a military acronym for \"Kiss My [. ]Guys, You're On Your Own!\") was released I was't exactly dragging the city looking for a copy. But then, on a bored Sunday, the album's cover part caught my eye. The image of Carll, standing on a Houston rooftop, boots off, looking dumb and silly, sucked me in, as did that funny title. I pulled out my phone, hit the 'net and read a few bits of press - all glowing - before buying the disc for weight bucks. Carll has been compared to Townes Van Zandt and has written songs for Van Zandt's old pal, Guy Clark. He covers Tom Waits and plays with cowpunk legend Ray Wylie Hubbard. Former Ryan Adams buddy Brad Jones plays in Carll's band and produces this records. Carll also regularly claims that guys like John Prine, Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac and even Peter Weir (via this Dead Poet's Society) are this influences. So yeah, on paper, this guy should be my favourite singer\/songwriter since David Berman packed this guitar away two years ago. Not the case. I mean, I dig some of the songs on KMAG YOYO, in theory, but they're not the kinds of tracks that I find myself nagging friends about. To me, the guy, when at this best, is a Todd Snider trip-off - but without the brilliantly clever phrasing and often desperate sounding vocals. And, okay, maybe the has a little more pop appeal than Snider does. Well damn, maybe I'm being a bit tough on the guy. Opener \"Stomp and Holler\" is a song that fans of Kristofferson and Dylan will love, full of, well, stomps and hollers. Carll is a strange bird in that the could maaaaybe appeal to both fans of \"real\" country and fans of current country, this lyrics often flaunting a novelty appeal that should hook the slow spokes. Next up is \"Hard Out Here,\" a song I want to like. I really want to like it, but damn if Carll in't taking left and right from Snider, both in this writing and singing. Still, for what it is (a trip-off), \"Hard Out Here\" is one hell of a country song - the kind you want to using along to before the second hook hits during your first listen. (Really though, Carll is taking from Hank Williams most of the time - which is just fine.)And then, all of the sudden, a track called \"Bottle In My Hand\" kicks in and I've had it. This guy is taking way too much from Todd Snider, especially in this vocal style. But wait . what's that? That is Todd Snider singing? Oh. Well, I suppose this collaboration implies that Snider is a fan of Carll's. Interesting. Anyhow, it's a pretty solid track, though not as memorable as \"Hard Out Here,\" which could very easily be a radio hit - if only \"real\" country was still played on the radio. There's quite of few themes there, almost all of which relate to the album's American flag-themed album part. Carll paints a picture of modern, war-torn, sad and scared America in a way that infuses humour and twang at every turn. Not every song works, but Carll is taking from some of the best out there. For example, the title track - and a couple other tracks, too - are almost exact copies of Dylan tracks, \"KMAG YOYO\" sounding like a carbon copy of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" but with lesser words. If you're a fan of soft-rocking and authentic country music, then, sure, pick up a copy of Hayes Carll's fourth studio album. But be prepared to dig your way through some overly obvious codes while you're getting to know these songs. If nothing else, you'll send up with a few great new drinking tracks and some fun-to-read lyrics.","overall":4,"summary":"Not an Original Voice, But a Good One Regardless","unixReviewTime":1299456000,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2011"}

Carl also constantly claims that people like John Prin, Chris Christopherson, Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac and Peter Weir (through the Society of the Dead Poets) have been affected in this way.

Radiohead has both rock and IDM capabilities, but the former is far from there.

He has a \"great idea\" on the hour, every hour. And of all those great ideas, sixty percent are truly are great. The other forty percent, well, you smile politely and change the subject quickly. Barnes' main gig, the eclectic ADD-inflected Of Montreal, is the sixty\/forty ratio. Over the years the band has morphed from an actual band into a half crazed\/half genius working alone in a home studio. The sound of Of Montreal has changed just as often as Kevin Barnes wardrobes and personas. Starting out in the Elephant six Recording Company, the band played twee, sixty's inflected pop. Then about the time two thousand and fives Sunlandic Twins came out, the sound began to shift. It became darker, and more interested in a flo of funky vibe. It became more personal. Hissing Fauna Are You The Destroyer continued the trend to beautiful affect. But the next two albums, two thousand and heights Skeletal Lamping and two thousand and tens False Priest stammered a bit. Skeletal Lamping became more in focus and showed it's scatterbrained charm the more you listened. False Priest, while containing some classic Kevin Barnes' songs, just sorta fell flat. It's now two thousand and twelve, and Kevin Barnes' Of Montreal has returned. This time with the poppy, savant garden, harsh but ultimately moving and very personal Paralytic Stalks.`Gelid Ascent' starts off with static noise and the faint sound of electronics before Barnes comes in with a wavering, robotic voice. Then the line \"You speak to me, like the anguish of a child doused in flames\", drums coming in, this voice echoing off into the distance. It's a great example of Kevin Barnes' ability to mix a catchy refrain with lots of noise inside a massive wall of sound. `Spiteful Intervention' sounds like its title. An angry Barnes screaming \"I made the one I love cry tonight, and it felt good\". Despite the odour words and title, this is a rather bouncy, upbeat song. This is a talent of Kevin Barnes. Making sad and hopeless into upbeat and sunny. `Dour Percentage' has a seventy's funk to it with it's bouncy, walking bass line and Barnes never present falsetto. It's a song about friends that can't be friends anymore. A lot has been said about the personal nature of this record. To bridges the Of Montreal main man has burnt, to problems in Barnes marriage. `Malefic Dowery' is a song about Kevin Barnes marriage and issues of infidelity. Despite the downer material, the keeps the track light with a floating melody and mellow percussion. The absolute highlight of this album is `Wintered Debts', with it's almost country flair and honky stock piano, Barnes' sings lines like \"All the people kept saying there is one true belief system, but all my life I've been betrayed by my mother's religion\". It seems Barnes is dealing with life long issues, and the does so in a way we can relate to without having to look at your own lives. This can't be a proper Of Montreal album without Kevin Barnes alienating some fans, and making sure the ruins any chance of making new jones. He has touted that the was very much influenced by post-modern composers Philip Glass and Krzysztof Penderecki. And it shows on tracks like `We Will Commit the Wolf' and especially the last two tracks. Here's where jones patience will be tested. \"Authentic Pyrrhic Remission\" is a dizzying cacophony of noise that lasts for an astounding thirteen minutes. Any fan of Wilco would call this the `Less Than You Think' track. But unlike that droning fifteen minute track, Of Montreal reward those who stick with it. The track ends with a beautiful piano and Barnes singing \"Til this afternoon I was a nomad\/No country would call me its son\/I'd be a refugee but I have no substance\". Was it worth the wait? Yes. So there's the thing: if you haven't been on board with Of Montreal for the last couple years, you probably still won't be. If Skeletal Lamping sent you packing in search of a new freak to follow, then Paralytic Stalks will pretty much do the same. But if there's still that adventurous side of you that still yearns to be fed a different fruit, then give this album a shot. Sometimes great part in't necessarily comfortable. Sometimes it needs to make you cringe and squirm in your seat before it makes you a fan. Paralytic Stalks at times will make you cringe, and squirm in your seat. But if you give it a chance it will make you a fan, and maybe even move you.","overall":4,"summary":"The Drama Queen and the Psychotic Orchestra","unixReviewTime":1330128000,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2012"}

Of all the great ideas, sixty percent are really good. For the remaining forty%, you smile humbly and change content quickly. Barnes' main work, the eclectic ADD-inflected Montreal, is a sixty\/forty rating. Over the years, the band has evolved from a real band to a semi-crazy \/ half-genius working alone in a home studio. Montreal's voice is constantly changing as Kevin Barnes and the characters drop out. Starting with Elephant Six Records, the band played a twee, a popular music of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys. Then about two and five thousand Sunlandic twins came out, the sound began to tremble. It gets darker and more interesting in the fashion scene. It becomes more personal. Kissing Animals Are You a Destroyer and continue to have a positive impact on this practice. But the next two plates, two thousand and weight thousand head lamps and two thousand and ten false priests, shook slightly. Skeletal Lamping has attracted more attention, and as you listen more, it will show off its untrained charm. False Priesthood, even though it contains some old Kevin Barnes songs, is a small thing. It's two thousand and twelve, and Kevin Barnes' \"Montreal\" is back. This time it is a poppy flower, a student garden, rough but ultimately touching and a deformed trunk. \"Gelid Ascent\" began with a steady noise and faint electronic sound, then Barnes entered with the sound of a vibrating robot. Then came the drum, \"You talk to me like the spain of a child drowned in a flame\", and a voice came from far away. This is a good example of Kevin Barnes' ability to mix a catchy chorus with a lot of noise on a large sound wall. \"Wicked intervention\" sounds like its title. An angry Barnes exclaimed \"I've made him cry my man tonight and it makes sense\". Aside from the fragrant lyrics and the title, this is a very powerful and hopeful song. This is the talent of Kevin Barnes. Turn sorrow and despair into hope and sunshine. \u2018Percent Percent\u2019 has a sense of awe in the seventies, has a flexible, moving bass line, and Barnes has never been seen in falsetto. This song is about friends who can't be friends. People have talked a lot about the nature of this record. The bridge burned a prominent man in Montreal, the problem of Barnes' marriage. \"Malefic Dowery\" is a song about Kevin Barnes' marriage and infidelity. In addition to the use of low-heavy materials, floating song and soft beats keep the track lighter. The highlight of the album is \"Winter Cases\", which is almost a rustic and clumsy piano. Barnes' words are like \"Everyone says there is a system of true belief, but I have been betrayed by my mother all my life. Religion\". Barnes seems to be facing the challenges of a long life, and the way the does that can be connected to us without looking at your lives. Without Kevin Barnes splitting up some fans and making sure the ruins have a chance to create a new Jones, this would\u2019t be a real Montreal album. He explained that postmodern composers Philip Glass and Krzysztof Penderecki had a great influence on it. It comes from a track like \"We'll commit to the wolf\", especially the last two songs. That\u2019s where Jones \u2019patience is tested. \"True Pyrrhic Forgiveness\" is an amazing murmur that lasts for thirteen minutes. Any Wilco fan will call this method \"less than you think\". But unlike the fifteen-minute whistle, Montreal rewards those who endure. The repertoire ended with a beautiful piano, and Barnes sang \"I am nomads until this afternoon \/ No country will call me its son \/ I will be a refugee, but I have nothing.\" Is it worth the wait? Oh yeah. And there's the thing: if you haven't joined Montreal in the last few years, you might not. If the Skull Lamp tasks you to pack up and find a new monster to follow, Paralyzed Stem will almost certainly do the same. But if you still have a dangerous side and still want to be fed a variety of fruits, please try this disc. Sometimes a large portion does not have to be free. Sometimes it has to make you squirm and squirm in your chair before you can become a fan. A crippled trunk sometimes causes you to crawl and turn in your seat. But if you give it a chance, it will make you a fan and can motivate you.","overall":4,"summary":"The Drama Queen and the Psychotic Orchestra","unixReviewTime":1330128000,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2012"}

But the next two albums, two thousand and weight Skeletal Lamping and two thousand and ten False Priest were pretty much falling apart. The skeletal lamps became more focused and showed the mental appeal scattered throughout the listening. The fake priest, along with some of Kevin Barnes \u2019songs, just sorta fell apart. Two thousand and twelve now, and Kevin Barnes is back in Montreal. This time in a waterfall, a safe garden, rough but ultimately moving and very personal Paralytic Stalks. Then the line \u201cTalk to me like a baby on fire\u201d, drums come, this sound coming from a distance.

Barnes seems to be talking about long life issues, and the does it so we can talk without looking at your life. It could\u2019t be right for the Montreal album without Kevin Barnes distancing himself from some fans, and making sure it ruined any chance of making new jones. He stressed that it influenced modern composers Philip Glass and Krzysztof Pendeecki. It shows clues like \u201cWe will decide on the wolf\u201d and especially the last two clues. Here you will test jones patience. \u201cAuthentic Pyrrhic Remission\u201d is a confusing cry that lasts thirteen minutes. Every Wilco fan will call it in the \u2018Less than you think\u2019 way. But unlike the fifteen -minute run, Montreal rewards those who stay there. The road ends with a beautiful piano and Barnes sings \"Until this afternoon I am a nomad \/ No country will call me this child \/ I would be a refugee but I have no essence\". Is the wait worth it? Yes So there\u2019s one thing: if you haven\u2019t followed Of Montreal in the last two years, you probably still won\u2019t stay. If Skeletal Lamping sent you a package to find a new love to follow, Stalks Paralytic would do great. But if there\u2019s still an interesting part of you that\u2019s still thirsty to be fed a different fruit, then give this album a shot. Sometimes a large part of it is not necessarily comfortable. Sometimes the has to force you and make you sit in your chair before the makes you a fan. Sometimes you get paralysed, and sit in your chair.

You have a million views. You have a \"good idea\" every hour, every hour. And sixty percent of all these good ideas are really good. Another forty percent, well, smile politely and change the subject quickly. Barnes's largest gig, selective ADD-inflected Of Montreal, average sixty \/ forty. Over the years, the band has grown to be half the battle of a real band that works alone in a home studio. Like Kevin Barnes' wardrobe and personality, Montreal's voice has changed many times. Beginning with the Elephant Six recording company, the band played a toy, a sixty pop. By the time the two thousand five thousand Sunland twins came out, the noise had begun. It got deeper, and there was more interest in the funky vibe floor. It was personal. Hissing Fauna Are You The Destroyer continued the trend of positive communication. But the next two albums, Two Hundred and Eight Skeletal Lamping and Two Hundred and Twenty Fall Priests faltered a little. Skeleton clamping was very focused and if you listen a lot, it showed the scattered charm. The false pastor, composed of Kevin Barnes' classical songs, suddenly fell to the ground. It's two thousand and twelve, and Kevin Barnes of Montreal is back. In this case there is a poppy, a warm, hard garden but ultimately a moving and personal paralysed pole. Then the line \"You talk to me like a child's spain in the flames\" came to the drum, the sound echoes far away. A good example of Kevin Barnes' ability to combine attractive dieting with a cloud voice within a cloud wall. 'Tragic intervention' sounds like its title. \"I made my sweetheart cry tonight, and it was fun,\" Barnes shouted angrily. In addition to the fragrant lyrics and title, it is a beautiful, powerful song. This is the talent of Kevin Barnes. To make you happy and sad and hopeless in the sun. 'Door Percentage' has seventy funk with its bounce, lineup and moving buses and Barnes never introduced Falsto. A song about friends who can no longer be friends. Much has been said about the personal nature of this record. The main man on the bridges of Montreal has burned the problems of Barnes' marriage. Malefic Dowery is a song about Kevin Barnes' marriage and infidelity stories. In addition to humour, it keeps track light with floating music and warm music. The full glimpse of this album is 'Winterd Dubts', as it is almost a country and a valuable stock piano, Barnes sings like this \"Everyone has always said that there is only one true belief system, but my All my life I have been deceived. My mother's religion. \" Barnes seems to be dealing with long-term health problems, and is doing so in a way that we can communicate without looking at your lives. It won't be a suitable Montreal album unless Kevin Barnes sets it apart from other audiences, and make sure the ruins are a chance to make new Jones. He says it's all inspired by modern designers Philip Glass and Krzysztof Pendrecki. It also appears on tracks such as \"We Will Commit the Wolf\" especially the last two tracks. This is where Jones' endurance will be tested. \"Authentic Pique Remix\" is a boring soundtrack that lasts an amazing thirteen minutes. Any Wilco fan can call this song 'Under Thinking'. But unlike this fifteen-minute track, Montreal rewards those who stick to it. The track ends with a beautiful piano and Barnes sings \"I was a gypsy until this afternoon \/ No country will call me their son \/ I can run away but I have nothing\". Was it worth the wait? Yes. So there's something: If you haven't been to Montreal in the last few years, you probably haven't. If Skeleton Lamping has sent you a pack, you will find something new to follow, and so will the strokes. But if you still have the aspect that still wants to feed a different fruit, give this album a shot. Sometimes a big part of the spain. Sometimes it needs to make you tired and proud of your chair before it can make you a fan. Disability races sometimes make you depressed, and shake your seat. But if you give it a chance, it will make you a fan, and maybe move you.","overall":4,"summary":"The Drama Queen and the Psychotic Orchestra","unixReviewTime":1330128000,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2012"}

In July two thousand and twelve, I stumbled upon the duo using a seven-inch single vinyl \u2018Hurricane\u2019 \/ \u2018Bones (Short)\u2019, and a white seven-inch vinyl record record Candy Bar Creep Show EP A few Months Later . The opening song of the album \"Hurricane\" is very exciting. I really like Lizzy's voice and drums, \"Welcome to the black and dirty soul meal I can't hide.\" Nice, great product and voice. 'Bones' is good, not very popular, and it's another great song from Lizzy, \"Empty Church with the Curse of the Soul\". When the described the spain of life, the was confident in this own birth. The 'Gray Tree Alley' is brighter, the other brass perfectly reinforces this \"dream of waking up when my mind is in turmoil\" and \"creatures seem to be crying and disappearing\". 'Imagination' also shines through in this fast-paced music, with the sound of \"time consuming damage\" \"helping me feel what I want to see\". 'Dark Doo Wop' is a beautiful original sound \"Baby, you have to stay\" slow and lovely, because it builds and burns \"This world is going to burn. A burning fire\" is a great sound. This time, you have the best \/ most powerful five song tracks on any album I've been listening to for a long time. The sixth \"Head Is Not My Home\" is almost a national anthem that is fascinating and amazing. \u2018Sweet Salt\u2019 and the old saying \u201cWe are afraid of rejection\u201d. 'Think Of You' \"I still remember you and all the things you make me go through\" are really fun. 'twenty-seven' focused on the piano \"No promise from heaven, just believe I will pass twenty-seven\", which makes hell even more glorious, and is a picture of how important rock stars have died in twenty-seven years. The excellent performance of 'BTSK' will amaze you \"It's not easy to come, I'm glad it's hard, it's worth waiting to give you my heart\" and excellent synthesizer sounds.
