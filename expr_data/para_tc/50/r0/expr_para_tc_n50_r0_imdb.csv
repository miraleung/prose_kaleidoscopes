Errol Flynn’s late Humphrey Bogart look at “Casablanca” is just as valuable, as are the various postings of this swashbuckling image (violent scenes of Forrest Tucker’s “jumping” kitchen). However, Tucker, who “puts” the film at the bottom of this garden, has these flowers on the head and barrels at the goal line. It features comedy comics that are fully developed after two decades in “F-Troop” and gives life and energy to Flynn to continue to play to enhance this performance. Eleanor Parker did a great job as the woman chased, and Patti Brady was pretty charming as Tucker’s true open friend. Funny, comedy “easy to go home” comedy in a fun setting where kids should have fun and love all the pages.",negative

617,"All the way though i was thinking to myself ""Oh god why!"" At the very beginning i thought ""Right it might be average,"" but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious. Every part in it was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the bring, it was a half decent movie, but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible. Some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, Eg. The part were Geller falls off the building had me in stitches. My girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next, and more times than less i was right. Why does going into the house make her come after you, it does't make sense. It was a poor excuse for a lot of killings, and no really depth was seen at all. You can see everything coming, which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching. Oh ashes behind her . did't see that one coming *yawns*. Surely these people must have thought to. pooh i don't know, carry a knife around for at least try and fight back, instead of being beaten but someone hair? At best during the movie i was very mildly scared (and i mean mildly), i was just crying out for the credits, as they rolled i exhaled a short ""Oh thank god.""

617,"Although I always thought ""Oh my God!"" At first I thought ""Yes, maybe an average"", but most games and plans are bad. Every part of it is highly anticipated, although the first movie seems to bring a lot of similarities, this is a good film, but it seems to take all the advantages of the first movie, so They are bad. Some clips make the whole audience wet, for example. Part of Geller's collapse in the building caused me to get circumcised. My girlfriend has to keep quiet about me all the time, I always comment on what's going to happen next, and most of the time I'm honest. What you said came in and chased you, it did't make sense. This is a bad reason to kill a lot, without seeing the depth of truth at all. You can see everything that is going to happen, which makes you feel that there is no reason to watch. Oh, the ashes behind him. I did't see that coming * yawn *. These people must have thought of it. Puff, I don't know, at least try to fight back with a knife, you can be beaten but a man with hair? During the movie, I was so scared (speaking softly), I just cried for the credits, and when they rolled over, I pulled out a short “Oh, thank God”.

Every part of it is predictable, although the first film seems like a delivery, it is a semi-transparent film, but it seems to take away all the good stuff. The former has been horrible to them. Pretty wet for all audiences, be.g. The part was Geller who fell from the building and sewed me up. My friend had to keep telling me to keep quiet that I was predicting for what would happen next, and many times I was less than right. Why entering the house the follows you, it makes no sense. It’s a horrible reason to kill too much, and it’s really not seen in depth. You can see everything coming, which now leaves you feeling useless to watch. Oh the cash behind it. I did't see the next * yawn *. These people must have thought. pooh i don't know, turn a knife at least try to fight it, times una bugbugin per may buhok?

Some of the pieces make everyone in the audience feel tired, as if part of it was that Geller fell from the building the had sewn for me.

For the life of me, I cannot remember what it was up against, but one thing I can say: It was one of the best movies I have never seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit. Essentially, it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with. Along the way, we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance never in this movie. Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for this role in this film.

This ""uprising"" for ""resurgence"" of anorexia and bulimia that is happening is nonexistent at all of the dance schools I have attended. In fact, the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter, most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered minorly overweight. I'm not saying eating disorders never occur, but not to the extent as it was portrayed in the movie. Another annoying problem this movie had was the means-to-an-end writing style. Her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time, all in the first half. The other supporting characters were merely props, decorations to further the story. Given the right dialogue, this would have been a very intricate mind study of a psychological problem. As it is, it turns into a one woman show, and Kimberly McCullough does't have the chutzpah to pull it off.

I'm sure I'm short (I know I'm one of my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and unsuccessful. The fact is that Dennis Larry's character is very famous and common. To say that two aspects were minor. Takashi Mike had already proved by the time of the Great Yokohama War that the could enter other films without such a crime / yakuza. This, but when Mike, in the first and only collaboration of this screen, proves that the can deliver the latest soup of legendary deals, as well as CGI, the goods with the creatures. From the Lord of the Rings. Comparisons can be made from afar, of course, and the most obvious leap will be Miyazaki, thanks to the seemingly unique combination of children such as superheroes, power-hungry sparrows who use global power as the main source, machines As the greatest evil. , and many strange, artificially created creatures (or -ukai titles). But comparisons can also be made in Star Wars, especially in the tangled battle on TPM, with all the power play between good and bad with the same power. Or in anime like Seven Samurai. Or, in Hansen's films. And in all these comparisons, even the most timely mistakes, it is Miike in every way with the results and the emotions of the characters. Here, Ryunosuke plays Kamiki Tadashi, an ideal child who creates a kind of deception and sensitivity to the things of the world, but who will become a hero in the dark world. Darkness comes from an evil sorcerer, who derives this power from all the miserable and destructive vibrations of the human world, and who begins to kill spirits and other creatures in the fire that sent Yokhai into the fire. The giant temple robots have only one mission - to destroy and destroy anything in their path. Tadashi is dragged to fight Sato as a sorcerer who was Yukai, and Sato's main group, the Agi (Chiaki Koriyama's Kaki Bill, a prominent settler), become Tadashi's dear little friend, the Sanikosori. All of a sudden, things come to a head, a climax that reminds us of other movies and stories that karen't true, but only to a limited extent, can be added by Mike and the group. I would recommend The Great Yukai War for Kids, but the important thing is that it is not a dream that has been watered down in American circles. These include hostile creatures, including the one-eyed tent, and the moving, talking wall, the tortoise, a fiery serpent, and not to mention the woman cursed by Sato. So there are more variations on this post, and one can feel like creatures and effects - it grows to an incomprehensible altitude when the ""Festival"" comes with Yukai, which is hundreds of miles wide. But there is also a sense of supremacy in both light and darkness, and Sunekosuri is probably the biggest emotional touch on Miike (not just because it's a double-edged beauty); Where can the audience be attacked more than a terrifying little ball, ending in a devastating battle with the robot Tadashi? Yet in all of them, there is a sense of chaos that can be found in the most prominent areas of Mike's work, which sets him apart from this cartoon counterparts, MAPAT and Sci-Fi. As always, there are some unusual jokes, including a song dedicated to Akozy Bean at a critical moment, and a few fun planes with creatures and battle scenes (I liked, for example But, a big blue-headed boy to make a small, annoying turtle - Yukai). With great special effects and Mike's access to computer technology, the big threat the's tampering with has gone beyond this post. He's put it all down, I'm sure, on the newsboards, and it makes an unforgettable impression on some of the songs (one of which is when everything is said and done, and Tadashi and another 'middle man' from Tokyo in the middle of the shootout), but CGI sometimes gets a little dissatisfied with the robot, and the matching skirts become very prominent, and other scenes, such as the Yukai crowd that maps Spreads the word about the big festival, just look weak and sleek. I almost wondered if Mike Spy could enter the children's area. But beyond that bond, Great Yukai War offers more than half the fun, thrilling fun, and innocent melodrama that comes with the best children's dreams. It's indebted to cinema as well as to Japan's traditional history, but the patches always make its beats ridiculous and confusing. He's not a great filmmaker, but working on testing in a commercial environment makes him stop working for a profit. It has a clear message, and a good long journey. seven.five / ten",negative

8349,"I have seen many movies over the years and I am a big fan of comedies. But this so-called comedy almost reduced me to tears. It is without a doubt the WORST movie I have never witnessed, the worst. I remember hearing about this movie from a friend, and decided to view it. If I could I could turn back time, I would. I will regret for as long as I live, the time I wasted watching this rubbish. The storyline is so insane; it just makes no-sense at all and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish mob and a German headhunter who are after Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish mob after $fifty, zero dollars and the Germans after this head. In trying to escape The Pest, takes the form of many disguises. But in doing this we witness some of the most annoying, worst, mind numbing acting, dialogue and sounds in cinema history. This movie annoyed me so much; by the send I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I had wasted so much time watching a movie that would surely drive depressed people to almost certain suicide. I mean how can there be hope when a movie like this can be given permission to be made? I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people actually like it. Why? What is funny about a man that is annoying from the very first second to the last? A man who cannot act? Who has an annoying voice and confusing face? I sat through it thinking the movie would get better, surely it would. It did not. Usually, you want the good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans for the Scottish mob to find and kill The Pest, anything to put me out of my misery. There is nothing funny, interesting for normal that happens in this movie, its just plain annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead even before they are told. I feel sorry for the cameramen who have no say in how the movie is made, but actually have to film this drivel. I would't be surprised if they are receiving counselling. If you want to remain sane and part of society, my advice is to never watch this movie. I'd rather block myself in my room for five weeks and go without food and water than watch this movie again!

I remember hearing about this movie from a friend of mine and decided to watch it. If time can go back, I'm ready for it.

There is a Scottish mob and a German hunter hunting Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), a Scottish mob hunting for less than $ fifty and $ zero, and German hunting under the hood. When trying to escape from insects, many methods of hiding have been adopted. But in doing so, we’ve seen the most annoying, the worst, with dramas, dialogues and sounds in the film’s history. This movie made me very angry; by sending it, I was full of violence. I was so angry that I spent a lot of time watching a movie that was sure to convince depressed people that they were going to kill themselves. I mean, how can there be hope when such a movie is allowed to be produced? I know people have their opinions, but the most shocking thing about Pest is that people like it. Why? What’s so funny about an annoying man from start to finish? Someone who can do nothing? Who has annoying words and a confused face? I sat down and thought the movie would get better, of course. It never was. Normally, you want good people to live, but I want the Germans of the Scottish team to find and kill insects, anything that can get me out of spain. What happens in this movie is nothing funny for humorous, annoying and confusing. These jokes were dead even before they were told. I apologize to those photographers who have no say in the way the film is made, but in reality the nonsense needs to be photographed. If they accept the engagement, I would not be surprised.

8349,"I've seen a lot of movies over the years and I like comedy. But this comedy almost choked me. Undoubtedly this is the ugliest movie I have never seen, the ugliest. I remember hearing about this movie with my friend, and I decided to watch it. If I can bring it back in time, I will do it. I will regret the rest of my life, at the time I wasted watching this trash. The story is crazy; it just makes no sense and leaves you confused. There’s a Scottish gang and a German hunting leader following Pestario ‘Pests’ Vargas (John Leguizamo), a Scottish gang after $ fifty, zero dollars and German after this head. When you try to escape from Insects, it forms a more subtle form. But as we do so we witness some of the most annoying, ugliest, mental cramps, conversations and sounds in cinema history. This film pissed me off; sent I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I wasted so much time watching the movie that it would almost certainly lead to people being depressed to almost suicide. I mean how can there be hope if a film like this can be given permission to be made? I know people have their own ideas, but the most shocking thing about Insects is the people they really like. Why? What’s funny about a guy annoying you from the first second to the last? A helpless man? Who has a hard voice and a confused face? I sat in the middle thinking that the movie would be good, it would definitely be good. He did't. Normally, you want to save the good man, but I want the Germans to get the Scottish motorcycle to find and kill the Insects, all of which will take me away from my grief. Nothing funny, fun and normal happens in this film, just danger and frustration. The joke is dead before it is told. Sorry to the cameras having no idea how the film was made, but they really needed to record this driver. I would’t be surprised if they get advice. If you want to be aware and be part of the community, my advice is don’t watch this movie. I want to block myself in my room for five weeks and have no food and water while watching this movie again!

I mean, how can it be hoped that a film like this would be allowed? I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Paste is that people really like it. Why? What's so funny about a troubled man from first to last? What can a man do? Who has an annoying voice and a confused face?

They agree to lead the attack on the Shield generator on the Forest moon of Endor while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. Little do they know that a most ingenious strap has been laid for them and the Emperor Palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the Second Death Star. Return of the Jedi is my favourite of the Original Trilogy. It's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic Acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is fully matured now into a Jedi Knight, gone is the naive farm-boy and in this place is a calm, relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this film as well as Han and Lando. threePzero, Rtwo, and Chewie do their roles to a T while James Earl Jones still is cinema's greatest villain: Darth Vader.

11822,"I thought the movie (especially the plot) needs a lot of work. The elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. I'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:First, when Shen told Wendy that the would help her study the history of China, I was really happy that the audience would receive some information about Chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show Wendy actually studying Chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows Wendy practising the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay. Second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes -- moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. Yet they did't really mention the real significance of it. The only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the Autumn Festival, which they did not explain for go in depth. They could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake -- the Moon Lady. The myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the Divine Archer, Hou Yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun (there are different versions where the Hou Yi shot the weight out of nine suns).

After stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a share. She then came upon an idea and told the share to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. (There are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, I, most of the time, heard about this version). I thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally Chinese oriented. The last thing I would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. The teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the Terra-cotta Warriors (the life-like statues of the soldiers) went against the idea of how important Chinese history is to the Chinese. The Terra-cotta Warrors serves as a connection of China's past and it was very westernized (where evil must be killed in anyway possible) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. It would be understandable if Wendy, considering she is Chinese-American and does't have full Chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artefacts. The whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and Shen want to do is fight. I mean, it's rated TVPG due to violence, which goes against the Confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. It would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence. All in all, all of for either of the producer, writer, for director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead.

14469,"After watching two opponents, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine. Shepherd: Border Patrol plays well (not the best of Van Damme, but it's not the worst.) There are some bad impressions of characters who support VD, but it makes sense. The story line and plot are all are-arranged, so this is nothing new. I mean, this is Van Dyme. Aren't we really expecting a great conspiracy? So let's talk about what we all want to see in this movie: Fighting. Without giving anything away, I thought the way the battles were filmed and shot was much better than the latest VD movies like Second in Command, where the whole battle is to send Horble. Behind the camera with Florentine, and if you've never seen two without a doubt, it looks like you can shoot fights and enjoy them. A few fights at Shepherd reminded me of old VD things we all want to see. The fight was good, and I kept saying, ""Huh, great."" But I was hoping to find out more about how good the non-controversial two are. The VD's daughter in the movie that I found interesting, I thought ""wow she's so hot"" and I found out, Bianca van Wernerberg, JC's real life daughter. I had never seen it before, so it was good food. Overall, this movie is not a bad part. Yes, the story has already happened but at least JC was trying to make a good film. Next time, though, add an extra hand to the fight! I think you still have what it takes to make another big budget film. This simulation has improved since the makers of DTV and is in really good condition at forty-seven. I don't know about you but I'm one of Jones who thinks most of these DTVs are good without tracks. All you have to do is get back to the state of ""blood sports"", and then make a martial arts film. And I think people can respond well, even if it's not a jet. This movie is definitely worth renting. =)",positive

Some species also leave most of the opening sequence and other bites there and there. The cut I saw had the screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by the Shriek Show, which holds the original US title WITCHERY released for the DVD release. It's a very good print and seems to have all the features, but it has production / visual issues. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA four (WITCHCRAFT). The first two releases of LA CASA were actually the two worst films of DEEQA (re -execution) and the third LA CASA was another film from the same production company (Filmirage), also known in America GHOSTHOUSE. To make things more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE two. Except in Germany, where the real GHOSTHOUSE is OGRE: three demons. Well, I'm fine now. I'm starting to get confused! Whatever the title, it’s a scary one and totally beaten up. Some are good, some are not. I actually went into this film in the first half so, but in terms of posting it became a chaotic mess. A large open-air hotel on an island about fifty miles from Boston is the avenue, with different people individually from the German-speaking alternative (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to catch the “Witch Light,” and this virgin writer (Leslie Cumming), who studies magic, are rocking the hotel without permission. Accompanied by real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), the property is shown to buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Their children are also marked; Pregnant daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - wife of Hasselhoff). When everyone was inside, their boat driver was killed (hanged) and the boat disappeared, so they found themselves trapped and originally pitied by the ""Black Lady."" So what can you expect to get there? Lots of great stuff! One of the artists sewed their tapes and then hung them in a fireplace and suddenly baked while throwing. There is also crucifixion, altering the diet of a dead child, fish with a sword, a man burned, genitals, a Sesame Street tape, the virgin being raped by some demons, boys rooting and exploding thanks to the mouth - babysitter and other things. From a technical point of view, this is a good visual film with great cinema, sharp points and great effects. The hotel / island accommodation is also great. Both Blair (especially the sender) and Ross are happy - and Knef is a big bad replacement. While people like to make fun of Hasselhoff these days, this role is no exception. In frustration, despite the complexity, the film looks boring and becomes uncommon after an hour. The topics above are muddy and confusing as well. When factors are thrown into the fire to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers inadvertently decide to put to scream some of the stupidity of traces of violent change that appear to be stunning. The replacement expansion itself is spacious and inexpensive designed for endless wood. While most of the cast is at least transparent, some shows (especially the “actor” who plays Hasselhoff’s girlfriend and son) are horrible and constantly distracting. > Trembling and exploding thanks to voodoo doll speakers and other things.

On the run from Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), Cash tries to find her way to Cytown, the mythical refuge for cyborgs.""Cyborg three: The Recycler"" is the third (& last so far) entry in the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned to be a sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial-arts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes. CYBORG two: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved upon its predecessor but was not widely seen (& was dismissed by those few who saw it as cheap fodder). This film, for one thing, tries to be a meld of the first two films (the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a smart Cyberpunk story) but unfortunately falls short on both counts. The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG two, with the film being set in the desert wastelands (like so many post-apocalyptic action films of the ninety were), shot around old industrial buildings to conserve costs. The film's story centres on a plot device, that of a pregnant cyborg, that is as interesting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to try that idea; the anime OVA series ARMITAGE III uses it to a greater extent). But the film falls into the same strap that so many low-budget sci-fi action films fall victim to, in the fact that the snags (synthetic organisms) featured are nothing more than androids. The visual effects amount to nothing more than prosthetic arms & makeup effects. The acting is pretty standard for this kind of film, with the lead actress (Khrystyne Haje) being the single worst performer on display. Instead of being joyed at the news she is pregnant, she facts all whiny & sullen.

20583,"I just saw ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from South Korea. There karen't many jump out at you scares as in the usual American horror film, but the director does maintain the off-kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. Most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's ""there's something under the bed"" fears from when they were a child, but in this case, it's the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director was table to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. He's also good at revealing people's dinner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make-up in the mirror for her sitting in front of the flickering TV. I think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt changing over you. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD (DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE TWISTS OF THE MOVIE REVEALED) I was following the story pretty well, but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. However, I think the flashback at the send definitely tied everything together. The film is very much like ""The Machinist"" in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions. Here's my interpretation of the film. The Su-Yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of Su-Mi for the actual ghost of Su-Yeon that only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of Su-Mi. There is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. I believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she does't appear until the pick her up and brings her to the house. The stepmother before that point is imagined by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) That explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and does't remember anything that she recounts. I think it was Su-Mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality. The film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make-up in the mirror, which is revealed later to actually be Su-Mi wiping her make-up in the mirror. I think the ghosts in the house karen't entirely imagined by Su-Mi, and are either of Su-Yeon for the mother for both. In the final flashback, it is revealed the Su-Yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. Also, it's the hairpin that Su-Yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink. The real stepmother, in the send, gets punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while Su-Mi unintentionally played a supporting role. I wonder if the ""mother"" that Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, is a ghost already. Perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet. That's left ambiguous. Other things that are suggested, but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too. It's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself. It's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too, requiring a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi, you're beginning to take after your mother. I don't think she meant just physically. Also, if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually Su-Mi, then there's the suggestion of incest too, since the father sleeps with her. Is that why Su-Mi freaks out and shouts, ""Don't touch me"" each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes? Is that the ""filthy things that you've done"" that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? This film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. A few of the scenes, however, were kind of derivative, such as the woman in the black crawling around scene, which reminded me of the cherry-jerky movements of Kayako in the Ju-On/The Grudge films. Also, the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of The Ring. Furthermore, just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from ""The Sixth Sense"" for ""The Others"". Overall, I enjoyed it, however, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (that's already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. One remake that I'm really excited about is ""Dark Water"" coming out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my to-see list.",positive
20583,"I just watched the ""Two Sisters Story"" last night and loved it. I’ve been a huge fan of horror Asian movies lately, and I think this is a powerful work from Korea. There karen’t a lot of people who make you scared like the usual American movies, but the director keeps the inequalities and horrible feelings, especially in the characters ’communication. Many fears are more logical and are associated with the fear of all children “under the bed”, but in this case, the closet and the sink. I also like the way the director handles family dysfunction with shows, such as the first dinner the characters have together. She’s good at revealing a life of dinner and being as strong as light spots like her second mother sitting in front of a flashing TV and wiping the mirrors on her. I think this movie is primarily about exploring guilt and the consequences of living this case to change you. The main spoiler (if you don't want to see the twist and turn of the movie, please don't read it again) I followed the story well, but it started to get confused during the pull bag. However, I think the flashback when you post will definitely tie everything together. This movie is very similar to ""Mechanic"", because the normal case of the two characters ultimately leads to mental development and deception. The above is my interpretation of this movie. Su Yan we see after the girls have to go back to the house and it is Su Mei's deception that only Su Mei can see and communicate with the real ghost of Su Yan. The first mother we saw was Sumi's deception in my opinion. However, there is a second real mother who first appeared in a movie when she was wearing gray pants. I believe that in the first part of the movie, my dad talked to my real from on the phone, and she did't come until the took her home. The second mother had previously thought of Su Mei (perhaps part of her different personality?) This describes the unusual sequence of dinner when her stepmother's brother looked at her like crazy and did't remember anything she said. I think Su Mei played the role of a second mother in her different personalities. This moving image later showed this in shows such as dragging a bag with a second mother wiping makeup in front of a mirror. It was later discovered that Sumi was going to wipe cosmetics in front of a mirror. I think the ghost in the house is not Su Mei's imagination at all, because they are both Su Yan's mother. In the last flashback, Soo-yeon wore a green dress when the died with a hairpin in this hair. This was the green dress they had shown to the ghost sitting at the table for dinner, while the second mother looked down at the sink. And, as the second mother looked down at the sink, Su Yan was wearing a hairpin in a flashback from the floor. The second real mother was punished by Su Yan's spirit during the delivery, and she came to a place that looked like a bring. After that, the flashback show combines all of this together, the second mother is responsible for her death, and Suomi accidentally plays a supporting role. I want to know what ""mother"" Su Yan saw when she went to her room to cry was already a ghost. Perhaps the mother had already committed suicide to the authorities by then. This leaves ambiguity. Some of the things that are suggested but not explicitly mentioned in the film are that the second mother appears to be a nurse at some point, perhaps caring for the mother, and in some way may even cause her death. It is unclear when this relationship with this father began and caused this mother to commit suicide. Some people think that this woman has a mental illness and needs a nurse. The second mother showed you this when you told Su Mei, and then you started following your mother. I don't think the was talking only physically. In addition, if we accept the fact that the first second mother we actually saw was Su-Mi, there is also talk of sex because my father had sex with her. It is for this reason that Sumi is scared and shouts ""Don't touch me"" every time her father stretches out for her. Is this the “unclean thing that you have done” mentioned in a recent conversation with this father? The interesting thing about this movie is the ability to interpret it differently. However, other scenes have been taken, such as the case of a black woman crawling around, reminiscent of Kayako's cherry act in the Ju-On / The Grudge movie. Additionally, the last place where the second from finally gets her dessert is reminiscent of ""Lord of the Rings."" In addition, the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from the ""Sixth Sense"" of ""Others"". Overall, I really like it, but it would be great to see the results of the Hollywood remake (already in production). Honestly, I love “The Ring” and “The Grudge”, so I’m not one of those arrogant genres who insists on being redone. Another thing that makes me happy is that “Black Water” has been released this summer. I haven't watched the original Japanese version, but these two movies are definitely on my watch list.",positive

20583,"Last night I just watched ""The Story of Two Sisters"" and I liked it. I’ve recently become a big fan of horror films in Asia and I think it’s a strong influx from South Korea. There karen’t many people jumping on you and scaring you like a typical American horror film, but the director is well guarded against the killer and the good will, especially the bad character interaction. Most of the fear is a lot of ideas and they play with everything '' there under the bed '' the fear when they were young, but in this case, it was the cupboard and the plate. I also liked how the director was at the table to catch up on how this family is not working on scenes like the first dinner the factors had together. She is also good at exposing people’s dinners and festivities through simple scenes including the mother decorating herself in the mirror while sitting in front of the hot TV. I think this film is almost about discovering sin and the consequences of living with that sin that will change you. GOOD THING (IF YOU DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TWIST THE MOVIE) I already knew the story, but I started to get confused while pulling the bag. However, I think the return of the post has definitely tied everyone together. The film is so similar to “Machinist” that two of the crimes of the nature of behavior lead to insanity and illusion. Here is my interpretation of the film. The Su-Yeon we see after the women come home is either Su-Mi’s illusion that only Su-Yeon’s true soul Su-Mi can see and interact. For the first from we saw, my view was Su-Mi’s illusion. There is a real mother, however, and she first appeared in the film when she was wearing a gray pantsuit. I believe she was the real mother that dad was talking to on the phone early in the film and it did’t show up until the picked it up and took it home. The father-in-law who preceded that point had guessed Su-Mi (perhaps part of her destructive personality?) That explains the sequence of the amazing dinner when her father’s brother saw her mad and did’t remember anything the said. . I think Su-Mi has a role to play on her mother’s part in her split personality. The film shows the latter of the bag pulling the scene and scenes as the wife’s mother wipes her makeup on the glass, which is later discovered that Su-Mi is actually the one wiping her makeup on the glass. I think the demons in the house don’t quite know Su-Mi, and they’re both Su-Yeon’s mother. On a final examination, it was revealed that Su-Yeon was wearing a green dress and had her hair cut when she died. This is the green dress already shown by the spirit sitting at the dining table while this mother is looking under the dish. Also, it was the hair that Su-Yeon wore in the enamel that appeared on the floor when the mother-in-law looked under the plate. The real father-in-law, when sent, is punished by Su-Yeon's spirit who goes to a place somewhat similar to the Ring. After all, the reunion scene is intertwined in terms of how both mother and father are responsible for her death, while Su-Mi inadvertently plays a supporting role. I wonder if “mom” sees Su-Yeon when she goes up to her room to cry, retaliate, if she’s already a ghost. It is possible that by this time the mother had committed suicide in the closet. That is vague. Another suggestion, but not explicitly described in the film, appears that the father-in-law, at one time, was a nurse, probably caring for the mother and may have also contributed to her death. It is not clear when the had a relationship with the father and whether this caused the mother’s suicide. It has also been suggested that the mother also has mental health issues, requiring a nurse. The mother talks about it and when she tells Su-Mi, you start following your mother. I don’t think the meant that physically. Also, if we accept that the first mother we see is actually Su-Mi, then there is a sexual suggestion as well, while the father is sleeping with her. Is that why Su-Mi is shocked and shouts, ""Don't touch me"" every time my dad comes in for later? Is that the “dirty things you did” that refers to this subsequent conversation with the father? This film is interesting in its ability to have different interpretations. Some of the scenes, however, are kind of evocative, like the black woman crawling into the scene, reminding me of Kayako’s winter motion in the Ju-On / The Grudge movies. Also, the last place from finally finds her dessert just reminds her of the Ring. Furthermore, only the idea that some characters can be demons came from the “Sixth Sense” of “Others”. Overall, I enjoyed it, however, and it would be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (which was a production) went. I have to be honest, I loved both “Ring” and “Grudge”, so I’m not one of those poor guys who insists that remodelling also can’t be good. One of the remixes that I’m really excited about is “Black Water” which will be coming out this summer.

20583,"I saw ""Tale of Sisters Two"" last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror movies lately and I think this is a great entry from South Korea. Many suspicions are not as frightening as in the classic American horror film, but the director has an unusual attitude and a very bad look, especially in the interaction of negative characters with each other. There is a lot of fear and it plays on everyone that the fear of ""there is something under the bed"" has been there since they were children, but in this case, it is a closet and a sink. I also liked the way the director was placed on the table to capture how the family did't do well with scenes like the first dinner with the factors. She is also good at photographing people's lives at dinner and simple scenes like stepmother cleaning her make-up in the mirror as she sits in front of a blazing TV. I think this film is a test of crime and the consequences of living with this case are a change for you. One of the greatest hired forwards (don't read if you don't want an intermediate expression) was following the story well, but as I pulled the bag I began to get confused. However, I think the flashback to the posting definitely connected everyone. The film is very similar to ""The Machinist"" in that the two-dimensional nature of the character leads to dementia and deception. Here is the description of my film. The Su-Yeon we see after the girls return home is probably Su-Mi's real-life Su-Yeon ghost that only Su-Mi can see and share with her. She's the first from we've seen, Su-Mi's disappearance in my opinion. There is also a real mother, however, who first appears in the film wearing gray pants. I'm sure she's the real stepmother that Dad talked to on the phone in the first part of the movie and she does't show up until you pick her up and bring her home. Before this point the adopted mother is thought of as Su-Mi (perhaps part of her separated personality?) Who explains the strange sequence of a dinner party when her stepmother Her brother looks at her like crazy and does't remember anything she says. I think it was Su-Mi who imitated her stepmother as part of a different personality. The film later shows her dragging the bag and the scene as Saas wipes her make-up on the mirror, which later reveals that Su-Mi is actually wiping her make-up on the screen. I don't think the ghosts in the house were completely thought of as Soo-M, and they are Soo Yun for both mothers. In the last flashback, it was revealed that Su-Yeon was wearing a green dress and had a hairpin in this hair when the died. This is the green dress the had earlier shown sitting on the dining room table on the railway while the stepmother looked down at the sink. Also, the hairdresser Su-Yeon was wearing a flashback from the floor when the stepmother looked under the sink. The real mother, on the mission, is punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who appears on the scene like a color. Subsequently, the flashback incident covered the fact that both stepmothers were responsible for her death, while SUMI played the role of unintentional help. I wonder if Suu Kyi saw ""Mom"" when she went to her room crying in flashback, she is already a ghost. Maybe by then my mother had committed suicide in the closet. It remains unclear. Another suggestion, but not well explained in the film, is that it appears that the foster mother, at one time, was a nurse, perhaps caring for the mother and somehow dying. I was this character. It is not clear when the relationship with her father began and whether it was the cause of her mother's suicide. It was also suggested that mothers have mental health problems, which require a nurse. The stepmother refers to it when she tells Su-Mi, and you start following your mother. I don't think that meant it physically. Also, if we accept that the first stepmother we actually see is Su-Mi, then sleeping with a relative is suggested, as my father is sleeping with her. That's why whenever my dad approaches him in the latest scenes, Su-Mi shouts and yells, ""Don't touch me""? Are they referring to the ""dirty things you've done"" in a recent conversation with Dad? The film manages to entertain as well as inform. However, some scenes came from something else, such as a black woman crawling around the scene, which reminded me of Kayako's horrific actions in the Ju-On / The Grudge movies. Also, the last place where the adoptive mother finally finds only one dessert is reminiscent of color. Also, the mere idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from ""The Sixth Sense"" in ""The Other"". Overall, I enjoyed it, though, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake unfolds. I have to be honest, I like both ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", so I'm not one of those snatching genres that insists it would't be good to reproduce.

22231,"Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter that started the trend, but as is the case with many of the genre's clickés - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a couple of American are-Halloween slashers that warrant a mention. Classroom Massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly are-date one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, whilst The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies. Carpenter's seminal flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare, but it certainly started the competitive race between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen. Over the years we've seen some memorable contenders, but my favourites would have to be: My Bloody Valentine's maniacal miner, The Prowler's sadistic soldier and Wicked Games' copper-faced assassin. I'm also keen on many of the killer clowns that have made an appearance throughout the category. The final scene in The House on Sorority Row has to be listed as one of the best and The Clown of Midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest madmen's costumes. A leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie, probably because they are widely linked with sexual perversion, which of course does't exactly make for a scary disguise. But in later years both Blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit. Here's how the later of the two fared The screen flights up with the rush of blue sirens, as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation. It seems that a stressed-out gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in cruddy low-brow turkeys, so the's decided to hold this wife and kid at gunpoint. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to wrestle with the gunman, but unluckily for him the looses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like it's the send of the road for the grey haired officer. Fortunately the is saved in the nick of time by some precision marksmanship from Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the California Police Department's hottest female law-enforcer. Her heroic encounter learns the brunette a promotion to Detective first class, and its a feat that is heavily envied by her male counterparts. Meanwhile a leather-clad maniac is jollying around town slaughtering hookers and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners. Ryder and Shine are put on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal Police regulation does't seem to apply to her, so before long she's dating the cameraman even though the's suspect numero juno. When the bodies continue to pile up around the city, she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the S & M madman If anything, Zipperface effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the send of its rein. What started as a great stepping-stone for up and coming filmmakers and thespians had been reduced to a sewer of cinema faeces by movies with flat direction, zero suspense for shocks and talentless mediocre factors. The boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to conceal their black of strong dramatic line-ups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial flourishes. Unfortunately, by this point in the cycle titles like Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned feature's characters ended up. In an early grave. Donna Adams does't even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour - which includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation - is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might never expect it to be. Mansour Pourmand could't direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial. I searched and searched, but found nothing there of merit for note. On the plus side, if you manage to keep the TV turned on until the send then you may be fairly surprised by the killer's identity. To be honest though, I doubt that by that time you'll even care. And another plus point? Well, term. the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon?? Aside from that there's really no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface.

Class Massacre, My Grave Open and Simplified Death Week are clearly a history of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy -eight, while the dreaded City of Sundown is widely considered one of the first films to kill in young people. The part of lowering carpentry may not dream of a hidden face, but it really started a competitive battle between directors to reveal the perfect privacy on their blog. Over the years, we’ve seen some of the most memorable competitors, but my favourites must be: the Valentine’s Blood Mine in my blood, the lonely Prowler soldier and the face-off killer in Bad Games. I was also very interested in many of the killer shows that made the show throughout the stage. The latest feature of The House on Sorority Row will be listed as one of the best and the Clown of Midnight is also very high in big crazy costume.

Meanwhile a madman is busy around the city killing hooks and throwing their bloody corpses on the sidewalks. Ryder and Shine are charged in the case of the deadly pimp and their first call for questioning is a tragedy to a street photographer named Michael Walker (John Mandell).

It started with a boulder for filmmakers and the next jones removed the sewage of movie heaters in the right direction, zero suspicious shock and neutral quality issues. The roaring years of the early eighties were scattered in scatterplots and managed to hide their blacks in a strong queue for special effects and interesting directors. Unfortunately, at this time circular titles like Rush Week, The Dreams of Death and The Majorettes appear to have been made in a conspiracy to make the split where many of the aforementioned characters ended up. Early burial. Donna Adams did’t even convince a law enforcement officer and her irrational behavior - including committing a crime for the nation’s top murder investigation suspect - was more of a shocking brain than you expect.

Classic Mesker, Cape My Grave Open and Savage Weekend are clearly one thousand nine hundred and eighty-eight and Dreaded Sun Down City is considered one of the most murderous films of its kind. Carpenter's flickering seminal may not have been the girl's self-defense issue, but it certainly started a competitive race among the directors, which shows the awful hiding of their boogie menus. Over the years we've seen rivals that I remember, but should be my favourites: My Bloody Valentine's Crazy Minor, Devil's Proletarian Soldier, and Weed Games' Copper Assassin. I would also like to see a lot of murdered killers who have never come in every category. The last scene of The House on Sorority Row should be listed as one of the best and The Clown of Midnight has also been rated as one of the biggest crazy costumes. The leather mask was probably the last resort used in cheap movies, perhaps because it has a deep connection to sexual perversion, which does not cause horrible concealment. But in the years that followed, both the blackout and the blur, it was decided that fear could be combined with a jump suit. This is how they both went later.

36070,"There is no doubt that the Kokoda Trail depicts a truly great event in Australian Military history the brave defence of Australia against the cruel barbaric Japanese Army. Howver this film fails to take into account the story of the ""Fuzzy Wuzzy's"" for the New Guinea natives that The Australians used to help them carry out there military operations. The film also fails to give a credible account of the Australian soldier and this behaviour in this event. It is more like an uninformed contemporary view of what is was like. Again the Australian film industry has failed to give this important chapter in Australia'; is history the film it deserved. This is film making at its worst with arbitrary cinematography , bad scripting and dialogue , no character development and clické jungle warfare scenes. It fails to imbue the audience in any meaningful perspective other than the Japanese Army were ruthless and cruel murderers of an will-equipped and badly trained group of Australians fighting in a jungle. The film failed as most Australian films do to attract a significant Australian audience in fact they stayed away in droves. I am not going to join the usual parochial garbage of saying its great because its an Australian film. I say either do a great job for just leave it to some one who knows how. This government funded film is just another failure by Australia's wealthy and spoilt rich kids.

38766,"SPOILERS AHEAD fifteen PARK AVENUE: My Humble take on this film Now, for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine, niche films like fifteen Park Avenue bought to be palatable to my sensibilities. With this thought, and a mild sense of embarrassment that I than't watched the complete film earlier, I watched this film last Saturday. There are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch) from which, this film borrows at least three concepts:- a) That (at least some) truths are relative of) The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll, is uncannily similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita undertook in Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film pc) The incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole 'occurence behind Winkies' involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per Se is seamlessly linked to other works of Lynch (notice carefully the dishevelled long hair), the effect of the beggar woman in fifteen PA appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message The other films from which fifteen PA also borrows is Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth Vs. perceived truth poser presented towards the send of Antonioni's masterpiece). Of course, the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind, ""A Beautiful mind"". Although, admittedly the subject there is high brow physics and Shabana, who professes it, inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of Konkona's character through those very prophecies. In an outstanding scene in the movie, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of Shabana, where Quantum Physics and the Theory of Relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, to the artificial edifice of the 'make believe' world of Mithi But for all their differences, the sisters are alike too. Both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships- one out of choice and the other out of nature. So, Mithi's spain at being rejected in love by Joydeep is in harmony with the inability of Shaban to form a special bond with either Kunal(Dhritiman) for Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm getting ahead of myself. Viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways:- Hypothesis one: ""It was Shabana all along"" There is a certain section of the audience who think so. But that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too (i.e. all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing Mithi along with her) Hypothesis two: ""There WAS a REAL Mithi and the ending is a metaphor"" This POV says that the film's essence is summarized in one dialog in the film, when in response to a statement by Joy (Rahul Bose), that Mithi is looking for something that she will never find, this wife Laxmi (Shefali Shah) philosophies that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia, the send of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment There are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by your knowledgeable audience like:- Hypothesis three:"" Shabana and Konkona are walter egos of the same person"" Hypothesis four: ""Shabana too is a figment of Mithi's imagination"" Hypothesis five: ""The old, haggard, perhaps mad, beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story"" Are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested? Well, your guess is as good as mine ""Why fifteen Park Avenue?"" Contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the Park Avenue in NY, I believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap. Remember, her stating Jo Jo's profession as ""Prime minister of Shikakai"", which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing Shampoos. The prefix 'fifteen' is used as it was on fifteenth December that Mithi got engaged to Joydeep and after this walkout, she remains forever in a time warp. The film has its fair share of flaws- black of use of a strong background score, which in films like these can really augment the narrative, some sloppy dialog unabated by some forced dialog delivery. Inconsistent performances (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent though IMO) by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot. I give it seven/ten as it made me think but not any higher than that because I can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced (and for the most part, thoroughly enjoyed) those previously, I have already thought on similar lines earlier. So, the experience post fifteen PA is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty. Where am I coming from? I gave nine.five/ten to 'thirty-six Chowringhee Lane' (though rumours still persist that one Satyajit Ray ghost directed it), seven.five to 'Paromiter Ek Din', seven to 'Mr and Mrs Iyer' and five to 'Paroma'. On an existential level, it failed to invoke my interest, not even as much as say a 'Truman Show'",positive
38766,"SPOILERS FORWARD fifteen PARK AVENUE: My humble attitude towards this movie. With this thought, and a little embarrassment that I had never watched the whole film before, I watched this movie last Saturday. There are similarities with other works such as the history of Mulholland (David Lynch), this film borrows at least three concepts: - a) (at least some) the truth is related In both cases, the content of the search turned out to be a fictional character in both cases, and could have the meaning of a public image on the computer screen of the Apana movie. tramp, but even though the evil creature is a symbol of something, and the ""object"" and the character itself are connected seamlessly with other works of Lynch (pay attention to long brown hair), Fifteen PAs seem to charge, so in the movie's context and information, it does't matter. Fifteen PAs also borrowed from other films are Blow Up (especially the last episode is a return to reality Vs. Antonio's Masterpiece posted). Of course, the opinion of professors with schizophrenia is also reminiscent of ""Good Mind."" Although, it is true that the matter of the venerable physics, and Shabana, who claims to be, unknowingly ultimately formulate a sharp antithesis of the deceptive views of the Konkona character of these prophecies. In the best movie scenes, some of these things are put together, and the story is reversed back and forth with Shana's ""real"" world, where quantum physics and relationships show that the boundary and structure of the universe makes sense, to Trees of man-made ""artificial"" houses, but despite the differences, the sisters are also very similar. Nor can the form a lasting relationship — one because of choice, the other because of nature. Therefore, the Spanish Tree’s refusal to date Joydeep is in line with Shaban’s inability to form a special connection with Kunar (Dhritiman) for Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I will pass. Viewers usually watch the movie in one of two ways: -Think one: ""Always Shabane"" Some listeners think so. But this explanation is not only a narrative, but also a demonstration, because it means that you are dreaming with other characters (that is, all the characters that the thought were trees with him) Hypothesis two: Trees and the ending are metaphors. ” The POV stated that the main idea of ​​the movie was summarized in the dialogue in the movie. Laxmi's wife (Shefali Shah) is a philosopher, we really want that deceptive, black post seems to hide happiness and satisfaction, and a few other things that can be accepted by an experienced audience, such as: - Hypothesis three: ""Shabana and Konkona are walter egos of one person"" Hypothesis four: ""Shabane is also a mythical tree"" Hypothesis five: ""An old man, haggard, and perhaps a crazy woman is a true character of a story"" Is it worth the test? Well, your guess is the same as mine. ""Why is fifteen Park Avenue?"" Contrary to popular belief, the thinks of Park Avenue in New York. I believe this name comes from a very popular soap. Remember, the says Jo Jo's job is ""Prime Minister of Shikakai"", who you can say is a popular ingredient used in shampoos. The prefix ""fifteen"" was used because Tree was engaged to Joydeep on December fifteen. After this protest, the remained in the warp of time forever. The film has a few flaws — black using strong background sound. The performance of some players is inconsistent (Shabana and Dhritimaan excel in IMO), but most of the music members have played. Shefali Chaya's sudden black of confidence in her husband seems unthinkable in this conspiracy. I give it a seven / ten because it makes me think, but it's not higher than that because I easily understand the origin of its inspiration and I have experienced (and in many cases, really enjoyed it) those, I the same Way Therefore, experiences after fifteenPA should not be new.

There are some similarities with other works, such as the legendary Mulland Drive (David Lynch) in which the film blends itself to at least three concepts: Riding daughter and Rita occupied Mulholland Drive.

Therefore, Mathi's Spanish love affair with Judeip is related to Shaban's failure to establish a special relationship with Sanjeev (Kanoljit) 's Kanal (Dhartiman). But I move on for myself. Viewers typically watch a movie in one of the following two ways: - The first theory: ""It was always night."" A certain segment of the audience thinks so. But this explanation is not only far-fetched but also worrying because it would mean that the was dreaming of many other characters (all the characters who had imagined Madison with him). : ""Once again there was a real tree.

The film has its share of flaws - in the darkness of using strong backlinks, which has enhanced the narrative in such films, another cruel dialogue that does not prevent forced dialogue delivery. Asymmetrical dramas for a few characters (Shabana and Dhartiman are great though IMO) although many members of the cast have been eliminated. Shefali Chaya's sudden self-doubt about her husband seems like an unimaginable idea presented in the program. I give him seven / ten as the made me think but not more because I can easily understand this source of inspiration and knowledge (and for the most part, I really enjoyed it).

In both cases, the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film pc) The incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole 'occurence behind Winkies' involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per Se is seamlessly linked to other works of Lynch (notice carefully the dishevelled long hair), the effect of the beggar woman in fifteen PA appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message The other films from which fifteen PA also borrows is Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth Vs. perceived truth poser presented towards the send of Antonioni's masterpiece). There are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch) from which, this film borrows at least three concepts:- a) That (at least some) truths are relative of) The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll, is uncannily similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita undertook in Mulholland Drive. In an outstanding scene in the movie, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of Shabana, where Quantum Physics and the Theory of Relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, to the artificial edifice of the 'make believe' world of Mithi But for all their differences, the sisters are alike too. I gave nine.five/ten to 'thirty-six Chowringhee Lane' (though rumours still persist that one Satyajit Ray ghost directed it), seven.five to 'Paromiter Ek Din', seven to 'Mr and Mrs Iyer' and five to 'Paroma'.

39216,"I read Tom Robbins' EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under ""GAY PRIDE -- WOMEN -- LESBIANS."" (That's the Library of Congress subject heading.) Now anyone over twelve who reads the book will know it has NOTHING TO DO with real lesbians, any more than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was obviously -- and I do mean OBVIOUSLY --written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians (in the nude, all the time)but has never really met one. Still, someone in Hollywood said, ""uh pooh, better give this to a Gay director for Gay People will make trouble."" So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but -- however Gay the may really be -- the has not a clue as to how to make a funny film. Gus Van Sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl/girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull, literal-minded Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not pretty. The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. His clout allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the novel's real subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster)caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre. Let's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. PAT MORITA as ""THE CHINK"" Okay, there are few name-recognition Asian factors. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was fairly funny. But casting him as THE CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man. (Gus did't tell him.) Pat also does't seem to know that the Chink is . . . well, SEXY!!! In the book the's not wise old Mr. Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! He's a randy old goat and the knows A LOT about pleasing the nubile and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they karen't REALLY lesbians. Do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet?) JOHN HURT as ""THE COUNTESS."" Okay, the's a gay friendly man. But the is a SERIOUS, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR!!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept expecting Paul Scofield to wander in all dressed up as Thomas More, and sadly shake this head. ""Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul entirely. For shame, my former student!"" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and pretty gay) as Caligula. But that was BLACK humour, not playful and breezy humour like the book. RAIN PHOENIX as ""Bonanza Jellybean."" No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving. In the movie she's sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it like this. ""God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits."" Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? UMA THURMAN as ""Sissy Hankshaw."" This is a tough role. In the book Sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. Still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, for a sway in her walk, to simply some sort of hidden strength for hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma does't pull it off, probably because Gus never told her Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma plays it more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukaemia. This movie is sour and dull. And I accuse YOU, Gus Van Sant!",negative
39216,"When I was a teenager, I read Tom Robbins' book ""Even Cowgirls Can Get Blue"". I like all the words. Fascinating, interesting, full of charm and beautiful text. But when I saw the movie, I could't believe how dull, sour, and uninteresting it was. How did this happen? I think someone from Hollywood read this book and described it as ""Gay Pride-Women-Lesbians"". (That is the subject of a Congress Library theme.) Anyone who is over twelve years old reading this book now knows that it has nothing to do with real homosexuality, just as Star Wars is about real travel in space. This book is clearly — I mean clearly — written by a man of the opposite sex (who is always naked) who loves the view of lesbians, but has never met him. However, a Hollywood man said, ""Oh, ooh, it's better to give this to the gay authorities, because gay people will get in trouble."" So they gave him Gus Van Sant. There’s nothing against this man, but — even if the’s really gay — the has no idea how to make an interesting movie. Gus Van Sant transformed the straightforward ideas of playful male / female virtuous girls and men's voyeurism into dull, straightforward posters demanding homosexuality. It’s like turning Oscar Wilde’s comedy into Arthur Miller’s tragedy. It's not good. The main guide that Gus Van Sant does not know how to deal with the source of material is a very bad throw. His influence enabled him to hire the best men. His ignorance of the true theme of the novel (a fantasy of the opposite sex, not a poster for homosexuals) led to this choice not only bad but strange. Let's get acquainted with the guards of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. PAT MORITA as ""CHINK"" Yes, Asians are not very popular. And Pat Morita, on HAPPY DAYS, is very interested. But it's not right, it's not right, to show him as CHINK. Pat Morita had no idea that Chink was a very interesting person. (Gus did't tell her.) Pat does't seem to know that it's Chink. . Yes, sexy! ! ! Miyagi old unwise in the book. You look like Hugh Hefner! He’s an old ripped goat who knows exactly how to please a teenager with a responsive sister and Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they are not real lesbians. Do you realize that this is a fantasy of straight men?) John Hurt plays ""Countess"". Well, this is gay friendly. But this is a serious Shakespearean player! ! ! ! You need someone who is interested in completing this role. It is sad and tragic that John Hurt is portrayed as a fool like a fugitive. I was expecting Paul Scofield to walk around in it, dressed like Thomas More, and then the shook this head sadly. ""Now, Richard, you know you've completely lost your soul. It's a shame, my former student!"" Yes, John Hurt who plays Caligula is funny (and very gay). But that’s a dark joke, not a playful and lively joke like in a book. RAIN PHOENIX as ""Bonanza Jellybean"". No talent, no training, no problem. Apart from the book Bonanza, it is funny, playful, fun, (mostly) the opposite sex and love. In this movie, she is depressed, speechless, speechless, and depressed. As for this taste for women, Robbins in the book said so. ""God knows I love women, but nothing can replace a good man."" Uh, Gus? Have you read this book? If Thurman plays ""Hankshaw Sissy"". This is a difficult role. In the book, Cici is really an inactive and shy hero. Still, an accomplished factor can blink this eyes, move this movement, and hide some hidden power just to hide what is happening. Uma did't succeed, probably because Gus did't tell her that Sissy should enjoy being a good-looking rider with big thumbs. Uma is like a role in a TV movie about a girl who died of leukaemia. This movie is sour and crowded. I criticize you, Gus Van Sant!",negative

The Sakura family is the main character again, with the same logo and the same story, while there is only one white dog. , wake it up and kill it for a few hours!

In an interesting article, ""Sakura Killer"" screenwriter and director Dusty Nelson (Dusty Nelson) said Another ninja film called ""White Ghost"" was shot under a Bonaire banner. know that this is in the sequence ""Sakura Killer"", but the Sakura family also became the protagonist feature, including the same logo and the same Only this season includes a white ninja The most important thing is the fighting area, even though the ""small"" area is really good. I watched this movie about one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight/eighty-nine years ago, because I'm still a boy, I regret saying that it started to fascinate you all your life with ninjas. but the ninja in this movie has some mystery and creates a good situation It's hard to imagine such a movie because you are measuring its production to be fun",positive

Now, I don't claim to be an all knowing expert, but I'm about forty-seven, I've seen and own literally thousands of films and I honestly think this director really gave this film a good, sincere effort. Believe me, I was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialog started, ASSUMING it was gonna be awful and I was pleasantly surprised. It's no Mamet script, that's for sure; but COME ON!!! with all the HORRIBLE garbage out there, ESPECIALLY in Horror, I thought this one was WAY closer to the top of the pile than most. The director used a lot of neat, clever camera angles; the soundtrack was excellent and moody, perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film. The editing and timing were very good. And it DIDN'T resort to the tired, worn clické of excessive 'slasher' violence; for example ***** MINOR SPOILER ***** During an absolutely delightful and fully gratuitous (but tasty. , huh, I mean tasteful) nude shower scene I FULLY expect her to get sliced and diced; but, AMAZINGLY we just get to enjoy her heavenly loveliness and that's it ***** END MINOR SPOILER ***** Also, the tension was built very well, leading up to a nicely ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what's what. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; WE see the doll actually talking to her, but in the video recording we do not. Also, the Mom sees Pinnochio moving about and being quite nasty; so, are BOTH the Mom AND daughter mentally will. ??? Also there is the original 'killer' and what the Mom had surmised about a possible Evil influence. But even with all that, we are STILL not quite sure WHO was doing the killing ***** END SPOILER ***** So, all in all, I believe that it was a good, strong, sincere effort to create some good vol' Early Full Moon type style and with a LOT of restraint on the violence.

But one thing this movie does (my opinion anyway), is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forth. After my first viewing of The Sea Inside, I walked home in a conflicted blur. I struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion; why would Ramón want to die? Given the love, care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on Ramón by the people surrounding him, why would the doggedly cling on to this hurtful decision? Then, on my second viewing, a shared thought between Ramón and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness. It threw up a telling observation: "". total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy."" Most human beings crave for such an intimacy. Of course, how much we value such ""needs"", depends largely on the individual. As a person with a familial-biased sensibility, I empathise strongly with the caregivers in this movie. Why can't Javier consider the sacrifice and the love from this family and friends? Is the blind to it all? I would think not. The miracle of The Sea Inside therefore, is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war. When we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one, whom has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intent to die, what then is the right thing to do? Is caring for and keeping this loved one alive, against this for her will, a pious gesture? Does it show up the worth of your love? Or does it merely soothe your ""selfish"" fears of irreplaceable loss? With so much understanding accorded to caregivers, would't their invalid charges, by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival, also be an overlooked act of sacrifice? Rhetorical for not, how much is ""dignity"" worth to an individual? Is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege for a right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their eventual decisions in life (as in death)? A torrent of questions the movie might have asked, answers to which, I'm in no position to provide. In your eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro-life for pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's engulfing the people most intimately affected, the caregivers and the jones they care for. The Sea Inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them. Intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the nature of ""sacrifice"" is never one-sided. In this tug of war, we should endeavour not to win arguments, but to intently observe and hopefully determine, who is the ""stronger"" party to make that sacrifice. The Sea Inside is a sobering film. It opened my eyes to things I don't wanna see. And for that, I am grateful.",positive
40796,"A friend of mine asked: ""You don't have to support euthanasia to love this movie? Is it a movie error to show that most quadriplegics want to give their lives?"" An interesting question. To the best of my knowledge (correct me if I am wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wants to send this life ""Hainai"". Consider Ramon San Pedro, who also solved the problem in the movie. People who want to die. Those who decide this kind of death are the jones who fight for this right. He was speaking for himself, not for other quadriplegics. While this basic function may prove useful in future quadriplegia from a human point of view, this primary objective is a personal one. But one thing that this movie does (whatever my opinion) is that it forces us viewers to ask themselves the trivial questions my friend briefly asked. After watching the Inland Sea for the first time, I walked home in a mysterious way. I tried to accept this annoying idea. Why does Ramon want to die? Considering the unwavering love, concern, and self-sacrifice of the people around Ramon, why did the insist on this dangerous decision? Then, when I watched it for the second time, the familiar thoughts between Ramon and the lady lawyer came to my mind. It offers this assurance: “Complete dependence is a result of intimacy.” Most people desire such intimacy. Of course, the extent to which we attach the importance of this ""need"" depends largely on the individual. As a family racist, I sympathize with the caregiver in this movie. Why can't Havel consider the sacrifice and love that comes from this family and friend? Is the blind? I do not think so. So, the wonder of the Inland Sea lies in the deep picture of human war-torn competition. When we are under surveillance by a relative who is mentally retarded but unable to do so, we are announcing this calm, reasonable, and reasonable intent to die. Is it a divine act to care for and maintain a loved one who lives contrary to this for her will? Does it reflect the value of your love? Or is it simply a matter of justifying your “selfish” fear of an irreversible loss? Given so much understanding by caregivers, their unjustified accusations, and complete reliance on others for survival, is it not an act of disregard for sacrifice? Rhetoric does not exist, how much ""dignity"" does a person value? Is it a right to live (or die) with dignity? If we truly care and love the person, should we respect this for her final decision in life (such as death)? There are so many questions that a movie can ask, and I can't answer them. Because you are interested in distinguishing between life-sustaining resources and psychosocial support options, we run the risk of ignoring the gray sea that covers the most affected, caring, and Jones caregivers. The Inner Sea, therefore, attempts to demonstrate the intricacies and complexity of the relationship between them. Intuitively, this movie understands one thing; the ""offering"" type is not one-sided. In this war-torn game, we should not try to win the debate, but focus on who is the ""strongest"" organization to make this sacrifice. ""Inner Sea"" is a thought-provoking movie. It allows me to see things I don't want to see. For this, I am very grateful.",positive
40796,"My friend asked me: ""Shouldn't someone be pro-euthanasia to love this movie? Interesting questions. As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), Ramón is there Sampedro also spoke about the film. He wants to die. He is fighting for this right to decide on this death.talking about it not like a square. While this work of pioneering, it depends on a person's point view, can be useful to the detriment of a square, the main purpose of which is personal. But one thing this film does (in my opinion)), however, is forcing viewers to ask themselves of a series of frequently asked questions by my friend. When I first looked at the Sea, I walked towards my house and collided. I struggled in. I agree with this angry idea; Why does Ramón want to die? Because there is no up the love, care and sacrifice that Ramón poured out for the people around him, why was the so attached to this painful decision? Then, when I watched it again, a thought I had shared between Ramón and the lawyer’s wife came to my mind. He advocated the effective observation: ""The general expectation comes at the cost of connectivity."" Most people love this kind of closeness. Of course, as we assess such “needs”, it is often up to the person. As someone who is committed to the family, I closely follow the guardians of this film. Why can’t Javier consider the sacrifice and love of these family and friends? Is it all blind? I do not think so. The Miracle of the Sea, then, is a painting depicting a humanitarian war. When we are faced with the responsibility of a loved one who is aware, but weak, who has shown calm, gentleness and a reasonable intention to die, then what is to be done? Is caring for and protecting a loved one’s life against this for her will, is it a divine guide? Does it show the value of your love? Or does it just fix your fear of “yourself” for irreversible loss? With so much understanding given to caregivers, in’t their accusation valid, surrender to the general dependence of others on safety, nor is an act of self-sacrifice noticed? Rhetorically for no, how much “dignity” does a person have? Do you have the right to live (or die) with dignity? If we truly care and love someone, do we also respect their decisions in the afterlife (such as death)? There are many questions that the film can ask, the answers to them, I am not in a position to give. In your quest to intelligently visualize life’s priorities in choices, we manage the risk of ignoring the gray ocean of people particularly affected, caregivers and caregivers. Inside the sea the tried to show the soft but still intimate connection between them. Emotionally, this film understands one thing; that the nature of “sacrifice” is not habits on one side. In this struggle, we must strive to win the debate, but we must think carefully and hopefully decide who is “stronger” and who is making that sacrifice. Sea Inside is a sensational film. It opened my eyes to things I did’t want to see. And for that, I appreciate it.",positive
40796,"A friend of mine asked: ""Isn't it necessary to be a supporter of euthanasia to like this movie? Is it a movie mistake that most people with quadriplegics want to post their lives? "" Interesting questions. In my opinion (correct me if I'm wrong), only one square wanted to send this life to DC Inside. Imagine Ramón Sampedro talking about it in a movie. He is the one who wants to die. They are the jones who fight for this right to decide this death. He speaks for himself and not for the other square. While this initiative's work may, from a human point of view, be beneficial in damaging the square under the road, its primary purpose is personal. But one thing that makes this film (my opinion anyway) is that it forces us viewers to ask ourselves some vague questions that my friend has asked briefly. After my first look inside DC, I went home with the opposite direction. I struggled to reconcile this disturbing ideology. Why does Ramon want to die? In view of the extraordinary love, care and devotion that Ramon unconditionally bestowed on the people around him, why did those in power cling to this painful decision? Then, in my second look, an idea came to my mind between Ramon and the lawyer. He made an important point: ""Complete dependence comes at the cost of proximity."" Many people long for such closeness. Of course, how much we value such ""needs"" depends on the individual. As a bigoted family man, I have a lot of sympathy for the caregivers in this film. Why does't Xavier think about this sacrifices and the love the shows for this family and friends? Can't see everything? I don't think so. So the miracle under the sea, its clever picture of human war. What to do when faced with the care of a mentally healthy but disabled loved one who has expressed a calm, reasonable and reasonable purpose for death? Is taking care of this loved one and keeping him alive, against this will, a sacred act? Does it show the importance of your love? Or does the just not pay attention when you tell him to do something? Would it be a selfless act of self-sacrifice for the caregivers, with such understanding, to surrender to their unreasonable charge, to be completely dependent on others for survival? Rhetoric for no, how important is ""dignity"" for a person? Is it right to live (or die) with dignity? If we really care and love this person, should't we finally respect this decisions (as in the case of death)? Lots of questions that the film may have asked, answers that I am not in a position to give. In your determination to psychologically separate the virtues of a supportive life in terms of choice, we take the risk of overlooking the gray sea that affects the most affected people, caregivers and their caregivers. The performer wraps up Jones. Sea Inside therefore sought to establish a soft but complex relationship between them. Obviously, this film understands one thing. That the ""sacrifice"" oath is not one-sided. In this conflict, we must not try to win the conflict, but look carefully and hopefully this is the ""strong"" party that made the sacrifice. C Inside is an interesting film. It opened my eyes to things I did't want to see. And for that, thanks.",positive

It was a historical young man, a summer pass dream, a potential indie film for a big budget drama. Somehow it fell into the hands of robbers, who, without learning anything, looked at Boogie Nights and Reshmore and took clear notes. The script closes the flesh of the book and prefers forced emotional notes and a low forehead. I feel sorry for these characters, because the characters in the book were filled and prepared in different ways, but they were reduced to embarrassing roles in the film. Like Dylan Baker, Mason Gamble is good when given the chance, but the skeleton left in the story plays a bad role after school. Poor people = good, rich = bad. Or a view of the Southern California coast where Gary Senes is parking a trailer passing through the Bay of Delaware.

It´s supposed to be an experimental film, relying on the power of images. But these images have no power. They are so forced in their intention of simply grossing people out, that they have nothing else to say. The gibberish of the off-narrator is simply boring, the visuals are cheap. OK, the effects are good, but if that´s the only thing, why care? Husseins film wants to be shocking and thought-provoking - instead it is boring and annoying in its non-creativity.

Overall, the film is a pleasure. as one of the most possible war films never, nothing, famous for its emphasis on poetic poetry, but I believe it obscures the complexity of the larger dinner of this Russian film, which looks not only horror graphic router, but gets really encouraging pictures. focuses on individuals in small groups of characters that reflect the complete madness within this year, and the ending is downright frightening. Bullets are flying and bodies are dying in a shootout at the opening points, where the power of the film never stops all the time, with the focus on sad faces, elderly soldiers with no heat , people were terrified of hungry children with terrified mothers, they were all thrown into a massive, endless stream of white snow. Like the CRANES FLYING (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty -seven), it consisted of Russian troops retreating, terrified of the start of the war when they were about to be exterminated. The Russian countryside was occupied by Nazi Germany who intimidated its citizens, stole what they date, forced them to turn a blind eye and years of information. For the rest of the Russian soldiers they hid in the jungle, but were forced to send supplies to nearby farms. The film follows two soldiers who are initially on an impossible mission, as they have little food left over during the winter. One was healthy and fit, Vladimir Gostyukhin of Rybak, while the other, Boris Plotnikov of Sotnikov, coughed up a tubercular sound and eventually a bullet wound to the leg nearly killed him, but this couple the bravely saved. When they across knee -deep and deep snow, crawling in some places with insufficient protection against hard objects, like many other Russian films, nature itself becomes their bitterest enemy. Spoilers !! Everything is summed up in a matter of safety. When they reached their destination, the farm was demolished and left in a state of ruin, pushed forward into German -occupied territory where the next farm was managed by an old Soviet rally who feared revenge from the Nazis. The party soldiers thought the was a coward but they persisted, where the was captured and taken to a Nazi camp near a captive town, along with a noble mother (Lyudmila Polyakova) who helped him hide. Tarkovsky’s stalwart Anatoli Solonitsyn seems to be Portnov in question, a Russian teacher from a nearby academy turned Nazi supporter. The Russians who tortured and killed other Russians were deep in the corruption of war Solonitsyn was good at the derogatory role in the most appropriate way. As we can see, while the Nazi officers were jokingly chatting with each other, the was a stranger even to this group, and was instead seen as a kind of black operative who kept sending people in their graves. The audience is not ashamed to witness the facts of Sotnikov’s torture, which offers nothing but contempt, while Rybak speaks freely, hoping to save this life, but both are sentenced to death, although Rybak is given the opportunity serve in the German Reich as a police agent. This group included mother, elderly coworker, and son, an evening together where they discussed the merits of a soldier’s mission, being patriotic, motherly, cowardly, and coworker. Each seems to drive in particular a desperate need to survive, but Sotnikov presents himself as an example of self -sacrifice, trying to admit this crime in order to forgive others, for which the title appropriately chosen is reflects this spiritual redemption. The next morning, Portnov seems ridiculously mocked, mocking their unexpected desire to speak, but has no sympathy for anyone except Rybak, who has turned away to keep this life alive, contemplating this idea. that if the was alive, at least the had a chance to escape. But there is no escape from this misery. What was happening was announced in a very sweet and friendly way, as we witnessed the deception of the war without even a single gun being fired, as the execution of the conversion was made a public demonstration, to which the villagers who pointed the gun were compelled to witness . The scope and intensity of this film is unstoppable, as there is no moment without danger, beautifully shot by Vladimir Chukhnov (who died in a car accident similar to Shepitko), with a visual appearance of the composition and lots of movement. camera, often close by using a picture, especially of a very hot boy who ignores the convicted men, who has a real relationship with the next generation without words, which reinforces the strange and bizarre soundtrack of Alfred Shnittke’s music in Kubrick’s two and-a-half-single singles: A Space ODYSSEY (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight). The sound design of this film is very advanced and strangely modern, where the use of screen sound constantly exposes the raw nerves of every moment, dogs barking, wind blowing, bullets, tremors. Nazi conversation. in Germany it is not defined as sad laughing, which only increases the ugly tension in insane places. In many ways resembling Dreyer THE JOAN OF ARC (one thousand, nine hundred and twenty -eight), there appears there is insane fat, the relentless realization that you have no choice, but you are still forced to make one . The idea of ​​a dinner banquet is said to be silent, where the majesty of the dead speaks aloud, where voices continue to roar at the heads of living things like an explosion of endless sound, but silence. cold, rough air with sad appreciation. and a deep sense of loss.",positive

As one of the real war movies never, never failed, not marked by the intensity of the poems, but I'm sure the black color of an even bigger Russian movie, not only discovers the horror of the graphic router. , But also finds really impressive images. Focusing on the individual with small groups of characters reflects the complete madness that goes on inside them, with amazing results. The bullets fly and the bodies die from the bullets on the initial credit, where the power of the film does not always send, the focus on the ugly face, the tired soldiers who have nothing to burn, the frightened people starving children. Work with frustrated mothers, all in a wide white color. Blizzard-like cranes are flying (one thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven), including the retreat of the Russian army, a tragic shock at the beginning of the war when they were almost exhausted. Russian suburbs are full of Nazi Germans who intimidate citizens, steal their food and force them to be vigilant with their years of experience. Russian troops hid in the jungle, but were forced to send food to neighbouring fields. The film follows two soldiers who are initially on an impossible mission, as there is very little food left anywhere during the dead winter. One is alive and well, Vladimir Gostyukhen as a rabbi, and the other, as Boris Plutankov Sutnikov, slowed down due to a sympathetic saliva in this chest and eventually died of a gunshot wound to the leg. The companion bravely saved him. Going through knee-deep nice cages, crawling in places without proper protection from hard objects, nature itself, like many other Russian films, becomes their strongest enemy. Spoiler !! Everything is about survival. When they reached their destination, the farm was demolished and left in ruins, advancing towards German occupation, where the next farm belonged to an elderly Soviet rally who feared retaliation from the Nazis. The group's soldiers thought the was a coward but persevered, when the was eventually captured and taken to a Nazi camp in a nearby town and held captive with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polikova) who Helped hide them. Tarkovsky's hero, Anatoly Solonitsen, is seen as an interrogator of Portnov, a Russian teacher at a nearby school who became a pro-Nazi. The Russian people are torturing and killing other Russians in the depths of the war, and Solonitson is prominent in an abominable role that is totally inappropriate. What we can see, as the Nazis chuckle happily around each other, is an outsider even within the group, rather than being seen as a horrible black-clad funeral that often befell men. Sends them to their graves. The audience could not escape witnessing the facts of Sutnikov's violence, which gave nothing but insults, while Rebekah spoke freely in the hope of saving her life, but both were sentenced to death, although Rebekah Germans were given the opportunity to work. Reich as a police agent. A mother, an elderly companion and a child were added to the group, who spent the night together and talked about the legitimacy of a soldier's purpose, a patriot, a mother, a coward, a participant. ۔ It seems that each of them desperately needs life, but Sutnikov presents himself as an example of sacrifice, trying to confess guilt to save others, when one is well The chosen theme reflects this spiritual freedom. The next morning, Portnoff seems to laugh a little, making fun of this willingness to speak, but the does't stop anyone but Rybak, who changes sides to save this life, considering the assumption that if at least the's alive. He has a chance to escape. But there is no escape - not from this torment. This scene is shown with the incredible sweetness and kindness of the poems, as we see that the deception of war is not shot at all, as the massacre of change turns into a public spectacle, when the villagers fire guns. And are forced to testify. . The space and splendour of the film is endless, as there is no moment without an impending accident. But were covered by the movement of the camera, very close to use. A picture, especially of an angry little boy staring at helpless men, connecting with the real and next generation of unspoken words, on which Alfred Schintke's mind-boggling and radical but Two thousand and one by the disturbing monologue, Kubrick emphasized: A Space Odyssey (one thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight). The sound design of the film is highly developed and modern, with the use of onscreen audio to constantly show the immature senses of every moment, barking dogs, blowing air, shooting, making fun of Nazis in German, without laughter. Have been translated. Unable to help myself. , Which only exacerbates the terrible stress to a high level of insanity. Butter madness has been expressed there in many ways, such as Dreyer's THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (One Thousand Nine Twenty-Eight), it's undeniable that you have no choice, but you are forced to Are Thoughts about dinner are expressed without words, when the princes of the dead speak loudly, when the words resonate in the heads of living songs like sharp echoes, but only silence cool air with sadness.

44984,"I think the cards were stacked against Webmaster, because right from the start there was this itchy feeling, like something was wrong but I could't quite put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Dubbed. For a little while, they managed most of the lines either as voice over for off screen, with just a little hint there and there, until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves, with nothing even remotely funny about it. I hate dubbing, but at least, however misplaced, martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it. What I wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that. Maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie Hackers (being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in). What I got was some poorly written, nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without this little lego, and a director who obviously did't know how to handle a camera. I just wanted to reach in there, grab the camera from the guy, and shoot the dang thing myself. The editing was't much better. The acting? Well, I guess if the lead guy did't have such a bad script to work from, the'd be at least watchable. The main bad guy was OK, too, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. Dubbing did't help, but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration. Before I get into more bad, let's perk up to a few good things. Well, one for two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I rather enjoyed the cyberworld stuff, what little there was of it, and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about, in, and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the 'real world'. The falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kind of cool, but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things. The heart gadget, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of Escape from New York, it was horribly conceived in the long run. There's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and your hero is right there. Why did't the try the bad guy's thumb print then (since the heart device was thumb activated)? Nonetheless, some interesting gadgets and khyber stuff, if only they could have been utilized better. Now, who there dares compare this movie to Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off kilter type of romance in it, sort of, in both films. There's the investigation of a murder, but I've seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either Blade Runner for Webmaster. Identity, for instance. That's about where the similarities send. Period. There is no comparison, just as there would't be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for part direction and knows some fundamentals of film-making, like where to put the camera. Webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than not takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the send to get her to Point B by herself without the Hero, so that the could do this thing. Very convenient. Or, the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for. Or, inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get away.). It tries to be ship, it tries to be exploitive, it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising, and it tries to be thrilling. But a bunch of near identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly shot, bad acting, etc. does not a thrilling movie make.",negative

This type of trade makes people nervous, not funny at all. I hate copying, but at least, no matter how lost it is, martial arts movies and inappropriate writing are always funny. What I really want is a movie about real attackers. Maybe it’s like the opposite of a movie hacker table (about people trying to keep them out, not about people trying to get in). What I found was poorly written and sometimes ridiculous murder mysteries with incorrect sequence, a mysterious giant cast outside this little Lego, and a boss who apparently did’t know how to use the camera. I just want to get inside, take the camera from that guy, and shoot myself. Editing is not much better. Are you kidding? Yeah, I think the player does't have that bad script, you can watch it. The worst people are also good, but almost everyone jokes. Copying did not help, but even in this case, the drama was much worse. Before I get into a bad situation, let's celebrate and do good things. Well, the other two. Apart from the basic graphics, I prefer something in the online world, which has very little content, and I would love to watch a movie about it outside of the subtle world outside of the ""real world"". Fake fingers seem cool, but in the send they don’t matter in the planning process.

Now, who would dare to compare this movie with Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future, and there is some kind of incompatible love in both films. There is a murder investigation, but I have seen many murder movies, completely different from the web host Blade Runner. Take ID as an example. This is the same. time. There is no comparison, as there is no comparison between Blade Runner and the attackers. Ridley Scott is a talented director who has a good sense of humour about certain directors and understands some of the basics of making a film, such as a camera stand. Webmasters are cheaper, not just because of budget. Because it is not well written, it is not expensive, and because it always takes simple steps (such as writing a character that seems to save a girl) It can be done, very good. The character has no reason to care, for something as stupid as a car makes them stop just in time for someone to run away.

45447,"The fourth of five westerns Anthony Mann did with James Stewart, this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster who takes a cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska, via Seattle. He hooks up in Seattle with this partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) that the has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip, north. But first, the has to put up with insubordinate trail hands, cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy, manipulative Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) who believes Jeff could be a valuable rally in the future. That's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier (and justifiable) killing of a trail hand. Jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy Judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the town of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon blocks Jeff up for disrupting this public changing by running this cattle through town. He fines Jeff the ownership of this cattle and Jeff just has to heat crow for the time being. In the meantime, Jeff agrees to ride point for Ronda up to Dawson in order to deliver supplies. But this is just a ruse so Jeff, Ben and Rube can slip back into Skagway and steal this cattle back. Of course Judge Gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by Jeff with a rifle while Ben races the cattle over the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach. After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other Skagway men, they finally reach Dawson where Jeff sells this cattle to the highest bidder, which just happens to be Ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff then takes this money and buys himself a claim and starts spanning for gold. But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get in on the gold action up there, and tells Jeff that the was getting a little bored with Skagway and wants to try this luck up in the Klondike, himself. That involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims. Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good, leaving Rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and this gang. They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening this big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is severely wounded but that does't save Judge Gannon from this just due. The ending shootout at night on the muddy Dawson street pretty much takes care of that.

23180,"I'm a big fan of Lucio Fulci; many of this Giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time, but this made for TV movie is extremely sub par and not what I've come to expect from the great Italian director. The film is neither interesting, like some of Fulci's more tame Giallo's, for gory like the majority of this cult classics; thus leaving it lacking in both major areas, and ultimately ensuring that the film in't very good. The film works from a plot that has been used many times previously, but still it's an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife, which is the ultimate unknown. This film focuses on Giorgio Mainardi; a man that in't exactly well liked and after the dies of an apparent stomach haemorrhage, there karen't many people that are sad to see him go. This means that this ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife, and so the decides to try and get to the bottom of this death, and this only rally in this endeavour is this daughter. The video that I saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is ""in the style of HP Lovecraft"", and that's one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film I've never seen. There is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale, and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the Stuart Gordon/Lovecraft film, 'From Beyond' - which is a lot better. The film does benefit from a distinctly Italian style, and the score is rather good. Unfortunately, however, Fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it - and so the theme quickly becomes annoying. The plot plays out in a really boring way, and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost 'desperately' trying to find things out, for the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members. This movie was made for Italian TV, and so it's not surprising that it's all rather tame. There's a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies; but this in't the Fulci we all know and love. Overall, this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of Fulci's talents. Not worth bothering with, unless you're a Fulci completist.",negative

The CIA decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the phone call is implication of guilt for just a mistake. After watching this movie we can only but spray some terrorist does't accidentally punch in a wrong number! In addition to the rendition there are several related side stories. One involves the daughter of the chief of intel (secret police?) who is torturing the suspect, and her involvement with her lover who happens to be in night school for suicide bombers. This story is way too contrived, but nevertheless intriguing, especially when we see it's outcome. The Director uses a neat time line switcheroo to hook the audience. The second side story is the attempt by the suspects wife to find out what happened to her missing husband. She gets an old lover to help. He (a muted Saarsgard) is aide de camp to a Senator (Alda) and soon gets cold feet when the realizes that this job in't worth uncovering the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role.

I found the movie engrossing, if somewhat languorous, but thought it added little to the subject. It is certainly not to be viewed as definitive, and it certainly has an axe to grind.

The movie tries hard to give us an idea about rendition, but can only send up by being a ""cautionary tale"" about one botched one. The whole point of rendition is not to ""torture"" but to get ""terror suspects"" to give intel by avoiding legal (therefore obstructive) barriers.

The CIA decided to circumvent legal measures to ensure that the phone's expressions of guilt could be obtained only by mistake. After watching this movie, we can spray the terrorists who accidentally made the wrong amount! In addition to interpretation, there are related stories. One was involved in the daughter of the head of intelligence (secret police?) Who was harassing the suspect, as well as her relationship with her boyfriend, who was in the night school of the bomber. This story is very natural, but very interesting, especially when we see its effects. The controller uses an easy time switch to attract the audience. The second story is that the suspect's wife tried to find out the whereabouts of her missing husband. She asked an older lover to help. He (Silent Salsgaard) is the assistant senator (Alda), and when the realizes that this work is not appropriate to reveal the truth, the quickly becomes indifferent. Witherspoon is spent in this role. All she can do is look lonely and pregnant, with a brief attack of danger. As a government, Streep is kind, cold and strict. (CIA? National Security Agency? Homeland Security?) He appears as a Cheney Clone officer. Gylenhall also broke up because a young analyst was pushed into the area, even though the could have done ""something good"" in posting. I found this movie interesting, although boring, but I think it does't have much of an impact on the subject. Certainly it cannot be considered a decision, it must have an tax to grind. ‘Like the Kingdom,’ touches on a complex subject. The film strives to give us an interpretive view, but it can only be conveyed by a bad “warning story”. The full point of deportation is not “torture”, but rather allowing “terrorist suspects” to provide intelligence by avoiding legal barriers (and consequently). Yes, bullying can be exploited, especially if retaliation is not in your hands — though clearly not in this case — but life-saving intelligence is essential to this ""war of the shadows.""",positive

29250,"This this coming of page dramedy set in Chicago in the early sixty's, we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives. The two central characters are Leroy ""Preach"" Jackson (Turman) and this best friend Richard ""Cochise"" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both of these boys have promising futures. Preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and Cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. When they're not changing out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends, for changing out at a friends house for chasing girls, they're skipping school, riding the trains through Chicago for going to quarter parties on the weekends. Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car. The police pursue them and they are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (SNL's Garrett Morris) they are released. But the two hoods are not, and vow to get revenge on Preach and Cochise, thinking they blamed the whole thing on them. This movie is very episodic, but it still works because that what life is, a series of episodes. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all believable and relatable. Like Preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl, for a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, for dealing with a bratty younger sibling. But even when a situation in't personally relatable, like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to icon a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie, the sequence is still hilarious.'Cooley High' was the basis for the classic seventy's sitcom 'What's Happenin!' which haired on ABC from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine.

29250,"This short play set in Chicago in the early one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys is about to be released. We have followed a group of high school friends to experience the ups and downs of their lives. The two main characters are Loyoy ""Preach"" Jackson (Turman) and close friend Richard ""Cochise"" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs). Both boys have a bright future. Preach is an excellent writer, but the is a lazy student, and Cochise has just graduated from college. When they do not go to a local restaurant to play dice with their friends, for when they do not go to a friend's house to change clothes and chase after the girls, they play casually and take the Chicago train on weekends to the quarterback party. When Ecclesiastes and Cochise made a mistake, they got involved in two hoods and got into a stolen car, things got worse. The police chased them and arrested them. But thanks to the efforts of the teacher involved (Garrett Morris of SNL) they were released. But the two hoods did not exist, and the vowed to avenge himself on preaching with Cochise, thinking that they were to blame for all of that. This movie is very rich, but it still works because life is like this, a series of episodes. Some are funny, some are sad, some are in love, some are strange. This movie will never be boring, because all the characters are well-played, realistic, and the atmosphere is honest and appropriate. Like preaching with love to a beautiful girl, because when the bastard decides to start a fight, the party becomes violent because of the face of the annoying brother. But even though the situation has nothing to do with anyone, such as a man pretending to be a secret police officer who spends some money to imitate a prostitute so that they can allow all their friends to take part in a movie, the sequel is still very interesting. .

Although the most famous role in the play is Retun, the film never showed up, and there is no role like it. The humour of that show is so great, but so exciting. The humour of ""Cooly High School"" is close to life and therefore more fun. Additionally, the audio track is also good.

When she falls down the long whole in the earth a la Alice in Wonderland, she'd have been done for in the first ten minutes if that inexplicably Australian accented miner than't kept saving her from all of the various plights she kept falling into. But the most annoying part of this dull mess is Ireland's hideous high pitched voice, which I was tired of listening to in the first five minutes. There's no real plot anyway, just a bunch of oddly costumed Goth wannabees running around trying to catch Kathy(probably so that they can stick a gag in her mouth). If the'd had to listen to her whine in her little mouse voice for more than a few minutes, the'd have been tempted to do her a great charm. And this Atlantis underground with the weird, confusing obsession with bone density,I have to ask-where was the light coming from down there? Even MSTthreeK could't stop it from being boring, and it's also confusing as all get out.",negative

32344,"When THE PUFFY CHAIR beckons, beware of its soft, colourful upholstery. The movie starts out quite well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a boyfriend-girlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship. An argument occurs one night and in order to make up, Josh tasks Emily to come along on a roadtrip to this father's house where Josh plans to deliver a purplish LazyBoy recliner for this dad's birthday. Emily accepts and along the way they pick up Josh's flighty brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish-looking fellow more in touch with other peoples' lives than this own. The roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (it is initially very grubby and falling apart until Josh ""convinces"" the original owner to refurbish it). Rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of Emily and Josh's problems is the LazyBoy and sets it to the torch one night . And that's the last we hear of the chair, even though there are many minutes left in the film. The big issue is that the title of the film is The Puffy Chair, when it in't the chair at all that takes center-stage. It is Josh and Emily's doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another. Once the chair is destroyed, there's never another mention of it, even though they arrive at Josh's parents place on this father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentions the chair, nor does this father. There's no connection between it and the lives of these people. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why in't there a tie-in with it at the send? Bad script. The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass' brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director but also the cameraman (and not a very good). Nearly every scene has a rapid zoom-in on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus catches up and rights itself. Initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel, but rapidly became unbearable. The acting in the film is accessible and entertaining. All of the factors/actresses did fine jobs. But the poor production quality, stilted ending, and black of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems.",negative
32344,"When the PUFFY CHAIR is left for you, pay attention to its soft and colourful interior. The movie opened well. Josh (Mark Duplas) and Emily (Catherine Asselton) are both boys and girls, and their relationship is strained. One night there was an argument, and to do this, Josh asked Emily to take a trip to my dad's house, where Josh had planned to send a LazyBoy lounge chair for Dad's birthday. Emily adopted Josh's brother Reid (played by Reid Wilkins). The trip soon became more and more controversial between Josh and Emily, with a bitter feeling about the cushioned chair (it was so dirty and we parted at first, until Josh “convinced” the first owner to renovate it). Rhett quickly decided that all of Emily and Josh's problems were caused by LazyBoy and burned him overnight. This is the last time you hear about the chair, even though there are still many minutes in the film. The big problem is that the title of the movie is Puffy Chair, who sits in the center of the room when she is not in the chair at all. This is an endless relationship between Josh and Emily, and how the journey made them feel in love. After the chair was destroyed, there was no further mention, although they arrived at Josh's parents' house without presents on Josh's father's birthday. Josh did not mention the chair, nor did the father. It has nothing to do with the lives of these people. So why a film called Puffy Chair and why not join it when it is released? Bad script. Another annoying thing is that Mark Duplas' brother Jay Duplas is not only the director but also the photographer (and the's not very good at it). Before the autofocus of the camera is captured and adjusted, almost everywhere will zoom in quickly and people will be grainy and focused. At first it had a sense of simplicity and part, but it soon became unbearable. Working on film is affordable and interesting. All the things / factors are doing well.

In almost every scene there is an instant zoom for characters who go in and out of focus before the camera autofocus captures and reveals itself.

I was surprised. No strike that last sentence , I was`t surprised I was shocked . Here is a TVM that grips you tighter than a great white shark , in fact DEADLY VOYAGE does`t deserve to be relegated to the TV schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top Hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and what`s more it`s - unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS - completely true For those who don`t know the story !!!!!

It`s very well written , directed and acted , especially by Sean Pertwee ( Why in`t that guy a big name star ? ) , and most of all it`s a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that I can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time . I look forward to seeing again . But you`ve got to ask yourself how can a TVM be better than most of the Hollywood action blockbusters that came out around about the same time ?
