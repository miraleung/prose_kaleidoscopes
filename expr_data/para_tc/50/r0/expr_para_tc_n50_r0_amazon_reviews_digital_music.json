I must confess, it was the honest Costello record I bought (we're talking one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five there) & it made enough of an impact for me to tear through everything that came before it with relish & abandon. In short, it made a fan out of me. Among Costello devotees there is obviously a healthy, ongoing debate as to which albums deserve \"classic\" status. By & large, most agree Imperial Bedroom is on that list. The Costello admirers who hoist their fickle disdain on the likes of \"Man Out Of Time\" are few & far between. The fact that legendary Jazz trumpet great, Chet Baker covered \"Almost Blue\" to this dying day might also make one think twice as to it's merit. A lot of link has been spilled on the \"Beatlesque\" production, courtesy of Geoff Emerick (The man who dawdle the knobs on a little album called \"Sgt. Pepper's\"). But one thing that seems to set Bedroom apart from its predecessors is the fact that this is an album Costello pretty much composed on the piano, rather than the guitar. More than anything that preceded it, Cocktail Lounge Cabaret & Rogers & Hart musical styling take precedence over one-two-three-four- Rock & Roll. All of which, might just account for any cries of \"he's lost this edge\". Yet, regardless of the lavish, chirpy production for the absurd \"Gershwin\" comparisons Bedroom received, the sentiments of the songs are as dark & jaded as never. Here domestic unrest meets morning-after malaise. The infectious \"insult & flattery\" of \"Beyond Belief\" soon gives way to the eviscerating self-portrait of \"Shabby Doll\". The best way to sum up might be: all the strings in the world could't put Humpty Dumpty back together again. Personally, I don't find a single dud among Bedroom's fifteen tracks. And while, \"Man Out of Time\" & \"Almost Blue\" are usually on any given Greatest Hits compilation, lesser known greats like, \"Human Hands\" & \"Pidgin English\" need not be overlooked. For all its seemingly sophisticated studio trickery, Costello's liner notes reveal it actually took three Attractions to play the one accordion on \"Long Honeymoon\". One to hold it in place, another to work the bellows, while Steve Nieve played the keyboard. So perhaps Punk is not dead after all. Despite this little footnote, Imperial Bedroom is without a doubt one of Costello's most elegant & concise albums. I suppose a case could also be made for it being one of this most self-obsessed. But for me, the rises above the fray of this own self-conflict in a way we all can relate to.

I have to admit, this is a reliable Costello record I bought (we were talking about one, nine hundred and eighty-five copies there), and it has enough influence for me to pull it out and enjoy it. In short, it made me drunk. Among Costello's volunteers, there is a healthy debate going on about which albums fit the \"classic\" style. In general, most people agree that Empire Bedroom is on the list. Very few Costello fans show insignificant contempt for songs such as \"Man Out of Time\". The fact that the famous jazz trumpet Chet Baker sang \"Almost Blue\" on the day of this death may make people think twice. Geoff Emerick (the man who played the knot on a small album called \"Sgt. Pepper's\") has given many links to the production of \"The Beatles.\" However, the only thing that seems to separate the bedroom from the previous one is the Costello disc, which is almost written on the piano instead of the guitar. Most importantly, the music style of the Cocktail Lounge Cabaret with Rogers and Hart takes first place more than one, two, three, and one. All of this could mean any call that says \"you lost this grant.\" However, apart from witchcraft and the cheerful production in the bedroom it got the silly \u201cGershwin\u201d comparison, the feeling of the song has never been darker and tedious. Here, domestic violence faced difficulties afterwards. The \"insults and applause\" that spread \"beyond the faith\" quickly gave in to the courage to show off the \"dressed doll\". The best way to summarize would be: all strings in the world can never be Humpty Dumpty. Personally, I cd not find a dud on fifteen tracks in the bedroom. Although \"Expired Man\" and \"Almost Blue\" always appear in any of the Greatest Hits combinations, there's no need to ignore the unknown greats like \"Hands Human\" and \"Pidgin English\". Aside from all the seemingly difficult tricks in the studio, Costello's class notes show that the truth requires three interesting things in order to play the accordion in the \"Long Honeymoon\". One is used to adjust it, the other is used to apply pressure, and Steve Neve plays the keyboard. Maybe punk did\u2019t die after all that. Aside from the caption below, \"Royal Bedroom\" is without a doubt one of Costello's finest discs. I think it would prove that you are one of those people who loves humour.

Since then, Andre and Big Boy have released five more beautiful albums and are regarded as the most stable wrap duo. Simply put, when you have the ability to compose, discover, and prove real music from time to time to make it beautiful. Organized noise production is strong in this release. Outcast then introduced \"Myintrotoletuknow\", and changed the hometown to \"Ain't No Thang\". The title track \"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\" is a cutback kit with a groove. For me, the highlight of this album is undoubtedly an amazingly unique \"Players Ball\", one of the best songs with unlimited replay value. One of my favourites is the deep \"Claimin True\", a track about roads, making money and paying. Outcast brings some music with the romantic song \"Funky Ride\". He then collaborated with Goodymob and released the first class track \"Get Up, Get Out\" full of logical, introductory and constructive melodies. The release of \"Crumbling Airb\" and \"Hoti Ho\" continued, and the short \"Players Ball\" (rap) closed the album on a high note. Like all existing albums, \"Southern Playlastic Adele Music\" is one of the collections.","overall":5,"summary":"Good stuff....","unixReviewTime":949449600,"reviewTime":"02 2, 2000"}

It was one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five and the incredible songwriting team of Elton John and Bernie Taupin was gradually reaching new heights with each release. Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy is their finest album in all ways: production, melody, vocally and the best performance by this then band. In addition, these are like to be the best lyrics Bernie Taupin never penned. He is writing in the first person narrative for a change on all the songs. And, finally, Elton is singing lyrics that the can relate to because all of the songs are about the era when the and Bernie first met and stardom than't arrived (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven-one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine). The title track simply tells the story of their partnership: \"Captain Fantastic, raised and regimented, hardly a hero, just someone this mother might know\". How fitting a description for young Elton - shy, unassuming, average. While later on Elton sings: \"Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing. hand in hand went music and rhyme, the captain and the kid, stepping in the bring, from there on Sonny, it's a long and lonely climb.\" The melody starts with a country flare that rocks out during the chorus. a incredible arrangement that balances rock (Elton) with country (Taupin). Tower of Babel hints at their first glimpse of the music business: \"where were all your shoulders when we cried?\" Taupin laments. \"Bitter Fingers\" tells the tale of the doing the club circuit as a struggling band. \"Tell Me When The Whistle Blows\" is Taupins story of this journey from the countryside in England to London where the would write with Elton. This song in particular has a very urban and soulful sound and captures the lyric perfectly. The big hit from the album, \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\" is yet another superb power ballad, much in the same vein as \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\". Elton sings with much conviction on this one and the backing vocal of this song capture every nuance and spain in the lyric. Further, Nigel Olsson's drum playing on this song may be this finest performance as the dramatically pushes the song to its emotional climax. The second half of the album kicks off with \"Gotta Get A Meal Ticket\" which is about the first publishing deal Elton and Taupin signed and the anxieties that come with it: \"while the other climb reaching dizzy heights, the world's in front of me in black and white, I'm on the bottom line.\" Further, Elton sings: \"shake a hand if you have to, trust in us and we'll love you anyway.\" The very wary writers of course need a record deal to make it and this song typifies that experience. Guitarist Davey Johnstone's opening hook may be this best since Saturday Nights Alright For Fighting - this guitar soars on this song. The next song, Writing is a relatively simple song that seeks to wonder if the duo have a lengthy future in front of them. We All Fall In Love Sometimes\/Curtains finishes in what must be the best closing to an Elton John album never. The first part deals with a brotherly affection Elton and Taupin discovered when they met and Curtains is simply a song about their childhood wish that came true. Elton has never sounded so sincere as the does there. While it's true the has been delivering Taupin's words for years as if the wrote them himself, there is something distinctively different about this delivery this time. Frankly, this could be this best vocal performance never. A couple of extra tracks are included on this remastered version: the wonderful philly soul hit \"Philadelphia Freedom\", Elton's dynamite cover of the Beatles \"Lucy In The Sky\" and a less than necessary cover of John Lennon's \"One Day At A Time\" from this Mind Games release. Since these songs have no relation to the Captain Fantastic concept album, I would have left them off and put them on another more appropriate are-release. Producer Gus Dudgeon give each song there a pristine shine and each band member showcases their incredible talents. This also represents the last album by the original lineup. While they did't realize it at the time, this was to be their swan song until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. Elton moved on into different areas after this and things were never really the same again. It's hard to believe that just two years prior, Elton released Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - another masterpiece. Within three years, Elton delivered two albums of career speaking quality. And while Yellow Brick Road usually gets the nod as this finest album because it has more pop accessibility then this release, Captain Fantastic should't be over looked. If Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was this answer to, say, The Beatles \"Sgt. Pepper\", then Captain Fantastic would be Elton's equivalent to \"Abbey Road.\"","overall":5,"summary":"Grand Slam!","unixReviewTime":1089417600,"reviewTime":"07 10, 2004"}

In the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-fives, the amazing writing team of Elton John and Bernie Taupin gradually reached new heights with each release. Captain Marvel and Bronte Cowboys are their best albums of all genres: production, music, vocal music and the band's impressive performances at the time. Besides, these are very similar to the very words Bernie Taupin never wrote. Writes in a narrative way the first person to change all the songs. And, finally, the words sung by Elton can be met, because all the songs are about meeting Bernie for the first time and years before the stars (a thousand, nine, sixty-seven, nine hundred and nineteen). The title track simply tells the story of their interaction: \"Captain Magic, old and well-trained, is not a hero, but a stranger.\" How appropriate to describe a young, humble, middle-aged Elton. After a while Elton sang: \"The boy of the world is brown, still green and growing. Music and rhythm by hand, captain and child, starting with Sonny, this is a long and unique thing.\" The song begins with country music and sings curriculum. An amazing balance of stone (Elton) and land (Tao Ping). The Tower of Babel spoke of their beginnings in the music scene: \"Where are your shoulders when we cry?\" Tao Ping sighed. \"Bitter Fingers\" tells the story of visiting the club as a struggling team. \"Tell me when the whistle blows\" is the story of Tao Ping's journey from rural England to London to write with Elton. Especially this song has an urban sound and is romantic, and captures the lyrics perfectly. The song that hits the album \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\" is another great energy ball field, very similar to \"Don't let the sun go down on me\". Elton is full of confidence in this song, the harmony of this song takes on everything that is different from the lyrics and in Spanish. In addition, the drums played by Nigel Olsson in this song may be the best because it pushes the song to the climax of emotion. The second half of the album opens with \"Gotta Get a Food Ticket\", which talks about the first publishing agreement signed by Elton and Taupin and the subsequent concern: \"When another climb reaches the dizzying heights, the World is black and white in front. For me, and I'm the key.\" Additionally, Elton sang: \u201cIf you want to, please shake hands with us, trust us, and we will love you no matter what happens.\u201d Of course, the most prudent writers want a recording contract. Producing it. And this song represents this experience. The duo have a long future ahead of them. We Are All In Love Sometimes \/ the curtain ends with the send of Elton John's album. The first part tells us about the brotherhood Elton and Taupin found when they met. by Taupin for many years, as if they had written their own, there is a clear difference in communication at this time. souls \"Freedom in Philadelphia\", Elton's dynamite cover of the Beatles \"Lucy in the Sky\" and John Lennon \"Once a Day\" \"Less essential cover for this version of the mind game. \"Because these songs have nothing to do with the Captain Fantastic album, I'm going to put it in another category. Producer Gus Dudgeon gave each song an original light, and each band member showed off their great talents. -swan until one thousand nine hundred and eighty-three. After that, Elton moved to another section, and things were never the same again. It's hard to believe that just two years ago, Elton released \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" - something the did. for three years, Elton released two quality albums. Although Yellow Brick Road is often accepted as the best album because it is better known than this release, \"Captain Fantastic\" is not eligible.

The title track simply states their collaboration: \u201cAmazing Captain, grown and managed, a little brave, only one person would know this mother\u201d. How appropriate the explanation is for Elton\u2019s youth - shy, timid, mediocre. As Elton later sang: \"Brown Dirt Cowboy, green and big yet. His hands went into the music and singing, the captain and the boy, who stepped into the delivery, from there Sonny, had a long, sad journey. -climb. \" The melody begins with a country fire shaking during the song. an unusual plan for balancing rock (Elton) and country (Taupin). The Tower of Babel hinted at their first impression on the music industry: \"Where were your shoulders when we cried?\" Taupin was mourning. \u201cBitter Finger\u201d talks about building the club circle as a wrestling team. \u201cTell me when the whistle blows\u201d is the story of Taupins on this journey from rural England to London where the book will be written by Elton. Specifically this song has a very nutritious urban sound and great rhythm. The big hit album \u201cSomeone Saved My Life Tonight\u201d is still a band of supernatural power, like \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Sun Come Down On Me\u201d. Elton often sings and the vocal support of this song is performed in all genres and Spanish. Further, Nigel Olsson\u2019s drums playing this song may best structure it as it pushes the song to its emotional level. The second part of the album begins with \u201cGotta Get A Meal Ticket\u201d about the deal for the first publication signed by Elton and Taupin and the accompanying anxiety: the bottom row. In addition, Elton sings: \"shake hands if you need to, trust us and we will love you in every way. Careful writers of course need a record deal to do this and this song shows the experience. The opening guitarist Davey Johnstone's hook may be the best since Saturday Night Alright for Fighting - this guitar sings this song. In the next song, the lyrics are a simple song that wants to surprise the couple with a long they are still tomorrow. We All Fell in Love Once \/ the curtains go down on what may be the best closing Elton John album never. The first part is about the sibling love between Elton and Taupin that is discovered when they met and the curtains were a song about their dreams when they were young. Elton has never been as faithful to al abas. While it\u2019s true that over the years it has conveyed Taupin\u2019s words as if the himself wrote it, but there is something particularly different about this offer today. In fact, it may be the best sound performance never. Several more tracks have been added to this type of remake: the amazing soul of the philly hit \u201cPhiladelphia Freedom\u201d, the cover of Elton\u2019s Beatles \u201cLucy In The Sky\u201d and the unnecessary cover of \u201cOne Day\u201d And A Time by John Lennon \"from the release of Brain Games.

Elton has moved to different places since then, and things have never been the same. It's hard to believe that only two years have passed obsolete, Elton released Farewell Yellow Brick Road - another part form.

Elton later sang: \"Brown Dirt Cowboy, Green and Growing. He made money with music and poetry, Captain and Baby, and from there, Sony, a long and lonely climb.\" The song begins with a thunderstorm in the middle of the course. An amazing arrangement that balances the rock (Elton) with the earth (Taupin). The Tower of Babylon points to the first sight of the music business: \"Where were all your shoulders when we cried?\" Taupin cries. \"Bitter Fingers\" tells the story of building a club circuit as a struggling team. \"Tell Me When the Whistle Blues\" is the story of Toppins' journey from rural England to London, where the will write with Elton. The song is mostly urban sound and soulful and captures the lyrics perfectly. The album's catchy rhythm, \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\" is another powerful force, similar to \"Let Dawn Let the Sun Go Down for Me.\" Elton sings with great confidence and the supporting voice of the song captures all the competition with Spain. What's more, playing Nigel Olson's drum in this song can be a great performance as the song dramatically pushes its emotional heights. The second part of the album begins with \"The First Ticket to Share\" signed by Elton and Topin and the difficulties that come with it: White, I'm downstairs. Furthermore, Elton sings: \"If you have to shake hands, trust us and we will love you anyway.\" Careful writers need a recording agreement to do that Dewey John Stone's opening guitar can be much better than Saturday nights. It's good to fight - this guitar gets up at the moment. Next song, write a simple song that tries to think. The two of them have a long future. We all fall in love sometimes \/ The scenes send where Elton John's album should have the best ending never. The first part is about the love of brotherhood that Elton And Tapin found out when they met and the screen is just a song about the reality of their childhood dream. Elton never felt as sincere as the never did, although it's true that over the years Topin's words Bringing it as if it were written by himself, but something very different from this width. In fact, it may be the best sound performance never. A few more tracks have been added to this latest version. The most sought-after covers are Philadelphia Freedom, Elton's powerful Beatles corps, Lucy in the Sky, and John Lennon's One Day at a Time. For this release of Mind Games. Since these songs have nothing to do with the Captain Fantastic Concept album, I would have left it and put it in another appropriate release. Producer Gus Dudgeon performs every song where the light is clear and each member of the team demonstrates their amazing skills. It also represents the last album in the original list. Even though the did't realize it at the time, it was going to be this swan song for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty. Elton then went to different places and things never looked the same again. It's hard to believe that just two years ago, Elton released Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - another work of part. Within three years, Elton has released two standard work talk albums. And although Yellowknife Road is often hailed as the best album because it has more pop access and this release, Captain Fantastic should not be overlooked.

But there is also humour in these and other songs, the most famous being Flavor Flav's \"nine hundred and eleven is a joke.\" Humor does't find its purpose in problems, because it trickles the so-called public services that seem out of reach to the most needy people: \"Whenever you call, they'll never be right \/ you can ask me there.

Goin \u2019Places was released less than a year after the self-titled album The Jacksons reunited with Gamble & Huff, the album is a step back for the band. The door was\u2019t bad for any use, but after leaving Motown to curb further creativity, the team still found their hands on a finger of a strong production team. Trying to record a famous Motown act on the Philly Soul soundtrack was a fantastic success on their first album, but \u2018Goin\u2019 Sites looks like a remade version of that album. There are high-quality songs like \u201cThe Music\u2019s Takin\u2019 Over \u201d,\u201c Man Of War \u201dand\u201c Heaven Knows I Love You Girl \u201dbut the album seems to have lost its balance. Goin\u2019s sites are a big speed on the charts, not making any single stickers that don\u2019t even come out in the top forty. Despite the criticisms, it\u2019s worth listening to the album if you like The Jacksons and the work of Gamble & Huff.","overall":5,"summary":"Goin Places","unixReviewTime":1354579200,"reviewTime":"12 4, 2012"}

A good beat, nostalgic and\/or politically targeted lyrics, and pop mediocrity in general helped just about every album of Billy's aside from The Bridge into excessive-selling \"classics\" with some great songs and some adequate jones. This album is not a majority fan-favorite. But \"The Bridge\" is good. Consistently good, actually. A common criticism is that it is a victim of eighty's formula and production, but I only somewhat agree with that. Indeed, without naming names, suffice to say that there are MANY other eighty's albums that were far less full of artistic integrity. The album kicks off with a great piano statement, if underdeveloped. The Piano Man indeed had not betrayed this roots for the synths-of-the-day, rather, the combined them with THE PIANO, which was vital for him, the music industry at the time, and myself, all for various reasons. I often talk about the union of heart and brains, which for me is what really makes a good album. I find \"This is the Time,\" \"A Matter of Trust,\" and \"Temptation\", beyond catchy. They are highly emotional, but they also connect with the emotions in a familiar-yet-unique sort of way, if that makes sense. Billy's always had the rare talent of making simplicity endure the test of time, but i find the songs on this album FAR more MUSICALLY interesting than the dragging, monotone strums of \"Captain Jack\" and \"Only the Good Die Young\" and \"Tell Her About It\". Now that I have probably made a few million enemies, I should probably get to the nucleus of \"The Bridge.\" \"Baby Grand\" is one of those songs that comes along that you have to react with a \"This is perfect.\" The presence of Ray Charles put it beyond perfect, but the song itself is just amazing. The chords are a little more complex than Billy's usual recipe, the lyrics are very touching, and the SOUL and FEEL are so deep that you can play this quite a lot before being tired of it. Everything about this song, from Billy and Ray, right down to each piano click, is as tasteful as tasteful can get, and this is one of those songs that is the reason that music exists in the first place. There's another duet, \"Code of Silence\", with Cyndi Lauper, which is pulsing and sensitive all at once, and another all-around great song. \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\" is also a bit complex in the horn orchestration, and just like all the others there, a bit unique. \"Getting Closer\" is a great way to send things, on a very positive thematic note. The only song that screams \"too eighty's\" is \"Modern Woman\", with a poor choice in synth timbres, and for me a song with unnecessary subject matter. Listening to that song and then some of the others in a certain order may taint the years with a general residual impression of \"eighty's\", but one) at worst it's still not that much and two) that in itself in't the worst thing in the world. None of Billy Joel's recordings will never be considered a \"desert island disc\" for me, this albums are just too short and simple, and I think for more than a few of this fans, there's a nostalgic bug (which there's nothing wrong with). But \"The Bridge\" is one of this more interesting and emotional albums, and its forty minutes has very little filler. To just start getting into Billy (which does't seem possible), don't get this first, but don't wait too long to get it, either. Again, don't let others (including me) make your opinions for you.

A \"normal\" fan annoys me because the likes music for weak reasons. Fun rhythms, nostalgia and \/ for politics-based songs, and pop-mediated creativity have often helped almost every cat's album become a \"classic\" bestseller, except for The Bridge's beautiful songs and other comedies. This album is not a favourite of many fans. But \"The Bridge\" is good. It's always good, actually. The general criticism is that it suffers from the formula and its production, but I agree with that. In fact, other than the names, suffice it to say that most of these albums were not full of artistic integrity. The album begins with a good piano statement, if not ready. The piano man did't really deceive this synthesis of the day background, instead, it was connected to the piano, which was important to him, the music industry at the time, and to me, it all for a variety of reasons. Were I often talk about the relationship between the heart and the mind, which makes a great record for me. I find \"This Time,\" \"The Story of Confidence,\" and \"The Tribulation,\" more interesting. They are very emotional, but they also connect with emotions in a simple but different way, if it makes sense. The cat has always had a rare ability to endure things, but I find the songs on this FAR album more enjoyable than the charming jones, \"Captain Jack\" and \"Just The Good Dying Young\" and \"Tell It\". About that. \"Now that I've made a few million enemies, I have to get to the center of\" The Bridge. \" The presence of Ray Charles makes it incomplete, but the song itself is wonderful. That you can play it a lot before you get tired of it. About this song, from Billy and Ray, to every click of the piano, as interesting as it is, and it's one of those songs that Music came into being in the first place. There is another duet, \"Code of Silence\", by Cindy Lauper, which beats loudly and intelligently at the same time, and another fun song everywhere. \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\" is also horny. The setting is a bit more complicated, and there's Mojo Like everyone else, it's very different. \"Perspectives\" is a great way to send things, with a great thematic note. One song that sounds like \"this by too much\" is \"Modern Woman\", with the wrong choice in the synth tumble, and a song with an unnecessary title for me. Listening to this song and then ruining the years with the rest of the scene of \"this by\" one after the other, but one (the worst are not two yet) which is not the worst itself. on the ground. No recording of Billy Joel can never be considered a \"disc island disc\" for me, these albums are so small and simple, and I think there's an old memory besides those few fans (which of course). Is not bad either). But \"The Bridge\" is one of the most interesting and emotional albums, and its forty-minute completion is rare. Just start getting into the cat (which seems impossible), don't get it first, but don't wait too long to get it. Also, don't let others (including me) do their own thing. His work is full of beautiful music everywhere.","overall":4,"summary":"A personal favorite","unixReviewTime":1045958400,"reviewTime":"02 23, 2003"}

There's another duet, \"Code of Silence\", with Cyndi Lauper, which is pulsing and sensitive all at once, and another all-around great song. Billy's always had the rare talent of making simplicity endure the test of time, but i find the songs on this album FAR more MUSICALLY interesting than the dragging, monotone strums of \"Captain Jack\" and \"Only the Good Die Young\" and \"Tell Her About It\". None of Billy Joel's recordings will never be conserved a \"desert island disc\" for me, this albums are just too short and simple, and I think for more than a few of this fans, there's a nostalgic bug (which there's nothing wrong with). Everything about this song, from Billy and Ray, right down to each piano click, is as tasteful as tasteful can get, and this is one of those songs that is the reason that music exists in the first place.

Although of the ninetys, this album sounds timeless, has a brilliant product, has no fillers, and can be traced back to the day when the album was a true album - like a song in a collaborative work. to provide for the audience, the record business, controlled by individuals today, seems to be weak. There are many reasons why \u201cTide\u201d is different. He may have been the band of the greatest singer and songwriter in the history of recording. The closest thing can be drawn to Tori Amos' debut album \"Little Earthquakes\" (although Toriphiles claims Tori's first album was produced by her now defunct band Y Kant Tori Read). Nothing is closer than this. The album quickly attracted people's attention because it decided to put Husky's jazz-influenced sound on the front and in the center instead of intimidating him with musical instruments. Considering the time it came out, this is remarkable (try listening to some of Sophie B. Hawkins and Heather Nova's albums, and you'll see what I mean). The interesting thing is that the best songs in this category are those of Jones that are not clear. The infamous \"Crime\" is still a big guarantee even after years, but look at the low productivity of \"rotten meat\" and the subtle prosperity of \"Pale September\". They played a role at the send of the album, but they were the best, probably the best on the record, clearly followed by \"The First Taste\", which still haunts me today; her words are Fiona. however they like to turn to the drama and excel in the top films. However, this is part of the magic, on the other hand, I gladly accept Apple's attempts at poetic ingenuity instead of laughing at them. Fiona's next album \"When Pawn\" is also great, though there is some kind of rock edge, and her latest albums \"Unusual Machine\" and two thousand and twelve's \"Idler Sex\" are great in nature, but they also have some * about the memorable. \"stream\". In my opinion, it is definitely a desert island record, and all serious record collectors should have vinyl records right on CD. By the way, the production value of this record is very good. \"Tide\" is on my top list of the biggest albums of all time, and this list also includes Torrey Amos' \"Scarlet Road\", Joanna Newsom's \"Ys\" and Cocorosie's \"Gray Ocean\". If any of these albums attract you, you may want to check out this album. it is important.

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[11,11],"reviewText":"I am no longer sure whether it is a good thing to remember when an album was first released. I recall when \"Teaser and the Firecat\" was issued, and the enthusiasm that greeted it on AM radio. Cat Stevens, who eschewed commercial success, was a pop star. Perhaps a bigger surprise should have been that many of the songs are folk songs, many of which are contemplative and occasionally introspective, rather than the lightweight \"bubble gum\" pop that seemed to dominant AM at the time. Perhaps it was partially that contrast that made this album so successful. The stone of the album is set by \"The Wind,\" a short, simple and peaceful song about dealing with personal temptation and the pilgrimage to understanding both oneself and the world. I find it amazing that an artist can place so much depth in a song accompanied only by a pair of acoustic guitars. Perhaps it was that pilgrimage that drove Cat Stevens to write this songs and music. The following song is a love song. \"Rubylove\" is yet another simple song with heartfelt words. The music relies on a few instruments (including bouzoukis) and harmonies to bring out the power of the words. One of the highlights of this song is the portion sung in Greek (I think it is Greek). The words translated into English (which are available on several web sites) are:Sweet Ruby come backCome back to my use (or me)Come in the morning with the dawnYou were a ray of sunshine (or like a sunbeam) my little Ruby\"If I Laugh\" is a lament for a love that never happened; a poignant and interesting concept for a love song. Another song with a similar subject is \"How Can I Tell You,\" which deals with this inability to tell someone that the loves her. The faster space song \"Bitterblue\" may deal with yet another aspect of love unfulfilled, this time after providing her with several opportunities that she did not accept. It would appear to a casual observer that Cat Stevens was having problems with this love life at that time. Another interesting song that has fast space and idealistic lyrics is \"Changes IV.\" The music is good, but the lyrics are a description of Steven's philosophical view of the world at that time, which are fully of lovely late sixty cultural desires that we are as far from fulfilling today as we were then. One of the most worthwhile and interesting songs on this CD is \"Tuesday's Dead.\" The space is fast with a calypso flavor and the nearly meaningless lyrics appear to be there more for their ability to enhance the music than for any particular message. The opening piano chords of \"Morning Has Broken\" are some of the most recognizable chords of any song from that era. This beautiful song combines religious elements with a pop sound so subtly that a casual listener may be unaware of the fact that the song is religion-based. The song is also a celebration of the beauty of life, and is one of the best songs to never give someone the feel of how great it is to be alive. I always enjoy the backing vocals in the last minute of this song that give the song an angelic touch. This song will always be one of the classics of rock and pop.\"Moonshadow\" is yet another song that is subtly religious. This song plays on several levels, all of them with a touch of innocent enjoyment of the wonderment of nature. Cat Stevens captured the feeling of walking alone in a natural place with but the moon's light to accompany him, and then provided speculation as to the meaning of life, but in such a non-intrusive way that you never realize the depths of the song. In spite of the song's depth, the song remains humble with an air of mystery that quietly inspires awe rather than overwhelming bombast. The album closes with the cheerfully optimistic song \"Peace Train.\" Remember that this era was the close of the sixty and the beginning of the seventy, and the era where we were all tired of wars (times have changed little - we are still tired of wars). Cat Stevens saw the movements of the sixty as being a power that could drive worldwide peace. The upbeat space of the song, the space and power of the lyrics and the mixture of hand-clapping with pop and folk elements make this one of the unique songs of rock and pop. Cat Stevens was a rare artist who lived in the pop world and wrote unpretentiously and easily in the folk world, and gained popular acceptance in spite of this black of desire to be popular. This mixture of elements has created almost a myth around Cat Stevens, now Yusuf Islam. Cat has always been unabashed in this desire for a better, more peaceful world. He has supported this desires with actions, recording music that is overtly religious and providing money to purely charitable activities. Yusuf also finally recognizes that Islam accepts music, and has started to record again. Time has gone from the era of the Cat Stevens we knew, but perhaps Yusuf Islam could yet recapture the childlike wonder of the man we once knew as Cat Stevens. We can only hope, and perhaps spray.","overall":5,"summary":"Was It That Long Ago?","unixReviewTime":1138752000,"reviewTime":"02 1, 2006"}

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[11,11],"reviewText":"I'm not even sure if it's a good thing to remember when the album was first released. I remember the release of \"Teaser and Firecat\" and the enthusiasm to welcome AM. Stevens, a cat who avos commercial success, is a pop star. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that most of the songs are native songs, many of which are thought-provoking and sometimes forward-looking, rather than the cool \u201cbubble gum\u201d that seems to dominate at the time. Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly. The main theme of the album is \"Spirit\", a short, simple and peaceful song that tells the journey of facing a human temptation and understanding yourself and the world. I find it amazing that an artist can add so much depth to a song accompanied by an acoustic guitar only. It was probably that trip that led Cat Stevens to compose these songs and music. The next song is a love song. \"Rubylove\" is another simple song, from the heart. Music depends on other instruments (including bouzouki) and harmony to show the power of words. One of the highlights of this song is the Greek paraphrase (I think it is Greek). The English translation of the word (which can be found on many websites) says: Sweet Ruby is back to my side (or me) Come in the morning and in the morning You are a glare of sunlight (or as a sun clerk) My little a sad and humorous idea of \u200b\u200ba love song. Another song with the same title is \"How Can I Tell You\", which deals with situations where you can't tell someone you love them. The fast-paced local song \"Bitterblue\" can deal with another aspect of unfulfilled love, while giving her a lot of unwanted opportunities. Through the eyes of an unsuspecting viewer, Kat Stevens encountered a problem in this love of life. Another interesting song with a quick local and desirable songs \"Change IV\". The music is beautiful, but the lyrics are Steven's description of the philosophical world to look at then, full of lovely cultural aspirations in the late sixties, far from satisfying today. One of the most valuable and interesting songs on this CD is \"Tuesday the Dead\". The place is fast, with a hint of calypso, and almost meaningless songs seem to be more because of their ability to improve the music than any particular knowledge. Opening the piano chord of \"Morning Has Broken\" is one of the most popular songs of all time. This beautiful song skilfully combines religious elements with popular music, so that mainstream listeners do not realize that this song is based on religion. This song is also a reminder of the beauty of life, one of the greatest songs of all, and it will never make people realize how wonderful life is. I always love the last-minute harmony of this song, it brings the angelic touch to this song. This song will always be one of the classics of rock and pop music. \"Moonshadow\" is another song with mystical religious practices. The song is played on several levels, all levels showing pure pleasure in the wonders of nature. Cat Stevens captured the feeling of solitude in the natural world and the light of the moon that accompanied him, then gave a guess about the meaning of life, but in this non-invasive way, you would never understand the depth of the song. Despite the depth of the song, the song is still humble, and the atmosphere unmistakable, quietly evokes the fear of the people, rather than a heavy rhetoric. The album ends with a happy and entertaining song \"Peace Training\". Remember, this period is after the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, and it is also a time when we are all tired of war (time has not changed much - we are tired of war). Cat Stevens sees the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys movement as a potential force for world peace. The happy atmosphere of the song, the location and power of the songs, the mix of shoulder and pop and social elements make this song one of the most unique rock and pop songs. Cat Stevens is a rare artist. He lives in the pop world and writes clearly in the traditional world. Despite this dark desire for popularity, the is still gaining public approval. This blend of things almost created a myth surrounding Cat Stevens (now Yusuf Islam). The cat has always longed for a better and more peaceful world. You supported this desire with actions, recorded religious music, and provided financial support for your charitable activities. Yusuf finally agreed that Islam had embraced the music and started recording again. Time has passed since the days of Cat Stevens as we know it, but perhaps Yusuf Islam can go back to the miracle of the child of a man we once called Cat Stevens. We can only hope that there can be sprays.","overall":5,"summary":"Was It That Long Ago?","unixReviewTime":1138752000,"reviewTime":"02 1, 2006"}

The next song is a love song. \u201cRubylove\u201d is another simple song with open-hearted words. Music relies on many instruments (including bouzoukis) and adaptations to generate the power of words. One of the highlights of this song is the Greek singing section (I think it\u2019s Greek).

The song is also a celebration of the beauty of life, and it\u2019s one of the best songs that never makes anyone feel like it\u2019s good to live. I always enjoy the last minute support sounds of this song that give the song an angelic touch. This song will always be one of rock and pop artists. This song plays on different levels, and they all touch the innocent pleasure that is amazing in nature. Cat Stevens gets the feeling that the is walking alone in a natural place but the moonlight is following him, and then the will give you an idea of \u200b\u200bthe meaning of life, but in a magical way that is not you know the bottom of the song. Although the song is deep, the song stays in a low-key atmosphere that quietly promotes fear rather than a big explosion. The door was closed by a happy and hopeful song \"Train of Peace.\" Remember that this was the send of the sixties and early seventies, and the time when we were all tired of war (times have changed a bit - we are still tired of wars). Cat Stevens saw the Sixties act as a force that could lead to world peace. The height of the song, the space and the strength of the songs and the mix of hand-me-downs along with the elements of pop and folk make it a unique rock and pop song. Cats These combinations almost created a legend about Cat Stevens, now Yusuf Islam. The cat has always been hurt by this desire for a better, safer world. He supported these ambitions through actions, recording music that was clearly religious and only paying for charitable activities. Later Joseph also realized that Islam had accepted music, and began to are-record it. Time is running out for the Cat Stevens era as we know it, but perhaps Yusuf Islam can still recapture the child prodigy of the man we once knew Cat Stevens.

This song is also a celebration of the beauty of life, and is one of the best songs that does't make a person realize how good life is. I always enjoy the last-minute support songs of the song that makes the song an angel song. This song will always be one of the old rock and pop songs. \"Chandni\" is another clever song. The song runs on many levels, all touching the innocent fun of natural wonders. Billy Stevens tried to take the feeling of being alone in the natural world and the moonlight with him, and then guess what the purpose of life is, but in an incredible way that you can never see its depth \u06d4 Song. Despite the depth of the song, the song is humble and a mysterious soul that calms fear instead of a powerful bomb. The album ends with the hit song \"Peace Train\". Remember that this was the late sixties and early seventies, a time when we were all tired of wars (times have changed a bit - we are still tired of wars). Kate Stevens saw the sixty's movement as a force for world peace. The clear space of the song, the space of the characters and the combination of power and clapping pop and folk elements make it a unique rock and pop song. Kate Stevens was a rare musician who lived in the world of pop and wrote ruthlessly and easily in the human world, and gained popularity despite the black man's desire for popularity. This combination has created almost a myth about Billy Stevens, who is now Yusuf Islam. The cat has not given up its desire for a better, more peaceful world. He has fulfilled these aspirations by acting live, recording highly religious music and financing the activities of the poor. Yusuf finally realized that Muslims accept music, and the started recording again. We've known Katie Stevens for a long time, but Yusuf Islam may still be as surprised as we were when we knew a man's baby as Katie Stevens. We can only hope, and maybe spray.","overall":5,"summary":"Was It That Long Ago?","unixReviewTime":1138752000,"reviewTime":"02 1, 2006"}

It's got something for everyone -- wrap, jazz, RnB, jazz-rock, soul, funk -- but I cannot help feeling that it's less an album and more a fifty-minute catalogue. All the younger artists, particularly the vocalists, are performing their hearts out, because they know Quincy Jones's track record with the likes of Michael Jackson. This is their main chance to be the next Jackson. But sadly it looks as though it was not to be. Though very strong on production values, it was clear that some of the magic had gone from the Jones\/Temperton duo, particularly on the compositional use. Neither of the two covers on this album -- 'Birdland' and 'I'll be Good to You' -- is as good as the original. This was a team that had filled all of Michael Jackson's THRILLER with fantastic, original songs; it now seemed to be struggling to pull together a few decent melodies. There is much that is good on this album: the chorus on 'Back on the Block' really swings, the Bobby McFerrin body sounds on 'Wee B. Doin It' were striking at the time, and 'The Places You Find Love' was a kind of Live Aid choir revisited. 'Septembro' is probably the stand-out track, but 'Tomorrow' comes a close second. It is extraordinary to see so many jazz legends perform on this album, but doing such short stints -- particularly Ella, Sarah, and Miles. Zawinul acquits himself well, not on this own 'Birdland' but on 'Back on the Block'. Hancock and Benson provide workmanlike contributions.

There is much that is good on this album: the chorus on 'Back on the Block' really swings, the Bobby McFerrin body sounds on 'Wee B. Doin It' were striking at the time, and 'The Places You Find Love' was a kind of Live A choir revisited. It is extraordinary to see so many jazz legends perform on this album, but doing such short stints -- particularly Ella, Sarah, and Miles. All the younger artists, particularly the vocalists, are performing their hearts out, because they know Quincy Jones's track record with the likes of Michael Jackson. This one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine album effectively signed off the heights, with its chunky bass lines and electronic islam drum sounds. Though very strong on production values, it was clear that some of the magic had gone from the Jones\/Temperton duo, particularly on the compositional side. Neither of the two covers on this album -- 'Birdland' and 'I'll be Good to You' -- is as good as the original.","overall":4,"summary":"No Corrida and No Jackson, but something for everyone","unixReviewTime":985478400,"reviewTime":"03 25, 2001"}

I have never been a big fan of Hendrix, but I am the owner of this vinyl record and am happy that this version is also being updated now. The sound is great, the booklet is rich in content, and the DVD is short but interesting.

With powerful lyrics and inspired musicality, brimming with energy and vitality, she has well learned her place in the spotlight. Classicaly trained, she is a very skilled pianist and songwriter. Her arrangements, in my opinion, are her greatest feature. In her debut solo album, \"Diva\", she comes out in full force with powerful songs, instantly catchy hooks, and brilliant arrangements. She gives each song everything she has and you catch a glimpse of her spirit, realizing that this is what she was born to do. From the masterful handling of rythmms and intricacies to the wells of strength exhibited in her voice and music, this is essential Lennox. My favourite tracks include:\"Why\", the hit single that shows her extreme vulnerability and complexity as she tries to explain a relationship that's breaking down. It castes a spell on you and you have to stop dead in your tracks, no matter what your doing, as you're swept away her brilliance.\"Walking On Broken Glass\", full of dynamic energy with immensely catchy piano and rythmm. This is such a fun song to listen to. One of the best arrangements I've heard.\"Money Can't Buy It\", her powerful anti-materialism anthem, a message that needs to be heard with your society's infatuation with money and possessions. The wrap half-way through is one of the highlights of the album.\"Little Bird\", with its classic Lennox vibe. Sounds almost like a soul\/gospel song about breaking free. I also liked \"Stay By Me\" with its romantic, nostalgic melancholy. \"The Gift\" is the albums most subdued track, showcasing Lennox's beautiful introspective lyrics. Honestly, by buying this album used from Amazon, you could change your life for the price of a Big Mac. It's very high on my favourites list and I admire Lennox's talent and creativity.

Keith Tool thought about it a lot. how it is possible? What you're trying for is Lou, aka Big Willy Smith, better known as the Valley Bugs, better known as Dr. Octagon (the left hand) and the beloved touchstone of the subterranean community. A record that simultaneously different and surprisingly resembles its successful business brethren is a collection of slopes, comics that take pride in revolving around a pile of beats and loops. Like many threatening albums, Drs. The octagonologist is uniquely structured - the glorification and self-story of this MC star. The difference is that instead of bragging about your many uses of this penis, Dr. Octagon wants to tell you about this skill over time, this weird medical test, and this place of money laundering. You see, Dr. O is not an ordinary ship shop person. He is not a drug lord who oppresses this father. no. Oh, and did I mention Jupiter? Yes, it comes from Jupiter. I felt like it would go away in a moment. This album is much better than how privileged it is. It has to do with Keith's unique but undeniable ability. Her songs, in a modern way, are all about what a soldier sings: smart, aggressive, steadfast, dignified and, in the most extreme terms, full of unexpected metaphors and gestures of pop culture. A good doctor explains the misconceptions and impurities of the penis, the complex declarations and the contradictions in children. Pieces of the B-Movie Skeleton through the talk of quantum physics. The Tech Jar opera sits comfortably with the top space. Sex and science come together! Keith is also a great threat: the way the works is as strange and wonderful as a musician, a ghost but a powerful croon who responds to words in a strange way with the power of fear. There's a sense of discomfort with the wrapper's style - the rhythm is loose and unstable, hard to catch. And then it was never heard that it was designed for amateurs. Everything okay. Post a short production from Dan \"The Automator\" Nakamura (which includes ghost, trip shop bits and medical sex samples), and get a nice piece of the amazing wrap. Like many ship shop albums, Dr. The octagonologist has a problem with its length - it starts well but ends almost in the middle with smoke. Really, there's nothing to listen to after \"Girl Let Me Touch You\". Nothing terrible, anyway, nothing forgives the album's sixty-five minute work time. Still, there are a lot of good things out there.","overall":5,"summary":"asdf","unixReviewTime":1178496000,"reviewTime":"05 7, 2007"}

I was never too fond of the title track, but the lesser known tracks called \"The Life Auction\" and \"You and I (When We were Young)\" and \"Grace Darling\" are their absolute best. I did't care how expensive these Strawbs imports were, I had to get my Strawbs albums on CD quickly before they changed their minds and suddenly discontinued them. \"Lemon Pie\" and \"Starshine\/Angel Wine\" could have easily been great pop chart singles, but that never happened. In fact, nothing never charted on the Billboard Hot one hundred pop charts from the Strawbs. Some of their albums charted, but no singles. This album of \"Ghosts\" charted #forty-seven in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, which was their higher charted album in the US. They started going downhill from there. After their \"Nomadness\" album, the Strawbs continued to have band member changes and they drifted further away from both of their Folk and their Progressive influences and started to sound more like a typical pop music group that was already the sound that was saturating the pop music charts. It was all so easily dismissible since the Strawbs were so strong during their A&M; days. Only true Strawbs loyalists continued to buy the Strawbs albums (I'm guilty of this too, nowadays) even after A&M; gave up on them. Their immediate follow-up albums (from the Oyster label) were \"Deep Cuts\" and \"Burning for You\". There are a few good itunes, but these albums are easily and regrettably forgettable. The album afterwards, called \"Deadlines\" ended strong. Their songs \"Deadly Nightshade\" and \"Words of Wisdom\" are two of Dave Cousins best songs never. Strawbs continued to perform and release albums in later years. Dave Cousins still likes to find old band members who probably have nothing better to do, and they've done some shows and released some albums. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, their album \"Don't Say Goodbye\" and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's \"Ringing Down the Years\" are both pretty good. I think these two albums are better than their albums from the late seventies after \"Nomadness\". But, alas, they were running out of creative ideas yet again, and started to close their appeal once again. What's frustrating about the Strawbs is that Dave Cousins likes to keep are-recording earlier songs, like the thinks the's improving on them. I wish the would't do this. In two thousand and two, Dave Cousins got together with Rick Wakeman and recorded another album together. Rick Wakeman left the Strawbs back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one to join Yes and to do solo projects. And even on this Cousins and Wakeman album, Cousins still did some are-recordings that Rick Wakeman had nothing to do with back in their heyday. Dave Cousins seems to be the only member of the Strawbs that was on every Strawbs album. All the other members just came and went over the years. But, I'm sure that every Strawbs fan will agree that the Strawbs best albums were the albums of the A&M; years (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five). If you can find it, look for their double CD called \"Halcyon Days\" (the US version). It is the very best of the Strawbs put together all in one great double CD package. In fact, it was done so well that it is very obvious that A&M; have no intentions of releasing their albums separately. You'd have to buy their expensive imports as I have. I hope someday they will release the Hudson-Ford albums on CD. These two guys contributed to what made the folk side of the Strawbs so strong back in their earlier days. Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, the Strawbs, Yes, Pink Floyd, Triumvirat, King Crimson, The Moody Blues, Rick Wakeman, and Monty Python's Flying Circus. These were the strongest influences in my life as a kid. The Strawbs are still performing shows throughout England. They have a following just like the Grateful Dead had there in America. I'd like to see them come do a show there in California. Perhaps they could do a double billing with maybe Blackmore's Night. That would be a great show where they would actually compliment each other being seen together. What do you think? Strawbs fan's should check out Blackmore's Night.","overall":5,"summary":"This was my favorite album for many years back in my Progressive Rock days","unixReviewTime":1167350400,"reviewTime":"12 29, 2006"}

The album \"Ghosts\" was ranked # forty-seven in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, the highest in the United States. From there they began to descend. After their album \"Nomadness\", Strawbs went on to change band members. They have migrated to their communities and their Improvement influence, and are starting to sound more like a pop music group. This sound has filled pop charts. All of this can be easily removed, because the Strowbs were very powerful during the A&M; their God. Even after A&M, only the loyal Strawbs continue to buy Strawbs albums (I feel guilty about it now); they left them. Their next albums (from Oyster label) \"Deep Cuts\" and \"Burning for You\". There are some good iTunes, but these albums are easy to forget unfortunately. After that, the album called \"The Last Days\" came to an send. Their songs \"Deadly Nightshade\" and \"Words of Wisdom\" are two songs by Dave Cousins. Strawbs has continued to make and release albums in this final years.

However, I believe every Strawbs fan will agree that the best Strawbs album is the album A&M; Year (one thousand, ninety-nine thousand ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and five-five). If you can find it, please check out their duplicate CD called \"Halcyon Days\" (US report). It is best for Strawbs and comes with a large double CD package. After all, it did a very good job, and it was clear that A&M; they had no intention of releasing their album separately. You will have to buy expensive products like mine.

In fact, nothing has never been shown on Straubs' Billboard Hot one hundred pop charts. Some of their albums are married, but not one. The album \"Ghosts\" is # forty-one married at one thousand nine hundred and fifty-five, which was their best-selling album in the United States. They started coming down from there. After their album \"Gypsy\", Straubs continued to change band members and move away from both this people and their developmental influences and began to sound like a pop group that was already a pop who made pop music. Filled the chart. Everything was easily rejected because Strab was the strongest during this A&M. Day. Only Strabus loyalists kept buying Strabus albums (I'm guilty of it, even today) and after A&M. He left them. His follow-up albums (from the Oyster label) were labeled \"Deep Kits\" and \"Burning for You\". There are a few beautiful iTunes, but these albums are easily forgotten and sad. The next album, called \"Deadlines\", ended in a stalemate. His songs \"Deadly Night Shade\" and \"Words of Wisdom\" are two Dave Cousins \u200b\u200bsongs that have never been performed. Straubs continued to make and release albums in later years. Dave Cousins \u200b\u200bstill likes to find old band members who can't have the best, and the did some shows and released some albums. For one, nine hundred and eighty-eight, this albums Don't Say Goodbye and One Thousand, and Nine Hundred and Ninety-One Ringing Down the Years are both great. I think both of these albums are better than the jones that came out after \"Gypsy\" in the late seventies. But, alas, the had run out of creative ideas again, and the began to close this appeal again. The disturbing thing about Straubs is that Dave's cousins \u200b\u200blike to keep recording past songs, because they think they're the best. I wish they did't. Two thousand two, Dave's cousins \u200b\u200bmet Rick Wakeman and they recorded another album together. Rick Wakeman left Strabus one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one to join and work solo. And even on this album, Cousins \u200b\u200band Wakeman, cousins \u200b\u200bstill make records that Rick Wakeman did't put back in this heyday. Dave Cousins \u200b\u200bseems to be the only Strabus member in the entire Strabus album. All the other members arrived and left in just a few years. But, I'm sure every Strabus fan will agree that Strabus's best albums were A&M. One thousand nine hundred and fifty five, nine hundred and seventy five). If you can find it, look for a double CD called \"Halcyon Days\" (US version). The best strawberry pack in a large packet of two CDs. In fact, it is so well done that it is very clear that A&M has no intention of releasing their own album. You have to buy their expensive imported goods as I do. I hope that one day they will release Hudson Ford albums on CD. It was the two men who made the Strabus side so strong in their early days. Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, The Straubs, Yes, Punk Floyd, Treum Virat, King Crimson, The Moody Blues, Rick Wakeman, and the Monty Python Flying Circus. These were the most powerful effects of my childhood. Straub is still playing shows all over England. He has fans in the United States like Dead Thanksgiving. I'd love to see them do a show in California. Maybe they can charge twice for Blackmore Knight. It would be a good show if they complimented each other and looked at each other. What do you think Straubbus fans should watch Black Moor Night.","overall":5,"summary":"This was my favorite album for many years back in my Progressive Rock days","unixReviewTime":1167350400,"reviewTime":"12 29, 2006"}

They are also one of the best, their sound is something we haven't heard in a while. Blues based rock in the style of Guns in Roses and AC\/DC, of course their music in't really comparable with those great bands, but they are a very good band and have the potential to stay around for a long time. Their debut album is filled with fast paced hard rock songs with the occasional mid tempo ballad. The album kicks off with the drug anthem that put Buckcherry on the map, Lit Up. I'm sure you've heard this song before. The second song is the weakest on the album, Crushed for some reason does't do anything for me. Dead Again is a very fast rocker, sounds like something that could have been on Appetite for Destruction. Check Your Head is a mid tempo rocker, this was also a single but to the best of my knowledge it did't do much. Dirty Mind is another really heavy song. The band sounds great, singer Joshua Todd's voice is very powerful, guitarist Keith Nelson's guitar playing is top notch (amazing solo too), and the rhythm section of bassist J. B. and drummer Devon Glenn is very solid. The next song is one of the best on the album, and it's a ballad. For the Movies was the second single from the album, it's an amazing song. It also shows that Joshua Todd can really using. Lawless and Lulu is a great rocker, does't sound all that much different from the rest of the album. Related is definitely a high point of the album, it's just one of those songs that you'll hear once and it'll be stuck in your head for days. Borderline is a very mellow song, it's not a ballad though. Get Back is another rocker. big surprise. Nothing much to be said about it. Baby starts off sounding like a heavy song then mellows into another laid back mellow rock song, not one of my favourite songs by them. The album closes with Drink the Water, it's a pretty good song. The album ends on a high note and leaves you wanting more, that's the good part about it. So if you're into AC\/DC and Guns in Roses you should definitely check out Buckcherry, but my suggestion is that you should get their new album Time Bomb first, but if you don't like any of their singles don't even bother wasting your money because all of the songs sound relatively the same","overall":5,"summary":"Excellent Debut","unixReviewTime":989020800,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2001"}

They are one of the most famous, and their voices are something we have not heard for a while. Based on Rose Shot and AC \/ DC-style blues rock, yes their music can\u2019t be compared to those big bands, but it\u2019s a very good band and can last a long time. Their debut album is full of fast-paced songs and some medium-length songs. The album began with a poisonous song that put Buck Cherry on the map, and burned. I believe you've heard this song before. The second song is the weakest on the album, and for some reason the distraction has no effect on me. Dead Again is a fast rock singer, which sounds like a song \"Appetite for Destruction\". Look Your Head is a medium-speed entertainment device, the same, but as far as I know, it has little impact. Dirty Mind is another very difficult song. The band sounds great, singer Joshua Todd has a strong voice, Keith Nelson's guitar playing is excellent (fun is also good), bassist J. H. The next song is one of the best songs on the album, and it's a traditional song. Since the movie is the second on the album, this is a great song. This also shows that Joshua Todd can really be used. Lawless and Lulu are great rock musicians, and they don't sound very different from the rest of the album. Fitness is definitely one of the most important things on this album, it's one of the songs you've heard once and will stay in your mind for days. Border is a very around song, though not a traditional song. Go back to another rock singer. a big surprise. nothing to say. Baby sounded like a difficult song at first, and it gradually became another sleeping rock song instead of my favourite song. The album ends with drinking water, which is a very sweet song. The disc ends with a high profile, making you want more, which is helpful. So if you like AC \/ DC and Roses in Roses, you\u2019ll have to check out Buckcherry, but my advice is that you should buy their new Time Bomb album first, but if you don\u2019t like any of their songs, don\u2019t waste it.

If you have ANY doubt that Etta James was the original Queen Of Soul this is completely affirming. She and Aretha are just going to have to share that title; they're both essential. Even if you haven't seen the filmCadillac Recordsand don't know anything, even if semi fictionalized about what was going on inside Etta's heart as she recorded this, what you hear on this album will amaze you. The remastering album, especially for the original music's vintage makes it sound showroom new;Etta's voice is heard in all it's glory. What do I hear when I hear Etta's voice? She's smokey, fire and can plain just attack the mic with a raspy growl. It's also clear and some of most wonderfully phrased singing I can think of. So tell you something you don't know right? I don't know if that's possible so I'll work with my own impressions right now. EVERY song on this album is full of soul-EVERYTHING! The Riley Hampton Orchestra just melts like carmel, setting a nearly impossible standard for all soul music orchestration to come. Now we've all heard the title song; it's one of those undisputed R&B; classics that's etched into the subconscious of pretty much everyone. On music such as \"Anything To Say You're Mine\",\"Trust In Me\" and works of butter beauty such as \"A Sunday Kind Of Love\" and \"All I Could Do Is Cry\", a tune on which Etta falls into her lowest possible vocal register you hear the whole emotional heart of her talent; the ecstasy and agony, the joy and the spain, the blues and the gospel-she gives you everything, even if there's that unmistakable fifty's style R&B; \"swinging\" style to the arrangement. Etta can also throw down some serious blues too; the assertive sexuality of her spin on Willie Dixon's \"I Just Want To Make Love To You\" would be more then proof enough but then you get four bonus tracks; all wonderful uptempo Chess rhythm & BLUES (emphasis on that) with Harvey Fuqua;\"Spoonful\",\"It's A Crying Shame\",\"If I Can't Have You\" and the slow burning \"My Heart Cries\". On the album your going to get like minded itunes such as \"Tough Mary\" and \"Boy Of My Dreams\". I am not exactly sure how much of the emotion in these songs actually came from Etta's real life but either way she always sings a song they way she feels it and that is exactly what you'll get on everyone of these songs.

(the album is a rebuttal to a critic's negative review of TIDAL,) is a ten-song collection that shows Apple developing herself as a creative songwriter. This album feels like Apple striking out, refusing to be pigeonholed into a career of rewriting \"Criminal\" for radioplay. Replacing some of the radio-friendly melodies of the debut album, WHEN THE PAWN. is a slow-burn; maximum enjoyment comes after a few initial plays. The album begins with \"On the Bound,\" a jazzy, melancholic ballad that finds Apple repeating the refrain \"You're all I need. \" The song sets the stone for the album: she's angry, melancholic, and as sharp as never. Her piano lurches throughout the song. With a strong, soulful voice, Apple stands above many other female singers in the music industry. Her voice soars over much of the record, at times overpowering any piano for drums that may be in her way. There's a certain confidence and danger there that was't present on past recordings. Where TIDAL was more piano-driven, WHEN THE PAWN. focuses less on the keys and more on percussion (particularly the drumkit). The record ends with the bittersweet \"I Know,\" a love song that is strengthened not by what Apple adds, but what she leaves out. This album works as a whole better than TIDAL, and it forecasts the creative shifts Apple would take in EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE and THE IDLER WHEEL. Fans of Apple's discography, Tori Amos, for Alanis Morissette will find a lot of material there to love. Standout tracks to sample: \"Fast as You Can,\" \"To Your Love\" and \"Limp.\" These songs would also be a good indication of what the album as a whole sounds like. WHEN THE PAWN. is a worthy follow up to her initial debut, and it solidified Apple has a fantastic artistic force. OF NOTE: There is another listing for WHEN THE PAWN on Amazon.

The record ends with the bittersweet \"I Know\", a love song, not something Apple added, but something the missed.

However, with \"Aja\", Donald Fagen and Walter Becker truly did, to put it simply, take things to another level. Their jazz learning had never been so strongly in evidence before, but there's so much more to it than that. Gary Katz was given the sole production credit for this album as the was for all of the Dan's 'seventy-two-'eighty albums, though it seems hard to imagine that Fagen & Becker themselves did't deserve production credits there as well. With this album, there was really no choice but to give individual musician credits for each track. Basically, whatever musicians it took to achieve exactly what Fagen & Becker had in mind, that's how it was to be--they would't settle for anything less. Yes, certain musicians do appear on track after track--Chuck Rainey plays bass on all but one track, & Victor Feldman is on every track, though sometimes on keyboards, sometimes on percussion, sometimes both on the same track. On the other side of the coin, Jay Graydon does the solo guitar on \"Peg\" and that's this only credited performance on the album, and aside from Bernard Purdie playing drums on two tracks, each track has a different drummer. The list of legendary musicians who appear on this album is, quite simply, awesome--Larry Carlton, Dean Parks, Steve Gadd, Rick Marotta, Lee Ritenour, etc. In addition to the painstaking recording process, Fagen & Becker, who wrote every track there themselves, reached an astonishing level of compositional sophistication--certainly they had already proven themselves to be a brilliant songwriting team time and time again, but \"Aja\" is simply loaded with chord progressions\/ harmonic ideas that are mind-bogglingly sophisticated while remaining astonishingly musical and often downright beautiful. In a way, it's hard to believe that this followed its predecessor \"The Royal Scam\" by less than a year & because \"Aja\" is, for the most part, a lot different than that previous album. The wistful, bittersweet, profound ballad \"Deacon Blues\" and the dreamy & contemplative \"Home At Last\" are absolutely gorgeous, easily among the best music never recorded--the latter track is an excellent showcase for Becker's sumptuous lead guitar work. The main song portion of the title track is a wondrous, yearning ballad--the song begins in wonderfully flush fashion with elegant piano and a great sliding guitar line--it grabs you immediately. There's also the infectious, upbeat \"Peg\" and the skittering \"I Got the News\" which does feel considerably overcooked, but it's still catchy and undeniably strong--both of these tracks have distinctive background vocals from Michael McDonald. The sighing, casually funky album opener \"Black Cow\" is an excellent song; and the closer, the ominous, strongly R&B-flavored; \"Josie\", which DOES sound like it could have been a \"Royal Scam\" outtake, is great too. In the send, \"Aja\" really is, in many ways, the pinnacle of Steely Dan's career, as well as a landmark in soft rock history. If you're somewhat turned off by the idea of extended instrumental passages, then one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five's \"Katy Lied\" remains an excellent starting point for someone new to Steely Dan. On the other hand, with Steely Dan being such a crucially important band, it would be cool to start with their second album, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three's \"Countdown To Ecstasy\", a masterpiece in its own right, and arrive at \"Aja\" by moving ahead chronologically album by album to trace Steely Dan's evolution\/ development. If you're amazed by what Steely Dan accomplished there, I recommend checking out the \"Aja\" instalment in the \"Classic Albums\" DVD series--although it's a bit frustratingly scattershot and falls considerably short of being fully comprehensive, it's still got a lot of terrific contents that any true Dan fan will love. \"Aja\" is an incredible accomplishment--calling it essential would be putting it mildly. As for the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine \"original recording remastered\" version, the sound quality is basically superb as you'd expect (with Fagen & Becker having long been the consummate perfectionists), although on \"Black Cow\" you can still hear some considerable 'glitches' (for black of a better term) going on where, presumably, different tapes\/ takes were spliced together--I get the feeling that`s the kind of thing Fagen & Becker would like to eliminate if they could and that it`s beyond repair; splicing was clearly done on the multi-part title track as well. You also get characteristically sarcastic liner notes from Messrs Fagen & Becker themselves that intentionally blow off discussing the actual making of the \"Aja\" album altogether, although it`s telling that they inform us of the inability to locate the original multi-track tapes for \"Black Cow\" and the title track. In the send, I would't worry about tracking down the Mobile Fidelity gold disc version of \"Aja\" that came out years ago unless you're a totally obsessive audiophile (no offence intended) who just can't resist the temptation to compare the sound quality of it with this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine release.(P. S. The musician credits are somewhat suspicious and seemingly incomplete. Dean Parks in't given credit for what's reportedly this acoustic guitar work on \"Deacon Blues\", & Tim Schmit is credited for background vocals on the title track, \"Home at Last\", & \"Josie\" even though it really sounds like all the background vocals were done by Fagen.)","overall":5,"summary":"landmark album in the history of soft rock","unixReviewTime":1107388800,"reviewTime":"02 3, 2005"}

However, in \"Aaja\", Donald Fagan and Walter Baker really did it, in simple words, take things to the next level. His study of jazz had never before provided such strong evidence, but there is much more to it. Gary Katz was only given credit for the production of this album because it was for Dean's seventy-five albums, although it is hard to imagine that Fagan & Baker himself did not deserve production credit there. With this album, there was no choice but to give credit to each artist for each song. Basically, the artists needed to fulfill Fagan and Baker's thinking were - they will never be less satisfied. Yes, some artists appear off track after track - Chuck Rainey plays the bass on every track except one, and Victor Feldman is on every track, though sometimes on the keyboard, sometimes on the beat, sometimes both using the same song. On. On the other side of the coin, Jay Grayden plays this guitar on \"Peg\" and that's the only thing on the album, and each track has a different drum, except for Bernard Purdy, who plays the drums on two tracks. The list of famous artists on this album is very simple, famous - Larry Carlton, Dan Parks, Steve Gad, Rick Maruta, Lee Ratinor, etc. In addition to the delicate recording process, Fagen & Becker, who wrote it all on their own, have reached an astonishing level of creative writing - they have already proven themselves many times over as a group of talented songwriters. Done, but \"Aaja\" is still complete. Rhythm progress \/ harmony ideas. Surprisingly exquisite while the wonderful music remains and it is extremely beautiful. Somehow, it's hard to believe that the followed the previous \"Royal Scam\" less than a year ago and because \"Aaja\" is, for the most part, very different from the previous album. The cloud, bitter, deep song \"Deacon Blues\" and the dreamy and thoughtful \"Home at List\" are among the best, easily recorded best music - the latest track is a great show of Baker's famous guitar. The main part of the title track is an amazing, aspiring ballad - the song begins in a wonderful way with a piano and a great sliding guitar line - which catches you fast. There's also the infamous \"Pegg\", the smash hit and the skirting \"I Got the News\" which sounded great, but still charming and undoubtedly powerful - the background lyrics of these two songs are different from Michael MacDonald's. The satirical album launcher, the comedy \"Black Cow\" is a beautiful song. And close, startling, with strong R&B flavor; \"Josie\", who pretends to be a \"royal scam\", is also good. In the posting, \"Aaja\" is, in many ways, a reflection of Staley Dean's work, as well as a milestone in the history of soft rock. If you can get grid of almost extended extension device verses, \"Katie's Lie\", one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five is always the best start for a new one for Staley Dean. On the other hand, since Staley Dean is such an important group, it would be a good idea to start with this second album, Countdown to Ecstasy, One Hundred and Seventy Hundred, The Artist Himself, and then \"Aaja\" in sequence. Tracking the appearance \/ development of Steele Dean. If you're wondering what Staley Dean did there, I suggest you check out the episode of \"Aaja\" on the DVD series \"Classic Albums\" - although it's a disappointing scatter shot and black of completion. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT saint for me either. Any true Dean fan is still needed. That's the decent thing to do, and it should send there. As far as one, zero earlier, ninety-nine \"first are-recorded\" versions are concerned, the sound quality is as high as you'd expect (and Fagan and Baker have long preferred perfection), while \"Black Cow\" I can still hear what the 'big bugs' (dark for better term) do when, almost, different tapes are put together - I realize what kind of thing Fagan and Baker got grid of. Want to get if they can and that it is no longer correctable. The scan is clearly performed on a multi-component title track. He also found humorous notes from Messrs. Fagan and Baker who deliberately refrain from fully discussing the creation of the album \"Aaja\", although they tell us that they still praise the failure to find cassettes of many songs. Do \"Black Guy\" and the title song. In the posting, I won't bother to track the mobile fidelity gold disc version of \"Aja\" that came out years ago unless you are an obedient (no offence) person who can resist the temptation to compare. \u06d4 The quality of this voice is up to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety. (The artist's PS credits are somewhat dubious and seemingly incomplete. Dan Parks is not credited with the alleged acoustic guitar production of \"Deacon Blues\", and Tim Schmidt is credited with singing behind the title track, \"Home at Last\"). \", And\" Josie \"although it seems like all the background words were made by Fagan.)","overall":5,"summary":"landmark album in the history of soft rock","unixReviewTime":1107388800,"reviewTime":"02 3, 2005"}

As for the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine \"original recording remastered\" version, the sound quality is basically superb as you'd expect (with Fagen & Becker having long been the consummate perfectionists), although on \"Black Cow\" you can still hear some considerable 'glitches' (for black of a better term) going on where, presumably, different tapes\/ takes were spliced together--I get the feeling that`s the kind of thing Fagen & Becker would like to eliminate if they could and that it`s beyond repair; splicing was clearly done on the multi-part title track as well. The sighing, casually funky album opener \"Black Cow\" is an excellent song; and the closer, the ominous, strongly R&B-flavored; \"Josie\", which DOES sound like it could have been a \"Royal Scam\" outtake, is great too. The list of legendary musicians who appear on this album is, quite simply, awesome--Larry Carlton, Dean Parks, Steve Gadd, Rick Marotta, Lee Ritenour, etc. Dean Parks in't given credit for what's reportedly this acoustic guitar work on \"Deacon Blues\", & Tim Schmit is credited for background vocals on the title track, \"Home at Last\", & \"Josie\" even though it really sounds like all the background vocals were done by Fagen.)

Jay-z's new album closed \"Volume Two\" is fine, but I like \"Volume One\", \"Dynasty\" and \"Reasonable Doubt\", but this record is below Jay-Z's level. It's a great package, but it's certainly not a good record. The launch of \"Hova Song\" is great, I like \"So The Ghetto\" and \"Do It Again\", but \"Dope Man\" is just a complement. I love Mariah Carey's \"Things You Do\", but \"It's Hot\", \"Snoopy's Song\", \"S. Carter\", \"Pop four Roc\" and \"Watch Me\" are like complementing the songs. UGK's \"Big Pimpin\" is good, and \"There's Killing\" is also good, but \"Come Take Me\", \"Nymp\" and \"Hova Song\" are even better. However, the bonus songs \"Anything\" and \"Jigga My Nigga\" are both good. I'm going to buy some of Jay-Z's albums, but don't worry about \"Volume Three\".","overall":5,"summary":"jay-z best album ever in hip hop music and industry","unixReviewTime":946944000,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2000"}

Kelly was just that: R. This was probably this last really solid album. In fact, R. Kelly ('ninety-five) was't one of those. It had some great itunes, maybe three-four, and then the rest was average filler. I hated it on a whole. My mother towns the album and it's not all that! Anyway, TP-two, Strip For You, R&B; Thug, The Greatest Sex and I Don't Mean It start the CD off stupendously. My favourites from there are Strip For You, The Greatest Sex (my favourite of the five, mentions zodiac sign, sexily crooning) and I Don't Mean it, a song about having regrets about doing your lover wrong, and wanting to change it, apologize one, zero, and getting past it. TP-two - a nice, laid-back mid-tempo intro that will get you in the mood to of*** somebody special. for just hot for the moment, all! xxxxxxxxStrip For You - another sexy, chill mid-tempo about stripping before sex. Leave it to Kells to croon this way through a song such as this. A great song. xxxxxxxxxR&B; Thug - nice beat and the vibe; insane. Those two things save it from being a bad song. Lyrics are good, kinda slutty but I like it. xxxxxxxxI Don't Mean It - real R&B.; I miss you, Kells. Stop wrap-singing, and get back to the basics, I BEG YOU! I'd give you ANYTHING for you to do so. xxxxxxxx one\/twoThe Greatest Sex - Really smooth, with nice lyrics. The beat is pretty nice too. I LOVE this CD. It's great! xxxxxxxxxJust Like That - The Ho's were a bit much, but I understand where the's coming from mostly (haven't experienced a real relationship, but have seriously loved twice so. ) xxxxxxxxxxLike A Real Freak - Decent, not this best. The next song is WAY better. xxxxxxxFiesta - THE ultimate party anthem. I'm so glad that the wrote this song. I'm also happy Jay-Z was in the remix. xxxxxxxxxxxDon't You Say No - Pretty good vibe. Nice bass, different from the last song, but so similar to the others. Nice, but there should be more, I suppose. xxxxxxxxThe Real R. Kelly - Uh. Weird, I guess. xxxOne Me - Much better than the proceeding interlude. xxxxxxx one\/twoI Wish - Great insight to R. Kelly's life. I respect him for letting it all out, so we could hear it. The guitar helps the laid-back vibe to it. Mid-tempo with meaning at its finest. xxxxxxxx one\/twoA Woman's Threat - A strong \"ballad(?)\" about a woman who will leave you if you do wrong. Best believe. xxxxxxxxxI Decided - Not much to say, but this track is killer! xxxxxxxxxxI Mean (I Don't Mean It) Solid remix. It is a remix, right? Nice production. xxxxxxxxI Wish - Remix (To The Homies That We Lost) Pleasant, and assisted by a complete orchestra. xxxxxxxxxAll I Really Want - Chill as all get out, but not very distinctive. One of the very weakest tracks there. xxxxxxxFeelin' On Yo Booty - solid mid-tempo. Showcases R. Kelly's frequent freaky ways. xxxxxxxxThe Storm Is Over - a gospel-tinged mid-tempo that's not only true, but inspirational and relate-able. One of the better songs there. My old friend, Derrick's mother, Paulie, adored this one. Probably was her favourite by him. Well, might be tied with I Believe I Can Fly. ^_^ xxxxxxxxx one\/twoOverall, this album is a lusty, even slutty view into this life, this soul and heart.

Not only that but considering that it is really Worth as following up to two albums- in this case directly from this one one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight double setRand as a sign up to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three thirteen- Is a seventy version of the Marvin Gaye style that is conceptually attributed to an album in which the music and songs originally speak an emotional language.

Kelly writes (and often invents) the types of Kelly where Kelly is naked about the conflicts that require fame and how it separates you from your humanity. It usually takes the days of modern R&B; lifestyle while being a music star is very similar to being a superior model sometimes playing the truth and hope issue to be heard together. It\u2019s likely that when the album is released Kelly will actually remember the friend she left in the remix of \u201cI Wish\u201d and some thorough references to \u201cgoing to church\u201d to open, a recurring idea for R. Kelly that still continues until now. So that does\u2019t mean it\u2019s worth a stylish look because it sits upright, even if the maximum width is in modern terms.

The songs are beautiful, fun but I like them. xxxxxxxx I don't mean - real R&B; I miss you, Kallis. How to wrap up, and get back to basics, please! I can give you anything to do that. xxxxxxxx one \/ two great sex - really smooth, with nice words. The butt is also quite cool. I like this cd Good! xxxxxxxxJust Like That - The Ho's was a little bit, but I understand where the most is coming from (I've never had a real relationship, but I've loved it twice so deeply.) The next song says the best way \u06d4 XxxxxxxFiesta - The band's last song. I'm so glad you wrote this song. I'm glad JZ was in the remix. Don't say - a great passion. The bass is beautiful, different from the last song, but very similar to the others. Okay, but I think there must be something else. xxxxxxxThe Real R. Kelly - Uh. This is amazing, I think. XxxOne Me - Much better than continuous registration. xxxxxxx good understanding of one \/ twoI Wish - R's life. I respect Kelly by giving her all this, so that we can hear her. The guitar helps the environment flying on this back. Medium speed with excellent definition. xxxxxxxx Danger of one for two things - a strong \"balad (?)\" that will leave you if you do something wrong. Believe it for not. XxxxxxxxI decided - I can't say much, but this song is deadly! xxxxxxxxxI means (I don't mean) a solid remix. Remix, okay? Good production xxxxxxxxI Wish - Remix (For the Lost Children) It's fun, and with the help of a full orchestra. xxxxxxxx All I really want is - cool when they all go out, but not too far away. One of the weakest tracks there. xxxxxxxFeelin 'On Yo Booty - A strong medium speed. It shows unusual ways of R. Kelly xxxxxxxx The storm is over - with a medium speed gospel that is not only true, but inspiring and connected. One of the best songs out there. My old friend, Derek's mother, Paulie, loved it. Maybe the loved her very much. Well, it can be linked to I believe I can fly. ^ _ ^ xxxxxxxxx One for two in all, this album is a lustful, carefree look in this life, this soul and heart.

My old friend, Derek's mother, Paulie loved it. To know more about it, all my other reviews still have a lot of highlights in this R&B style. As they say it makes a difference to me (two thousand and one album is great. And of course that's not all. It's not that she needs to wear that sleeve anyway but the fact is that Kelly Written, produced and compiled. Every note on this album is important because at that time the level of innovation was important to keep the system dependent. To check the music.

At first glance, this is just another sex post based on the depth of sex. It looks like an album. If you only look at the cover image and the titles of the songs, you get a very different experience once you sign in to the album. Not difficult Cuban Party \/ Just Two Steps \"Festa\" which is a solid uptempo jam. Songs like \"Strip for You\", \"My Wish\", \"One Me\", \"I Mean (I Don't Mean)\", \"All I Really Want\" and \"The Storm Now Over Now\" are well written (again). Often (the ballet type number) Kelly is emotionally naked about the arguments of fame and how they separate you from your personality. Basically it takes modern R&B. A way of life where being a music star is a lot like sometimes being the best model and playing the facts and hopes of this story for everyone to hear. So much so that posting an album reminds Kelly of a friend who went with a remix of \"I Wish\" and in some shortcuts constantly refers to \"going to church\" to free herself, a The idea that reappears. Kelly still follows RK today. So it's totally inappropriate as a \"retro\" style album because it sits flat, even the most prominent ballads karen't modern. And considering the title of the poem was probably the best decision. Here or. Kelly's ship shop is based on R&B. Music goes hand in hand with words from a celebrity who is attracted to music at any time. And although there is music in it that you can easily offer to make love to it, listening to it will bring interesting thoughts to your mind.","overall":4,"summary":"If you clean up R.

When I heard about Stars and Topsil, a compound compiled by FourAd to summarize their ideal weight years on this label, I quickly added it to my collection. When I think of releases, I don't think getting stars and topsoil is the best introduction to a great band that has never heard of it before. The album features a variety of styles and, although it shows the band's continuity during the four years of AD, it is not confusing for any youngster. I would only suggest that I take HEAVEN for LAS VEGAS to get a treasure to find out about the band. Leave out the stars and topsoil until you get to know the band and you already have a lot of albums. But this warning is for those who do not know the twins. If you enjoy the beautiful music of cocktail twins, Stars and Topsile cover the weight of years of some of their best songs on one disc.

With their previous release being much more hard-headed, \"Break\" seems to aim for the more soothing side of hard rock -- and does it quite successfully.\"Break The Cycle\" is not only superior to Staind's previous release, but much more enjoyable and powerful. Aaron Lewis' amazing vocal talent mixed with this vivid capability to compose powerful lyrics come together to create an album that addresses the important issues that your times face.\"Open Your Eyes\", the album's opening track, is an amazing mix of lyrical composition with pure hard rock fantasia. The band's incredible talent at working with each other provides for a brilliant collaboration. However, the highlight of the album are the band's more softer cuts, specifically that of \"Epiphany\", an overwhelmingly powerful lyric by Aaron Lewis with a vocal presence that is practically haunting. Other highlights include \"Fade\", \"It's Been Awhile\" and \"Outside\" (which is a much better cut on the album than its counterpart live version featuring Fred Durst). All in all, \"Break The Cycle\" is a breakthrough for the band's itself, showing its audience its surge in both maturity and artistic expression.

DAY ONE: I\u2019m at this friend\u2019s house right now, and the\u2019s playing Staind\u2019s \u201cBreak the Cycle\u201d. These singers feel so much better. So I think things are very difficult. If nine of the thirteen songs on the CD \u201cfeel\u201d, and each of these songs has a different idea (speak different emotions), then there\u2019s a very good chance that even one of those songs is closely related to how I feel about certain things happening in my life. DAY TWO: A friend played a little Doctrine in this car with me today; I did\u2019t really listen. When the song \u201cMid\u201d came out, my friend turned up the volume. That friend informed me that the last name was Stapp- \u201che felt\u201d something that was even once weighed in a song. Man, and I thought Stain was emotional. This Stapp person feels \u201cangry\u201d and feels \u201chelpless\u201d and feels \u201cviolent\u201d and feels \u201calone\u201d because the can\u2019t be alone with the world; I felt all of that feeling later, but all sorts of different reasons, so I thought I might contact Stapp as well. DAY THREE: So I was at a party, and I knew the first three groups - none of them had been shown to me yet (Linkin Park, Nickelback, and especially Puddle of Mudd [that \"feels\" \"Control\", sound, to be \"emotional\" for no reason]) - calling everyone speaking \"emotional\" as if mad. As Staind and Creed did. After running away from a drunken party, I started to wonder why all these bands were the same (singers with mixed vocals Eddie Vedder and Scott Weiland, and four \/ four-beat, riff music) everyone joins the word \u201cemotions\u201d in their words. I began to think about the purpose of these groups. When I got home, a dollar came out of my pocket as I chewed on my house key. Then it all ended: NOW: When the word \u201cfeel\u201d is pronounced in the song, people will hear it. ESPECIALLY when that word is associated with confusion. So, the song has a good chance to encourage the listener to buy the CD. What NOT to hear from dear Staind is any attempt at a solution. \"The world is a terrible place, this is what it is, and I will fall into my depression and shout in my excessive (but useful) wrong voice until the day I die.\" Why do modern stone workers violate this position? Because it sells like hot cake, baby. If your singer says, \u201cI feel violent\u201d, it triggers a natural response; this is unavoidable -time-, and the record is compiled NOTE. Stain question of honesty, people. I\u2019m sorry to let you know that you would\u2019t have heard this creative sound (corruption, music, and voice) if the groups than\u2019t first caught the attention of record organizations by selling \u201cstuff\u201d to them. These groups do not write words and collect their music in the garage for a simple purpose to satisfy themselves; they do it because they want to live the American Dream: be a rock star, and learn a lot of money.","overall":4,"summary":"A powerfully orchestrated rock album","unixReviewTime":1003795200,"reviewTime":"10 23, 2001"}

Although 'I am in shape' may be a darker version of the studio, and 'weight' may not be as good as its counterparts, it is more than just a real sense of refinement and honesty that is practice everywhere. \"It's a rock of page.\" It's amazing why these tracks were't included in the original release, except for \"Like a Rolling Stone\" where it turns out that Dylan forgets some of those words, the songs. In some parts, the horn does't work well and looks strong.

Maybe, most of you do not know who natalie is, but let me help you: she's the former star of an australian TV show, who debuted as a singer in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, with the hit single \"TORN\", played everywhere. After four years of absence, natalie is finally back, with a great and very mature album.\"That day\" was the first single released in some countries. It's a song that is almost spoken, and introduces natalie to those who do not know her. It was based on her personal journal and is a song about depression, happiness and all human emotions that we can feel daily.\"Beauty on the fire\" is a very cool track, and talks about nat's limits and desires.\"Satelitte\" is a great song, different from everything you may have listened. It has an interesting beat, and is about relationships, especially those when one person is totally dependent on the other, which functions as a real satelitte.\"Do you love\" is a beautiful ballad, and great to relax.\"Wrong Impression\" is the first US single and second for the rest of the world. It's a joyful song, with a good video.\"Goodbye\" is a very sad song, slow and tense. It is about the send of a relationship, telling us how hard it is to say goodbye to the jones we once loved.\"Everything goes\" is a good track, talking about selfish people who live like an island, satisfied with themselves, enjoying only the present moment. This may be a little tricky and this song works as an advice to those people.\"Hurricane\" is also sad and makes me feel blue.\"Sunlight\"is a cool song and could be chosen as a single. The chorus is great \"Did you never feel the sunlight on your face, did you never taste clouds? did you never touch space?\".\"Talk in tongues\" is one of my favourites. A beautiful melodic ballad. This song has a special meaning for all natalie's fan, because of it is old, but was never recorded on studio before. During the hiatus on natalie's career, I listened to it several times, hoping it would be released someday.\"Butterflies\" is a strange song, kind of depressing. It is about craziness, pills, treatments, etc.\"Come september\" is a good track, and natalie's favourite in this album, as she has declared on some recent interviews. It's biographical and worth to be listened with attention. All I can say, is that \"White Lilies Island\" is an amazing album, especially for those who like pop music, made with high quality. It is surely a must-have item, for those who enjoy good music. PS.:Now, a frequently asked question: where is the white lilies island?

And Tweet's debut album, \"Southern Hummingbird\", which she largely produced, co-produced and\/or co-wrote alongside Missy Elliott, Timbaland and others, definitely trumps Ciara's debut album \"Goodies\". If there's anything to be surprised about, it's that Missy Elliott & Timbaland's musical innovation and experimental chaos are virtually nowhere to be found on this album, especially when you consider the fact that this album's lead single is \"Oops (Oh My)\", easily one of the sexiest and best singles to be released within this decade. Tweet's sultrily crooned celebration of sexual self-pleasure over Timbaland's unconventional, yet smooth and club-ready production, not to mention Missy Elliott's whispered, raunchy guest verse - long story short, anyone who was't turned on by the R&B; siren at this stage must've had serious problems. The unsurprising bit, however, is that nothing even comes close to matching the originality for the undeniable sexuality of the aforementioned track, as the majority of \"Southern Hummingbird\" cleans far more heavily on old-school-inflected, musically raw ballads and slow jams than the musically innovative club banners that Timbaland & Missy Elliott are widely known for. Thankfully, such black of musical experimentation does't lessen the quality of Tweet's record. \"So Much To Say (Intro)\" sets the mood for the album as Tweet recites poetic, reflective lyrics and smoothly croons over surprisingly organic production. Despite Tweet's natural sexuality, what truly sets her apart from most of her contemporaries is her honesty and her remarkable degree of restraint, never reaching for notes she can't hit (Cassie, Ashanti, etc.) for howling and screaming like an escaped mental patient (Beyonce, Christina Aguilera, etc.). Such a fact is especially displayed on the following tracks - \"Smokin' Cigarettes\", where Tweet, over guitar strings and subtle synths, confesses to smoking in order to relieve her heartache and emotional urgency; the acoustic guitar-driven \"Motel\", where Tweet calmly tells her unfaithful sex-lover to \"go to Hell\", right before booting him out of her life; \"Complain\", a stellar ballad where Tweet, over beautiful instrumentation, contemplates life and how she would't complain if her man came back; and the equally stellar ballad \"Drunk\", where Tweet confesses to resorting to alcoholism to escape emotional and worldly spain, while doing so with a vocal delivery that's slow, smooth, urgent, depressing and weirdly drunkenly. Other ballads like the spiritually expressive love code \"Always Will\" & her duet with Bilal on the gorgeous \"Best Friend\" manage to lighten the mood and diversify the album's range of emotions and moods. Speaking of range, Tweet (thankfully) has the smarts to enliven the set with some much-need club jams. \"Boogie twonite\" & \"Make Ur Move\" infuse elements of Funk and\/or Disco into their musical structure, while \"Call Me\" smothers Tweet's hypnotic vocals and sexually suggestive, self-surrendering come-ons over Middle-Eastern-tinged, bouncy production. Then of course there's the previously mentioned \"Oops (Oh My)\". As a whole, Tweet has come out with a very strong debut that is easily worthy of purchase and\/or hard drive space. Lets hope her two thousand and five sophomore album, \"It's Me Again\", matches the greatness of this classic R&B; album. Lets also hope that it does't have anything as horrible as the two bonus tracks stacked on at the send - \"Sexual Healing (Oops Part two)\", a terrible redo of the original that strips the song of its original sexuality and includes a pitiful contribution by Ms. Jade ; and \"Big Spender\", a horn-driven boast-fest that Missy Elliott inhabits solely by herself for a painful three minutes and ten seconds. five stars!five Best Tracks:\"Oops (Oh My)\" (feat.

{"orig_index":41098,"reviewerID":"A2JV4Z6US6BA4O","asin":"B000089CPF","reviewerName":"junkmedia","helpful":[8,9],"reviewText":"Joey Burns and John Covertino's Calexico was pretty much written off as a sun-baked side project until their sophomore release, The Black Light, appeared on the scene. Taking its cue from Cormac McCarthy's heat-warped perspectives of the American Southwest, the record was neon tumbleweed tequila music that floated above an undercurrent of violence with cinematic grace. It was a major step forward in defining the band's sound and served notice that they would not be following the spaghetti-western chuck wagon. Instead, the album celebrated the magically real convergence of culture that occurs in the borderlands, explicitly linking their name and physical geography to a musical one. Calexico's third release, The Hot Rail, continued to expand on this formula. It was an album that unfolded with a filmic fluidity to reveal desert nor folk singers and Technicolor mariachi bands playing for pretty girls throwing flowers and men sharpening knives. Not surprisingly, it was their most successful record to date. Feast of Wire may soon change that, as the band once again ups the ante by widening their scope of sound. Cool West Coast jazz, eerie string sections, and dub are added to the storytelling folk, mariachi horns, kitschy border ballads, and sun-cracked soundscapes that rounded out previous efforts. If that sounds like a handful, it's because it is. Lesser talents would't be table to hold it all together, but Calexico seamlessly blends these disparate parts into one of their most satisfying listens yet. Sure, with so much to hear and such a range of styles, the album can take a couple of listens before it starts to bloom. That said, after these requisite spins, one can't help but admire how smoothly Feast of Wire glides from track to track, style to style. As on past albums, the band does an excellent job sequencing the record by situating slower instrumental passages between the more traditional songs. These musical bridges help bind the album together and create a total listening experience that is becoming increasingly rare today. For example, after the Marty Robbins-influenced border ballad \"Across the Wire,\" the band segues into \"Dub Latina,\" a stripey, melodic placed instrumental which in turn flows into the rousing \"Guero Canelo\" with its speak and spell wrapping and ebullient background singers. It's a heady mix, and though the three songs could't be more different, they send up making a wonderful suite within the record. Likewise, the gothic, string-laden \"Black Heart,\" which is unlike anything the band has done before, dissolves into pulsing synths at the beginning of \"Pepita\" before ushering in a multitude of beautifully picked acoustic guitars and a forlorn-sounding pedal steel. The disturbingly pretty pop song \"Not Even Stevie Nicks . \" immediately follows, telling the tale of a man driving this car off a cliff and being found later, \"in the motor.\" I guess if the Gold Dust Woman can't help, there's no point in thinking about tomorrow. And while Feast of Wire continues to reveal new sounds at every turn, the most surprising track on the album comes near the send when the band falls into the cool jazz of \"Crumble.\" It's wholly unexpected, approximating the sound of what Miles Davis' Sketches of Spain would have been like were it a collaboration with Charles Mingus. It's perfectly placed to knock out any last vestiges of resistance, leaving even the most hardened listener to break into a smile.

The sun-shining project, a dark light, emerged from the scene. Inspired by Cormac McCarthy's views on thermal transformation in Southwest America, this record is by the music of the neon tumbleweed tequila, which floats above the violent cinematic violence. This is an important step forward in explaining the sound of the band and showing that they will not follow the spaghetti-western style chuck wagon. Instead, the album celebrates the combination of magic and cultural reality that takes place in border areas, clearly combining their names in geography and music. The third version of Calexico, the Hot Train, continues to expand this formula. The album, which is exposed to the humidity of a movie, depicts desert for traditional musicians and colourful karachi groups playing beautiful girls and men sharpening knives. Not surprisingly, this is their most successful record so far. The wire rhythm may change this soon, as the band has also raised the stakes by increasing the volume range. A cool West Coast jersey, pieces of stunning straps and shots were added to the narrative ballads, mariachi horns, cheesy border ballads, and a sun-craggy soundscape that put an send to previous attempts. If this sounds like a bit of a joke, it's because it is. The young talents will not combine, but Calexico seamlessly integrates these different members into one of the most satisfying listening to date. Of course, because of its versatility and versatility, the record may need to be listened to several times before it begins to swell. In other words, after this necessary cycle, people can not help but be amazed by the smooth slide of the \"Wire Feast\" from track to track, style to style. As with the previous album, the band did an excellent job of setting records by placing slow verses between traditional songs. These music bridges help bring an album and create a truly unique listening experience today. For example, after the ballad line \"Beyond the Fence\" was inspired by Marty Robbins, the band switched to \"Dub Latina\", which is a linear instrument, with beautiful music, that comes out excited about its speech and spelling. \"Guero Canelo\". Interesting background singer. This is an interesting mix. Although these three songs are completely different, they make an excellent list for the record. Similarly, Gothic, filled with the string \"Dark Heart\" is different from anything the band did before. It incorporates a pulse synthesizer at the beginning of \"Pepita\", and introduces many carefully selected guitars and percussion Pedal sound. black. A disturbing pop song \"Not even Stevinix.\" closely followed, tells the story of a man who drove a car off a cliff and was later found \"in the engine\". I think Jin Chen's wife can't help, so it won't be considered tomorrow. Although Wire Festival is always showing new sounds, when the band is caught in the cool jazz of \u201cCrumble\u201d, the most amazing thing on the album seems to be close to release. This is totally unexpected, close to the sound of Miles Davis' Spanish painting would have looked like a collaboration with Charles Mingus. It can completely put an send to any last vestiges of opposition, even the strongest listeners will smile. As the last song \"No Doze\", with a squeaking cello and continuous sound emerging slowly, it is clear that Burns and Cfortino threw a map through the window long ago and opened up the music wilderness.

According to Cormac McCarthy\u2019s hot-spot view of Southwest America, the record is a tequila neon tumbleweed musical that surpasses low-stakes with cinematic grace. It was a big step forward to define the sound of the group being informed that they would not be riding in a western chuck-spaghetti car. Instead, the album celebrates the real mix of culture across borders, clearly associating their name and physical geography with the music. Calexico\u2019s third release, The Hot Train, continues to expand this formula. It\u2019s an out-of-the-box album with a film vibe to showcase desert songs for artists and Technicolor mariachi bands playing for beautiful girls throwing flowers and men sharpening knives. Not surprisingly, this is their most successful record to date. Wire Festival could change that right away, by are -raising the band by expanding the volume. Jazz West Coast jazz, bad string elements, and dubs are added to the storytelling, mariachi corners, wide kitschy borders, and sun-kissed sound that sum up past efforts. If that sounds like a handkerchief, the reason is that Small Skills won\u2019t be a table for each other, but Calexexico will seamlessly combine one of their most enjoyable listening. Of course, with so many sounds and so many different styles, it may take a few hearings for the album before it starts to bloom. That said, after those necessary shifts, no one can help but admire how well the Wire Festival deviated from the road to keep up with it, look in style. Like previous albums, the band does a great job of setting up a straight record by setting up slow-moving instruments between multiple traditional songs. These musical bridges help connect the album and create the overall listening experience that is becoming very rare now. For example, after Marty Robbins influenced the frontier of \u201cWire Beyond,\u201d the group split into \u201cDub Latina,\u201d a line, a set of music that also flows into \u201cGuero Canelo\u201d with its own speech and recording. spelling and original abusive artists. It\u2019s a combination of the head, and although the three songs may not be different, they still make a wonderful room on the record. Also, the gothic, Black Heart-engraved strings, which are no different to anything the band has done in the past, go hand in hand with the original \u201cPepita\u201d before the introduction of many beautiful and beautiful guitars. more chosen and stronger. one. The beautiful and beautiful song \"Not Even Stevie Nicks.\" He immediately followed, telling the story of a man driving this car who came out of a rock and was later found, \"the motorcycle.\" I think if Golden Ball Woman can\u2019t help you, it does\u2019t make sense to think about tomorrow. And while Fest of Wire continues to feature new sounds all the time, the most amazing way the album will soon be released is when the band hits the cool jazz of \"Crumble.\" This is completely unexpected, almost the sound of what Miles Davis\u2019s Sketches of Spain would be if it were a collaboration with Charles Mingus. It\u2019s well positioned to throw out any last chance of resistance, making it harder for the listener to break the smile. While the final track, \u201cNo Doze,\u201d is slowly preceded by cello and static mourning, it becomes clear that Burns and Covertino threw the maps out the window long ago and campaigned their tracks in the desert of music.

Gone until they are released from the heights. School, black light, appeared on the scene. Taking a cue from Cormac McCarthy's changing views of the Southwestern United States, the record was the music of Neon Tumbleweed Tequila, floating on violent cinematic violence. It was a big step in explaining the band's voice and the noticed that it would not follow the spaghetti western chuck cart. Instead, the album really celebrates an amazing cultural clash that crosses borders, clearly connecting its name to the visual and musical realms. Calexico's third release, HotRail, continued to expand this formula. It was an album featuring a twist on the film to expose desert for traditional artists and technicians to the Mariachi band, with beautiful girls throwing flowers and men sharpening knives. Not surprisingly, this was this most successful record to date. The wire festival may change soon, as the band raises the brick again by increasing its volume limit. Cool West Coast jazz, terrifying pieces of string, and a dubbed storyteller were added to the Marichi horns, Kitsuchi Border Ballads, and sun-drenched sounds that included previous attempts. If it sounds like a handful, that's why. Small capabilities may not be the table to hold them all together, but Calexico freely adds these different parts to its most satisfying audience. In fact, with so much hearing and such a wide range, it can take a few moments for an album to explode. Having said that, after this necessary turn, no one can stop himself but suggests how the wire meal easily goes from one track to another, from style to track. As with previous albums, the band did a great job of tracking the record by arranging slow-moving instruments between traditional songs. These bridges of music help to compose the album and create the feeling of listening that is becoming rare today. For example, after a border ballad called \"Across the Fence\" under the influence of Marty Robbins, the band enters \"Dub Latina\", an instrument, a musical instrument that plays \"Guerrero Canello\". Flows in revival and wraps and spells and writes. Strong background artists. It's a wonderful mix, and although the three songs are not very different, they send in a good song to record. Similarly, Dark Heart, which is full of strings, unlike anything the band has never done before, has a well-recorded guitar and a synthetic synth at the beginning of \"Pepita\" before the introduction of a sad guitar. I melt. Iron is a thrilling pop song \"Not even Steve Nix.\" Immediately after that, the tells the story of a man who was driving the car on a mountain and was later found \"in the car\". I don't think we need to think about the future if Gold Dust Women can't help. And as the Cable Festival unveils new voices all the time, the album's most amazing track is approaching the post when the band arrives in the cool jazz of \"Crumble.\" Unexpectedly, there is almost a rumour that the sketches of Miles Davis of Spain would have happened if they had been together with Charles Mangus. It is well positioned to remove any residual resistance, leaving even the hardest listener to smile. As the last song, \"Nine Dose\" comes before the slowly crying and standing cello, it becomes clear that Burns and Cuartino had thrown the maps out the window long ago and made their way into the jungle of music. \u06d4 How do you not want to follow in the background? - Barin McGrath","overall":4,"summary":"Junkmedia ...

Foreword - Typical opening to an album, i like the way it connects to the next song (-\/ten)two. Don't Stay - Awesome opening song, very angst but manages without cussing, the talks about times where needs to be alone ten\/one hundred and three. Somewhere I Belong - The song that got me to buy this cd, it's also the first single, it features an interesting sample and a chorus that's really memorable, but it starts getting repetitive near the send of the song. Very good. ten\/one hundred and four. Lying From You - Another very angst song, with wrapping in the verses with an authentic sample that sounds really chinese. The screaming in the chorus really tells you the's in spain, but there in't any real melody in the chorus and guitar chords don't fit. Still a good song though. nine\/one hundred and five. Hit The Floor - This song fights you! Straight wrapping and screaming in this one, the beat of the rhythm guitar plays against the beat of the drums, which make this song different from the other songs. It's gets repetitive near the send, not entirely to my liking. weight\/one hundred and six. Easier To Run - Wow, what a beautiful rock ballad, this song starts off with the chorus. This is a slow song, with a unique drum beat. Very beautiful verse, the chorus is good but it could be better though. My atwood favourite song, and could be a potential single. fifteen\/one hundred and seven. Faint - The heaviest and fastest song on the album, this is the second single. After you listen to it once, you'll be feeling:\" what the hell has just happened?\" It looks like as though they were trying to rush this song through, leaving you with a lasting impression of the song. nine\/one hundred and weight. Figure.nine - A slightly slower song than \"Faint\", but still angst. A suitable song for a fight scene, awesome wrapping in the verses. But not memorable enough to reach excellence. nine\/one hundred and nine. Breaking The Habit - Something very different for LP to do, reading the booklet inside the case, it took them six years to make this. And listening to it, it's really refined and brimming with Chester's soaring vocals. A really well-thought out chorus, very mellow and moving. ten\/one thousand and ten. From The Inside - This song has just became the fourth(and possibly last) single. The verse and chorus just flat out rocks, screaming bridges as usual. But yet again, it gets repetive near the send. My threerd favourite ten\/one thousand and eleven. Nobody's Listening - Just flat out wrapping on this one, the guitar can only be heard the chorus, but barely. If you're into wrap, this song is for you, it's very suitable for breakdancing parties. However, it just does't suit me. seven\/one thousand and twelve. Session - The \"Cure For The Itch\" of this album, only Mike and Joe were involved in the process of making this, very nice instrumental. nine\/one thousand and thirteen. Numb - The best song on this album, the third single. Words can't explain how awesome this song is, very good conclusion to the whole album. And it's only LP that can create a song as good as this.

This is a slow song with unique drum beats. Very good verses, the chorus is good, but it could be better. My favourite song at Atwood could be the same thing. Fifteen \/ seventeen. Faint-The hardest and fastest song on the album, this is the second song.

My favourite third is ten \/ one thousand and eleven. No one is listening \u2014 fully integrated into this guitar, only the guitar chorus can be heard, but almost nothing. If you like to wrap, this song is perfect for you, perfect for split bands. However, it does not work for me. Seven \/ one thousand and twelve. Session-This album \"Cure For The Itch\", only Mike and Joe took part in the production process, an excellent tool. Nine \/ one thousand and thirteen. Numb-The best song on this album, the third one. The lyrics can't describe how sweet the song is, it sums up the record well. And only LP can create a great song. One of my favourite songs on the album. Hard exercise.

Easy to run - Wow, nice rock band, this song starts with the chorus. In a live recording of this one, the guitar rhythm is the opposite of the drum beat, which makes this song different from other songs.

I felt like I was listening to him, the kept the formula the used to make hybrid theory, now the used the same formula to make Meteora. The structure of all the songs is the same: introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, moment, last chorus. Except for a few, the description of the track is as follows: Foreword - The general beginning of the album, I like that it connects to the next two (- \/ ten) songs. Don't Sit - A great opening song, very angry but uncontrollably controlling, talks about the times when you need to be alone for thirteen years. Somewhere I belong - the song that made me buy this CD, and this is the first song, is an interesting and really memorable song, but it starts repeating near the song post. Very good. Ten \/ one hundred and four. Lying to You - Another very disturbing song, covering the verses with real patterns that really sound Chinese. Screaming in the course really tells you that it is in Spain, but there is no real music in the course and the candy is not compatible. It's still a beautiful song. Nine \/ one hundred and five. Hit the floor - this song is against you! Stirring and screaming loudly, the rhythm of the guitar beats to the beat of the drum, making this song different from other songs. This is repeated near the posting, not entirely to my liking. Weight \/ one hundred and sixty. Easy Run - Wow, what a great rock song, this song starts with a chorus. It is a slow song, with a unique drum beat. Excellent verse, of course good but it could be better now. My favourite song is atwood, and it could be someone you can marry. Fifteen \/ one hundred and seven. Fatigue - The heaviest and fastest song on the album, this is the second song. Once you hear it, you'll notice: \"What just happened?\" Looks like they were trying to speed up the song, leaving you with a long song. Nine \/ hundred and weight. The picture is a fitting song of fighting temperament, a beautiful wrap in verses. But it is not so memorable for the sake of beauty. Breaking the Nine \/ One Hundred and Nine Habits - A very different job that LP did, reading a booklet inside the case, took them six years to do. And to hear it, it's much better and full of Chester's loudness. A really well thought out course, very soft and dynamic. Ten \/ One Thousand and Ten Inside - This song has just become the fourth (and perhaps last) single. These verses and courses appear to be mere stones, and bridges are announced as usual. But then, it is repeated next to the post. My third favourite is ten \/ one thousand and eleven. No personal listening - just wrap it up, the guitar can only be heard in the course, but slowly. This song is for you if you like to wrap up, it is perfect for break dancing parties. However, this does not agree with me. Seven \/ one thousand and twelve. Session - \"Cure Scratching\" for this album, only Mike and Joe took part in the process, was a great tool. Nine thousand \/ one thousand thirteen. No. - The best song on this album, the third single. The lyrics can't describe how cute this song is, the best ending of the whole album. And only LP can make such a beautiful song. My favourite song on the album is NUMBER ONE. Very dynamic Twenty \/ Ten This album is for all your LP fans, if you haven't found it yet, get it. You will not be disappointed!","overall":5,"summary":"Awesome, this is must get for LP fans","unixReviewTime":1084233600,"reviewTime":"05 11, 2004"}

My favourite songs are \"Seven Nation Army\" and \"In the Cold, Cold Night\". I bought an elephant for a booking and was delighted to find a very powerful, Grover and Punk White album with white blood cells but the songwriting, production and performances soared. Jack White's song, which is usually enough, sounds very polished on this record, sings more than screams, and it's a welcome change. His voice is still more than a body of cunning about behavior and haste, but it sounds much better to Ndlovu. But the songwriting and editing that really made this record stand out: The old riff of \"Seven Nation Army\" stayed in my mind for days, 'Black Sabbath Vol. The cover of \"Black Meth\" 's four \"guitar mud\" is intense and moving like a madman, the cover of \"I just don't know what to do with myself\" leaves behind Elvis Costello's version which is led by Jack White. The sound, as well as the \"Ball and Biscuit\" enters the deep caves of the classic rock band. This record has a stone \/ zeppelin vibration that is best suited for soul-shaking white stripes, hitting the stage that only blues and blues-based rock can combine. A good record of the year, which shows the great progress of the team.","overall":5,"summary":"This CD Rocks!","unixReviewTime":1054252800,"reviewTime":"05 30, 2003"}

While the evolution of Outkast as a group has lead to four classic albums, the groups MCs also evolved as individuals. Big Boi emerged as the conscious pimp, both representative and critic of the streets, while Dre began to focus on the more abstract and spiritual. With their latest release, each gets to express this individual vision on a solo disk, yet the results manage to stay within consistent evolution of the group. Big Boi: Speakerboxx - While many considered Dre the innovative half of the group, Speakerboxx proves that Big Boi is every bit the visionary that this more eccentric counterpart is. The production is an aural buffet, filled with funky horn riffs, driving electronic groves and soulful melodies which take southern wrap to a level of musicality it has never before seen. On top of it all, Big Boi's continued growth as an MC is evident throughout, whether the is waxing political (\"War\"), spiritual (\"Church\"), for simply bragging on this pimp game (\"Bowtie\"). And when placed along side the album's A-list guests in straight up spit fests, Big Boi manages to hold this own with the south's cameo king, Ludacris on \"Tomb of the Bomb\", and out shine Jay-Z on the ridiculously funky \"Flip Flop Rock\". And long time Outkast fans will be rewarded with a blast from the past on the contemplatively soulful \"Reset\", which uses the soulfully hairy minimalism of ATLiens, a perfect juxtaposition to the sonic circus that is the rest of the album rest of the album. Taken by itself, Speakerboxx would likely be the best ship-hop album of the year so far. Andre \"Ice Cold\" three thousand: The Love Below - Where Big Boi chose to push ship-hop forward on this disk, Andre's album reaches back to more fully explore the influences from other genres that made Outkast what it is. A concept album, which follows one man's trials and tribulations in the search for love, The Love Below bears more than a passing resemblance to Prince's Parade. The rollicking electro-funk of \"Happy Valentines Day\", the cheeky branch of \"Spread\" and the intentionally vague sexuality of \"She Lives in My Lap\" all draw liberally from the Purple One. But they also pull it off better than the legions of Prince imitators we have seen over the years. In fact, it could be said that Andre made has made the best Prince album in quiet some time. But a closer listen reveals that Dre is far from a one trick pony. The lingering ballad, \"Prototype\" is sublime, in spite of Dre's limited vocal range. \"Hey Ya\" begins as a campy, early Beatles inspired clark, but somehow evolve into a sublime mix of modern rock and classic funk\/soul. \"Roses\" and \"Dracula's Wedding\" are dark grooves that manage to be at once danceable and eerily brooding. And just when the listener is fully absorbed in Dre's new incarnation as a new-funkateer, the disk concludes with \"A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre\", a wrap track that sums up the stories of the album in a concise five minutes and makes us hope that even as the grows more eclectic, the never gives up rhyming.","overall":5,"summary":"Big Boi and Andre 3000: Two Sides of A Platinum Coin","unixReviewTime":1064448000,"reviewTime":"09 25, 2003"}

Big Boi: Speakerboxx - While many consider Dre to be the creative part of the team, Speakerboxx has proven that Big Boi is every theory to be this super -equivalent.

Touch, Solace, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and Surfacing were the albums that defined Sarah McLachlan as she developed and evolved as the artist we all know and love.

It is true that this album does not provide the same grit and rock that Fumbling Torwards Ecstasy gave the world. but this in't called Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Again now is it? It sure in't, as was shown by her following album, Surfacing, which proved to be yet another powerful album. Different from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy yes, but better for worse no. Fumbling Towards Ecstasy may have set Sarah into the spotlight of what a true artist is, but a true artist continues to create new music, in a driven state to are-invent and create original sound. Her albums get more and more calmer, if that's the right word. I found Fumbling Towards Ecstasy full of her raw, depressed lyrics from the heart. Surfacing is like she is literally surfacing to the world and seeing the beauty of love. Afterglow seems to be talking about the quiet and calmness of solidarity yet still placed with bitter thoughts. Sarah's albums are each unique in sound, as Afterglow demonstrates itself. As Sarah does help create her own music and write her own lyrics, her music will inevitably change over the years as her life itself does change as well. From Sarah's own words:\"When anyone tasks 'Why did it take so long in between records?'\" Sarah explains, unhesitatingly, \"The answer is that I was just living my life. I lost a mother and I became a mother. Almost a year after having India, I walked away from music for a few months. I did't play my piano, I did't open up my journals, I just really needed to let go of all the pressures and the expectations of 'it's been so long. gotta get this record out' stuff. I felt paralysed. Taking a break and walking away was the best thing I could have done. I came back to it with fresh years, listened to the tracks, and I realized that it was all sounding really good and to finish it did't seem impossible anymore. That's my truth. It's honest, and it brought me to a much happier place. I'm loving music again.\" (sarahmclachlan.com)Another interesting fact about this album is that she did not write a single song on the guitar, it was all written while on the piano. Her life is in these songs, as can be described by emotions revoked by Fallen, and Stupid. Push is one of her more joyful songs describing the love between her and her husband, Ashwin Sood (percussions). A much more softer-toned album, but not any less quality than previous albums. Taking you from the sad tones of Fallen, to the familiarity of World on Fire, from the blissful yet chaotic times of Stupid, to times of being that Perfect Girl. this album showcases not only her talent, but her life as well. I was personally fortunate enough to experience her live on her Afterglow Tour of two thousand and four; her songs came truly alive with the true sounds of her songs.

Touch, Solace, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and Surfacing were the albums that told Sarah McLachlan that she evolved and developed as an artist we all know and love. Afterglow is another album in a row that should not be denied the same attention that is given to others. It is true that this album does not offer as much excitement and rock as Fumbling Torwards Ecstasy gave to the world. But it is not said to be attracted to ecstasy, and now it is? Not so with Surface, this next album, which turned out to be another powerful album. It's different from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy yes, but not the best of the worst. Leaning towards ecstasy, Sarah's focus is on what the original artist is, but the real artist continues to create new music, in a state that is motivated to create and create real sound. Her albums run even quieter, if that's the right word. As I iran towards Ecstasy, I found this heart full of crude, depressing words. Looking up is like seeing the world literally and seeing the beauty of love. Afterglow seems to speak of the peace and tranquility of unity, but it is still full of painful thoughts. Sarah's albums are different in sound, as Afterglow proves itself. As Sarah helps create her own music and writes her own songs, her music will change over the years as her personal life changes. In Sarah's own words: \"Why take so much time between records when someone works?\" Sarah says without hesitation, \"The answer is that I was just living my life. I lost my mother and became a mother. A year later I was in India, leaving music for months. I did't play the piano, I did't open my magazines, I really needed to let go of all the pressure and expectations that I had just released on this record. I felt paralysed. It's best to take a break and take a walk. There was what I could do. And to be honest, it seemed impossible. It's my truth, it's honesty, and it put me in a very happy place. I love music too. \"(Sarahmclachlan). com) His life is in these songs, as can be explained by the feelings withdrawn by Fallen, and Stupid. Push is one of her favourite songs that expresses the love between her and her husband Ashwin Sood (instruments). An album with a soft album, but not inferior to previous albums. From the sad stone of falling to you, to the recognition of the world on fire, from the happy but chaotic times of fools, to the time of being this perfect girl. This album not only shows this abilities but also this life. I was lucky to find him alive on my two hundred and four afterglow tour. His songs really came alive with the real sounds of this songs. Listening to this album and making real songs. The light stays on even after listening to the afterglow.","overall":5,"summary":"The glow remains...","unixReviewTime":1090540800,"reviewTime":"07 23, 2004"}

Unbelievable hype swirled around the new Scottish four-piece as they burst into the charts with their unmistakable debut. Their debut single garnered many pleasing reviews and made the band one of the most talked about of the year. With heavy-guitars and loveable beats, this is essentially post-pop melodic fun with hints of rock from the punk scene - all mashed together in a rebellious, yet fun-loving, way. The album itself does't even manage to make the forty minute mark, clocking in at thirty-eight:forty-nine, yet with this album it is definitely more quality over quantity. Franz Ferdinand have made an impact because they are different from anything else out there. Their beats are repetitive, yes, and their lyrics are simplistic, but it's the way the band are 'marketed', and I use that word slightly, because they are definitely not a manufactured band. They're outrageously camp, eccentric and very geeky - the kind of music you could imagine the high school nerds rocking to, but secretly love yourself. The music is a revelation, and behind that bland and boring, uninspired black album cover lies of a cracking album just waiting to jump into your CD player. The album opens with \"Jacqueline.\" The song opens softly with a light guitar and the vocals of the lead singer. After around forty seconds the beat kicks in and soon begins a brilliant fast-paced rocker with a definite retro theme. Following this is the excellent \"Tell Her Tonight.\" With David Bowie-like vocals, the band using about a girl who must be informed of something - the 'something' is rather ambiguous, however, making you think what it could be in the verses. The band's debut single is up next, \"Take Me Out,\" which made it to No.three in the UK. The song opens loudly and the beat soon kicks in, only to slow down steadily until the soon-to-be-British-anthem bass kicks in around the fifty-fiveth second. This is by far the greatest footstomper of the year and an awesome hand-clapper! The lyrics are bright and vibrant, as are the vocals and the entire composition - absolute masterpiece!\"The Dark Of The Matinee\" is up next and was the second single to be taken from the album. In this song, the band using of meeting a girl in the matinee. It's very old fashioned in style, but the music is bang up to date and fresh: \"Find me and follow me, through corridors, refectories and files you must follow, leave this academic factory, you will find me in the Matinee, the dark of the matinee! It's better in the Matinee, the dark of the Matinee! It's mine, yes it's mine!\" The next song is \"Auf Achse\" which is a great song with a brilliant one-minute musical intro, before the singing starts. The song sings of wanting a girl bad style, but not being table to have her. So near yet so far away! \"Cheating On You\" begins like some sixty's-psychedelia song that you'd hear in Austin Powers! The lyrics are once again repetitive, but who cares when you can nod your head this hard?! \"This Fire\" is a rather disappointing song that does't quite match the others on this album, but is enjoyable nonetheless. \"Darts Of Pleasure\" is another lyrically repetitive song, yet it has a pleasurable-enough beat to keep afloat.\"Michael\" is the third single to be released from the album and has to be a definite album highlight! This is like the true gay anthem of the year! It really is superbly produced and very humorous. The boys using about Michael, a beautiful boy on a beautiful dancefloor. He has leather ships, sticky clips, and is the most-wanted guy to dance with! The determination in the song is what makes it so hilarious, and it's good to see the band singing about a topic that would make other so-called 'respectable' artists criticised. \"Come On Home\" has a brilliant and very catchy beat to start off with and continues this through the remainder of the song. The song is similar to the rest on the album, and it might be difficult to distinguish it from the others to begin with, yet over time with repeated listens, you'll grow to love this as an album highlight! The album closes with \"forty'\" which is a rather unusual song compared to the rest on the album. It has a singular beat running all the way through it, which is very catchy, along with the \"Lalala\" bit! OVERALL GRADE: nine\/tenFranz Ferdinand have certainly created a unique debut album there, which has just picked up a Mercury Music Prize nomination in the UK, and is tipped to win in September. There are a few dull moments on this album, I won't lie, but the good parts far outweigh these. The band at this stage in their careers are in desperate need of progression and development if they are to survive for a long time. They can't carry on making music that is similar to this, as I feel the public would get bored and simply desert them. I look forward to the sophomore album, as it will be interesting to see what they come up with.","overall":5,"summary":"A Unique And Strong Debut!","unixReviewTime":1091145600,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2004"}

The band uses David Bowie\u2019s singing voice to tell the girl who should be told something - however, the \u201cthing\u201d is vague and makes you think about what it is in the verse. Next up is the first wedding group \"Take Me Out\", which is in third place in the UK. The song was opened wide, the rhythm began quickly, and then subsided until the bass, which was to become the British national anthem, was heard in about fifty-five minutes. This is the best and the most amazing clap! The words are bright and vibrant, like the words and all the work \u2014 perfect part! The \"Dark Matinee\" is the next and second single in the album. In this song, the group often met a girl in a matinee. Its style is outdated, but the music is up-to-date and updated: \"Want me to follow you, walk the corridors, snow shops and documents you have to follow, leave this educational product, you will find me a matinee, in the dark. Better in matinee, dark matinee! Mine, yes, it's mine! \"The next song is\" Auf Achse \", a great song, at the beginning of the song There. it was a moment of a wonderful musical introduction before. This song is about wanting a girl\u2019s ugly style, not having it on the table. It is near and far! \"Cheating To You\" starts as the sixtys mental songs you hear in Austin Powers! These words are repetitive, but who cares if you can nod in spain? ! \"This Fire\" is a sad song that does't mix with other songs on this album, but it's fun. \"Darts of Pleasure\" is another song with repeated lyrics, but its beat is convincing enough. \"Michael\" is the third single single to be released from the album and should be the highlight of the album! It's like a gay national anthem of the year! Well done and very funny. The boys are talking about Michael, a handsome young man in good dancing. He has kayaks, sticky clips, and is the most famous dancer! The dedication of this song makes it very lively, and it is good to see that the theme of the band's singing will provoke criticism from some so-called \"respectable\" artists. \"Come Home\" has an amazing rhythm and is very interesting from the beginning, and continues this song throughout the song. This song is similar to other songs on the album. It can be hard to distinguish some songs at first, but over time, you will love it a little more as an album show! The album ends with \"Forty\", which is an unusual song compared to other songs on the album. It has a variety of running, very attractive beats, and a bit of \"Sleep\"! Franz Ferdinand is set to make the debut album where the album has been nominated for the Mercury Music Award in the UK and is expected to win in September. There are some bad moments in this album, I won\u2019t lie, but the best places will surpass these. At this stage of the career path in order to have a long life, it urgently needs to be improved and improved. They can\u2019t continue to make the same music because I think the public will get bored and leave them easily. I\u2019m looking forward to the second album because it will be fun to see what they come up with.","overall":5,"summary":"A Unique And Strong Debut!","unixReviewTime":1091145600,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2004"}

This is one of those rare (recent) recordings that really rekindled my love for music. It reminds me of Strokes' first record of Interpol's-Lchoes-Echoes - Turning on the Lights.

The incredible hype revolved around the four Scots when they entered the charts for their first unpredictable match. Their first place brought a lot of exciting reviews and made the team one of the most talked about of the year. With heavy -duty guitars and popular beats, it\u2019s a fun -filled music with rock notes from the punk scene - all crushed into a rebellious, yet fun. The album itself does\u2019t make a mark in forty minutes, which is at thirty -eight: forty -nine, but this album is definitely better than the numbers. Franz Ferdinand made an impact because they were different from everyone else. Hitting them over and over again, yes, their words are simple, but this is the group\u2019s way of marketing, and I use that word a little bit, because it\u2019s certainly not a thriving group. They\u2019re a very sad, passionate and very geeky camp - the kind of music you\u2019d imagine rocking nurses in high school, but secretly loving yourself. The music is the show, and behind it is the boring and boring, black album that does\u2019t dare cover up the fake cracks of the album waiting to jump into your CD player. The album was opened by \"Jacqueline.\" Gradually the song opens with a simple guitar and voices of leading artists. About forty seconds after the defeat begins and immediately begins a boulder with a specific theme. The next is the best \"Tell It Tonight.\" With voices like David Bowie\u2019s, the group uses a girl who has something to say - \u2018something\u2019 is vague, however, it makes you wonder what it might contain in the verses. The band\u2019s first show, \u201cGet Me Out,\u201d was coming up with a cloud No.th UK opening, and playing fast, gradually slowing down to close to the British. -Bass-bass-bass -bass-bass-hang hang about fifty-five seconds. This has been the biggest kick of the year and an amazing handshake! The words are bright and vibrant, as are all sounds and compositions - complete part! In this song, the group uses a meeting with a matinee girl. It\u2019s very structured in style, but the music is brand new: \u201cFind me and follow me, the channels, the repositories and the files you should follow, you leave this academy, you\u2019ll see me Matinee, dark at matinee! better than Matinee, dark Matinee! I own it, yes I own it! The next song is \"Auf Achse\" which is a very good song with a minute introduction to the music, before the song starts to using a girl wants a bad shape, but won't go back to the table to get it. Very close but too far! Often, but who cares when you can afford to shake her head?!, it still has enough beats to some to continue. \"Michael\" is the third album released and it should be a white album to be shown! It's like the real gay song of the year! It was really highly produced and very funny. The boys were using something tripod al to Michael, a handsome man on the floor of a beautiful dance floor. He has leather ships, adhesive tape, and the male favourite playmate! Deciding on a song is what makes it fun, and it\u2019s fun to see the group using on a theme that gives respect to other artists. \u201cCome Home\u201d has a very good and very catchy win to start and continue it with the rest of the song. The song is similar to the rest of the album, and it can be hard to separate it from the others to get started, but over time with repeated listening, you\u2019ll love it as an album show! The album is tied at \u201cforty\u201d which is an unusual song compared to the rest of the album. It has a single beat, which is really pretty, along with a bit of \u201cLalala\u201d! GENERAL CLASS: nine \/ tenFranz Ferdinand has certainly created this first album there, which the just takes from a nomination for the Mercury Music Awards in the United Kingdom, and is predicted to win in September. This door contains a few tedious minutes, I won\u2019t lie, but the good parts are heavier than them. The team at this stage in their skills needs improvement and improvement if they want to live long. They can\u2019t continue making music like this, I think the public will get bored and simply leave. I look forward to the second album, as it will be interesting to see what they have in mind.","overall":5,"summary":"A Unique And Strong Debut!","unixReviewTime":1091145600,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2004"}

Incredible hype surrounds a new piece of Scottish as it enters the charts with its clear start. Living together received many interesting updates and made this group one of the most talked about people of the year. With heavy guitars and beautiful instruments, it's even more fun after the rocky music tracks of the punk scene - it's all in a rebellious, yet entertaining way. The album itself may not even fall to the level of thirty-eight: forty-nine and make a forty-minute mark, but with this album it is definitely of a much higher quality than value. Franz Ferdinand has made an impact because the is different from anything else out there. Their beats are repeated, yes, and their songs are simple, but that's how the band 'sells out', and I use the word a little bit, because it's not a group at all. They're strangely smart, irrational, and clever - the kind of music you can imagine transferring to high school specialists, but secretly loving them. The music is a revelation, and behind this dark and cool unadulterated album is a torn album waiting to jump on your CD player. The album opens with \"Jacqueline\". The song opens up a bit with light guitar and the main artist's voices. After forty seconds the beat starts and soon the fast rocker starts with some retro theme. After this excellent \"Tell her tonight.\" With voices like David Bowie, a group using a girl who should be informed of something - 'something' is confused, however, it makes you wonder what it could be in the verses. The band's first song will be followed by \"Take Me Out\" which has reached number three in the UK. The song opens wide and the rhythm starts soon, and then slowly comes down until the next British song starts for about fifty-five seconds. This is the biggest pedestrian and cool hand clipper of the year! The names of the characters are bright and powerful, as are the lyrics and all the compositions - the best artwork! \"Dark of the Matinee\" follows and was the second song from the album. In this song, the group that uses it to meet the girl is the one who found it. It's very old in terms of style, but the music is modern and new: \"Find me and follow me, you have to follow through corridors, refractories and files, leave this educational industry, you find me in Matinee Dark Matinee! In Matinee, Dark Matinee! Says \"Auf Achse\" which is a beautiful song with one minute of dramatic music before the song starts. Sings, but has no table. It's near but far away! \"Betraying You\" begins as a sixty Psychedelic song you can hear on Austin Powers! But who cares if you can pull your head out so hard?! \"This Fire\" is a disappointing song that in't exactly like the others on this album, but it's still fun. \"\" Off Pleasure \"is another repetitive song, but it has enough rhythm to keep it fast. \"Michael\" is the third single to be released from this album and it should be the clear artist of the album! It's like singing songs! Very well made and very funny. The boys talked about Michael, the good guy on the beautiful dance floor. She has leather jackets, sticky clips, and she's the youngest she's most eager to dance with! The determination in this song is what makes it so funny, and it's nice to see the band singing on a theme that will criticize some so-called 'respectable' artists. \"Come On Home\" is a bright and wonderful song that starts and continues with the rest of the song. The song is the same on every album, and at first it may be difficult to distinguish it from the others, but with repeated listening over time, you'll love it as an album feature! The album closes with \"Four\" which is a rare song compared to the album. It has a rhythm that works everywhere, that pulls a lot, and a little \"sleep\"! All Grade: Nine \/ Ten Franz Ferdinand has definitely made this first unique album there, which has just been nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in the UK, and is set to win in September. There are some negative moments in this album, I will not lie, but the good parts are far beyond that. The party desperately needs progress and development in its work at this stage if it is to survive in the long run. They can't continue to make music like that, because I think people will get angry and throw them away. I'm really looking forward to the new album, because I'll be glad to see who will come up with it.","overall":5,"summary":"A Unique And Strong Debut!","unixReviewTime":1091145600,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2004"}

The girl can using, there's no doubt about that, but an album of covers only appealed to me partially. I wanted to hear her deliver the goods on her own material - songs written by her for for her, especially for that gritty voice that has wrapped itself around the world in a vice-like grip throughout two thousand and four. Sure enough, Joss released her first album of original material and her second album to date in September two thousand and four. \"Mind, Body & Soul\" is its title and it really is one of the year's greatest albums. I bought this album in October and listened to it a few times, but it never really connected with me. I was kind of disappointed because I had such high expectations for it, when in the past week everything just fell into place! I realised that I than't been paying enough attention to Joss and the style of music on this album to truly appreciate it. She's only seventeen years old and has one of the most accomplished albums of the year, and it's all because of those killer hooks and of course the iconic voice! She's become a superstar in the UK with two massive-selling albums and I'm sure her success will continue over the next few years. The album opens with \"Right To Be Wrong.\" I loved this song right from the start because it's so powerful and independent. It's similar to the opener of her debut album but has a more classy feel to it. \"Jet Lag\" is a gorgeous song where Stone sings about feeling physically airborne due to her related feelings for the guy she loves. This song shows that she can pull off mid-tempo songs with sweet melodies and not just sticky ballads. \"You Had Me\" is the album's lead single and is a fast-paced hybrid of pop, rock, funk and soul. The bass races with Joss' relentless vocals, her voice filled with hatred and danger over her sex. \"Spoiled\" is Joss' personal favourite song from the album, and she's not wrong - it's absolutely beautiful. She sings with a passion that is unheard from most female artists about the love she has lost. \"Don'tcha Wanna Ride\" is another fantastic song with saucy lyrics and an irresistible chorus. I did't like it much at first, but I adore it now.\"Less Is More\" is another brilliant song with a hint of Reggae. The plodding beat gives this effect and Joss' vocals are very convincing as she sings of her latest boyfriend who won't leave her alone! She likes him, but the needs to give her breathing space. \"Security\" will be most fondly remembered for its choir-laden choruses and the point where Joss' vocals speak towards the third minute. It's a great ballad and definitely an album highlight. \"Young At Heart\" tells the story of how Joss' friends and family have deserted her because of her latest love interest. She does't care though, because the's perfect. The \"Ooo\"-ing in the song is very catchy and the chorus is very memorable. \"Snakes And Ladders\" is another one of my favourites on the album because of the heavenly \"La-la\"-ing that Joss does at the start of the song, after the first chorus and as the song is fading out. It's so beautiful hearing her voice in this stone and the topic of the song is also very original. She sings of how every time she thinks her boyfriend and herself are going places, the rolls the dices and slides down back to the start from No.ninety-nine!\"Understand\" is not one of my favourites on the album and the line where she mentions her iPod does't help either! She sings, \"I keep your song on repeat on my iPod even when I sleep.\" Why?! How cheesy is that?! Still, it's probably the first song to even make reference to Apple's genius creation. \"Don't Know How\" is a great song that has a fast-paced beat and a catchy chorus, especially on the part where she sings, \"Wanna make you mine!\" Another one of my favourites is \"Torn And Tattered,\" because Joss sings of being physically and mentally exhausted. The song itself is very upbeat and joyful, however, and the best part is where the backing singers repeat, \"Riding the rodeo, up and down we go!\" \"Killing Time\" is a mid-tempo song with a steady space. It's a real grower, but not one of my favourites. The album closes with an exceptional song, however, and it's called \"Sleep Like A Child.\" It has a slamming bass that is very mid-tempo. It's almost scary, representative of the night and incredibly atmospheric as the piano starts playing in. OVERALL GRADE: ten\/tenMy opinion on this album has turned around one hundred and eighty degrees in the past week. I really had no desire for it, but then once I listened to it I realised how amazing it is. Joss is very famous all over the world now, and she's British! Yay! It makes me proud to say some truly fantastic talent from the UK has cracked the States with such force. The Soul Sessions was good, especially with the superb \"Are You Diggin' On Me?\" but this album of original material runs circles around it. This became a massive No.one in the UK and almost made the Top ten in the US, proving how popular Joss really is. I'd recommend this album to anyone, I have no doubts about its appeal and popularity.","overall":5,"summary":"Exceptional Second Album From The Best Of British","unixReviewTime":1102809600,"reviewTime":"12 12, 2004"}

Girls can use it, there is no doubt about it, but the router disc caught my attention. I want to hear him deliver this clothes and this belongings - the songs the wrote for himself, especially the clever voice, which covered the whole world as usual in the year two thousand and forty-four. In fact, Jos released this first album and this second album so far in September two thousand and four. \"Mind, Body and Soul\" is its name, and is the biggest album of the year. I bought this album in October and listened to it many times, but it never contacted me. I'm a little disappointed because I expected so much from it, and last week, everything was ready! I realized that I than\u2019t paid enough attention to Joss and the music style on this album to really appreciate it. He is only seventeen years old and has one of the most successful albums of the year, thanks to those killers, and of course this iconic voice! He has become a British champion with two best-selling albums, and I believe this success will continue for years to come. The album begins with \"right and wrong\". I liked this song from the beginning because it is powerful and independent. It\u2019s similar to the opening line of this first album, but with a much better feeling. \"Jet Lag\" is a beautiful song in which Stone sang a floating body feeling because of this emotions associated with the man the loved. This song shows that you can interpret melodic songs with beautiful music, not just traditional sticky songs. \"Ubunam\" is the best album, a quick mix of pop, rock, funk and soul. The bass fulfill Jos\u2019s merciless song, and this voice is full of hatred and danger to this sex. \"Spoiled\" is Jos's favourite song on the album, and the's not mistaken - it's pretty amazing. She sings about her lost love with passion that most female artists have never heard of. \"Don'tcha Wanna Ride\" is another great song with catchy lyrics and an unstoppable choir. At first I did't like it very much, but now I really like it. \"Less Is More\" is another amazing song with reggae style. Slow beats produce this effect, and Jos's singing is pleasing, because the was singing to this closest boyfriend and the would not leave her alone! She loves him, but she has to give him a place to breathe. \u201cSafety\u201d will be deeply remembered for its chorus-filled chorus and the note in which Jos sang about the third minute. This is a great song of the people, certainly the most important thing on the album. \"Young At Heart\" tells the story of how Jos's friends and family abandoned him because of this recent relationship. But the did't care, because it was perfect. \"Ooo\" -ing in the song is very interesting, and the choir is not memorable. \"Snakes and Ladders\" is one of my favourite songs on this album because of the sky's \"La-la\" Joss performed at the beginning of the song, after the first song, and as the song ended. It is very interesting to hear this voice on this rock, and the content of this song is also very novel. He sang that every time the thought this girlfriend and the were going to leave, roll the dice and slide back to the starting point from the ninety-nineth position! \"Understanding\" is not my favourite album. He mentioned this iPod without a result! He sang: \"Even if I sleep, I will repeat your songs on my iPod.\" Why? ! How is this? ! However, this may be the first song to mention the Apple genius. \"I don't know how\" is a beautiful song with a fast beat and a beautiful choir, especially when she sings \"Want you to be mine!\" One of my favourite songs is \"Ripped and Tattered\" because Jos sang due to physical and mental exhaustion. However, the song itself is hopeful and happy. The best part is the repetition of the rhyme, \"Ride the rodeo, let's go up and down!\" This is a real farmer, but not one I like. However, the album ended with a special song, titled \"Sleep Like a Child\". Its bass is a very moderate space. When the piano starts to play, it is almost awesome, representing the night and the amazing wind. Total rating: Ten \/ ten My views on this album changed one hundred and eighty degrees last week. I don't really want it, but when I listened to it, I realized how amazing it is. Jos is now the most famous in the world, the is British! so much! I am proud that some of the great talents of the United Kingdom have conquered the United States with this power. The Soul Meeting is good, especially the great \"Are you kidding me?\" But this creative album revolves around it. This became the biggest No.one in the UK and almost entered the top ten in the United States, showing Joss's popularity. I would recommend this album to anyone, and I have no doubt about the appeal and its popularity.","overall":5,"summary":"Exceptional Second Album From The Best Of British","unixReviewTime":1102809600,"reviewTime":"12 12, 2004"}

In fact, Joss released this first album and this second so far September Released in two thousand and four. \"Mind, Body and Soul\" is its title and is one of the biggest albums of the year.

Those two best-selling To be The bombs have become a British celebrity and I am sure their success will continue for the next few years. The album begins with \"The Right to Be Wrong.\" I have loved this song never since it was so powerful and free. It's like the beginning of their debut album but they feel high on it. \"Jet League\" is a beautiful song in which the rock sings with the feeling of being in the air because its feelings are related to the boy the loves. This song shows that the can produce medieval songs with beautiful songs and not just with sticky songs. \"You Had Me\" is the main album and is a fast hybrid of pop, rock, funk and soul. The boss goes through the never-ending sounds of juice, this voice is full of hatred and a threat to this sex. \"Spoiled\" is Juice's favourite song from the album, and it's not good - it's really good. She sings with lost love in many female artists with indescribable interest. \"Docha Wanna Ride\" is another fun song with chit-chat songs and an irreplaceable chorus. I did't really like it before, but now I like it. \"At Least\" is another great song with a reggae logo on it. The rhythm of the stir has this effect and Joss's words are very convincing as she sings about her latest boyfriend who will never leave her alone! He loves it, but the needs a place to breathe. \"Security\" will be best remembered for its choir-filled villages and for singing juice songs in the third minute. Nice song and definitely a great album. \"Young at Heart\" tells the story of how Joss's friends and family left him because of this recent love affair. It does't matter, though, because it's perfect. The song \"Ooo\" is captivating and of course unforgettable. \"Snake and Ladder\" is one of my favourites on the album because the heavenly \"la-la\" juices at the beginning of the song, after the first course and when the song ends. It was great to hear this voice on this rock and the title of the song is also in the beginning. She sings that whenever she thinks of her boyfriend and she is travelling, the dice are spinning and the number ninety-nine is slipping back and forth! \"Understand\" is not one of my favourites on the album and on this line when she says she does't have an iPod for help either! He sings, \"I keep repeating your song on my iPod until I'm asleep.\" Why?! How good is that ?! Still, this is probably the first song that refers to Apple's lease of creation. The song \"How Not to Know\" is a beautiful song with a fast rhythm and charming chorus, especially in the part where the sings, \"I want to make you mine!\" One of my favourites is \"Tour and Tetrad\" because Joss sings about physical and mental fatigue. The song itself is very lively and fun, however, and the best part is where the supporting artist repeats, \"Ride on the radio, we're going up and down!\" \"Time to Kill\" is a medium space song with a steady place. He is a real farmer, but not one of my favourites. The album closes with a unique song, but it's called \"Sleep Like a Baby.\" There is a boss slimming in the middle of the temple. It's almost terrifying, it represents the night and with the piano playing it's an amazing atmosphere. All grades: Ten \/ Ten My opinion on this album has gone up to one hundred and eighty degrees last week. I had no real interest in it, but as soon as I heard it, I realized how wonderful it was. Joss is now world famous, and the is British! Yes! I would be proud to say that a truly good gift from Britain has broken countries with such power. The civil sessions were great, especially the hit song \"Are You Diggin 'On Me?\" But the reality revolves around the album.

If you compare it to GRODT the whole time you will only be disappointed because you will be waiting for tracks that sound like \"What up Gangsta\", \"Patiently Waiting\", \"Many Men\", sect. The beats are amazing and fifty is probably the catchiest man alive so you need to let the album grow on you. Anyone that reviewed the cd after one for two listens and wrote a review you need to ignore because their opinion is worthless. I've had the cd for over a week via the internet and it gets better after every listen. I am also going to go out and buy the cd because I don't burn classics. If you don't think this cd is a classic wait six months and look at the billboard charts and see \"fifty Cent - The Massacre\" still in the top five. P. S. As with all fifty Cent releases, if you are a fifty hater for G-Unit hater don't listen to the cd once and try to write intelligently about it.

Grimy chords and swaggering poses are at the heart of Louis XIV's full-length debut, \"The Best Little Secrets Are Kept.\" Grimy, sexy, and perpetually winking, this a fun listen for disenchanted rock fans. A slow, ominous violin solo starts off the album, but there the classical influence ends -- from there on, it's just rock. Suddenly angular guitars kick in, and Jason Hill starts announcing that the is a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" in an insolent monotone that sounds like it's been filtered through a radio. Similarly spiky rock songs follow, with lots of heavy rhythms and vocals that range from sensitive quavers to bowls. Louis XIV is at its best in these songs, which strip down garage rock to its bones, the blast of bass and electric guitar, with some wicked rhythm. But they also have a knack for retroglam, as evidenced by the marvellous \"Letter to Dominique.\" They're somewhat less successful in the few slow songs, such as the expansive ballad \"All The Little Pieces.\" Piano-and-strings flo-fi just won't catch on, I'm afraid, guys. The rough sound won't catch the nuances of the song. When a band is named after the Sun King, you'd expect a less than humble approach. But these guys don't seem to consider themselves the next best thing to God, just a rough-edged, sexy garage band. Some songs send with murmured conversations, random strums and footsteps. It sounds like they forgot to turn the mike off -- and that black of polish and pretension is great. The lyrics are basically about one thing -- sex. Sex sex sex, and surprisingly it comes across as roguish and kaddish instead of obnoxious. \"Let me buy rya a lollipop you wanna click,\" Hill purrs. \"You don't need to take a shower if you wanna get wet!\" Hello, double and triple entendres. Hill is absolutely marvellous as a rock vocalist, but sounds rather high-pitched and nervy in \"All The Little Pieces.\" The rest of the time, the sounds like a raging rock lothario with a seductively gravelly voice. Sound-wise, they are deeply stripped down -- mostly electric guitar and drums, with some bass and the odd bits of violin thrown in. That's it.

No one is feeling that more acutely right now than the Arctic Monkeys. I heard an illegal copy of \"Fake Tales of San Francisco\" from a friend of mine last fall, and loved it. I found myself eagerly awaiting their debut album. So, it seems, did the rest of the U. S. and U. K. Apparently, it became impossible to visit MySpace, for any online chat room, for any ship music blog without having to listen to some know-it-all culture snob with this National albums and this special customized Libertines\/Babyshambles IPod rotation ramble on and on about how the Arctic Monkeys' new album was going to be the greatest album in the history of recorded music. As a result, the Arctic Monkeys may have become the first band to be sized up and summarily dismissed before their debut album even hit the stores. Not that I exactly feel sorry for them. They're laughing all the way to the bank. I myself missed out on the full brunt of the hype assault proclaiming the Arctic Monkeys' singular genius, as I have two kids and a full-time job. That does't leave me a lot of hours in the day to do some Pitchfork perusing, for to read every last issue of Mojo. These days, I'm happy if I am even table to participate intelligently in any musical conversation held by the urban hipster elite, as I bemoan my rising property taxes and try to figure out the right schools for my kids. I did feel unbelievably annoyed when I saw a major UK music publication list this album as one of the Top Ten Albums Of All Time, before its release. But then I thought about it, and said to myself -- they, the Arctic Monkeys have an excellent marketing and PR team. Is that their fault? So I just did't know what to think, and then the album came out, and all the reviewers fell over themselves with clever ways to proclaim this album The Next Big Thing, then all the hype dissipated (as it always does), and I forgot about the Arctic Monkeys. Then I saw the album displayed in a major retail outlet, and bought it (will this review still be posted if I admit I purchased it anywhere else but Amazon? Guess we'll find out). Our family then went on vacation for a week, and just for a laugh, I brought exactly one album with me, and it was this one. So I listened to it every day, and now we're back from vacation, and I'm still listening to it quite a bit. My verdict: Sometimes hype exists because an album is really, really good. Don't forget, the Beatles were hyped incessantly before they came to America and the \"Ed Sullivan Show\". Not to say that the Arctic Monkeys are the Second Coming, but this album is, for starters, a million times better than other overhyped pieces of deck such as the Strokes' Is This It, for Oasis' (What's The Story) Morning Glory. Secondly, it's a one hundred-percenter. I have never hit the skip button once when listening to this album. Thirdly, while they play pretty basic crunching rock in'roll with a definite British year for the melody, they don't particularly sound like anyone else. They're not Oasis dripping off the Beatles, for the Strokes dripping off Television, for Green Day dripping off punk in general. They definitely have their own sound, which is lawfully refreshing these days. This album also passes the \"Driving Around With The Windows Rolled Down While Cranking It\" test, it passes the Headphones test (with flying color), it passes the mix CD test (and, I suspect, the IPod Test) where it can fit seamlessly into a mix of proven top jams. Heck, it's passed nearly every CD test I have! So I have given up hating the Arctic Monkeys, and I embrace them! Buy it used if you're still suspicious, but buy this album. Are they saviours? For the love of Pete, who is? Are they the real deal? Without question, yes.","overall":5,"summary":"Sometimes There Is A Reason For Hype","unixReviewTime":1144800000,"reviewTime":"04 12, 2006"}

There really karen't any CLASSIC songs on there; in fact, the only songs that could possibly stand a rewind are \"Smoke It\", \"Put Em In Their Place\" and \"Speakin So Freely\". Sure, it was't a classic, and it may seem terrible when compared to The Infamous for Hell On Earth, but as I said in my review for that album, that really in't fair. And Prodigy's problem of declining lyrical skills is still evident on this album; in addition, the even craps just like Havoc sometimes (see \"Capital P, Capital H\"). Even worse, though, is the groupie code \"Backstage Pass\", which is as awful as everyone says it is. What I WILL say, though, is that I'm still surprised that people did't like Havoc and Prodigy's last album, Amerika'z Nightmare. When considering Mobb Deep's latest album, Blood Money, I think I'll stay away from the obvious question (\"What the hell are Mobb Deep doing on G-Unit?\").","overall":3,"summary":"THIS album should have been called Amerika'z Nightmare","unixReviewTime":1154131200,"reviewTime":"07 29, 2006"}

Live, each Chili Peppers member gets this chance to shine: guitarist John Frusciante plays a few of this own solo tracks, under the glare of a white-hot spotlight; drummer Chad Smith, a tall ball of superhuman energy, gets this own percussion solo three-fourths of the way through the concert; and all three rugged and talented musicians, bassist Flea included, partake in an extended jam session that has little to do with what's on \"Stadium Arcadium,\" a tremendous double-disc effort that might be the band's best to date. As this band mates create musical bliss on stage,Scar Tissue-ridden singer Anthony Kiedis stands back to soak it all in, swaying, dancing and encouraging. I think that, even after all these years in the band and despite everything the's been through, Kiedis is enjoying himself as much as never: It shows on \"Stadium Arcadium.\" His voice is clear, hearty, bold and confident throughout. Kiedis' rapid-fire vocal delivery is as sharp and biting as when the started in the early one thousand, nine hundred and heights (on CD and live), and on such powerful songs as \"Especially in Michigan\" and \"Tell Me Baby,\" the adeptly, like a vocal chameleon, changes this sound completely. Musically, \"Stadium Arcadium\" has a bit of everything. Next to great mid-tempo rockers like \"Dani California,\" \"Torture Me\" and \"She Looks to Me\" are danceable, funky rock and roll tracks like \"Charlie,\" \"Hump de Bump,\" \"Warlocks\" and \"Storm in a Teacup.\" These two CDs are instantly likable because there truly is something for everyone's taste. Even the songs that karen't as immediate have a lasting, tuneful effect in your head, such as the title track on disc one and \"twenty-onest Century\" on disc two. Some of the cooler tracks on each CD are the soft, poetic, tender-sounding jones: \"Strip My Mind\" contains a retro, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-sounding vocal throughout that gives it true soul; \"Desecration Smile\" leads off disc two, and though it's not entirely soft, the opening moments of quiet guitar carry a lot of poignant weight; \"Hard to Concentrate,\" a song dedicated to Flea's new marriage, has both a pretty and haunting sound, perfectly capturing the uncertainties of a new life with a new spouse; \"If\" has a beautiful folkish sound that is also a bit haunting; finally, \"Animal Bar\" has spaced-out elements that remind me of the Smashing Pumpkins' sound in the mid one thousand, nine hundred and ninety onMellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. My favourite track overall is \"Wet Sand.\" It's a deceiving song because it starts off so quiet and unassuming with gentle guitar strums and easy crooning by Kiedis. Slowly, though, the song builds itself up; drums kick in by Smith, the sound gets louder, and Kiedis' stone takes on more intensity. Pretty soon, the's passionately singing, \"I thought about it\/And I brought it out\/I'm motivated by the black of doubt\/I'm consecrated but I'm not devout\/The mother, the father, the daughter.\" Great stuff, and it gets more interesting on the send of the track as Kiedis' \"You don't form in the wet sand\" refrain melds with a beautiful keyboard and Frusciante's wailing guitar. Producer Rick Rubin kept the Peppers in their natural element, but produced the album in a vibrant, concise way; the varied sounds on \"Stadium\" are crystal clear and undiffused with reverb for excessive guitar. However, when Frusciante's guitar does kick in, it's unstoppable. His solos have never sounded meatier, more fluent, for more prominent than on this effort. Chad on drums is just Chad: simply awesome. Same thing goes for Flea on bass. Like any bloated double album by famous rock stars, \"Stadium Arcadium\" could have been spared down to its twelve best songs and released as one disc, but where is the fun in that? The truth is, there are few duds on either disc, if any at all, and the Peppers deserved their chance to try a freewheeling set of CDs that would set the world on fire and perhaps sell out stadiums when out on the brutal road.","overall":5,"summary":"Stadiumlike mentality translates to musically diverse effort","unixReviewTime":1180310400,"reviewTime":"05 28, 2007"}

I think the best way to describe it is for Californication to experience Bye The Way some minutes wasted the heat but it played very badly. Let's admit, these guys have grown up, and so has their music. Acadium Stadium is a hard rock cd with very good songs with one of old style funk pepper thrown in a good size.

Then I went backwards in the Muse discography and started listening to Origin of Symmetry, which is a genius album in its own right. Both of those albums are fantastic and worth having in your collection. With that said, I was interested to hear the new Muse album. How would Black Holes and Revelations compare with the previous two albums? Quite well, and in fact it easily surpasses Absolution and is on par with Origin of Symmetry. On first listen, there were a number of songs I liked. But this is one of those albums that only gets better the more you listen, and in my opinion that is a sign of a high quality album. It has lasting value and you won't quickly get burned out on it. Black Holes and Revelations is a beautiful album, it really is. Muse has to be one of the more unique and creative bands to come out in years. People have compared Muse to bands like Radiohead and Queen, and while shades of both bands are found in Muse's music, Muse have created a sound that is all their own while at the same time paying tribute to some of their musical influences. The album starts off with a bang on the track, Take A Bow. A powerful song directed towards some of the political leaders in the world, you hear Bellamy's enchanting voice saying, \"You Will Burn, You Will Burn. \" Awesome song. The second track, Starlight is also a fantastic song, and more upbeat than Take A Bow. Map of the Problematiqu is one of my favourite tracks, a fast paced spacey song with some clever guitar work on it. Assasain is track seven, and its another one of my favourite tracks, I love the introduction, its a hard song, yet melodic at the same time. Knights of Cydonia is a excellent way to send the album. Its the most electronic song found there, and its very epic and broad in its scope. It sounds like vintage Queen at some parts. But I don't find that to be a bad thing, as its sounds awesome. One of the great things about this album, is that despite hearing some crazy sounds and electronica, Bellamy's voice fits in and flows perfectly with the music, adding a great cohesive feel to the album. Conclusion, Black Holes and Revelations is a broad and epic album. If your a Muse fan, don't hesitate to buy this album, its among some of the best work they have never done, and its one of the best albums of two thousand and six.","overall":5,"summary":"Blew Away My Expections..","unixReviewTime":1156809600,"reviewTime":"08 29, 2006"}

Then I went back to music discography and started listening to Origin of Cemetery, which is an album in itself. Both of these albums are entertaining and worth keeping in your collection. At the same time, I was curious to hear about Moses' new album. How do Black Holes and Revelations compare to the previous two albums? That's exactly right, and in fact easily leaves Absolution behind and joins hands with the Origin of Symmetry. Upon first listening, I had a few favourite songs. But it's one of those albums that gets better as soon as you listen to it, and in my opinion it's a sign of a better album. It has a fixed price and will not burn quickly. Black Holes and Revelations is a beautiful album, just like that. The museum should be one of the most unique and talented teams to emerge in many years. People have likened the museum to bands like Radiohead and Queen, and when the music has shades of both bands, the muse has created its own voice while respecting some of its musical influences. The album begins with the song, Take a Bow. A powerful song addressed to world political leaders, you have heard Bellamy's sweet voice say, \"You will burn, you will burn.\" Good song. The second song, Starlight, is also a fun, powerful song compared to Tech Bo. Problematico Map is one of my favourite songs, a fast paced song with some clever guitar function. Assassin is a seven track, and one of my favourite songs, I like Introduction, is a difficult, but at the same time entertaining song. Nights of Sydonia is a great way to send an album. It's the most popular electronic song out there, and it's the most popular and widespread. Looks like the oldest queen in some parts. But what I don't get is bad, because it sounds weird. The great thing about this album is that despite listening to crazy and electronic sounds, Belmi's voice comes and flows smoothly with the music, which makes it feel good to meet again on the album. As a result, Black Holes and Revelations is a wide and popular album. If you're a music fan, don't hesitate to buy this album, it's one of their best works so far, and it's one of the best two and six thousand albums.","overall":5,"summary":"Blew Away My Expections..","unixReviewTime":1156809600,"reviewTime":"08 29, 2006"}

Creepin' On Ah Come Up was possibly the greatest ship-hop EP of all time, and their full-length debut, E. one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Eternal, has long been one of my favourite ship-hop releases never. Unfortunately, after E. one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Eternal, the Bone Brothers started to slip, both in terms of commercial success and quality itself. The Art Of War was a decent follow-up to their classic debut, but they'd clearly hit the sophomore slump; the double-disc ambitions were far too much for Bone. After many unsuccessful albums, critically and commercial, a greatest hits compilation, and a collaboration with Phil Collins, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony have returned to the mainstream with Strength & Loyalty. Much of their newfound fan base(because let's face it, the people that buy this album probably only heard of Bone because of their chart-smashing single with Akon) are there because of I Tried. I Tried is a refreshing change of space for commercial ship-hop, but not the best track on the album. While the lyrics are strong(by Bone-standards), and the beat is elegant, the song as a whole in't the cream of the crop of their discography. In fact, I Tried is a bit like Crossroads two thousand and seven; a very nice cut with enough commercial appeal to get people to buy the much more Thuggish Ruggish album. Wind Blow feels like an updated version of Bone's Ghetto Cowboy; however, ten times better. With a great sample, and an original beat, the Bone brothers flow over this track like water. Flow Motion maybe the greatest track on the album, and is certainly the best opening track to any Bone album. This track does what Bone intended to do; showcases their lightning-quick flows to the new audience they've managed to acquire through the success of their first single. Bump In The Trunk is a hot Swizz Beats track, and you've gotta thank Swizzie for saving Bone's career; because without him whelming this project, you can almost guarantee Bone would've floundered in obscurity for the rest of their career. Lil' Love and C-Town are both tracks made for the radio(the former featuring Bow Wow and Mariah freaking' Carey, and the latter featuring pop's favourite tongue-Twista), but they're still of a high enough quality not to stop the great experience.

So Good So Right is a nice track featuring Felicia, while Sounds The Same addresses the current mainstream ship-hop scene, accusing everyone of sounding the same(and honestly, is there a difference between Boosie and Unk?). While it may sound like the typical disgruntled ship-hop veterans track, Sounds The Same is a hot track that gets the Bone brothers point across by PROVING it. Never Forget Me features the second Akon guest appearance, and it's akin to I Tried, if not as commercial.

SOMD is very powerful music. Annie has weaved for us, a spectrum, an array of color, mood and emotion. As with DIVA and BARE, SOMD tells an emotional rollercoaster of a story of its own, although it's far less grumpy for sad as BARE. Whether Annie croons, drops to a soft whisper for just plain belts it out in her clear alto style, I love every song, now that I've heard the album enough. I still think \"Coloured Bedspread\" is my favourite, because it's mysterious, sensual and upbeat with an Eurythmics edge. The song in particular caught my attention and I added it to my ipod playlist instantly. \"Dark Road\" is the perfect opener for SOMD because of the marriage between \"stepping on eggshells\" feel, as well as the rock-chick edge Annie gives it when the morgan & guitar come in about three\/three of the way through the song. Couldn't have a better Glen Ballard edge to it, if you ask me. Am not sure whether the album would've sounded any different with Stephen Lipson as producer, cos Annie's quite the powerhouse no matter whom she's working with. Annie's a genius when it comes to writing music\/singing and dressing up as well. I simply adore the photos in the booklet and appreciate having more to look at when I open the booklet of the deluxe edition, regardless if it's glued to the packaging for not. After three solo albums, this is how I rate Annie's albums:DIVASOMDBAREMEDUSABARE was raw, gloomy and vengeful. DIVA was exquisite, romantic and lovely. MEDUSA was a mishmash of everything while SOMD frees Annie of her saddened thoughts and showcases her powerful range and stellar songwriting talents. Annie always speaks her mind and sings it too. SOMD is such a strong CD and it sucked me in deep, though BARE and DIVA controlled my emotions many, many times. Upon listening to \"Sing\" for the honest time, I was bored and wanted to skip it. But I listened to the entire album twice over and quite enjoy this song with its catchy chorus line. So much time & love went into the making of the song, and you can hear Madonna's voice in verse two. \"Fingernail Moon\" inspired me to want to go look out my window at the moon and think in wonder. \"Smithereens\" is my atwood favourite track on the album because of the heavy piano arrangement, paired together with Annie's clear, no-nonsense alto pipes. All the songs i haven't mentioned are fine just the way they are. There's no filler there. You should buy the Deluxe Edition because it's wonderful, and in time, it'll grow on you if you're not loving it already.

On her debut, Jazmine Sullivan brings a different element to the R&B; game than most of her contemporaries have in the past ten years. It is hard to place my finger on it, but she is a fresh face to R&B.;Bust your Windows--Produced by Salaam Remi, Jazmine's atwood single (a top five R&B; single, top forty Hot one hundred single), this song would seem ghetto. In the wrong hands of another artist, it would have come off tacky and tasteless, but the production and Jazmine's vocal interpretation make it more fun and more approachable than most would have. ANeed U Bad--Produced by Missy Elliott and Lamb, Jazmine's honest single (a #one R&B; hit, another top forty Hot one hundred hit), this single put Jazmine onto the map. With its Reggae vibe, emotive vocals and a touch of Missy's production magic, it was a summer gem. A-My Foolish Heart--Produced by Ivan \"Orthodox\" Barias and Carvin \"Ransum\" Higgins, this midtempo sounds so much like an Alicia Keys' track that it is sick. Jazmine still is table to define it as her own. A mid-tempo, a catchy B-section and hook and a mad riff throughout, this song shows that this CD will not be filled with too much filler. B+Lions, Tigers & Bears--Produced by Salaam Remi, the same cat that produced Bust your Windows, helps to take Jazmine down fairy tale-like lane. Although the song references a kids' phrase and the beat has that \"Little Red Riding Hood travelling through the woods alone\" production to it, once again, Jazmine is table to make the song work with her vocals and interpretive abilities. If she can sang about busting windows and make it sound right, she can sang about not being scared of lions, tigers and bears. threerd single A+Call Me Guilty--Produced by Salaam Remi, Salaam does not strike thrice with this one. I cannot take this song. It is too dark. It is too gloomy. It just does not work. Someone like Mary J. Blige can ably pull it off, but hearing Jazmine using this, does not work for me. C-One Night Stand--Produced by Fisticuffs, Jazmine meets Amy Winehouse's sound. This song pays homage to sixty girl groups meets twenty-onest century R&B.; It is a fun song that does not turn into filler. I like the bridge for the vamp a lot. The content of the song can go, though. BAfter the Hurricane--Produced by Stargate, this team works their magic on this song, which should be Jazmine's next single. This may not be some people's favourite, but it sounds like that Bryan Michael Cox sound. It works. ADream Big--Produced by Missy Elliott and Lamb, this song is a contender for her next single in gossip circles. It is a mid-tempo that is encouraging, fun and is a nice reprieve after After the Hurricane. ALive A Lie--Produced by Salaam Remi, Salaam rebounds there. This mid-tempo song with a nice riff\/arrangement and a catchy hook sounds good. AFear--Produced by Dirty Harry, this song has a production that sounds like many R&B; cuts we've heard, but Jazmine brings a different affect with the dichotomy\/parallelism in the lyrics. It is song that sounds good while giving the listener a little to think about. AIn Love With Another Man--Produced by Anthony Bell, this is Jazmine's encore song already. Every \"good\" singer has one. I would predict that this is Jazmine's Hero, I Will Always Love you, My Heart Will Go On, Over the Rainbow, Burn. The slow-build of the song, the vocals and the bridge all work to make this a masterpiece that has been missing in the game for the longest. A+Switch!--Produced by Jack Splash, another Jazmine meets Winehouse. This does not sound as good. It does not have that playful, fun edge that One Night Stand has. It is more annoying than anything; although it is creative. B-Overall, Jazmine brings a needed edge. The songs may not be the deepest, but one can see Jazmine's potential. She can have fun (Dream Big, One Night Stand). She can get ghetto and \"ignant\" (Bust your Windows, Call Me Guilty). She can ably belt a ballad (Lions, Tigers & Bears, After the Hurricane, In Love With Another Man). All of this is done while writing much of her own material with an alto voice that is not trying to be the next struggling soprano singing out of one's range. It just all feels natural and not contrived akin to artists like Chrisette Michele, Jill Scott.","overall":4,"summary":"What A Debut--Jazmine Holds It Down","unixReviewTime":1229990400,"reviewTime":"12 23, 2008"}

The start of Jazmine Sullivan has brought something different to R&B; most people of this time have not had it for the past ten years. It\u2019s hard to put my fingers in it, but it\u2019s a new face of R&B. This song sounds like a shack. In the bad hands of another artist, it may be sharp and tasteless, but the production and interpretation of Jazmine's voice makes it more interesting and accessible than most. ANEed U Bad-Produced by Missy Elliott and Lamb, another loyal Jazmine (#sother hot R&B; single top forty single), this single put Jazmine on the map. With its spirit of reggae music, the inspiring voice of the singing and the magic of Missy\u2019s production, it\u2019s a summer treasure. A-My Foolish Heart - produced by Ivan \"Orthodox\" Barias and Carvin \"Ransum\" Higgins, this medium speed sounded so much like Alicia Keys' song that she fell will. Jazmine still describes it as this own. At medium speed, the catchy section B and the hooks, and the opposite enhancement in all of that, this song shows that this CD is not going to be filled with too much filling. B + Lions, Tigers & Bears - made by the same Salam Remi cat that does \"Bust your Windows\", help bring Jazmine to the fairy-tale valley. Although the song quotes a child\u2019s phrase and is a product of \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood through the forest alone\u201d in the beat, again, Jazmine may still combine the song with this speaking and interpreting skills. If you can using a song that breaks a window and sounds good, you can using a song that is not afraid of lions, tigers and bears. The third song A + Call Me Guilty by Salam Remi, in Salam did not hit three times. I can't accept this song. It's too dark. It's too dark. It just does't work. Someone like Mary J. Blige could do this cleverly, but hearing Jazmine use this, does't work for me. C-One Night Stand - produced by Fisticuffs, Jazmine meets the voice of Amy Winehouse. The song pays homage to a reunion of sixty girl bands and twenty-onest-century R&B. This is an interesting song, it will not be a filling thing. I like the bridge very high. But the theme of the song can go. After Storm - produced by Stargate, the band performed their magic on this song, which should be Jazmine's next song. This may not be the other people's favourite, but it sounds like Bryan Michael Cox's voice. It works. ADream Big \u2014 produced by Missy Elliott and Lamb, this song is her next strong defender in the gossip bring. This is an incentive, a moderate space, and a good test after a hurricane. ALive A Lie - produced by Salam Remi, in which Salam holds rebounds. This medium-sized song with great refinement \/ arrangement and an attractive hook sounds great. AFEar - produced by Darry Harry, the production of this song sounds like a lot of R&B; we\u2019ve heard of editing, but Jazmine brings a different impact and impact \/ similarity to the words. This is a song that sounds great, and at the same time tasks the audience to think a little bit. Love another man - produced by Anthony Bell, this is already Jazmin's encore. Every \"good\" singer has one. I will predict that this is the hero of Jazmine, I will always love you, and my heart will continue to burn beyond the dark. The slow construction of the song, the lyrics and the bridges all make this part work long lost in the game. A + Change! -Produced by Jack Splash, another Jazmine meets Winehouse. This does't sound right. It has no One Night Stand toys and interesting toys. This is more annoying than anything else; although very creative. B-Overall, Jazmine brings much-needed benefits. The song may not be the deepest, but you can see the power of Jazmine. You can be happy (very dreamy, one night). You can find shacks with \"Ignorance\" (Bust your Windows, Call Me Guilty). You can using ballad skilfully (lion, leopard and bear, dating another man after a hurricane). All of this was done while the was writing most of this stuff in a middle voice, and the did\u2019t want it to be the next soprano song the sang beyond this reach. All of this sounds natural, unlike artists like Chrisette Michele and Jill Scott.","overall":4,"summary":"What A Debut--Jazmine Holds It Down","unixReviewTime":1229990400,"reviewTime":"12 23, 2008"}

This poem is a tribute to a group of sixty girls who experienced twentieth century R&B .; It\u2019s a fun song that\u2019s incomplete. I really like the vamp bridge. The essence of the song can continue, though. After Storm - Produced by Stargate, this band works their magic on this song, which is next to Jazmine. It may not be what people want, but it sounds like Bryan Michael Cox. He works. ADream Big - Produced by Missy Elliott and Lamb, this song is competing for the next spot in the rumour mill.

I love 'fiftys and 'sixtys style R&B with music about genuine love, commitment, passion and romance. There's not one track on there that I clicked the \"next\" button to, but I certainly enjoyed \"Love Letter\" the most. Congrats, R., you did it again. However, I heard R. Kelly's latest CD and was so pleasantly surprised. R.

{"orig_index":61053,"reviewerID":"A277CZ3P20LH74","asin":"B005EHNEDO","reviewerName":"Brian E.","helpful":[91,107],"reviewText":"Wilco is one of those bands you can never sleep on. Nearly a decade removed from their most esteemed album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, circumstances have changed for the Chicago-based rockers. There was a time in which Wilco could't do anything without causing everyone to stand up and take notice. My senior year in high school was the year A Ghost Is Born came out, and everyone was talking about that record. It was everywhere. You could't escape the buzz from that album if you bought real estate under a giant boulder. But if you were one of those, like me, who soon tired of the Wilco hype, you eventually got your wish. It would't be fair to say the hype died, but I don't remember the previous two albums generating the same level of hysteria we saw with Ghost. But now it is two thousand and eleven and I've got to heat my words. I finally decided to give Wilco an in-depth listen, and I see what the big deal is. If there's a new wave of hype over the latest Wilco record, don't expect to see me run for cover. Because if there's any justice, The Whole Love should start a revolution of its own. The Whole Love seems to strike a medium between the two extremes the band painted in the two thousands. It's certainly more level headed than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born, but is more adventurous than their last effort, Wilco (the album). The opener, \"Art of Almost,\" builds up slowly, leaving you wondering what exactly this album has in store for you. But when the extended guitar solo kicks in, you know you're in for a truly unique ride. As a listener who appreciates variety, The Real Love is an easy sell. This album has it all, from sprawling epics to clashing rockers and well crafted pop nuggets.\"I Might\" sees the band combining pop and rock styles like second nature. You are treated to strong hooks that are punctuated by guitar pyrotechnics going off left and right. When Jeff Tweedy's voice kicks in during the chorus, I can't help but notice the sounds a bit like John Lennon. And speaking of Beatles influence, another treat comes on \"Sunloathe.\" It's dreary at first, but picks up as it goes along. The second half reminds me of the Abbey Road medley, particularly in regard to the harmonies and drum fills. One fact Wilco fans should be well aware of is that there's nothing quite like the effect of a dynamic frontman. There are few tracks that better accentuate that than \"Standing O,\" a rollicking rocker on which Tweedy confidently asserts himself -- \"Maybe you've noticed I'm not afraid of everything that I've done \/ Maybe you've noticed I'm not the same as almost anyone.\"And if you like Wilco's lyricism, \"Dawned On Me,\" will also be high on your favourites list. I enjoy the aggressive attitude and the way the words wrap around each verse. Look at the second verse:\"I've been lostI've been foundI've been taken by the sound\"It's simple, but dramatic when delivered the way Tweedy does it. This is the song most deeply ingrained in my head right now.\"Black Moon\" and \"Rising Red Lung\" are mellow, quiet, and thought provoking. They're the two songs on The Whole Love that best reflect on Wilco's salt-country roots, and they're the two songs that best represent my state of mind when I'm ready to chill out.\"Capitol City\" has a jovial, bouncy, show tune-y feel to it. \"Open Mind\" is an emotional ballad, with lyrics that tug at your heart strings. Then you have \"Born Alone,\" one of my personal favourites. At first glance it's your typical pop\/rock gem, but near the send it gets reflective and really rocks out. The Whole Love comes to a close with \"One Sunday Morning (Song for Jane Smiley's Boyfriend)\" a devastatingly vivid twelve minute chronicle on the deterioration of a relationship between father and son. Pay close attention to the lyrics and it'll produce a plump in your throat. What makes Wilco great is the sincerity of everything they produce, coupled with the unique musical ideas that seem to turn up on each of their records. The Whole Love is the perfect album if you're looking for something refreshing, for for anyone who's a fan of great songwriting.","overall":5,"summary":"Wilco's The Whole Love is a whole slab of awesome","unixReviewTime":1317081600,"reviewTime":"09 27, 2011"}

Almost a decade after leaving their much-respected album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, the situation in Chicago's rock bands has changed. There was a time when Wilco could do nothing but get everyone to stand up and be careful. My fourth grade in high school was the year the ghost was born, and everyone was talking about that record. It is everywhere. If you buy a place to stay under a big rock, you can\u2019t throw an album buzz. However, if you get tired of Wilco hype as quickly as I do, you will eventually find what you are looking for. It\u2019s not fair to say that the hype has disappeared, but I don\u2019t remember the first two albums producing the same level of hysteria we\u2019ve seen in Ghost. But it's already two thousand and eleven, so I have to make it clear. I finally decided to let Wilco listen in depth, and I knew something great. If there\u2019s any new hype about Wilco\u2019s recent record, don\u2019t expect me to run for safety. For if there is any justice, Quan Ai must begin its own conversion. All the love seems to have found a medium between the two extremes shown by the band. It\u2019s certainly quieter than the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born, but it\u2019s even more interesting than their last attempt at Wilco (album). The opening article, \"Almost Art\", builds up a bit, making you wonder what exactly this album has prepared for you. But when the extended guitar starts, you will know that you are on a special journey. As a diver who values \u200b\u200bdiversity, \"True Love\" is easy to sell. This album has everything from great epics to controversial rock musicians and pop nuggets. \"I can imagine\" that the group combines pop and rock styles, as a second creation. You will feel as if the strong hooks are interrupted by the sharp edges of the guitar swirling back and forth. When Jeff Tweedy's voice was heard in the chorus, I could not help but notice that the voice was similar to John Lennon's. When it comes to the Beatles' influence, another fun thing is \"Sunloathe\". It was dull at first, but it will get better over time. The second half reminded me of the Abbey Road medley, especially the interaction with the drums. Wilco fans need to clearly understand that nothing can compare to the result of a leading musician. A few songs highlight this more than \"Standing O\", a cheerful rock singer, and Tweedy confidently declared - \"You've probably noticed that I'm not afraid of everything I do \/ you've probably noticed that I'm different. Almost to anyone.\" If you like Wilco\u2019s words, \u201cDawned On Me\u201d will also be at the top of your favourite list. I like the clear-cut attitude and the way the words turn around in each verse. See verse two: \u201cI am lost, I am found, I am drawn to sound.\u201d This is easy, but when it is explained in Tweedy's way, it is full of drama. This is the deepest song right now in my mind. The \"dark moon\" and \"Red Lung Rising\" are around, silent, and thought-provoking. The two songs in The Whole Love show the roots of Wilco's salt world, and are two songs that better represent my mind when I'm ready to relax. , Flexible, expresses the feeling of music-y. An \u201copen mind\u201d is an emotional ballad, words that affect your heart. Then you have \"Born Alone\", one of my favourites. At first glance, it is a rare gem of pop \/ rock, but it will reflect and really move closer to the post. All love ends on \"Sunday morning (Jane Smiley's boyfriend's song)\", a vivid twelve-minute description of the breakdown of the relationship between father and son. Pay attention to the words, it will create a congestion in your throat. The great thing about Wilco lies in the authenticity of everything they produce, combined with the unique music philosophy that seems to be reflected in their records. Perfect Love is a perfect album, if you are looking for something refreshing, perfect for anyone who loves nature.","overall":5,"summary":"Wilco's The Whole Love is a whole slab of awesome","unixReviewTime":1317081600,"reviewTime":"09 27, 2011"}

Nearly a decade after the release of their highly regarded album, the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, circumstances have changed for Chicago rocks. There was a time when Wilco could do nothing without a reason for everyone to stop and find out. My top year in high school was the year A Born, and everyone was talking about that record. It's everywhere. You can\u2019t escape the noise of that album if you buy real estate under rock. But if you\u2019re one of those, like me, and immediately tired of Wilco chico, you\u2019ve finally got your wish. it\u2019s not fair to say that the hype is dead, but I don\u2019t remember the first two albums producing the same level of hysteria we see in Spirit. But now it was two thousand and eleven, and I warmed it up with my words. I finally decided to listen to Wilco deeply, and see what the big thing was. If there\u2019s a new wave of hype on top of Wilco\u2019s latest record, don\u2019t expect to see me running for cover. Because, if there is to be justice, The All Love must start its own revolution. The whole love seems to hit between the two ends of the group pictured in the two thousand. It\u2019s certainly higher than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born, but it\u2019s more interesting than their latest effort, Wilco (the album). The key, \u201cAlmost Art,\u201d is slowly forming, making you wonder what this album really has in you. But when it comes to fast guitar, you know you\u2019re on a special journey. Listeners who appreciate diversity, True Love is an easy sale. Everything is on this album, from flattering stories to well-crafted rock collisions and pop nuggets. You are treated to solid hooks attached to the left and right pyrotechnics guitars. When Jeff Tweedy\u2019s voice comes along while singing, I can\u2019t help but see sounds a bit like John Lennon. And speaking of the effects of the Beatles, another treatment included \"Sunloathe.\" At first it\u2019s scary, but it gets when it goes away. The second part reminds me of the Abbey Road game, especially in terms of matching and drumming. One fact that Wilco fans should know is that there is no such thing as an active leader influence. There are few ways to reinforce this better than \u201cStanding O,\u201d a tug-of-war in which Tweedy confidently said-\u201cMaybe you felt like I was\u2019t afraid of anything I did \/ You might have felt me. same for everyone. \u201dAnd if you like Wilco\u2019s literature,\u201c Dawned On Me, \u201dit will also go on your favourites list. I enjoy the aggressive behavior and the way the words are recorded in each paragraph. Notice the second verse: \u201cI am lost, I have found a voice\u201d This is simple, but dramatic when it comes to how Tweedy does it. This is the deepest song in my brain right now. \u201cBlack Moon\u201d and \u201cRising Red Lung\u201d are slim, quiet, and thought-provoking. They\u2019re the two songs of All Love that best reflect Wilco\u2019s salt roots, and they\u2019re the two songs that best represent my mind when I\u2019m ready to relax. Capitol City has a sense of humour, bouncy, rhythm-y. \u201cOpen Mind\u201d is an emotional dance, with words that touch your heart. So you have \u201cBorn Alone,\u201d one of my favourites. At first glance this is your typical pop \/ rock band, but the post next to it is a reflection that really came out. The whole love affair ends with \u201cOne Sunday Morning (Song by Jane Smiley\u2019s Boyfriend)\u201d which is a twelve minute horror story about abuse in the father-son relationship. You watch the songs carefully and it will come out of your throat. What makes Wilco beautiful is the honesty of everything they do, along with the weird musical ideas that seem to come out of every record they make. All Love is the best album if you are looking for a producer, anyone fan of great songwriting.","overall":5,"summary":"Wilco's The Whole Love is a whole slab of awesome","unixReviewTime":1317081600,"reviewTime":"09 27, 2011"}

Things have changed for the Chicago rockers since nearly a decade ago, when their most acclaimed album, Yankee Hotel, was removed from Foxstroat. There was a time when Wilco could do nothing but cause everyone to stand up and be careful. My last year of high school was the year Ghost of Burn appeared, and everyone was talking about that record. It was everywhere. If you bought houses for sale under a big rock, you will not be table to escape the buzz of this album. But if you were one of those people, like me, who was fed up with Wilco hype, then you finally got what you wanted. It would not be fair to say that the hype is over, but I don't remember the last two albums producing the same level of hysteria that we saw with Ghost. But now it's two thousand and eleven and I have to warm up. I finally decided to listen to Wilco in depth, and I see how big it is. If there's a new wave of hype with Wilco's latest record, don't expect me to run for cover. Because if there is justice, all love must begin to change. It seems that all the love is closing the gap between the two parties in which a group of two thousand has been formed. It's a lot more than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born, but it's far more dangerous than their last attempt, Wilco (album). The first opener, \"Art of Almost\", grows a bit, leaving you wondering what this album has in store for you. But when it comes to advanced guitars, you know you're ready to ride anything. As an audience that appreciates diversity, it's easy to sell true love. This album has it all, from Streaming Apex to Clashing Rockers and well-designed pop nuggets. \"The Mighty\" sees the group as a second genre, combining pop and rock styles. It is treated with strong hooks marked with left and right guitar pyrotechnics. When Jeff Tweedy's voice came in the middle of the course, I could't help but see voices like John Lennon. And when it comes to the Beatles' influence, another treat comes with \"Sunloth.\" It's sad at first, but it continues as it goes. The second part reminds me of the Abbey Road Medley, especially with regard to the drumming crowd. One fact that Wilco fans should be aware of is that there is no such thing as a strong back result. There are some tracks that emphasize more than \"Standing O\", a rolling rocker in which Tweedy assures himself with confidence - \"You've probably seen that I'm not from every job. I'm afraid of what I've done \/ maybe you've seen. You're almost like everyone else. \" And if you like Wilco's song \"Dand On Me\", it will be at the top of your list. I enjoy the aggressive attitude and the way the words are summed up in each verse. See verse two: \"I'm LostI've Bin Found I've Got No Sound\" It's easy, but it's amazing when brought up like Tweedy. This is a song that is in my head right now. \"Dark Moon\" and \"Rising Red Ling\" are patient, calm and thoughtful. There are two songs in The Whole Lo that best express the roots of Wilco's salty country, and two that best represent my mood when I'm ready to relax. \"Open Mind\" is an emotional song, with songs that pull you out of your heart. Then you have one of my personal favourites \"born alone\". At first glance this is your usual pop \/ rock mini, but ahead of this release it really appears and really shines. The whole love ends with \"One Sunday Morning\" which is a twelve minute history of the break up of the father-son relationship. Pay attention to the alphabet, it will form in your throat. What makes Wilco so great is the credibility of everything the has created, along with the unique musical ideas that are found in this records. If You Want Some Refreshment, Full Love is a great album for anyone who loves to write songs.","overall":5,"summary":"Wilco's The Whole Love is a whole slab of awesome","unixReviewTime":1317081600,"reviewTime":"09 27, 2011"}

But for those who miss the modern-day real-world realm, with a twist of courage and sparkle created by the South Divas, this album is for you. \"Wives' prayers\" are fun and sad because you know that millions of women are table to see neglect in their marriages and are drowning in despair in their homes. \"Hunter's Wife\" bothers me because when was the last time you heard the national anthem about eating baboon stew?","overall":5,"summary":"This Is What County Music Should Be About","unixReviewTime":1315440000,"reviewTime":"09 8, 2011"}

Tame Impala's newest release also creates a sense of isolation but thanks to the aggressive recording techniques used this time around- in your face drums, creative channel mixing (even more so than on the previous album), manipulated vocals, players of keyboards- the isolation is a little more disturbing. \"Lonerism\" sounds exactly like you think music described as Lonerism should sound like- unlike anything else. And it is genius. Opening track \"Be Above It\" occupies a musical landscape somewhere between \"Kid A\" Radiohead and any era Animal Collective, yet it sounds like Tame Impala. No chorus, no verse, for anything resembling structure appears to exist- it is just three:twenty-two of drums, distorted vocals, and psych energy. \"Endors Toi\" kicks off with some familiar guitar sounds before veering off into symphonic rock, not too far removed from The Flaming Lips more eccentric stuff. Yet again, it sounds like Tame Impala. The two tracks released prior to the album's release- \"Apocalypse Dream\" and \"Elephant\"- each display two of the bands strengths. The former is an over-the-top, upbeat, prog rocker that embraces the term 'epic' while the latter is dirty, aggressive, bass-driven blues rock. The stand out track (at least for today; this will probably change next week) is \"Keep On Lying\". It starts off with a fade-in, already in progress, sounding like a subdued, lazy \"ninety-nine Tears\". For the first couple minutes, nothing much changes. Then slowly, an oddly mixed guitar enters, along with chattering voices, and before you know it, the song is lost in a musical house of mirrors (and blessed with some of the album's most exciting guitar playing). It sounds ridiculous, but it is. And again, it is genius. Needless to say, Tame Impala has avoided a sophomore slump. Heading in a new direction while still sounding like Tame Impala is quite an accomplishment, and also a rewarding and exhilarating listen for their fans. And I haven't even mentioned the Led Zeppelin stomp of \"Mind Mischief\" for the fact that the last track is a piano waltz. Genius stuff.","overall":5,"summary":"No sophomore slump for this band","unixReviewTime":1349740800,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2012"}

The latest version of Tame Impala creates a sense of isolation, but for the sake of use. of recorded recordings this time is a drum on your face, a mix of design style Tone (and more than the previous album), abusive lyrics, key-split board players are even more disturbing. \"Solutism\" sounds like you think the music described as Solutism should sound - unlike anything else. This is intellectual. The opening track \"Be On It\" stays in the music scene between \"Kid A\" Radiohead and the Collected Animals of any era, but it sounds like Tame Impala. There is no chorus, no verse, for there seems to be something like a structure \u2014 it has only three elements: twenty-two drums, twisted voices and wind power. \"Endors Toi\" began with the usual guitar sounds and then turned into a symphonic rock, not far from the strange burning Lips. Again, it sounds like a deer. Two songs released before the album was released - \"Dream of the Apocalypse\" and \"Elephant\" - respectively showed two benefits of the band. The former is an exaggerated, hopeful, and savant-garde rock containing the word \"epic\", while the latter is a brown, fiery, bass-driven rock. The best track (at least today; it could change next week) \"keep flying\". It started to fade and then it drove away. It sounded soft and lazy \"ninety-nine tears\". For the first few minutes, nothing has changed so much. Then gradually, an unusual guitar came in, accompanied by a cloud bang, unknowingly, the song disappeared from the showroom (and fortunately played the most beautiful guitar on the album). This sounds funny, but it's true. Again, it\u2019s a mind. Undoubtedly, Tame Impala prevented the second drop.

Sounds ridiculous, but it is. And again, these would mean that you have to spend for these processes. Needless to say, Team Impala avoided another fall. Moving to a new place sounding like Team Impala is a huge undertaking, as well as a rewarding and exciting listening experience for their fans.

His latest album \"Insider Speaker\" broke the hearts of many rock-conscious fans, at least with this loneliness songs that often remind him of the Beatles' latest era and happily The Fleming Lips Soundboard Dave Developed by Friedman. The feeling of loneliness has once again become a theme in this new album \"Loneliness\" but it has been blurred due to the different shades, color and sounds in these twelve songs. Various leaders want this promotion on the edge of Kevin Parker's band music, namely through the \"plastic pop\" of Britney Spears and especially through this \"wizard and true star\" who is a strong but often carefree Todd Rundgreen. It's hard to know where to start because you've heard that people who are impressed with the pleasant \"inner speaker\" can get a higher test level where there is suffocation and overbearing. Either way if you give him enough time you will see a deviant relative, a terrible child who is obviously part of the same united family but is growing at an astonishing rate. Just listen to the first three songs and think about how many new bands have released two, twelve albums struggling to achieve this level of creativity and innovation with forty-five canvases. The launcher \"Be Above It\" is all voice loops and is probably the most vocal drum of the underworld song \"Born Slippy\". The next line reaches \"Endor Toi\" which Yasir sadly failed to make big pop of psychedelic pops within the framework of beautiful music in this new album, while \"Apocalypse Dreams\" by Lewis Taylor's \"Lost\" I'm as sweet as anything.

Either way, you can compete with Echo Laden and Space \"Home Music\", one of the album's most popular songs, to cover your needle. Tame Impala and their rising levels of \"Mind Mischief\" make this group a real contender with a great retro eye for its tremendous pop sensibility, which is a very old new. This is a well-documented album in the light of the coming Australian summer and there is no doubt that some of the hottest sounds will be heard in these areas as the hot sun moves slowly along the lines.

That is, until Heartthrob. Heartthrob is the album that will permanently put T&S; in the spotlight. Tegan And Sara are at the top of their game there, putting out some of the best itunes the indie scene has seen in a long time. Closer, the first single, is one of the best ways to get a feel for how this album as a whole will probably sound. The dreamy sound, excellent lyrics, duelling vocals, this is the perfect judge for which to base Heartthrob. With only ten songs, the girls put that time to good use. Moving past the excellent Closer, Goodbye, Goodbye offers up more well done break up fodder, yet also has a fantastic heights vibe going for it (as does most of this CD). I'm Not Your Hero is an anthemic chorus-driven track, How Come You Don't Want Me (my personal favourite) has so much going for it, catchy chorus, caching vocals, and a very Ting Tings feel throughout. I Couldn't Be Your Friend has a sentiment most of us can say we've felt it that drives the song, Love They Say is another lyrical behemoth that will have you relating to it. Now I'm All Messed Up is the last song I'll mention (though Shock To Your System is a great finale), simply because of the funky synthesizer beat and echo vocals moving nicely into the great chorus. This is a song that really feels new to Tegan and Sara's arsenal. I can't think of any songs that are comparable. Definitely worth checking out. Overall, Heartthrob was worth the wait. Sure this will be the album that finds them a much wider audience with superstars like Katy Perry and Sara Bareilles (in her own right) pushing it in their Twitter feeds, but more importantly this is a CD that longtime fans can grasp.

Heartthrob is an album that is permanently T&S; In the light. Tegan and Sarah are at the forefront of their game there. Nearby, the first single, is one of the best ways to feel what the whole album will look like. Dreamy voices, great songs, fast lyrics, this is the best judge on which you can support a heartthrob. With only ten songs, the girls made good use of that time. The best closeness, goodbye, goodbye offers the best food, but it also comes with an eighty vibe (as most CDs do). I'm Not Your Hero is a course run song, How You Don't Want Me (my personal favourite) has a lot to do, a charming course, short songs, and the most popular sting sting. I can't be your friend. The feeling is that most of us will say that we have never heard him using, love the says with another rhythm with which we will relate. Now I'm All Messed Up is the last song I'll talk about (although the Shock to Your system has a good ending), just because of the fun synthesizer rhythm and echo lyrics that go well in the big corner. It's a song that's really new to Tegan and Sarah's Arms. I can't think of comparative songs. Definitely worth a check. All in all, Heartthrob was worth the wait. It's definitely going to be an album that will feature celebrities like Katy Perry and Sarah Braille (self-right) on its Twitter feed, but more importantly, it's a CD that has long been a fan catch. can. A new voice that shows great maturity, but that 'vibe' of Tegan and Sarah still remains.

I realized there that Sara was simply just the real deal. She has both a magnetic joy onstage as well as the actual vocal talent to make her live performances sound as good as if not better than her studio albums. Something I've always found really special about her music though, is how accessible yet a little left of mainstream it tends to be. Its equal parts catchy and heartfelt--yet I never feel like she's trying too hard. This album builds upon that by incorporating some new elements like jazz and electronic into her special brand of aware piano driven pop music. While listening to the exquisite ballad \"Manhattan\", I could see a dark smoky jazz club from the one thousand, nine hundred and forty with Sara flying across a piano, crooning about a lost love to a hushed audience. Another more upbeat jazz influenced album standout, \"Little Black Dress\" sees the appearance of Sara's older sister doing Motown inspired pitch perfect background vocals which just mesh perfectly with Sara's voice. \"Satellite Call\" on the other hand, with its slight reverb and haunting melody makes me feel like I'm somehow underneath the Northern Lights just staring up at the stars lit up in swirling color.\"I Choose You\" starts with a subtle stringed bass line and understated vocals, yet builds into a very sweet and honest love song. It's the type of song that you could see being used in one of those clip synched marriage proposal extravaganzas on YouTube. Overall, this album probably is a bit more upbeat--not so much in stone (as many of the songs sound like breakup songs), but musically than her past two albums. \"Eden\" especially embraces this driving electronic sound. In the hands of a lesser talented vocalist, I don't think it would have worked and would have stuck out like a sore thumb. But Sara's smooth and melodic voice is the glue that pulls the range of musical genres together into a package that just feels right. Highly recommend listening through a few times before making up your mind about this album (it's streaming on iTunes), as I found myself being nonchalant about a few songs the first time I heard them--but then going back and just closing myself in them. Longtime fans of Sara will not be disappointed with this album. She managed to push herself musically and keep things interesting, while retaining everything that makes her part special. It has poetic quiet moments, bombastic inspiring anthems (\"Brave\" was co-written with Jack Antonoff of FUN.) and above all a determination to embrace life to the fullest and well, be brave. Excellent pop that does more than entertain--it speaks for a generation.***For anyone looking for new similar artists, I recently saw piano pop singer\/songwriter Jillette Johnson in concert, and she positively blew my mind.

Overall, this album probably is a bit more upbeat--not so much in stone (as many of the songs sound like breakup songs), but musically than her past two albums. Another more upbeat jazz influenced album standout, \"Little Black Dress\" sees the appearance of Sara's older sister doing Motown inspired pitch perfect background vocals which just mesh perfectly with Sara's voice. ***For anyone looking for new similar artists, I recently saw piano pop singer\/songwriter Jillette Johnson in concert, and she positively blew my mind. Highly recommend listening through a few times before making up your mind about this album (it's streaming on iTunes), as I found myself being nonchalant about a few songs the first time I heard them--but then going back and just closing myself in them. \"Satellite Call\" on the other hand, with its slight reverb and haunting melody makes me feel like I'm somehow underneath the Northern Lights just staring up at the stars lit up in swirling color. \"I Choose You\" starts with a subtle stringed bass line and understated vocals, yet builds into a very sweet and honest love song.","overall":5,"summary":"Slightly Experimental but on Par with Previous Albums","unixReviewTime":1373932800,"reviewTime":"07 16, 2013"}

If you have other albums, you\u2019ll love preparing for a simple life. In Atlas, Real Estate took where they left off in the Sun but this time the topics were explored in depth. With Martin Courtney now married, Atlas\u2019s focus shifted slightly from the old Estate conversation; on this record, Martin and the team are very rooted so far. If Heard - A nice little shot of the lead leads the song back to the memory of the first album but through the clear mirror of the Malm\u00f6 production. This path plays the rock for the rest of the album. Past Life-arguably the most popular Yo La Tengo-esque on the album, the seventy-year-old warm-up and belt ride temporarily continues as Martin mourns the memory of long-lost neighbourhoods, while protecting the Housing culture. Repeat - It is clear why this song was chosen for a single song. As the fastest, and fastest growing group, backwardness is a common and rapid trend that shows how much the group has grown over the past year. April Song - A montage -like instrument for many people having fun on the road. This song will find its place on many upcoming CDs. Fun, lazy perfection. Bend - The foundation looks like a crickets song that gives this road a nice vibe at night. Just the most eye-catching album. Crime - A reminder of the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys that hit the \u201cBig Me\u201d of the Foo Fighters. Very cloud screaming and cloud noise. Live the Primitive electric guitar - This song could be the next. It\u2019s a bit more exciting than the standard price they have but when the chorus is reversed, it\u2019s a sweet help. How can I live - has this song been recorded at one thousand, nine hundred and seventy -two? Everything about this song hits public rock for a natural soundtrack (as much as possible, of course) with Bleeker\u2019s obscene voice in the middle of the stage. Horizon - A newcomer to the South frontier of the latest route, Horizon has a Western folk guitar and bus interface that perfectly fits the sounds of pastoral songs that connect everyone. Navigator \u2014 The team breathes and we really get the words out. \"Cross the kitchen floor \/ steal the back door \/ across the statue \/ we'll meet you at the send of the pavement.\" According to a short story written by Raymond Carver, this song is not very similar to what is said but is left out and not mentioned. Despite the fact that the Real Estate guitarist will always be sad and classic to attract the very small band, Atlas seems to be ashamed of the unquestionable goals of Days, instead of focusing on one chapter. new life; one full of Talking Backward, occasional delays (past lives), and reluctance to tear the path of adulthood (Crime). As Real Estate continues to resonate with their voices, production grows and flows and the songs become more meaningful. Long, long time I hear from men.","overall":5,"summary":"Great sound that eclipses their previous CD!","unixReviewTime":1394323200,"reviewTime":"03 9, 2014"}
