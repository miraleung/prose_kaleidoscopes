The music is awful. The acting is limited largely to growling and smirking. A half star dud. Shame on DirecTV for putting it on pay-per-view. In a theatre, people might well have thrown soda at the screen.",negative

The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the girl from Will and Grace) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters were't as funny even though the movie focused around them. All in all, this is a great movie to go and see with your girls (yes guys, it's a girlie movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!",positive

25344,"A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented factors, sounds like a great idea. An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less of the content allowing the factors and writers and director more creativity. But then why is this movie so bland? Ask the dust. This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters. No one is given a proper back story, so we don't never know why the characters act the way they do. Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to your imagination, if you still have one left at the send of this movie. I told a friend that I went to see this film, and that I thought it was awful. Her question: ""Not even Colin Farrell could save it?""

I would strongly suggest that anyone who is interested in American rugby should watch this movie and see what rugby really is on YouTube because the rugby shown in this movie is actually distorted and distorted by what it is. The film manages to entertain as well as inform. Various rugby traditions such as ""haka"" were first created by New Zealand's ""all black"" and only all blacks.

5922,"This story was never among my favourites in Christie's works so I was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation. The mouse motif was effective if a little overdone, the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past' subplot. The students were all pretty much as I imagined them although its a pity they were't a more cosmopolitan bunch - perhaps the revised thirties setting did't allow for that! I thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming; perhaps its because I've not long are-read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on. Humour was much more prevalent in these early Poirots. Sometimes it works but I found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode (though I did smile at the 'Lemon sole' throwaway line). Altogether though, a solid entry in the series though not one of the best.",positive
5922,"Among Christie's works, this story has never been my favourite, so I'm very happy to have this one. The content of the mouse is legitimate, and if a little finished, the bones of the story are there, though more emphasis has been placed on ""past crimes"". Students are almost as I think, although unfortunately they are not a group of foreigners - perhaps the revised one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys setting does not allow that! I think I took a big risk when I shot; probably because I haven't read this book in a long time, but since it came out in some shots that show up right away, it seems like I know who the killer is. Humor is common to these former Poirot objects. Sometimes it works, but I find that there are a lot of heavy points in this article (although I smile at the “mon only” discarded product line). Overall, although not in the best of series, it is a reliable entry point.",positive

I thought very dangerous risks were taken for the recording; maybe it’s because I haven’t read the book in a long time but it seems to me the person who appeared to the killers in their images of some of the vaccines coming out early. Jokes have multiplied with Poirots previously. Sometimes it works but I get a lot of heavy hands on this event (even though I smile - I smile at the Lemon single line).

5922,"I thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming; perhaps its because I've not long are-read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on. The mouse motif was effective if a little overdone, the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past' subplot. Sometimes it works but I found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode (though I did smile at the 'Lemon sole' throwaway line). The students were all pretty much as I imagined them although its a pity they were't a more cosmopolitan bunch - perhaps the revised thirties setting did't allow for that! This story was never among my favourites in Christie's works so I was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation. Altogether though, a solid entry in the series though not one of the best.

Because of Parker Posey we enjoyed the film more than if the other actress played Mary. This is a time when we have never been smarter about what the area and surrounding Meat Market districts have become. “Party Girl” is the epitome of Parker Posey’s biggest attraction.",positive
20362,"After all, sometimes, this movie seems like a car in which Ms. Posey is allowed to play on her own, as she always does in real life. At least, there is no bluff in the movie, and we see people with their feet on the ground living their lives in a normal way, if we can call it that. Directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, the movie is a treat for fans of Ms. Posey. Von Scherler Mayer took us on a wrong trip to South Manhattan and showed us this soulless soul, this life dedicated to the happiness of the various clubs where the lived. Precisely it is because of Parker Posey that we prefer this movie to other factors playing Mary. This is a time that has proved to be more subtle than the region and the nearby meat market. ""Party Girl"" makes full use of Parker Posey's great charm.",positive
20362,"In fact, at times, the movie looks like a car in which Ms. Pussy is allowed to play, as in real life. At least, there is no hypocrisy in movies and we see people living their lives as usual, if we can call it that. Directed by Daisy Van Schiller-Mayer, the film is popular with Ms. Posey's fans. Van Schiller-Meyer is taking us on a wild trip in the lower part of Manhattan to show us the lifeless soul who is dedicated to entertaining himself in various clubs. Because of Parker Posey, we enjoy the movie more if someone else plays the role of Mary. It was a time of less pressure than the surrounding areas and districts of the meat market. ""Party Girl"" made a lot of money from Parker Posey's great attention.",positive
9987,"RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt all warm and tingly when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. To me, she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him. However, I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. In addition, I thought that Lurky (voiec of Pat Fraley) and Murky (voiec of Peter Cullen) were diabolical. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who has't seen it, especially die-hard fans of the TV series. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.",positive

In addition, I thought Lurky (voice of Pat Fraley) and Murky (voice of Peter Cullen) were satanic.

And there's Edward, who in't sure what life the wants to lead. My favourite character was Tom, Edward's insane boss. Tom has a short role but a memorable one.

Being made on a low budget, one can comprehend why the special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they were not completely horrible.

Probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. I want to mention to The Diceman from Germany there's no reason to feel that the 'sucks' when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. Like I said, I don't understand Japanese -or at least only the very small amount I came away with from reading the very lengthy novel -pro- baby my favourite all time book which I could not put down & took the next day off from work just to finish reading!
