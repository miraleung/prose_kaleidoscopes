8,"Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on there I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen nine hundred and fifty+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, spacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a flame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the send credits of a film. The only thing that prevents me giving this a one-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from this best performance the at least seems to be making a bit of an effort.

17,"This movie made it into one of my top ten most awful movies. Horrible. There was't a continuous minute where there was't a fight with one monster for another.

Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of this panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that the's writing this own films, you'd think the'd give himself a role that the has't been typecast in already.)

2315,"Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I find this movie to be particularly grating. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave, pooh so smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a ""fish out of water"" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it's the ""fish"" who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.(I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is American - found the ""in your face"" attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.) As for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid (picture Moe of The Three Stooges). All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because the is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie.",negative

Maybe it’s because I’m from a different time and a different country, but I found that Crosby’s frequent mention of the beauty of the United States was fun at first, faded late, and eventually annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not against America at all - but Britain does not seem to be doing much and / for wants this brave and wise American tour to show them the way. This “fish that leaves the water” is a story, but unlike many such films, this time it was the “fish” that existed. In order to do it myself and this movie, I watched it several times every few years and had the same vision all the time. (I watched another Crosby movie last night - Emperor's Waltz - which also produced a similar response. ) As for the film’s score, it was special enough at the time, Certainly the supporting role is very good. The space and the music are also great, and the costumes are great — although I agree with earlier critics that William Bendix’s wig looks awesome (beautiful images of three heads).

I am a 'non-traditional' student, and, perhaps for reasons of years-lived for wisdom-accrued, appreciated the slow, reflective spacing of the film's narrative.

The claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! Actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr Loomis, the made the film even better. Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as your beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. She gives a tremendous performance. I loved this film since it scared me like hell back when I seen it in the very early eighty's and I still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that the is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. Horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as Psycho's superb storyline, both of which I adore, I believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. To me Halloween and Psycho are the best films I have never seen and I will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.",positive

She's just met him when the's whisked off to do battle for the South in the Civil War, and they've only exchanged about five sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. Law's main direction throughout seems to be `Look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.'

Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch - the one from `Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time swallowing in muck making mud spies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel. Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!' and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do this unspeakably dastardly facts, like kill and torture innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fadingConfederacy.

THE SYNOPSIS:*** MINOR SPOILERS ***David Norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural. One day the mysteriously disappears after phoning this publisher and suggesting the has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger. The entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the ""Norliss tapes"" -- a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural. In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies -- but not before purchasing an ancient Egyptian scarab bring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death. We soon discover the bring itself does't grant immortality. Instead, it only reanimated the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape this crypt so the can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood. Blue-faced, yellow-eyed and growling out ARRRGHHHHHHs you haven't heard since you last watched ""Scooby Doo"" cartoons, the sculptor attacks this wife (Dickinson) one dark night. She escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get this assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate. So is this guy a vampire? No. There's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read for heard. The sculptor does't drink this victims' blood -- the collects it. How? Don't know. We only see him attacking, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of this bid for immortality. It turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if the builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. Once it's finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as this gateway into your world. THE FINAL ANALYSIS:""The Norliss Tapes"" was't picked up as a series for a very good reason. it was garbage. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a paltry, will-conceived mess.

One day, after calling a publisher and suggesting that the publisher accidentally find something that put him in serious danger, the miraculously disappeared.

We soon learned that self-sacrifice does not bring everlasting life. Instead of just waking up the sculptor’s body and allowing him to escape from the basement so they could run around town and suck the blood of a beautiful girl. From the last moment of watching “Scooby” ​​cartoon, the sculptor attacked the woman (Dickinson) on a dark night with a blue face, yellow eyes, and a roar you had never heard of. She fled and contacted Norris through an acquaintance of the common man to seek help to unravel the mystery of the reincarnation of her late husband after her husband. Is this guy a vampire? Do not.

An then, like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots, to Turkish traditional music, to commercial romances, and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music. The interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music, and we hear a lot of (good) rock and wrap in the first third of the film. In such a complex and conflict ridden country as Turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects, like censorship introduced by the military rule in the heights for the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the Kurdish one. 'Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul' is one of the best music documentaries that I have seen lately and is more than a film about music.

There are also dramatic elements (some work, some extreme) that add weight to the story. The performances were good for the board as a whole, especially for Blythe Danner as a mother (though she and Judith Ivey don’t usually choose WASP-ish to perform as Jewish women). I haven’t been a fan of Jonathan Silverman yet, but I will say that the beats fall into the right characters like obnoxious, gawky, and completely fictional / story characters. The film is very similar to Woody Allen’s “Radio Days,” but the latter is more imaginative and humorous. > The shows are great for the whole board, especially Blythe Danner who is a mother.

22297,"DARK REMAINS is a low budget American horror movie that somehow managed to win two awards. The plot seems to involve two separate strands. First, a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed. The grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. It later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted. As the movie goes on, the two separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect. However, the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings. Unfortunately, the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once. Just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! And the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found there. I believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the factors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor. The characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. The badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for character-driven situations and without adding depth to any of them. The direction is uninspired. The inspiration from J-Horror movies such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay close attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown. Tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation (a ghost on a CCTV camera walking towards it for example), and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning. There is no humour for tongue-in-cheek element in these movies. Everything is played so straight and without remorse for limitations that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it. The foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact, very much unlike the ""jump scares"" used in Hollywood movies. The directors of DARK REMAINS made a brave attempt to avoid Hollywood clickés and also successfully avoided using CGI. The homage to J-Horror could have been well intended. Unfortunately, the black of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed ""scares"" on the screen. The make-up effects of the ""ghosts"" were't too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic. I was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie. I could't give away the ending even if I wanted to. I simply could't understand it. All I could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax. What remains? The answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom. The movie is a chore to sit through. Thankfully, the spain ends after an hour and a half. However, most would probably switch off long before the send. There are only two positive things I could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of scare clickés and the absence of the ""f-word"" in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find. This is what the two stars are for. Those who like supernatural for psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING for the J-Horror sub-genre. If you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra-low budget ""R-rated"" horror movie about ghosts, watch DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the greatest horror movie never made but it is surely a lot better than DARK REMAINS and does have a few genuine surprises in store. I advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like the plague.",negative
22297,"DARK OWNERSHIP is a low-cost American film that has somehow won two awards. The conspiracy seems to involve two distinct lines. First, a woman committed suicide by cutting herself in a tree while bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technology writer was found to have her throat cut. The distraught couple decided to move to a remote mountain house. Later, it was discovered that the shut and surrounding areas were windy. As the movie progresses, these two different stories will eventually come together as one might expect. However, the killings are pointless and lead to chaos, which can only be solved by multiple tests. Unfortunately, the movie's appeal is not enough to entice many viewers to watch it more than once. Almost everything that might go wrong in this movie is going to go wrong - and fast! And a low budget cannot be used to justify the shortcomings found there. I think it’s wrong to judge the things involved in a product because the tools are so bad. As some commenter in the area have said, these characters are boring. A poorly written script informs too many people without giving them interesting conversations, creating opportunities for situations that are driven by the characters, for adding depth to anyone. Direction is not recommended. Influences from J-Horror movies such as INGU, GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL are visible. Unfortunately, the director of DARK REMAINS did not pay attention to the J-Horror style. The reason why J-Horror is so effective is that it uses the fear of anonymity. Stress is caused by frequent switching between unfamiliar situations (for example, a ghost on a CCTV camera going to it) and the response of a character in it without warning. The comedy in these movies is ridiculous. Everything is straightforward, and there are no regrets about the barrier, so don’t be sure and be fascinated by it. The horror situation sets the stage for doubt and ensures that the horror has an emotional impact, very different from the ""panic panic"" used in Hollywood movies. The director of DARK REMAINS boldly tried to stop the Hollywood press and successfully blocked the use of CGI. The tribute to J-Horror could have been kind. Unfortunately, the darkness of the inspiration may have caused viewers to ridicule the so-called ""panic"" on the screen. Considering the low budget, the ""Ghost"" makeup effect is not bad, but their behavior is against logic. In this movie, I scratched my head several times. Even if I want to stop, I can't stop. I can't understand at all. I can only guess that this is anti-climax. What's left The answer shown by the author on another website is boring. Watching movies is a job.

22297,"DARK REMAINS is a surprisingly low -budget American film that somehow won two awards. The picture seems to include two different parts. First, a woman committed suicide by cutting off her farm while taking a bath. Second, the daughter of a technical writer was found to have a severed throat. The depressed couple decided to move to a separate room in the mountains. Then the room and the surroundings were turned off. As the film progresses, the two different parts of the story finally come together as one would reasonably expect. However, implementation is uncommon and leads to confusion that can only be resolved through multiple perspectives. Unfortunately, the film is not attractive enough to attract viewers more than once. Anything that can go wrong with this film is wrong - and fast! The small budget is not available to prove all the shortcomings found there. I believe it is wrong to judge the factors involved in this production because the material is so hard. The characters are not as interesting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. The poorly written text introduces a large number of people without giving them an interesting discussion, without creating opportunities for situations that drive the character backwards and without adding any depth. the direction is discouraged. The promotion of J-horror movies like RINGU, GRUDGE and a missed call is self-evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAIN did’t pay much attention to the J-Horror model. J-Horror works effectively because it plays on unknown fears. The tension is caused by the constant change between a strange situation (someone with a CCTV camera going for example), and the reaction of a central character not experiencing a warning. There is no joke for the real life element of these films. Everything is played directly and you don’t regret the limitations and you can’t control it, but you are satisfied and satisfied with it. The distant environment calms suspicion and ensures that fear has a psychological impact, which is quite the opposite of the “jump fear” used in Hollywood movies. The directors of DARK REMAIN made a bold attempt to avoid Hollywood clicks and also successfully avoided the use of CGI. The prestige of J-horror is well-designed. Unfortunately, the darkness of the revelation is likely to amuse viewers on the “scary” screen. The decorative effect of “ghosts” is not too bad in terms of lower budgets but their actions are against reason. I scratched my head a few times in this movie. I can’t afford the send even if I want to. I just did’t understand. The only thing I can mention is that it is the opposite. What's left? The response pointed out as another reviewer of this website was annoying. The film is a difficult task to sit through. Fortunately, Spain finished in an hour and a half. However, they are usually more likely to turn off long before they are shipped. There are only two positive things I can see in this film-the successful avoidance of scary push-ups and the absence of the “f-word” in every sentence that one would normally expect to receive. This is for two stars. People who like the high nature of psychological fear associated with ghosts and harassment may be better off staying with movies like THREATENING HOME, HELL CHANGE. If you think you watch too many movies and want to see a very low “R-rated” budget for ghosts, check out the DEAD GHOST COLLECTION. It may not be the scariest movie I’ve never made, but it’s definitely better than DARK REMAINS and has some really amazing things in store. I advise everyone to avoid BLACK as a disaster.",negative

22297,"Dark Remnants is the lowest budget American horror film to win two awards. The structure appears to consist of two separate wires. First, a woman commits suicide by cutting off her wrists while taking a bath. Second, the young daughter of a professional writer has been found strangled. The grieving couple decided to move to a remote mountain village. It is later reported that the cabin and surrounding areas have been relocated. As the film progresses, the two different threads of the story finally come together as one might expect. However, the exercise is not possible and leads to confusion that can only be resolved with multiple theories. Unfortunately, the film is not attractive enough to attract many viewers more than once. Almost everything that is going wrong with this movie is wrong - and fast! And the low budget cannot be used to justify any shortcomings found there. I'm sure it would be wrong to judge the factors involved in this product because the content was so bad. The characters karen't as interesting as some of the site's reviewers. The written text introduces a lot of people without giving an interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for the characters to move on and without adding depth to any of them. The directory is not affected. J-Horr is obviously inspired by movies like RINGU, The GRUDGE and ONE Missed CALL. Unfortunately, the directors of Dark Remnants did not pay much attention to J-Horror's style. J-Horor works with great success because it plays on unknown fears. The severity of the situation is due to the constant rotation between the bizarre situation (the ghost is watching it on the CCTV camera for example), and the reaction of the main character which you encounter without warning. Is. There are no jokes on these cheeks in these movies. Everything is played directly and without remorse which will not help but believe and love it. Horrible environments are suspicious and confirm that panic has a psychological effect, unlike the ""jump dress"" used in Hollywood movies. The directors of Dark Remnants made a bold attempt to avoid the click of Hollywood and successfully avoided the use of CGI. Praising Jay Horror was in good faith. Unfortunately, the stimulus can make black viewers laugh at the so-called ""panic"" on the screen. The effects of creating ""ghosts"" were not so bad when given a low budget, but their actions only demeaned the idea. I scratched my head a few times during the film. I could't finish it even if I wanted to. I don't understand you All I could find was that it was against the climax. What's left The opinion of a reviewer on a different website is boring.

I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twaddle. The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from this notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand. The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case there. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy granting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid. To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for this actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated. The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating.

Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. John (Mark Constable), this wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small Southern town to take care of this deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward check into a local hotel John begins to question the locals about Uncle Tom's death - some say that the committed suicide, some are unwilling to talk. Puzzled John comes up with a theory of this own - Uncle Tom is alive and well, hiding in the nearby bushes. If not for the occasional lines of dialog used to please its heavy atmospheric stone Modern Love could have been easily mistaken for a Sokurov film. Shot with a sixteenmm camera its washed-out color scheme is strangely evocative of the Russian director's reflective forays into human agony. Perhaps it in't a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival where Modern Love had its premiere. Looking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals however reveals a slightly different picture - while Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to a point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything into a large splash of the director's preferred yellow, Modern Love very much feeds off the Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. In Sokurov's The Second Circle a young man returns to the Russian countryside to bury this deceased father. In the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust. He gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places the body of this father in a coffin. Then the bids goodbye and buries it. The rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and dissatisfaction many were left dealing with. In Modern Love, somewhat ironically, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary it is spain, loneliness, and dissatisfaction with ""modernity"" that suddenly invade John's life. Unlike The Second Circle however there the main protagonist has the opportunity to are-embrace this modern life. His wife and son await him, yet, the walks away. Slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. I doubt Frayne intended for Modern Love to be so strikingly similar to what Sokurov did in The Second Circle. Yet, the spacing, and in particular the puzzling framing, are precisely what transforms this film into a near meditative experience - a difficult and enormously brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology the two directors have mastered to perfection.

Following in the footsteps of someone who is unable to control the drastic changes in personality that result from the death of a close relative, provides an interesting study of the human mind. Published by Accent Film-Australia. John (Mark Constable), this wife Emily (Victoria Hill) and their son Edward (William Tregg) came to the southern town to take care of this uncle's (Don Buck) property. When Emily and Edward entered the local hotel, John started asking the locals about Uncle Tom's death — some said it was suicide, others did't want to talk. Confused John set out this own theory - Uncle Tom is still alive, hiding in the bushes nearby. If it were’t for the dialogue lines used to rent a large stone, “Today’s Love” would easily fall short of Sokulov’s film. Captured with a sixteenmm camera, its finished color scheme dramatically revives the Russian emperor's attempt to reflect human suffering. Perhaps it is not just the fact that ""Modern Love"" began at the Moscow International Film Festival. However, if you look under the face of this special collage of intoxicating visual effects, you will find a slightly different picture — and Sokulov’s films always maintain a strained relationship, so that the protagonist is deliberately isolated from the environment, hiding everything. big picture. The choice of the yellow director, ""Current Love"" is based largely on the Australian outback. John's change of mind gradually depended on it. In Sokurov's ""Second Circle"", the boy returns to a Russian village to bury this late father. Everything was covered with dust in the old man's house. He laid out the scattered clothes and put this father's body in a coffin. Then say good-bye and bury her. The rest of the film shows the long-running collapse of the Soviet system and the loneliness and dissatisfaction that has left many people behind. In today's love, the funny thing is that love is invisible. In contrast, in Spain, John's loneliness and dissatisfaction with “modern life” suddenly swept across John's life. However, unlike the second circle, the protagonist has the opportunity to embrace this modern life. His wife and son were waiting for him, but the left. Under the pressure of the chaotic past, it is slowly but surely beginning to deteriorate. I suspect Flynn is looking to make the current love look amazingly similar to what Sokulov did in the second stage.

The early Yokai includes tea leaves, a kappa water imp, a live umbrella, a woman with a massive leaf, a woman with a second face on the back of her head, a dwarf priest with a large tree - such as curcurka, etc. These types of fun animals came not only from an part story, but they came from some form of summer entertainment in the Tokugawa Era, which corresponds to today’s Halloween houses, to last year’s “horror show” but with private telephone. Demon wells and golden animals and year heads are overflowing to create “chills” during the hot summer. The fat woman and the like were recreated by imaginary techniques, based on the monsters depicted in medieval books; and if their film designs are simple and sacred, they will do everything that represents the previously remade for summer cool. This lovable monkey has to face and destroy the ancient Babylonian vampire who came to Japan and pretended to be a samurai master. While some of the Japanese looks are a bit goofy, and many of the costumes are smaller than a mask that does’t even move the pieces when speaking, they are all played face to face and very attractive. Ay. It has some great cinemas, how to deliver a CGI film in the same decade. Watched in the right mood for the right friends, it’s fun, touching and touching.

This parade is otherwise known as the Big Monster War in the past. The first instalment in Yukai features a tippet freak, a kappa water camp, a live brawl, a woman whose sheets can grow too big, a woman with a second face behind her head, a little priest who has great charm - like a wrist , and so on. This kind of hilarious animal not only comes from fiction, but also from the Tokugawa-era summer style of entertainment, which is compared to modern Halloween-inspired homes, thanks to ancient ""unusual shows"" but only Thanks to the unusual calls. Ghost and fish creatures and one-headed dance umbrellas are designed to generate ""cool"" warmth. The fat woman and so on were created by deceptive tactics, based on the beasts depicted in medieval scrolls. And while the design of this film is simple and sacred, it makes him more representative of what was historically recreated due to the cold of summer. These beloved beasts must confront and destroy the ancient Babylonian devil who came to Japan and transformed himself into a samurai king. Aside from the fact that some Japanese have very small shapes, and a lot more clothes than masks, they also talk while moving the clips, they are all very playful - very charming and very charming. It has the best cinematography, as can be given in the CGI film of the eighties. Seen in the right mood with the right friends, it's fun, dynamic and touching.

I was having a good time with some kind of ""Kevin Smith Matt Color Films"" wave until the movie got stuck on the floor and explored its themes in detail. Darker and more painful edge. Instead of focusing on the experience, I was brought forward. This is not a very good film of grace and certainly will not be the focus of worldwide attention. So I understand some of the negative reactions. But I bought it and really enjoyed it. Historically, the ""flashback"" type of movement worked, the characters were clearly seen and the issues raised were humane, accessible (in my experience, however) and attractive. I am fascinated by the film's ability to be humorous, witty and entertaining while not avoiding the crude language of controversial subject matter and emotion, flexibility and context.

Flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins: The virginal Mandy Lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school, and gets invited to spend a weekend at a branch by three guys who think they can get lucky, and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size. So. you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, who want to do nothing but have sex, do drugs and drink booze. The only other company is a chunky branch-hand who may for may not be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm. potential future suspect maybe? So as you're probably ascertained by now, all the house-guests send up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways, and for a change the black man ISN'T the first to die. There are some conventions that still hold up though, like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field. Or the flights going out mysteriously in the evening as your 'heroes' unwisely separate to tackle the problem. Even down to the so-called shocking twist at the send, the movie is like an old eighty's horror updated for the noughties, and on this score it succeeds. Unfortunately, it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise. People get cut up, shot, bludgeoned etc but because of their innate gratefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations, it's hard to care as the bodies stack up. Someone gets murdered, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, BANG they're brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we'll get a screenplay with plausible, intelligent, likable characters who make rational decisions but still send up being outwitted by a genius killer.

What about Sidney Toler? He is pretty decent but looks like the is straining to carry the film. What I noticed most was the way the film was shot. Chan director Phil Rosen, of whom I generally like most of this entries, uses lots of long shots with no action(like Charlie's initial walk into the house from outside). Why?

25931,"""The True Story Of The Friendship That Shook South Africa And Awakened The World."" Richard Attenborough, who directed ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""Gandhi"", wanted to bring the story of Steve Biko to life, and the journey and trouble that journalist Donald Woods went through in order to get this story told. The films uses Wood's two books for it's information and basis - ""Biko"" and ""Asking for Trouble"". The film takes place in the late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, in South Africa. South Africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid, which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and classifies the whites as the superior race. The blacks are forced to live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities and towns, and they come under frequent harassment by the police and the army. We are shown a dawn raid on a shantytown, as bulldozers and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants. Then we are introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), who is the editor of a popular newspaper. After publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods goes to meet with him. The two are wary of each other at first, but they soon become good friends and Biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to Woods. This encourages Woods to speak out against what's happening around him, and makes him desperate to bring Steve Biko's story out of the clutches of the white man's South Africa and to the world. Soon, Steve Biko is arrested and is killed in prison. Now Woods and this family are daring to escape from South Africa to England, where Woods can publish this book about Steve Biko and the apartheid. When I first heard of ""Cry Freedom"", I was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of Steve Biko. I had never actually heard of Steve Biko before I seen this film, as the events in this film were really before my time. But it's more about the story of Donald Woods and this journey across the border into Lesotho as the tried to elude the South African officials. Woods was put on a five year type house arrest after Steve Biko was killed. So in order to publish this manuscript on Steve Biko, the had to escape. Because the manuscript would be considered treason in South Africa and that could have resulted in Woods meeting a fate similar to that of Biko's. The real Donald Woods and this wife acted as consultants to this film. Denzel Washington is only in the film for the first hour, and I was disappointed with that as I was expecting to see him for the entire movie. But the was amazing as Steve Biko, and captured this personality from what I've read really well and this accent sounded perfect. His performance learned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Kevin Kline delivers a excellent and thought-evoking performance as Donald Woods, and Penelope Wilton is excellent as this wife Wendy. Filming took place in Zimbabwe, as needless to say problems arose when they tried to film it in South Africa. While in South Africa, the South African gestapo followed the film crew everywhere, so they got the bad vibes and they pulled out and went to neighbouring Zimbabwe instead. Despite everything, and the fact that the apartheid did't send 'til seven years later, ""Cry Freedom"" was't banned in South Africa. But cinemas showing the movie received bomb threats. Richard Attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination. He does't hold back at the send of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown, turns into a massacre when police open fire on them. The film ends with the names of all the anti-apartheid movers who died in prison, and the explanations for their deaths. Many had ""No Explanation"". Quite a few were ""Epilepsy"", which is hard to believe, and many more either fell from the top of the stairs for were ""Suicide from Hanging"". No one will never know what really happened to them, but I think it's fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands, but at the hands of others; for to be more precise, at the hands of the police. ""Cry Freedom"" is a must-see movie for it's portrayal and story of Steve Biko. It's also a searing and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the hellish grips of racial segregation and violence.",positive
25931,"""A true friendship story that has shaken South Africa and awakened the world."" The directors of ""The Bridge Are Very Far"" and Richard Attenborough of ""Gandhi"" hope to combine the Steve Biko story with the journey and the problems that journalist Donald Woods has gone to tell the story brought to life. The film uses two of Wood's books as information and a base - ""Report"" and ""Request a Problem"". The film took place in South Africa between the years one thousand and nine hundred and seventy. South Africa is under the control of a terrible apartheid system that separates blacks from whites and places whites as the upper class. Blacks were forced to live in shantytowns outside the cities, and they were constantly harassed by the police and the army. We saw slums in the middle of the night, tractors and armed police storming the camp, beating and killing residents. Then we were introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Klein), editor of a popular newspaper. After publishing a bad story about black fighter Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods went to meet him. The two were smart at first, but soon became real friends. Biko showed Woods the horrors of the apartheid system from the perspective of black people. This encouraged Woods to publicly denounce what was happening on all sides and made him want to take Steve Biko's story to white South African victims around the world. Soon, Steve Biko was arrested and executed in prison. Woods and this family now have the courage to flee South Africa to England, where Woods can publish this book on Steve Biko and apartheid. The first time I heard about “Freedom”, my idea was that it was a movie dedicated to the life of Steve Biko. Before I watched this movie, I never really heard about Steve Biko, because the events in this movie were happening right now. But it is about the story of Donald Woods and the across-border trip to Lesotho trying to stop South African officials. After Steve Biko was killed, Woods was sentenced to five years in prison. So in order to produce a manuscript for Steve Biko (Steve Biko), the had to flee. Because this manuscript could be considered a crime against South Africa, this could cause Woods to suffer as usual for Biko. The very best Donald Woods and the woman work as mentors for the film. Denzel Washington only appeared in the first hour of the film, and I was disappointed because I was looking forward to seeing him throughout the movie. But Steve Biko (Steve Biko) is really good, capturing this personality from what I've read, this speech sounds good. His performance learned him the nomination of Oscar as the most supportive factor. Kevin Kline played Donald Woods in excellent performance and thought provoking, while Penelope Wilton performed as well as this wife Wendy. Photography was done in Zimbabwe and, no doubt, problems arose when trying to photograph in South Africa. When they were in South Africa, the South African Gestapo followed the camera crew everywhere, so they had a bad situation and returned to Zimbabwe. Despite this, and the apartheid system did not disclose this fact until seven years later, South Africa did not shut down ""Cry Freedom."" But the cinema showing the film received bomb threats. Richard Attenborough conveys the fear of apartheid on the screen with great power and determination. When the test was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in this shack town, the did not hesitate to film, but when the police opened fire on them, it turned into a massacre. The film lists the names of all the anti-apartheid activists who died in prison and the cause of their deaths. Most people are ""without explanation."" Many are ""violent"", unbelievable, and many fall down the stairs for ""suicide."" No one will never know what happened to them, but I think it is right for these people to die not in their hands, but in the hands of others; exactly, they were in the hands of the police. ""Freedom Cry"" is a movie you should see because of its production and the story of Steve Biko. This is also a shocking and devastating demonstration of hell's dominion over the beautiful world of apartheid and violence.",positive

25931,"""The true story of the friendship that shook South Africa and woke up the world."" Richard Attenborough, director of “Very Far Bridge” and “Gandi”, would like to add to Steve Biko’s story, and the journey and hardship of journalist Donald Woods to tell it. The films use both Wood’s data base and its base - “Biko” and “Questioning the Problem”. The film takes place in the late nineteen hundred and seventies, South Africa. South Africa is in the grip of racial segregation, dividing blacks and whites into white races. Black people were forced to live under villages outside cities and towns, and faced constant harassment by the police and army. We were shown the early morning attack in a neighbourhood, with bulldozers and armed police walking into the camp beating and even killing residents. We were then introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), the editor of a popular newspaper. After a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington) is published, Woods will greet him. The two flirted at first, but soon became best friends and Biko showed the horror of the racist system from the perspective of black people all the way to Woods. It encourages Woods to face what is going on around him, and makes him desperate to get Steve Biko’s story out of the hands of white people in South Africa and the world. Immediately, Steve Biko was arrested and executed in prison. Now Woods and this family dare to flee South Africa to England, where Woods could publish a book about Steve Biko and racism. When I first heard about “Freedom of Shout”, I was under the impression that it was a film entirely dedicated to the life of Steve Biko. I certainly than’t heard of Steve Biko before I saw this film, because the events in this film were really my time. But it’s more about the story of Donald Woods and this journey across the Lesotho border as the tries to escape from South African officials. Woods was under house arrest for five years after Steve Biko was killed. Now in order for Steve Biko to publish this article, the has to run away. Because the texts would be considered treacherous in South Africa and that could cause Woods to face the same fate as Biko. The real Donald Woods and this wife became consultants for this film. Denzel Washington was in the film for the first time only, and I was disappointed because I expected to see him throughout the film. But it’s surprisingly like Steve Biko, who holds this personality for what I’ve read really well and this accent looks perfect. His performance learned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor Award. Kevin Kline offers great and thoughtful performance like Donald Woods, and Penelope Wilton is very good with this Wendy wife. The recording took place in Zimbabwe, and needless to say problems arose when they tried to film in South Africa. While in South Africa, the South African gestapo followed the film crew everywhere, so they were shocked and left and went to their neighbouring country of Zimbabwe. Despite everything, and the fact that racism did not transmit ‘until seven years later,‘ Freedom of Noise ’was not banned in South Africa. But the heaters showing the film received a bomb threat. Richard Attenborough brings racism and bigotry to the screen. He did not delay sending the film when the showed what was thought to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown, it turned into a massacre when police opened fire. The film ends with the names of all the racists who died in prison, and the description of their deaths. Many had “No Explanation”. Many were “paralyzed”, hard to believe, and many more fell down the stairs because of “Suicide”. No one will know what really happened to them, but I think it is fair to say that none of these men died on the one hand, but on the other; to be precise, police hand. “Freedom of Noise” is a visual film because it is this picture and Steve Biko’s story. It is also a very ugly and ugly scene depicting a beautifully divided land in a hell of apartheid and violence.",positive

25931,"""The true story of friendship in South Africa that shook the world"" is based on two books.

Richard Attenborough, director of “Long Bridge” and “Gandhi”, wanted to bring to life the story of Steve Biko, and the journey and hardship of journalist Donald Woods to see this story. No one will know exactly what happened to him, but I think it is fair to say that none of these men died by this own hand, but by other hands; to be precise, police hand.

25931,"""A true friendship story that shakes South Africa and revives the world."" Richard Attenborough, who directed ""A Bridge to Four"" and ""Gandhi"", wanted to revive the story of Steve Becko, as well as the journey and problem that journalist Donald Woods took to tell the story. The films use Wood's two books to explore their knowledge and basis - ""Report"" and ""Ask a Problem"". The film takes place in South Africa at the send of one thousand nine hundred and seventy. South Africa is at risk of horrific racism, which separates blacks from whites and calls whites racists. Blacks were forced to live in slums on the outskirts of towns and cities, and were often harassed by police and soldiers. We are shown the morning operation in a shut, when tractors and armed police pass by the camp and hit and kill civilians. We were then introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Klein), editor of the popular newspaper. After publishing a bad article about black activist Steve Baiko (Denzel Washington), Woods will meet him. The two are cautious at first, but soon become good friends, and Biko shows the horrors of the racist system from the black community to Woods. It encourages Woods to speak out against what is happening around him, and the wants to capture Steve Becko's story in white South Africa and the rest of the world. Soon, Steve Beko was arrested and changed. Now Woods and this family have the courage to flee South Africa to England, where Woods can publish a book about Steve Becko and colouring. When I first heard of ""Cry Freedom"", I got the impression that it was a film entirely dedicated to Steve Becko's life. I had never heard of Steve Beko before watching this movie, because the events of this movie were before my time. But this is the story of Donald Woods and this journey across the border to Lesotho as the tries to escape the South African authorities. Woods was sentenced to five years in prison after the murder of Steve Becko. So Steve Becko had to run to get this version published. Because the manuscript was considered a coup in South Africa, Woods faced the same fate as Beko. The film stars the real Donald Woods and this wife. Denzel Washington is only in the movie for an hour, and I was disappointed because I was expecting to see him in the whole movie. But it was as amazing as Steve Baiko, and the portrayed a character that I have read very well and this quote seems very accurate. Her performance learned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Kevin Klein is as beautiful and thoughtful as Donald Woods, and Penelope Wilton is as beautiful as Mrs. Wendy. The filming took place in Zimbabwe, as there was no need to mention issues when trying to make it in South Africa. When we were in South Africa, the South African Gestapo followed the film crew everywhere, so they gained notoriety and instead moved to neighbouring Zimbabwe. Despite all this, despite the fact that the colouring did not pass until seven years later, there was no ban on ""cry freedom"" in South Africa. But movie screens are receiving bomb threats. Richard Attenborough exposed the horrors of racism with great force and determination. He does not hesitate to publish a film showing the peaceful students protesting in the shut, which turned into a massacre when police opened fire on them. The film concludes with the names of all the anti-racist activists who died in prison, and details of their deaths. Many people had no ""details"". Very few people had ""epilepsy"", which is hard to believe, and many just fell down the stairs because they said ""hanging suicide"". No one will never know what really happened to them, but I think it is fair to say that none of them died at their own hands, but at the hands of others. More accurately, in the hands of the police. ""Cry Freedom"" is a film that should be seen in its coverage and the story of Steve Baiko. And it is a hot and damaging picture of a beautiful world trapped in a hell of division and racism and violence.",positive

31416,"This tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and swallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary Mid-Sommerish version of an old Joan Crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. Here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. A well-heeled London solicitor, (Tom Wilkinson), discovers that not only is this wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident. He throws up, but otherwise this stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers. Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing ""Gosford Park"", (this is this directorial debut), from a novel by Nigel Balchin, it's quite comical although I am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. It's like a throw-back to British films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books for plays rather than like people might in real life. However, it's not all bad. Wilkinson is terrific, even if you never believe in him as a person while Emily Watson, (the adulterous wife), and Rupert Everett, (the highly amoral high-class potty), are both very good at covering the cracks in the material.
