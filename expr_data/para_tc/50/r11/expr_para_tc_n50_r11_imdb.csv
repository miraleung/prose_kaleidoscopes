42678,"This movie was funny from START to FINISH. Everyone in the cinema was laughing out cloud throughout the film!! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the girl from Will and Grace) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters were't as funny even though the movie focused around them. All in all, this is a great movie to go and see with your girls (yes guys, it's a girlie movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!",positive

21239,"This film got roasted by the boys at MSTthreeK, but it's actually a neat and nasty piece of low-budget film nor. The plot is tight, the characters are believable (within the good-boy-gets-obsessed-with-bad-girl genre), the spacing is solid, the climax is well-handled, and the cast is bolstered by several fine character factors. True, most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but the's actually quite effectively creepy when the plays the mastermind.

3423,"Without Kirsten Miller this project need't have been completed. However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it. It looked as if the other factors were only playing to her strong performance. Wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but this few scenes did't detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen but alas I was fortunate to rent it before it was lost.",positive

Basically my critique goes hand in hand with the line of writing and conspiracy theories, the joint talent team did a brave job of saving what should have been a disaster.

She was embarrassing and the film just has this weird plot if that what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? I have never been so unsatisfied in my life. It was just total rubbish. I can't believe that the factors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. Have Sissy being 'beautiful' didst get to me. I thought she was everything but that. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHATS THE POINT??? zero out of ten, shame the poll doesnt have a zero, doesnt even deserve a one.

21995,"This was a very nice soft-core movie for both men and women. Plenty of nudity/sex, but without the overall branch you'll usually find. They could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning. Trust me guys, if you want to get your woman in the mood, get something with Bobby Johnston in it! And I'm sure lovely Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please PM me! I'd love to know. The photography was much better than usual.

Dan Kane, Christopher Lloyd, Marie Winningham, and Kirsten Storm are all around the main characters, and they're all different. For anyone who thinks this show is not theirs, please give it a try.

The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks.

Of these, ninety-nine films have tried to use Michael Curtis's best film, ""Dirty Faces with Angels."" Somehow curiosity about how Carson was used in the same way that luxury homeowners did in New York years later. There is a new reality in today's climate with lots of guns. The film should be seen only because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed them that they are together.

In the same way it is surprising how cars have been used in the same way as some of the poorest landlords in recent years in the same New York city. In today’s climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The film was worth watching because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that their marriage went well.

8709,"Goodnight Mister Tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised. It in't completely faithful to the book, but does it have to be? No, not at all. John Thaw is mesmerising as Tom Oakley. His transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised, making it more believable than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, this is Thaw's finest hour. He was matched earnestly by a young Nick Robinson, who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with this mother. The script and music made it worth the buy, and you also see Thaw playing the morgan. Amazing!

47780,"Although this movie is not enough in this regard, it is still a good addition to the series, even if it was the wrong place during the stupid fashion and new wave music. Thankfully, the movie took some time to develop a different kind of story, which could also embarrass Harry and the whole genre. Callahan sometimes seems weak and out of place, but this character remains unwavering. As Harry Callahan grows up, the ""old man with a chip on this shoulder"" can't help but finally the story has to play out.",positive
47780,"Although the film is slow to do so, the series is still very good, albeit a bit out of place during the silly fashion and music trends of the New Wave. Unfortunately, this film took a while to come up with a similar storyline, which could be a remake of Dirty Harry and all genres. Callahan, who at times seems delicate and out of place, this character is still inseparable. With Harry Callahan waking up for years, the inevitable old man with shoulder to shoulder will finally get into the game.",positive

Even though its very flat in comparison to a lot of this other work but its Argento and this may be biased but I'm gonna be giving it a good review anyway. It does contain a lot of good ideas. The subtle voyeuristic element. The needles under the eyes. The gory and disturbing deaths. And the Argento clické flashback. Downsides include the heavy metal soundtrack, acting and the ending. All the film is made worth it for the birds in the theatre sequence near the send. A fairly good film from Argento but the as done better. A lot better!",positive

A hidden virological object. Needles under the eyes. A painful and disturbing death. And click Argento back. Downsides include heavy metal singing, limitation and ending.

I have to admit I have a particular penchant for the humour and story telling style of British movies, though not all of course, succeed. Its about character development and relationships, truth and lies, and whether love is sometimes simply not enough. Some very nicely understated acting from all the participants, especially the two leads, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. An intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed, but also capable of facts of genuine graciousness. This film made me think, and left me in the send with a quiet smile on my face.",positive

If you don't like that kind of humour then don't bother. I love this film and have grown up with these comedy programmes, for me this film is simply placing their comic genius on the big screen. It is not an award winner by any means but if you just want good wholesome slapstick then this is it!the film blacks the quality of the TV series and this is usually the case with films but it still has enough material to keep you laughing even if a lot of the jokes are pretty similar to their previous work.yes, the humour is a little childish and not to everyone's taste but sometimes you just need that in a film.",positive

9927,"The Story line for this game is very jerky where it appears the game writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in Tales of the Soul. That being said, this is the only gripe I have about the game. The beginning FMV is spectacular with breath taking sceneries and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and their own Martial Arts discipline. There's even a second story mode which makes up for the awkward Story design of Tale of the Souls. Parts of the FMVs during Tale of the Souls is also interactive where you can decide the fate of your Character to a certain degree which is an interesting feature. With the many combinations of Characters you can create, the varied paths you can explore in Tales of the Souls and the Chronicle of Swords story mode, this game will keep any Beatem up/RPG fans amused for a while!",positive

32751,"I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch. Ben's character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes the goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say the has a future in acting after Harry Potter. Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Ben's over protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too. Villain-y. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to this mother, and in the send the is quite honourable too. The only character i was't keen on was Bryony, she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thought.

It blows my mind everytime I go into a video store and Boyz 'n the Hood is in the 'Drama' section while Cooley High is in 'Comedy'. It's an embarrassing disgrace.
