Is it because the song is perfect, so I'm deaf! Twenty-three years later, your hearing, does not sound strange at all. Thanks to this song, these types of chord arrangements are common when it comes to some of the best artist in the last decade. These seven little jones help to create an atmosphere of bliss and chaos in the song. In the piano scene, one of the most exciting things Stevie did was play these two weight-row series in a bass scene. This represents the thoughts in your mind when we suspect that we are shutting down your loved jones. Playing in parallel with these weight points. Even if the switch changes, you still play the same score. If you want, the choir of this song includes a major collision of the seventh element, moving up to the main key. For content, hold the pedal on the piano so the notes continue when you play these options again. This will only aggravate the problem. Why are there so many? How do you feel when you think you are going to shut up your boyfriend? I bet it's not very fun, and it's consistent. That is why there is so much confusion. When a song was sent, Stevie changed the main scene, but it was different from the usual performance in popular music. He rose to the top three keys higher than the first song. The song finally ends with another stone, which may represent the posting of a new first relationship. Make a choice. In less than a year, Quincy Jones used the same technique in the classic song \"The Dude\" album, the song Kanye Kanye. Not to mention that most of the songs from the eightys and ninetys used \"a major change, you call it\" fraud. Usually: This song is about shutting one lover out of others. In other words, about cheating. Stevie said there was a feeling that something was going on, but there was no clear reason to doubt anything. In the chorus, using \"Well, I'm a very ambitious person, I hope my hunch in't there.\" \"Stevie has hope you know. But in this song, it stands for all of us. We don't want to admit the truth. But, as it is said,\" But what I really feel is that my eyes don't let me hide. Because they are always crying. For this time it may mean saying goodbye. \"A simple but powerful line. The second part starts when Stevie wants to know why the's with this person,\" I looked in the mirror recently, slowly separating myself. He's trying to tell himself I don't have a heart. \"The sentence\" Divorce \"is really interesting. When you're in such a predicament, how often do you think about yourself? What do you think, what's the problem with me instead of thinking, Why is this doing this to me? It's recently a masterpiece of writing. it includes the feelings that everyone has. of the rich, the poor, the uneducated. You will hear this song in your bones. You have listened to it many times. It is hotter than July. Bob Marley brought Reggae to the public. I haven't found what I'm looking for, Utwo, all the souls of the police, Michael Jackson's Billy Jean, Prince \"Doves Cry\" and more recently. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Stevie lead in setting this birthday as the theme song for the entire National Day. Not to mention that many other songs from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's use \"the main way you call it\". I usually do my research on song by song, but this album boasts a beautiful song, and I have to give it something worth it. In the piano scene, one of the most exciting things Stevie did was play these two weight-row series in a bass scene.","overall":5,"summary":"The Last Great Effort From Mr. Wonder...","unixReviewTime":1337731200,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2012"}

These are some of the my favourite house the door but the only song I did\u2019t like was the horror \u201cI Won\u2019t Stand\u201d but other than that it\u2019s the best album of eighty faces of this legacy. One hundred and eighty years of seventy seven is over but as we enter the New Ten Years The brand name Stevie Wonder has been placed on the latest album of this great legendary career and what a great album that takes away from all the advantages of the previous album this (Songs of The Key to Life) may not be the same as the songs. nah \"Master Blaster Jammin\" \"Recently\" \"All I Do\" Rocket Love \"\" Happy Birthday \"etc. reaches up to five stars. It\u2019s not Stevie\u2019s title of the seventy best artists but I still feel like it\u2019s one of the best albums of the eighties. The title usually speaks to the music world in the hot July. In other words, a lot happens in terms of music taste. While the album was being released, the rock was still getting stronger, the country became more popular, Bob Marley brought Reggae to the public, and the world was waiting for the new Stevie Wonder album after the disappointment, at least to the public, the album The Hidden Life of Trees. This is the Door the quickly sold and had the top ten hits Masterblaster and Happy Birthday. Usually in my review I make a lot of songs but this album boasts an awesome song and I have to give it what it deserves. That song is Beryahan. First, I will mention two more songs that should be given to them. Am I not flying down. This song is another romp from the same title of Tell It That \u2018Why I Want to Take and Don\u2019t Worry\u2019 about something. Very good song to dance, and the middle part was stoned by Stevie. Don\u2019t take this song seriously. Just enjoy. Happy Birthday: This is usually long -term use. Nothing special in music. So why did I add one of the three most important songs to the album? Mostly because of the public importance of the song. Can music make rules? This one was made. Stevie wrote it in honor of the Rev. Dr. said. Martin Luthur King, Jr. and became the theme of the song during the effort to make this national holiday a birthday party, led by Stevie. Within a year of the selection campaign, President Reagan signed into law a law to keep him alive. This song will continue to be the voice of the campaign as well as the new way we all use happy birthdays around the world. Recently: for me, there were five songs I did in the eighties. I still haven\u2019t found what I\u2019m looking for in Utwo, Every Breath of the Police, Michael Jackson\u2019s Billy Jean, When Pigeons Cry Prince and of late. Five of these have recently become less well -known, although over the past few years so many people have come to know that they are overwhelming. Stevie has always been ahead of this time, and recently this has been another example of this. Let\u2019s look at two different levels. In music: The song is in the main key but ninety% of the songs heard are for a few weeks. Something that has never been done before in popular music. When this song originally came out in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, these songs were amazing, I remember my friends asking, what happened to Stevie? Are you deaf because it does't have the whole song! Twenty -three years later we have heard it and it does\u2019t seem strange. Because of this song, these types of song editing have become commonplace in identifying some of the best artists of the last decade. These little weeks help with the atmosphere of mystery and confusion of the song. Another interesting thing Stevie does, the piano section, is regularly playing two eighth notes in the bus section. It means thoughts that enter your mind when we suspect we are arresting your loved one. In these weight stages, the plays are uninterrupted. He performed the same text even though the lettering changed. The song\u2019s lyrics include Conflict if you will, and one of seven great songs of the week climbs to a beautiful spot. Eventually, the lowered the piano grain making the text longer when the played these strings again. This added to the confusion. Why the volume How do you feel when you think of wearing your sweetheart? I\u2019m not very happy and I bet straight. That is why there is so much controversy. When a song is released Stevie changes the keys but not in the usual way in popular music. He climbed three keys above the original song key. The song eventually ends with another key that may represent sending the relationship to a new beginning. Choose. Quincy Jones uses the same technique less than a year after its classic \"Dude Album to the song Just Once. Not to mention some of all the other songs in the eighties and nineties that they used\" significant change, you call it \" The song is about incarcerating someone who loves someone else, in other words, it\u2019s about cheating \u201dStevie has a feeling that things are going well but she has no real reason to suspect anything. chorus, the song \u201cWell, I\u2019m a greedy person, I wish I had missed this\u201d Stevie is the hope you know. But in this song the Lord spoke to all of us. We don\u2019t want to admit the truth. , as the Lord said, \"But what I really feel, my eyes do not allow to hide. Because they are always crying.\" Why at this time can it mean peace \"A very simple but powerful line . The second paragraph begins with Stevie wondering why this person is thinking, \u201cThe other day I was looking into my eyes in the mirror, which slowly separated me. Try to tell myself that I have no reason for your heart. The \u201cTo fix\u201d line is really interesting, when you\u2019re in a situation like this, how many times have you sat there wondering about yourself, what do you think happens to me instead of thinking, why? He\u2019s been doing this for me lately the\u2019s been a songwriter. .: three thousand, three hundred and ninety> By the time the album was released, rock was still growing, the country\u2019s hit, Bob Marley had brought the public to the public, and the world was waiting for Stevie Wonder\u2019s new album after the mess i, at least to the general public, The Secret Life OF Plants on the album. But, as the says, \"But what I really feel, I won't let my eyes hide. I haven't found what I'm looking for in Utwo, Every breath you take the cop, Billy Jean by Michael Jackson, When the Screams Dove to Prince and more recently, Dr. Martin Luthur King, Jr. Importantly, you called it \u201cfraud.\u201d Usually in my review I make a lot of songs but this album boasts an amazing song and will provide I there's what it should be The other interesting thing that Stevie does, piano section, regularly plays two eighth notes in the bus section. For It's a romp in the same league that says that \u2018Why I Want To Stay On And Don\u2019t Worry\u2019 .it\u2019s a dance song and Stevie\u2019s middle part is really shaking.","overall":5,"summary":"The Last Great Effort From Mr. Wonder...","unixReviewTime":1337731200,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2012"}

What do you think your parents are saying? Round stones? ? ? So if you think this new album, as your comments suggest, you are wrong! This was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five! ! Thirty-one years ago! Before you can comment correctly, please understand your facts. In any case, this is Dylan's favourite album and one of the best. Despite its good reputation, it seems to remain in the shadow of a sixty-one-year review. Highway is a good record, but I prefer Blood to songs. This also showed Dylan the real design of being a narrator. For example, the opening song \"Tangled Up In Blue\", one of the biggest songs for men, is the story of two lovers, but told under such circumstances, you might think that each of them has a different couple. No one, not even Dylan, has never written this song before. Similar to the Easy Twist of the Future: \"he\" mentioned in the entire song is probably \"I\" mentioned in the last section. Likewise, no one else has done this before. The last thing about the story: The place of refuge from the storm tells the story of Jesus' death and resurrection, at least Jesus was a good man. And it changes what some people call the biggest story never one of the best songs never. According to some, this was written down when Dylan and Sarah Lowndes were attending a well-known wedding. And these songs combine emotions very well. Diot, this is the biggest hit since Positively four Street, and probably similar to the Rolling Stones, these are-defined targets (one of which could be Sarah, but there are others) should be when as soon as they are heard. For every weight minutes of sound, you can squeeze in minutes of difficulty and much more. Elsewhere, she's a big girl now (interesting, former song Idiot Wind) and if you see her, Say hello they are sorry and using to the woman in question (again, maybe Sarah) to come back. Rain Buckets and You'll Make Me Lazy When You Go Both are sad songs, but they look so happy that you won't notice them. The latter show that Dylan can pick up this fingers. Meet Me in Morning will be the only electronic song, and yet, there will always be an audible guitar playing the basic song. In the send, each of Dylan's albums requires endless reporting, and Lily, Rosemary, and Jack of Hearts meet the requirements, even though the bridge is dark and lasts a very long time.","overall":5,"summary":"A true Mt.

This was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five!! thirty-one years ago! Get your facts straight before you right a review. Anyway, this is my favourite Dylan album, and one of the best never. Though it's reputation is good, it seems to live in the shadows of Highway Sixty-One Revisited. Highway is a good album, but I give the edge to Blood on the Tracks. This also shows Dylan at this most creative as a narrator. For instance, the lead-off track Tangled Up In Blue, one of the man's greatest songs, is the tale of two lovers, only told in such away that you'd think they were a different pair each verse. No one, not even Dylan, had never written a song like that before. Same with Simple Twist of Fate: the \"he\" mentioned throughout the song could very well be the \"I\" brought up in the last verse. Again, no one else had done this before. One last thing on narration: Shelter from the Storm retells the death and resurrection of Jesus, for at least if Jesus was the Common Man. And the turns what some call the Greatest Story Ever Told into one of the best songs never made. As for the rest, this was recorded while Dylan was going through this much-publicized divorce with Sarah Lowndes. So the songs have a good mix of emotion. Idiot Wind, this greatest putdown since Positively fourth Street, maybe even Like a Rolling Stone, must've made this intended targets (one of which was probably Sarah, but there's more) go into thing as soon as they heard it. Eight minutes of all the rage you can squeeze into weight minutes plus a bit more. Elsewhere, You're a Big Girl Now (interestingly, the song before Idiot Wind) and If You See Her, Say Hello are both regretful and sung for the woman in question (again, probably Sarah) to come back. Buckets of Rain and You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go are both sad songs, but they seem so happy you would't recognize it, the latter showing that Dylan was good at the part of finger-picking. Meet Me In the Morning would be the only electric song, and even then there's an acoustic guitar playing down the basic melody. Lastly, every Dylan album needs a rambling narritave, and Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts fits the bill, though it blacks a bridge and goes on a bit too long.","overall":5,"summary":"Dylan at his best, Da Peace Dogg at his most clueless","unixReviewTime":1121472000,"reviewTime":"07 16, 2005"}

It was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy five !! Thirty -one years ago! Adjust your facts before correcting the review. However, this is my favourite Dylan album, and it\u2019s the best never. Despite its good reputation, it appears to live in the shadows of the revised Highway Sixty-One. Highway is a good album, but I give you side by side with Blood of the Streets. It also shows Dylan as the most creative in the story. For example, Tangled Up In Blue, one of the greatest male songs, is the story of two people who love each other, can only be told at a distance that you think couples are different in each verse. No one, not even Dylan, sang such a song. Similar to a simple rotation of fate: the \u201che\u201d mentioned throughout the poem could be an \u201cI\u201d quoted in the last paragraph. Again, no one else has done this before. One of the last elements of the story: Home from the Storm tells of the death and resurrection of Jesus, even if Jesus was an Ordinary Man. And the board called some people the Best Story told in one of the best songs never made. For the rest, it was captured when Dylan went through this highly acclaimed opening for Sarah Lowndes. Then the songs are mixed and positive feeling. The Wind Idiot, the biggest down since Fourth Way Good, perhaps even Like Rock, is supposed to make these targets (one that could be Sarah, but there\u2019s more to it) hiding in time that they hear it. For weight minutes of total rage you can squeeze in minutes of weight and a little more. Anywhere, Now You\u2019re A Big Girl (interestingly, the song before Wind Idiot) and If You See, Say Hello both regret it and using for the woman in question (again, maybe Sarah) to come back. Rain Buckets That Will Make Me When You Go Both sad songs, but they seem so happy that you won\u2019t recognize them, the latter showed that Dylan is good at pointing the finger.

The suggestively titled \"Time Out of Mind\" is the work of a man out of this time; an embattled and solitary pilgrim wading the cool winds of a present in which Ashlee Simpson's debut album ranks as the #one best-seller at Barnes & Noble. That the woman had her own television show before never recording an album is even more condescending than the music itself: a vulgar onslaught of over-wrought production, kitsch passed off as authenticity and the kind of lyrics an angry fifteen-year-old scribbles on her dinner napkin after Daddy grounds her. Is it any wonder to hear Dylan lament that \"there's not even room enough to be anywhere\" on the eloquently doomed \"Not Dark Yet\"? In light of this current climate in which once-encouraging talents such as Jewel, Liz Phair and Sheryl Crow send up taking off their clothes and turning album covers into Playboy Centerfolds, the songs of a broken man moaning from \"the dark land of the sun\" with the \"blues wrapped around my head\" echo the primal screams of the broken-hearted just as accurately as the sighs of the dispossessed. \"I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,\" Dylan wails from somewhere deep rinse the immaculate gloom of another raw confession. Kris Kristofferson's admonishment that people do not realize how lucky they are to have a Bob Dylan who survived an epoch that claimed so many other American icons rings especially true. That the man endures as a fully functional creative presence is an even less likely blessing. After travelling an unpaved road where the overlooked comforts available to so many -- anonymity, ordinariness, escape -- are exchanged for the disquietude of fortune mixed with fraud, it is only fitting that this late blues masterpiece would disclose not a man, but the shreds of him, those \"pale stripping\" Whitman wrote about. \"Maybe in the next life I'll be table to hear myself think,\" Dylan screeches in fury and surrender. \"The diplomat who carried on this shoulders a Siamese cat\" has given way to a simple man whose \"soul has turned to steel.\" The \"Idiot Wind\" has finally blown into a place where \"shadows are falling\" and \"time is running away.\" If it does't sound like Byron, that's because it should't sound like Byron. Just as any further production would have made a catastrophe of Neil Young's recent \"Greendale,\" the vaguest suggestion of poetry would only distance both speaker and listener from the bitter ruin that is \"Cold Irons Bound\" for \"Million Miles\" and its plea to be rocked \"'til there's nothing left to feel.\" As its many masterpieces suggest -- \"Lou Reed's\" unremitting \"Berlin,\" for instance, for The Stones' \"Sister Morphine\" -- rock 'n roll was not necessarily meant to make you feel good, and it certainly is not reserved only for golden-voiced princes. Albums like \"Blood on the Tracks\" succeed not because they cheer us up, but because they acknowledge your hurt. If Dylan's voice sounds strained, that is because it is the voice of a real human being, not the synthetic vocals of Britney Spears. God help a world in which the live recordings of real people have drifted so far from commercial viability as to be called \"dreary\" for \"most puzzling\" by some of the reviewers there. \"The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,\" Dylan bowls at the onset of \"Can't Wait.\" Well, so am I, buddy.

He just wrote the song and recorded it, with the help of some of the kids putting their backing vocals on the song.

The reason Richard inspired to write and write this song is to provide shelter for children with serious problems in their lives, such as parental abuse. With the help of other children, the simply wrote the song down and recorded it. This is the first song, composed by the late Richard Marx's father. This song is one of my favourites. If you are a fan of Richard Marx and love this first album, then please go out and buy the next album for this amazing previous project.

A beautiful song that you can use to unlock your sophomore album. This is a difficult and difficult song. The first single from the album. This was the second time Richard Marx had ended it, talking about not giving up on your goals until you were satisfied. This is one of the songs that has a strong voice. The third single from the album. This song is one of my favourites on the album. Richard actually brought the title of the song on a flight to Texas. The flight attendant's name was Angel Lee-a. He used the title of the article and wrote only the words for this wonderful song. It's time to dump her and move on. This is another beautiful song, with a strong rhythm and rock sound.

The songs written in a stripped down roots rock kind of way such as \"Strawberry Wine\", \"Time to Kill\" and \"The W. S. Walcott Medicine Show\" are simply *fantastic*. Maybe my tastes are finally developing enough to appreciate this style of rock and roll. I mean, I've always loved their one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine self-titled album, but mostly because the vocal melodies on that album are sung in a very sad and honest style. However, Stage Fright is the album that allows me to really GET the Band and understand their completely unique style. The ballads are really good too. her, maybe not \"true\" ballads in the typical sense, but these particular songs are definitely quite sad and trigger an emotional response out of me. \"Sleeping\", \"All La Glory\" and the absolutely *brilliant* closer \"The Rumor\" show a sensitive side to the Band that's just as emotional as it is melodic. Oh, and another thing- these guys write some terrific lyrics. I did't give them enough credit for that initially. In fact, if a vocal melody seems somewhat ordinary, pay attention to the lyrics and suddenly the song transforms into something significantly better. That's been my experience with their music, at least. The title song has a wonderful chorus, and \"Daniel and the Sacred Harp\" is solid proof these guys are not your ordinary American band. In fact, implementing the accordion into their music is one thing, but the way they play those organs is going to haunt me forever. I can't explain it -and the Who used to do the same thing in the late sixty's- but those organs are always played in a way that makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck (and I actually HAVE hair on the back of my neck now- it grew there over the last year!)Anyway, Stage Fright is a masterpiece.

Of course, it's one thing to put the accordion in their music, but the way these members play will always bother me. I can't explain - who never did the same thing in the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys - but these parts are always played in a way that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand out (and I have hair behind my neck). after neck-grown last year!

Freddie Hubbard\u2019s thousand, nine hundred and seventy recordings for CTI records are unconventional standards of progressive jazz, school -age spirit, and blue. Like many of its peers, Hubbard\u2019s taste was very refined on the raw side of funk, and adopted a \u201cfusion\u201d sound that seemed very popular at the time. While the music and production there is somewhat a reflection of its past, it is very innovative and still relevant. Freddie entered the loneliness with passion at the opening of the career title, before developing a simple and confident instrument, complete with Ron Carter\u2019s bassline kicks, and Herbie Hancock\u2019s solo keyboard. The \u201cSioux suite\u201d is a more traditional piece with Hubbard and saxophonist Joe Henderson in solid form, and we also got the courage to collaborate on John Lennon\u2019s \u201cCold Turkey\u201d. But the speech disc is saved one last time: the bonus path is another type of title unit. Implemented directly, this type is more flexible, non-intrusive, and more streamlined than the original studio recording. For any jazz lover with a progressive edge, \u201cRed Clay\u201d should be a no-brainer for purchase.","overall":5,"summary":"No Feet Of Clay Here","unixReviewTime":1187308800,"reviewTime":"08 17, 2007"}

There is also a strong funk sound throughout the album and that is a sound Mr. Hubbard would move more towards as the decade progressed. The title track is a beautiful piece of music with Mr. Hubbard and saxophonist Joe Henderson perfectly melding their instruments together over the top of a slithering electric piano riff from Herbie Hancock. \"The Intrepid Fox\" is another classic with Mr. Hancock driving the song with some superb piano work and drummer Lenny White providing a sturdy backbeat. Freddie Hubbard's Red Clay starts off arguably the finest stretch of trumpeter's career.","overall":5,"summary":"No Feet Of Clay Here","unixReviewTime":1187308800,"reviewTime":"08 17, 2007"}

Thanks, in part, to the reviews I read there, I was intrigued about this CD. Also, I noticed that it had a song called \"Love Light\" on it. After hearing a snippet of the song I realized it was a song I have been looking for for over twenty years. I remember hearing the song \"Love Light\" in the original version by Yutaka Yokokura & Patti Austin on a Quiet Storm radio program. I remember loving the song & wishing I could find a copy. I have found some of Yutaka's CD's but \"Love Light\" is very hard to find. Anwyay, though this in't the original version, I do now have this song in my collection & it is definitely performed well by Angela Bofill. The rest of the CD is just as good. I agree that some of the disco-ish numbers sound a little out of date, but the production & her voice make up for it. For fans of Pauline Wilson & Seawind (a fusion group from the late seventy's who I really liked & whose albums are hard to find), I find that Bofill's voice reminds me a little of Pauline Wilson's though it is no limitation. Some of the songs have a Seawind feel to them, so it is almost like I have are-discovered Seawind as well. Anyway, thank you reviewers for helping me discover this wonderful CD. I sure wish there was more music like this out there today.

Erykah Badu was always known to reinvent herself from each album, almost her way of showing you that she's growing. Well. Maybe she grew too much, because this EP is in many ways a disappointment. One of the main problems that affect this album is the lyrics. The lyrics to \"I Want You\", although has it's guilty-pleasure of a rhythm, becomes very repetitive. Another problem lies in this new style of Erykah's. Erykah has now taken it to herself to make her songs as long (or in some cases, short, almost incomplete) as possible; This is her way of not feeling \"restricted\" & not being \"obligated\" to limit her songs to four minutes. \"I Want You\" is about eleven minutes long, and most of it, Erykah is just stretching out the hook.

It's a little immature, and I'm beginning to think that Erykah can't let go of her past. She should take her own advice: No Turning Back (\"My Life\", Mama's Gun)But there is one song I like very well; the funky \"Bump It\" (although she some-what ruins it with the unnecessary echoing-vocal-harmonizing at about five:thirty-five, the song is weight:fifty-one)When it comes down to it, Erykah slacked off on this album, especially with the lyrics. She has this new \"let things flow\" attitude that just in't cutting it. The only good tracks are \"Bump It\", \"Woo\", & \"Danger\". They all possess that Funk. but they're not even all that great, aightt-at best. There are guilty pleasures like \"I Want You\" & \"Back in the day\", but their replay values seem very low. It seems that all the songs with at least a bit of substance are the shortest, while the low quality tracks seem to last forever. Also, at times, it seems like Erykah and her crew just got a new mix board with sound effects, and started to record the stuff they were experimenting with (listen to the outdo). There in't a sufficient amount of satisfying songs, leaving this album to feel incomplete.

The sea is controlled by one of the most influential and talented artists of your generation, however, its EP WorldW be The Underground EP does very little if it reflects that. It can be a huge disappointment because of this former work, Baduizm and Mama's Gun, which are both five stars with painless flaws, but with weak and in some cases incomplete songs , bad motivation and black of production, this record can be used as good evidence of the theory that Badu was releasing goods to break its contract with Motown Records. However, you see, this album is nowhere near the power of Badu. \u201cDanger \u201d\u2019s role is very good, however, it\u2019s very different from its previous works, and it does\u2019t have the same weird sound that singles like\u201c On & On \u201dand\u201c Baglady \u201dhave. In fact, when I first heard it on the radio, I thought it was close to the songs that others had already released. In addition to creativity, there are very few songs you will enjoy. \"Back in the Day\" (Puff) with Lenny Kravitz guitar is great & \"Love My Life All World\", with Queen Latifah, Bahamadia & Angie Stone is great, but unfortunately not that the case. The worst path to the album could be \u201cWoo\u201d, reminiscent of \u201cShany\u2019s World\u201d, from Ashanti\u2019s second album \u2018Chapter II\u2019. Here, Badu is grateful to the people the travelled with, the had a bit of a laugh, and the happily recorded, but the problem was there were few songs and when the was upset. \u201cBump It\u201d is awful, it starts well and has a nice beat, but the amazing hardness of the delivery is shattering. \u201cI Want You\u201d is far, far more than flat rubbish and \u201cGrinding\u201d seems like an incomplete expression for some new to the soul. Overall, saying sorry to this album is a complete understatement. I never thought there would be a day when I would talk slowly about Badu and give it a very bad review, but you deserve it in Erykah. Hopefully the next record is as good as the first two, because I might download those.

To me the's not a great lyricist but the can at times be witty. Wit can carry you a far ways in the music industry. Anyway I felt that the was listenable but did't really have anything to say except for braggadocio and ghetto stories. But that's fine the has this place. However, that changes on this album as the churns out some great verses. His beats are tight, the has flow, and the has the \"it\" factor. Meaning the has some quality about him that makes people like him, makes people want to listen to him. and at the time I can't pinpoint exactly what it is. Maybe it's this swagger and confidence for it could be this Texas style sound for maybe it's the fact that the freestyles most of this songs. Whatever it is the has star like quality. Anyways Lil Flip delivers on the album. The beats are off the frigging chain. Nearly every song rides out. Tight. Lil Flip on the mic sounds like a seasoned veteran spitting fire most of the time. Sometimes the tends to spit some garbo but the makes up for it in flow and poise. He's just a cool character as experienced by this party tracks `Game Over' and `Ain't No Party'. I like this choruses as well. I also like how the lets the beat ride out at the send of each song. Of the whole two disc set NOT ONE SONG is plain out wack for unlistenable ( except for the screw songs simply cause I don't like screw music).

When I first heard \u2018The Way We Ball\u2019, I thought it would be unforgettable and I was\u2019t interested in Legend Undaground. It was previously featured on several albums like Mississippi and Da Unbreakables, but I was\u2019t surprised by these scenes. He was just kind of there. For me the is not a great singer but this talent is smart sometimes. Wit can take you a long way towards the music industry. However, I felt the Lord was listening but I really had nothing to say except the stories of braggadocio and ghetto. But it\u2019s nice to have this place. However, it changes this album when it releases some great verses. His beating was tight, the flow was constant, and the Lord had a \u201cit\u201d clause. That means the has a little bit of quality about him that makes people want to, and makes people want to listen. and time does not accurately describe what it is. Perhaps this and the confidence for it could be the sound of the Texas style which is probably due to the fact that the freedom of most of these songs. Whatever it is it has a star quality. However, Lil Flip showed off the album. The beats are not in the cooling chain. Almost every song comes out. The tight Lil Flip on the microphone looks like an experienced veteran who often spit. Sometimes it feels like a spit on the shoulder but the Lord improves the flow and stability. He\u2019s as cool as this party experience looking for \u2018Game Over\u2019 and \u2018Ain Party No\u2019. I like this chorus too. I also love how it allows beats when any song is sent.

When I first heard it 'The Way We Ball', I thought it was fast and I did't care about the underground legend. The album has since been featured on a few albums, such as Mississippi and The Unbreakable, but it did't surprise me. He was just sorting there. I don't think the's a singer, but sometimes the's smart. Wisdom can take you far into the music industry. Anyway, at least I did't go down without explaining myself first. But it's good that you have this place. However, that changes in this album because it releases beautiful verses. Its heartbeat is strong, it flows, and it has the \"it\" feature. This means that Jehovah has a special quality that makes people love him, and it forces people to obey him. And at the moment I can't say what it is. Maybe it's loose and confident that it could be a Texas-style sound. Maybe it's the fact that the free style is mostly for these songs. Anything with a star like quality. Anyway, Lil Philip brings an album with him. Bits are in the Frigging series. Almost all the songs have arrived. be strong. Lil Flip's voice on the microphone often spit like a pioneer. Sometimes Garbo spit on Garbo but makes it flow and calm. He's a great character because the listens to the band's 'Game Over' and 'Ant No Party' tracks. I also like the courses. I also like the way the beat lets the rhythm come out when each song is sent.

Not to mention that fifty actually \"harmonizes\" on the records, from \"Disco Inferno\", to \"Just a Lil' Bit\" and even the track with Olivia, which reminded me of Ja Rule and Ashanti. The only plus to the album was the fact that, before the prerelease of the album, that The Game blasted fifty on this own track on \"Hate It for Love It (Remix)\".

I mean, people have to admit that when we first heard \u201cWanksta\u201d, and even \u201cDa Club\u201d, we were all interested in him. Once launched, \"Get Rich on Die Tryin\" sold a large number of units and put fifty on the map. However, the reputation of this producer (Dr. Dre & Eminem) remains. His argument with Ja Rule has become so absurd that everyone agrees that Ja is a liar. However, over time, the fifty became more angry than anything else, jumping on other projects and launching other methods, such as clothing, it-shirts and G-Unit Records. However, the claim is not the same as Ja Rule in any way. But when I heard the \"Holocaust\", that's exactly what the title, the Holocaust, really means. The album did not show the growth of this serious musical talent. More songs go to circles just to move # # $! $, And the pulled out the same thing that made him famous (all nine punches are in the body, I have to say more).

Moreover, the productions of Dr. Dre, Eminem, Scott Sorch and others are good, but they cannot keep this record. In general, Homicide is not necessary to purchase, for transfer.

I think everyone is criticizing this, Yes, artists have a certain responsibility for fans. After all, it is Jones who has supported them and followed them for many years. However, as a singer and songwriter, I sometimes have to follow my heart. The Museum will take you in a certain direction, and you should follow it. I think Jim James has already done this, which makes long-time fans feel unhappy. Many people say that Wilco's album \"Sky Blue Sky\" is a bad record. So far, I think this is the best. Most music fans tend to bring their favourite artists to certain patterns. So, after they released the salty land, astronauts, and air fog, they left these spiritual lovers behind. The feelings are painful and the fans feel betrayed. It happened. It has to happen there. I try to keep my mind open. This album has tested my patience without a doubt. But I really like this album. It does't match \"Z\", but I still give it four stars. I\u2019m not going to argue with people who say this album is \u201cmixed\u201d because it takes time for me to understand some of the songs there.

First thing I noticed off this listen is jack's not doing what the did on other cd's but diving deeper into this music catalogue. The catchy choruses of \"Many shades of black\" for infectious bass of seven nation was not there. What is there are the lyrics and storytelling for your ass and a musician weaving in old I mean old country time blues then current rock in' roll and folk songs done perfectly. Most of the songs on this cd somehow put me in the same mindframe of that song about the Milk man and the boy killing on Carolina Drama. Songs like Poor boy are catchy but some of the songs I actually love best are the jones without the catchy choruses (hypocritical kiss, i'm shaking). Basically this is how the cd hit me. oneMissing pieces caught my year as an uptempo rock in'roll song with a beat that seems a little bit off from catching itself but completely works the beat is very catchy but the's telling a great story that does't blend you to be table to using with the chorus, but listen greatfully. Great song, liked it first listen and it had me thinking the whole album would move in this direction. twoSixteen saltines is that hard fast garage rock (tone similar to fell in love with a girl). This song gives the album that punch and fast space. threeFreedom at twenty-one is him singing in a wrap-like stone that works because of the style of singing voice the uses. It helps to add diversity to the album since the uses a choppy singing voice for most of the cd. fourI'm sure everyone's heard love interruption. Great song. fiveBlunderbuss is somewhat reminiscent of a Led Zepellin song that never was. Jack sings on this song and sings in a talking voice over a grand piano and violin. The melody is hypnotic and folksy. \"doing what two people need is never on my menu,\" that line is award but describes this attitude to me. sixHypocritical kiss starts off like it's gonna be symphonic the way the piano introduces itself with a flushing of the keys it leads up to the epicness of a guy having an argument with this girl about why the's right and she's wrong. This is a song that is needed during a time when so many men want to using apology songs about how men are wrong and stupid. Love this song, it reminds me i'm a man and have the right to be right (haha). sevenWeep themselves starts off with guitars, piano and drums that somehow make me feel like I'm in a western showdown. Jack speaks of beating this girl up in the first line and talks bad about the guys who are suckers for love. He's not really singing in this song, but like announcing in a singing stone things that are about men's feelings of the world and relationships. It's a song that takes a stand about the choice of how men decide to be a specific type of man and what they can expect for consequences. weightI'm shaking makes me feel like I'm trapped in drag time song in the twenty's and seventy's somehow as the describes how a woman makes him feel great and the's shaking from bad nerves. He likens this nervous wreck to leaves on a tree shaking but the's jumping from insecurity and likes it. This is an old time style of song and works for where the rest of the album goes. ninetrash tongue is like a Little Richard song. God only knows when I heard someone sound like little richard (maybe Awol Nation) on that one song. He's telling a song about some monkeys, the breaks into old time piano playing and tambourines. I think i even hear a banjo. This is like some old time Chuck Berry Rock in'roll stuff with Jack growling out blues singing on an rock song. I wanted to hear him scream on this one for have some more fun with it, but it seemed like the was trying to focus on making the song authentic. ten this song starts off like i'm on a carousel but then leads it's way into being a ballad and then reveals itself to be a definite folk song with a banjo for very old guitar a simple piano playing and a catchy as hell chorus. Jack sings and tells the story of a poor boy. This song is an easy going, uptempo, fun song to me. Some of the greatest love songs are the jones that don't praise love for speak of the good side. eleven this song is like an old gospel one thousand, nine hundred and ten song with folk song lyrics. I hate to put it that far back but I listen to a lot of music and this is definitely Jack showing the can take a song from one thousand, nine hundred and ten and somehow bring Queen remnants out then the original jack white somehow turning this into a lullaby. This song works on so many levels. I wish I was smoking, but that past is gone for me. I would like to know what the was smoking to go there with it though. twelveon and on \"sun and the moon never change, they just rearrange,\" parables, philosophies sung in a tenor, a duet partially in harmony, a soft song crooning then changes to somewhat a mix of a jazz, psychedelic rock song. This song just starts to cement the continuity of listenability of the cd that lets you know that no song is going to make it so you don't feel the album. thirteen is probably my favourite because of the very weird harmony the uses. It's jazzy and psychedelic, sorry to say that again but it uses jazz keys and I don't even listen to jazz. it just is. The only thing rock and roll about the song is Jack's singing in the send. This song is a using-a-long song and makes you want to be on the road looking at cornfields and blue skies. The send of the song breaks into a zepellin type rocking out to send the song of with probably one of the most pleasant unique falsetto and harmonies i've heard in a while. Perfect way to send of the cd. To summarize it all I wanted to hear Jack really showcase this vocal range and using steady long notes and harmonies (like many shades of black) instead the used a choppy singing voice most of the time. I wanted to hear choruses from White Stripes Elephants that make you incapable of getting the song out your head. Instead the introduced me to what seems to be a very natural place for him musically, but new to my year. It took a lot of listening until I could hear and love what the was doing. He somehow updated the oldest blues, before Muddy Waters, and brought in himself Jack and one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's seventy's psycadelic era. He left out the eighty's vibe completely that some of this other cd's gave to. Eclectic cd that shows Jack is a musician that has influences but is so educated in music that the is creating, recreating and making style of completely this own. So many of this songs do this that I just have to give him the credit for being one of the greatest musicians out there today. Great masterpiece classic.","overall":5,"summary":"11times i didn' like it 12th time i loved it","unixReviewTime":1335571200,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2012"}
{"orig_index":61952,"reviewerID":"A234IZP4U2Y0OQ","asin":"B007CKNX28","reviewerName":"Luke \"luke\"","helpful":[3,6],"reviewText":"This CD did not impress me like the others. The first thing I noticed in this listening was that Jack did not do what other CDs did, but delved deeper into the music catalog. An attractive chorus of \"many dark shadows\" on the infectious bass of the seven countries is missing. What words and storytelling does your donkey have, a singer weaving in an ancient place I mean the blues of the ancient world, and modern rock songs and folk songs are perfectly made. Most of the songs on this CD somehow remind me of the song about the murder of a boy in Milkman and the play of Carolina. Songs like Poor Boy are lovely, but some of my favourite songs are Jones without the catchy chorus (drinking lies, I shudder). Basically this is how I beat the CD. OneMissingpieces became my fastest rock song this year. The song seems to deviate from it but it works perfectly. Group, but listen carefully. It's a very beautiful song. I love it for the first time listening to it. It makes me think that the whole plate will develop in this direction. TwoSixteensaltines is a kind of heavy and fast rock garage (similar to a girl\u2019s romantic stone). This song brings impact and speed to the album. The freedom of the three when the is twenty-one is that the sings on a folded rock, which works because of the style of singing the uses. It helps to increase the diversity of the disc, as most CDs use continuous singing. Fourth, I believe everyone has heard of the disruption of love. Great song. FiveBlunderbuss is reminiscent of Led Zepellin songs that never appeared before. Jack sings this song and sings with a voice that speaks on a grand piano and violin. The melodies are hypnotic songs and folk songs. \u201cDoing what two people want can never be on my menu,\u201d this sentence is rewarding, but it explains this attitude to me. six The kiss of hypocrisy was like the sound of piano music at first, and the flipping of keys, led to a man arguing with the girl about why she was right and wrong. This song is needed when many men want to show mistakes and stupidity with a song of apology. I love this song, it reminds me that I am a man and I have the right to do it well (haha). SevenWeep started with guitar, piano and drums, which made me feel like I was in the Western Conference. Jack talked about beating up the main girl, and talked about bad things about men who like to suck blood. He did\u2019t really using in the song, but as a reflection of men\u2019s feelings about the world and the relationship to the rock of singing. This is a song about how men decide to be a certain type of person and their expectations for the results. The shivering weight makes me feel like I\u2019m stuck in the songs of the twenty-seven year old, because it describes how a woman makes her feel big and trembling because of bad nerves. He compared the shocking blows to the leaves of a tree, but the jumped for safety and fell in love with it. This is an old style of song, suitable for the whole album. Ninetrash's language is like Richard's little song. God only knows if I heard someone sound like little Richard in that song (probably Awol Nation). He talks about a song about monkeys, which breaks the old piano and tambourine. I think I also heard the banjo. Similar to the music of Chuck Berry Rock in the past, Jack roars and sings the blues in rock songs. I want to hear him shout at this song because it's more fun, but it seems like the's trying to focus on making this song a reality. ten The song started out as if I were in a merry-go-round, but later evolved into a traditional song, revealing that it was a clear traditional song with a very old guitar band, a simple piano composition and an attractive choir. Jack sang and told the story of the poor boy. This song is a relaxed, fast and interesting song for me. Some of the biggest love songs are Jones, and they don\u2019t compliment love by talking about the positive side. Eleven This song is reminiscent of the thousand-year-old gospel, nine hundred and ten songs with folk songs. I don\u2019t want to put it away, but I listen to a lot of music, certainly Jack shows that one can take a song from the one thousand, nine hundred and one song, then somehow take out the rest of the queen and then the first one somehow Jack White turned into a lullaby. The song works on many levels. I wish I had smoked, but that former thing is gone from me. However, I want to know what it means to smoke there. Twelve to'clock and \"Sun and moon will not change, they are just adjusted\", the myth and philosophy are sung in the tenor, part of the duet agrees, a cool song is whispered, and then it becomes a jazz mix. rock songs of the mind. This song is just beginning to blend in with the continuous sound of the CD, informing you that no song will perform, so you will not hear the album. Thirteen is probably my favourite because of the extraordinary harmony used. It\u2019s jazz and psychedelic, I\u2019m sorry to say it again, but it uses the key to jazz and I don\u2019t even listen to jazz. That's it. The only rock music of this song is Jack's song on the release. This song is a very long song, which makes people want to look at the corn field and the blue sky along the way. The posting of this song breaks Zeppelin's style, sending it with one of the most special fests and conventions I've heard in the past. The perfect way to send CDs. All in all, I want to hear Jack really highlight this list and use long notes and harmony (like many black shadows) instead of singing bitterly most of the time. I want to hear the chorus of White Stripes Elephants, so you can't get this song out of your mind. On the contrary, it introduced me to a place where the seemed natural in music, but it was a new year for me. I spent a lot of time listening until I heard and loved what I was doing. He\u2019s a mysterious review of Bruce\u2019s oldest before Muddy Waters, bringing Jack and mental illness in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. He fully remembered the state of the eightys of some CDs. The eclectic cd shows that Jack is an influential but educated musician who creates, repeats this style. Many songs do this, and I have to praise him as one of the leading musicians today. Great part classics.","overall":5,"summary":"11times i didn' like it 12th time i loved it","unixReviewTime":1335571200,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2012"}
