2918,"*Spoilers and extreme bashing play ahead*When this show first started, I found it tolerable and fun. Fairly Oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked. It also had high ratings along with Spongebob. But it started to fall because of the following crap that Butch Hartman and this team shoved into the show. First off, toilet humour in't all that funny. You can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp, but that's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a clické joke. Next there are the kiddie jokes. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people across-dressing. LOLOLOL!!! I just can't stop laughing at such gay bliss! Somebody help me! But of course, this show would't suck that bad if it were't for stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed Australians? They saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving, boomerang-throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert. But now. Is the coup de grace of WHY this show truly sucks the loudest of them all. OVER-USED JOKES!!! The show constantly pulls up the same jokes (the majority of them being unfunny) thinking it is like the greatest thing never! Cosmo is mostly the one to blame. I hated how they kept on mentioning ""Super Toilet"" (which also has a blend of yiddish humour in it just as well) and Cosmo would freak out. And who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in Dimmsdale would use in that one be-mail episode? You know, the one in which every single parent (oblivious to other parents saying it) would butter the EXACT same sentence before breaking into their kid's room? Yes, it may be first class humour to some people, but it is pure is*** to others. If I'm not mistaken, I do believe Butch Hartman said something about ending the show. Thank God! Everyone around my area says it's, like, the funniest Nickelodeon show never. I just can't agree with it I think it's just another pile of horse dung that we get on your cartoon stations everyday, only worse.",negative
2918,"* Robbers and extreme criticism will start * When the show started, I thought it was tolerable and interesting. Ideally Oddparent is a type of cartoon that is popular with adults and children. It also received top ratings with SpongeBob. But it started to decline due to the subsequent stupidity that Butch Hartman and the team pushed into the show. First of all, the humour of the toilet is not funny. You can easily laugh at a busy baby, but this is almost exclusively for the audience who laughs at such a joke. Next comes a bad joke. Lol, we see people wearing underwear, we can see people wearing underwear. LOL! ! ! I can’t stop laughing at gay fun! Someone help me! However, if it were not for this, the show would not have been so bad. Do you see how the group reflects the people of Australia? They think they are just fools to love the kangaroo and the boomerang - throwing in the hot desert. but now. Why this show is attracted to the highest of them, even if it is a deadly plague. Extreme jokes! ! ! This show always produces the same jokes (most of them are boring), you think it's the biggest thing! Cosmo is the main culprit. I hate to always talk about “high toilets” (mixed with Yiddish shame), and Cosmo is scared of you. Who can forget that the smart goat joke that every Dimmsdale parent watched used that email quote? Do you know, in that case, every single parent (you don't know what other parents say) can say the same sentence before entering their child's room? Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me, Looks like Al that sounds crap to me. If I remember correctly, I believe Butch Hartman said something about ending the show. Thank God! Everyone in my area said it was the most interesting Nickelodeon show. I don't agree with you that this is just another pile of horse manure we get from your cartoon station every day, and it will only get worse.",negative

2918,"* Excessive spoilers and bash are ahead * When this show first started, I found it fun and entertaining. Fair Oddfather is the kind of cartoon that kids and adults alike love. He also has a high rating with SpongeBob. But it started to decline because of the upcoming flexibility of Butch Hartman and this team coming into the show. First of all, bathroom jokes are not funny. You can easily get a quick laugh with a little kid with a crack, but usually that’s just an audience laughing at a joke. This was followed by kiddie jokes. We see people in their underwear and we see people dressed up. LOLOLOL !!! I just can’t stop laughing at that kind of sexual pleasure! Someone helps me! But of course, this show does’t suck up that evil unless it’s a misconception. Did you see how the group presented the Australians? They saw it as nothing more than kangaroo -loving, simply throwing a boomerang that lives in the hot desert. But now. Is the coup the reason why this show really sucks the strongest of them all. USED ​​BY JOKES !!! The show continues to capture the same jokes (most of which are unreachable) that are thought to be the greatest never! Cosmo is often at fault. I hate how they always mention “Super Toilet” (which is also in Yiddish jokes) and Cosmo leaves. And who can forget the stupid battery jokes that any god -fearing parent in Dimmsdale would use for a post event? Did you know, that a single parent (unaware of what other parents are saying) greets the same sentence before entering their child’s room? Yes, it may be a joke for some people, but it’s pure ***. If I’m not mistaken, I believe Butch Hartman said something about stopping the show. Thank God! Everyone around me says this is, like, the funniest Nickelodeon show never.

First of all, toilet jokes are not all that funny. You can get grid of a quick laugh at a naughty little kid, but these are the same audience that can laugh at such a joke. Next up are baby jokes.

10228,"This is a brilliant, lavish Czech film from the Sverak father and son team, all about two Czech pilots who flee to England to help the RAF in the Battle of Britain but who also fall out over a woman (the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Features some excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes  probably the best never and much better than Pearl Harbour for even the film Battle of Britain - and a number of interesting general themes such as love, war, romance, comradeship, loss and servitude. Also, the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (though made easier there with the great stalwart Anna Massey). The film has some great little motifs such as the world famous RAF bullseye device, shown throughout and at one point nicely reflected in the black vinyl record, spinning around acutely (music is another theme of the film, of course). Plus, all of the traditional icons of English life: dimpled beer glasses (unlike the post-war straight glasses used in Pearl Harbour), tea in a nice china tea set in an English country garden (though shot in the Czech Republic?), the mascot dog, a vintage bottle of HP sauce, even a darts board! Of course, the fairfield and surrounding countryside is ridiculously unlike anywhere in the south of England, though the virtuous aerial sequences make up for this, showing Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always synonymous with southern England and the Battle of Britain. But best of all is the sensational musical score from Ondrej Soukup, as good as anything from Hans Zimmer yet all in the tradition of the late, excellent Ron Goodwin who scored the original Battle of Britain film amongst other classic English war films. There's even a nice little cameo role for the  apparently  famous Czech musician and factor (and Kevin Kline lookalike) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays on the piano the title theme song, Dark Blue Sky. Excellent! It's got a few smutty yet funny little Freudian devices too, such as always showing an inflated condom floating by the ceiling whenever Karel (the callow but brilliant Krystof Hadek) is stuck at the fairfield while this love rival and fellow pilot Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is with Susan. Another great English factor in this film! Charles Dance is of course fine as Wing Commander Bentley. Highly recommended and well worth watching/hiring  get the DVD with special features (stuff like how they created the dog fights and stuff). Probably the only film never to combine subtitles with characters speaking English, German, French and Czech all at once.",positive

In addition, the temptations and difficulties of moving abroad and learning foreign languages ​​(although it is much easier with the independent Ana Messi). The film has some beautiful little patterns, such as the famous Royal Air Force, on which it travels and is sometimes featured in black Vinyl records, which revolves around a lot (yes, music is another movie theme). In addition, all the traditional symbols of British life: toothpicks with toothpaste (different from the standard glasses used in Pearl Harbor after the war), tea in delicious porcelain bricks in English country gardens (although it was taken from the Czech Republic?), Mascot dog, old bottle, HP and dart board! Of course, Fairfield and the surrounding countryside are very different from any other place in the south of England, although the excellent airport sequence makes it, featuring Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always a battle between southern England and Britain. But the most important is the soundtrack of Ondrej Soukup, which is as good as any of Hans Zimmer's works, but inherits the tradition of the late and best Ron Goodwin, who made the sound of the first British Film War in some British war films.

Did not quarrel (Beautiful Tara Fitzgerald) It includes some of the most beautiful and realistic war scenes - perhaps better than Pearl Harbor and even the movie Battle of Britain - as well as many more about love, war, romance, relationships, loss and slavery. Interesting topics. Also, the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning another language (or even made easier with the strongest Anna Macy). The film has some great features, such as the world-famous RAF Bliss instrument, which is shown everywhere and sometimes revolves around a black vinyl record, revolves well (one of the themes of the movie) Is). Also, all the traditional icons of English life: dimple beer glasses (unlike the direct post-war glasses used in Pearl Harbor), a beautiful Chinese tea set in the English Country Garden (although shot in the Czech Republic) Gone?), O mascot dog, an old HP bottle, and even an narrow board! In fact, the ideal stadium and the surrounding countryside are nowhere near as sophisticated in the south of England, although a good flight chain does, including the Eastbourne and Seven Sisters, which are often the scene of the Anglo-British War. Similar to the south. But the best school of music is that of Andrej Sokp, which resembles anything of Hans Zimmer and yet everything is according to the tradition of the late, Ron Goodwin who got the original British film in other English war films. There is also a small character - apparently - the famous Czech and notable artist (and Kevin Klein who looks alike) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays the piano for the title track, Dark Blue Sky. Very good! It has some obscene but funny Freudian devices, such as whenever Carroll (Christoph Haddock but clever) gets stuck in the stadium, a condom on the proof shows him flying high while this beloved rival and fellow pilot Frantisek (Andrej Vetti) With Susan. Another great English thing in this movie! Charles is as good as Dance Wing Commander Bentley. Highly recommended and viewable / rental - get special featured DVDs (such as how they fought dogs and things). It's probably the only film that never combines subtitles and characters that speak English, German, French and Czech at the same time.",positive

Of course, the fairfield and surrounding countryside is ridiculously unlike anywhere in the south of England, though the virtuous aerial sequences make up for this, showing Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always synonymous with southern England and the Battle of Britain.

43108,"Naturally, along with everyone else, I was primed to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON over the legend of Custer. Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part my expectations were fulfilled (in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way). Yet even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the Custer story, I was struck by some of the points made in this movie that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counter the typical clickés of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in Westerns of the early twentyth century. For instance, even while this film attempted to whitewash it's hero, certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real-life Custer: one) His initial entrance at the West Point front gate, in which this arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of this character.two) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed as much to Custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor; there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where the seems downright stupid.three) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. I half-expected to see the Marx Brothers for Abbott and Costello wander into the scene.four) Custer's stand against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky.five) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored. And although the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the Black Hills squarely at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I did't expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivocally in a movie like this. And one other thing: usually in these films it is the Indians who are portrayed men mass as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol. In this movie, it is actually the troops of the seventh Cavalry, and not the Indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way. All in all, this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the Hollywood bunk.",positive
43108,"the main character, however, this means Castor's misconduct and character in real life: one) His first entry into the former door of the West Point Military Academy. two) His tragic report to the West Point Military Academy seems to resemble Custer's ignorance of military service requirements and any other factors; during Flynn's role as Custer at West Point Military Academy, there were times when it seemed like a complete failure. C) Custer promotion in general is not a joke, but it is also a joke. However, even in this very clear (and under a lot of criticism) telling Custer's story, I was shocked by some of the scenes in the film, sometimes subtle but solid, and seemingly different from the usual. Although the music and certain ways of portraying Indians in this film are certainly proof of racial discrimination against ignorant people, I am still amazed that this film provides details of how Indians attacked those white people of the country have a right, and clearly responsible for fighting Montenegro at the feet of white people. In this movie, at least two scenes are shown this way, actually the seventh Cavalry troops, not the Indians. I look forward to seeing Marx's brothers strolling around Abbott and Costello. four) Custer's position against Jeb Stuart in Gettysburg was not made white as an excellent military leader, but with carelessness and luck. five) Custer's alcohol problem is certainly not going to be noticed. Yes, that part of the story is true, but I did not expect to see it clearly portrayed in such a moving picture. In fact, no one can deny that the obvious villain of this work is not Anthony Quinn, who sits on a cow, but Arthur Kennedy.",positive

43108,"For example, although the movie tries to hide its hero, some scenes still portray the real life Custer's flawed and stupid character: a) of that character. Two) Its tragic history point in the West, which seems to be due to Custer's ignorance of the need for military service like anything else. There are times when Flynn played the role of Custer at West Point where the looked stupid. Three) The promotion of the cluster to the general is not only presented as a humorous mistake, but also as a slap in the face. However, in this clear (and critical) narrative of Cluster's story, I was impressed by some of the points made in the film that are sometimes subtle but still strong, usually in conflict with open clicks and unapproved bravery. Seems early twentieth century. And while the music and some of the methods portrayed by Indians in the film were certainly reinforcing the racist ideology of the ignorant, it still amazes me that the film goes into some detail that Indians are their own country. Why did I deserve to attack the whites who entered, and apparently blamed the Black Hills wars? In this film, the is actually the seventh cavalry soldier, not an Indian, as portrayed in at least two scenes. I was expecting to see Abbott's Marcus Brothers and Costello walking around the scene.

43108,"For instance, even while this film attempted to whitewash it's hero, certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real-life Custer: one) His initial entrance at the West Point front gate, in which this arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of this character.two) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed as much to Custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor; there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where the seems downright stupid.three) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. Yet even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the Custer story, I was struck by some of the points made in this movie that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counter the typical clickés of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in Westerns of the early twentyth century. And although the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the Black Hills squarely at the foot of the white man. In this movie, it is actually the troops of the seventh Cavalry, and not the Indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way. I half-expected to see the Marx Brothers for Abbott and Costello wander into the scene.four) Custer's stand against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky.five) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I did't expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivocally in a movie like this.

It's never really a direct caricaturation of them and Morris seems most of the time to be saying, ""But no, no, these people are really fascinating, really!"", but there's always these subtle little canted angles and not-so-subtle editing techniques that show that Morris seems to be mocking them behind their back. This movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation. a man who studies African hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly want-like, a lion tamer, a man who keeps a garden full of animal-shaped shrubbery, and a robot designer. The general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal, human, and life features? So the title of Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control does't really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie. right? Except of course Morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals' passions (he might call them ""obsessions"") making synthetic designs on life. I share not that fear and honestly don't appreciate some of the connections Morris makes in the film. But I stress this subtlety. With no voice-over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it's not as if Morris never pounds that anxiety onto the spectators' collective head. Instead the mixes circus footage and want footage together often at times when they're taken out of the context of the circus and the wants, showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about. I don't find them absurd, I find them all very neat and interesting individuals.

31563,"When you first sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that you are about to see something you've probably never seen before. Keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent INSANE amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting for anything else for that matter. The crazy thing I noticed is that every character is completely over-portrayed, and it seems (most of the time anyhow) that the film had been 'sped-up' to make the characters move faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was dubbed too?) I understand the cartoon had this, but it does't work for live-action. It just looks odd. as if the camera crew decided to act because they could't afford real factors. The English version is horribly dubbed, and the character's words do not match the mouths at all. I would have proffered subtitles, but since this is a kids movie, and since some kids cannot read well, I'll let it go. But there is something extremely odd about this movie. It's supposedly a kids movie, but there's a lot of material about SEX, RAPE, and STRIPPING which in't exactly for young Western audiences. (In the Orient, they have different laws and sexuality in children's movies is much more accepted). But parents be warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, multiple scenes where people say 'sex maniac' and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the 'sex maniacs' and shows him her breasts! Who was this movie made for anyway? Oh, and the special effects are laughable.

Remember, this is a movie, and they seem to be spending crazy money exploding without enough money for anything else. The worst thing I’ve never seen is that every character overreact, and it seems (most of the time it is) that the movie is “fast” to make the characters go faster! (I don't know if the Hong Kong genre is also called extant?) I know this cartoon has this thing, but it does't work on the live genre. It looks strange. It seems that the film crew decided to take action because they could not afford the exact same conditions. The English version of the dubbing is awesome, and the names and mouths of the characters are completely inconsistent. I could have provided the footnotes, but because this is a children's movie and some kids can't read well, I give up. But there are some very strange things in this movie. This is supposed to be a children’s film, but there are a lot of things about sex, rape and liberation that are totally inappropriate for a young Western audience. (In the East, they have different rules, and sex in children's movies is acceptable). But parents need to pay attention! There are places where two characters talk about rape, there are many places where people say “sex”! Who is this movie for? Oh, special results karen't funny. You could say that things like the bomber that exploded in the village were cardboard cuts (or cartoons, I'm not sure), and even for kids, they don't seem convincing. The producers of this film have missed out on a lot of cool stuff in the cartoon, because they can’t afford to budget for the kind of money they want. I don’t like how to change the names of all the characters. This makes me wonder if this movie was made by the same person as Dragon Ball Z. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Kids, adults, Dragon Ball Z fans. Obviously, some people will say the movie is brushed off without worrying. I'm not going to go in and take pictures.

The strange thing about Jill The Ripper (or Jill Rips. for Tied Up) is that I honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller? It shows in the way that they describe it on IMDb, on the DVD case, in the commentaries, and this film is not serious. To call it campy would be a huge understatement. The film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it's nothing more than shallow, confusing and gratuitous. On top of that they put Lundgren, who is known for action films, in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because this range as an factor is pretty limited. The entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller? Just the plot and premise immediately make it a B-Movie Porn at very best.

I mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has Lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes, and witnesses and everything else even though the's not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather black cluster performance from Lundgren. Danielle Brett is Lundgren's eventual love interest and this brother's widow. Brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story. The supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it's on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by Victor Pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film, boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain. I honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there was't any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where Lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked. To explain how classy and well done this movie is (sarcasm. sarcasm) the back of the DVD I picked up (it was really cheap) has Lundgren's character listed as ""Murray Wilson"" (not the name of this character in the film.)

What I am saying is to set aside a lot of loopholes and allow Lundgren to roam freely to investigate crimes, witnesses and everything else, even if the is no longer a police officer, and you can still see the work of a strange and black group by Lundgren. .

The first time around I was certainly impressed by the astronomical vistas we're treated to in this movie, but by and large I did't think that much of the movie as a whole. It was an Alien trip-off, and I thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science. That they were allergic to light was something I found especially ridiculous. Based on my first viewing, I recently rated this movie a five. However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is on the way, and the movie poster for that one looks amazing, I thought I'd better brush up on Pitch Black once more, so I borrowed the video from a friend. I am so glad I did. There's so much of what I thought I remembered from the first viewing that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died very early in the movie. This was not so. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. This was not so. I thought Riddick was the sole survivor. This was not so. I see now that the movie works *extremely* well. There in't an excessive, tiresome focus on the monsters. It's much more of a human drama. The main characters are appealing and capable of some convincing acting. And there are so many little details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and believable, such as the shortage of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet they crash on, and the fact that the monsters have beaten everything on the planet, and so they turn on each other. And I have to mention the astronomical vistas again. I mean, we start out seeing the spaceship passing through a comet's tail, with bits of spacedust zapping through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just as the shipwrecked people think it's about to get dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon, and everything is engulfed in a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see the huge, neighbouring, fringed gas giant rise across the sky, and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship skid closely above one of these very rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I don't think I've seen any other SF movie that really made such a point out of including these things. I hope we see much more of it in the sequel. Pitch Black now gets from me a rating of nine out of ten. A cult classic? You bet!!",positive
31947,"If you are a fan of science fiction and have only watched the movie once, please watch it a second time. I just did it and was amazed at how good I thought this movie was, not the first time I saw it three years ago. The stellar scene I saw in this movie for the first time left a deep impression on me, but in general, I don’t think much about the whole movie. This is a strange journey, and I think the definition of a monster is a very bad state of science. They are not in contact with light which is something I find irrational. Based on my first show, I recently rated this movie as five points. However, now that the sequel ""Chronicles of Riddick"" is about to be released, and the movie posters look great, I think I'd better check out ""Black Lacquer"" again, so I borrowed a video from a friend. I'm glad I did. There are so many things I thought I missed when I first watched it, that it turned out to be wrong. I think most of the characters die instantly in the movie. But in reality, it is not. I think the role of Claudia Black was the first to die. But in reality, it is not. I thought that only Riddick had survived. But in reality, it is not. I see this movie now * very well *. There are no excessive and tedious observations on the beasts. This is like a human game. The main characters are very attractive and can have convincing play. There are many small details that make the black universe so coherent and reliable, such as the black of oxygen in the planetary atmosphere where they crashed, and the monster conquered everything on earth, so they turned to each other. I must also mention the astronomical landscape. I mean, we started to see spacecraft pass through the tails of comets and dust in space passing through the hull. Then we came to a three-day planet. Just when the people on the boat thought it was going to be dark, a green sun came out of its target, and everything was covered with a blue light. As the solar eclipse approaches, we see a large gas planet on the horizon, rising from the sky, and in the last film, we see a ship floating on top of one of these circles. The making of these films has beauty, surprise and detail. I hope we will see more in the sequel. The Pitch Black level that comes out of me now is nine out of ten. Sect classics? you bet! !",positive

As the solar eclipse approaches, we see a giant gas leak, a German gas leak in the sky, and at the send of the film we see the ship jumping hard into one of these many rings. If you are a fan of science fiction, and now you just watched this movie, please, PLEASE go and treat yourself to a second watch. And there are very few details that make the world of Pitch Black the same and reliable, such as the black of Oxygen in the atmosphere of the collapsed plan, and the fact that animals beat everything on the planet, and therefore opened it up. each other. These scenes were created with a beautiful, surprising and detailed feel, and I did’t expect to see another SF film that actually did such an article and included these things.

The first time I was impressed with the stars we were treated to in this movie, but most of the time I did't think about how much the movie is overall. It was an alien expedition, and I thought the description of beasts was really a bad science story. The fact that they did't like the light was something I found ridiculous. Based on my first point of view, I have recently rated this film five times. However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is on its way, and the poster for this movie looks amazing, I thought I'd go back to Pitch Black again, so I shared this video with a friend. Borrowed I'm glad I did. There was a lot that I thought I remembered at first glance that was already wrong. I thought most of the characters in the film died soon. It was not like that. I thought Claudia Blake's character was going to die first. It was not like that. I thought Radcliffe was the only survivor. It was not like that. Now I can see that the movie * works very well. There is no such thing as an overly focused, annoying monster. It's more than just a personal drama. The main characters are charming and table to imitate something satisfying. And there are a lot of details that make pitch black so coherent and reliable, such as the black of oxygen in the planet's atmosphere that they attack, and the fact that beasts kill everything in the world, so they Turn on And I have to talk about Star Vista. I mean, we start by seeing the spacecraft pass by the tail of the comet, and the dust particles of space revolve around the spacecraft. Then we landed on the planet for three days. Just like the people on board think that it is getting dark, one day the green sun rises, and everything is covered with blue light. As the sun sets, we see a large, neighbouring gas rising from the sky, and in the last scene of the movie we see a ship diving near one of these places. These scenes are made with a sense of beauty, amazement and detail, and I don't think I've never seen another SF film that incorporated these things into a place like this. I hope we see more of you below. Pitch Black now gives me an average of nine out of ten. A classic denomination? You bet !!",positive

Dude, as soon as the sun goes down, we see a big, neighbouring gas rising from the sky, and in the last scene of the movie we see a ship diving near one of these places. If you are a fan of science fiction, and you have seen this movie only once, please watch it a second time. And there are countless details that make Pitch Black's atmosphere so coherent and reliable, such as the black of oxygen in the planets it collides with, and the fact that monsters kill everything on Earth.
