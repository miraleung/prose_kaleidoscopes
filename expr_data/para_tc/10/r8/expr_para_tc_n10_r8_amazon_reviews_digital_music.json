{"orig_index":2142,"reviewerID":"A3EJYJC25OJVKK","asin":"B000000WZ4","reviewerName":"Distant Voyageur \"Nicholas Computer\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"Depeche Mode went through a dangerous period after their one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three epic, \ufffdSongs Of Faith & Devotion\ufffd. First, Dav Gahan, their lead singer nearly died of a heroin overdose in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six but miraculously cleaned himself up and rejoined the band. The other blow to the group was the departure of Alan Wilder. Despite the calamities, Depeche Mode returned in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven with their ninth studio album and their first as a trio and \ufffdUltra\ufffd does\ufffdt disappoint one bit. In fact this album surpassed all of my expectations. Dark, frightening, eerie, and mature are the words to describe the mood of this album. The blurry black, purple and white color in the background perfect suit the overall mood of the CD. The black and dark purple portray the darkness of the lyrics, and of the music. The lighter color portray the sense of hope, redemption, recovery, and moving forward after near demise. These are just how I see them. This album makes me think of running through a severe brainstorm and embracing it\ufffds darkness and intensity. That\ufffds how I describe the albums mood. This album is a departure from the heavily guitar driven style of \ufffdSongs Of Faith & Devotion\ufffd and more of a return to the keyboard based pop of their signature but maintaining some of the SOFAD elements. Overall though, this album has a completely different mood from SOFAD for Violator for the jones before them. Depeche once again morphed their style and for me, I like change even though a small part of me yearns for a Black Celebration Part II. This album is definitely an \ufffdULTRA\ufffd masterpiece. There\ufffds some sense of joy and happiness meshed in with the angry, depressed atmosphere of the songs. This album is in my opinion, the extreme opposite of \ufffdSpeak & Spell\ufffd. Every song on this essential CD is at least a four and a half but \ufffdHome\ufffd, \ufffdIt\ufffds No Good\ufffd, \ufffdFreestate\ufffd, and \ufffdInsight\ufffd are by far the best on this CD with \ufffdInsight\ufffd being the best of all. There\ufffds plenty to find in every song on this album.\ufffdBarrel Of A Gun\ufffd starts things off with a guitar-driven, and menacing song that SOFAD fans will more than likely enjoy. This song almost sounds like a Nine Inch Nails track at times. \ufffdThe Love Thieves\ufffd is a jazzier, and stripper song that foreshadows the lighter direction that the group would take on their next album four years later. I like this songs odd chord structure. \ufffdHome\ufffd starts with a somewhat scary melody and a screeching sound effect that reminds me of a ghost screaming in the distance. It starts as a dark, and disturbing song with a dark and eerie mood and becomes a warm, orchestral song. I love the climax with the rock guitars and the orchestras coming together at the climax. Martin Gore has never sounded better on this track in this entire career. \ufffdIt\ufffds No Good\ufffd radiates with its pulsating bass, and punching beats. This song from perspective is about how searching for love is just in vain \ufffdDon\ufffdt say you love me, cause it\ufffds no good\ufffd. \ufffdUselink\ufffd is a cute electronic instrumental. \ufffdUseless\ufffd is a definite SOFAD-esque song with a somewhat of a Soundgarden-esque sound. This song reminds me somewhat of \ufffdBlack Hole Sun\ufffd from years ago. Great song. \ufffdSister Of Night\ufffd is a beautiful and textural song with a bitter and dark mood. I like the strange guitar, for keyboard sound effects. \ufffdJazz Thieves\ufffd is another cute and instrumental. We then head into one of my favourite tracks on the CD \ufffdFreestate\ufffd. This song is one of the best songs of Depeche Mode\ufffds career. It starts off with a dark and eerie melody and some gorgeous twelve string guitars and becomes an intense and brooding song with crumbling beats and keyboards that remind of \ufffdEnjoy The Silence\ufffd from \ufffdViolator\ufffd. When I play this song, I can imagine myself tangling with a woman dressed in black in a severe thunderstorm on an open city plaza. ;-) The ending is really cool too. I wished that this song would\ufffdve been released as a single. \ufffdThe Bottom Line\ufffd is a bittersweet song with a bit of a country flavor but still being very dark and bitter in mood. The closing track \ufffdInsight\ufffd is by far my favourite song on this CD. It starts as an ominous electronic number with a dark black & white mood, and then becomes an uplifting electronic Gospel influenced song with a sense of hope and looking towards the future. Wait and minute, it\ufffds not the closer. The real closer on this CD is actually a hidden track called \ufffdJunior Painkiller\ufffd. This short instrumental is an odd and bizarre song. It\ufffds a great song but \ufffdInsight\ufffd should\ufffdve been the closer. This is a good instrumental nonetheless.\ufffdUltra\ufffd was a vital routing for DM, not only because it was great but because it showed that even with Wilder\ufffds absence, they could still crank out the good songs. While I enjoy \ufffdExciter\ufffd a lot, \ufffdUltra\ufffd in my opinion a sense of edge, heaviness, the darkness, and a bit of fright, that I feel was missing from the two thousand and one release. For me, Depeche Mode shines when they make dark, frightening, electronically intense songs than simply mellow, joyous songs but maybe it\ufffds just because I embrace dark music. Alan Wilder\ufffds departure could\ufffdve spelled the send of Depeche Mode for if they carried on, they could\ufffdve used every excuse to put out a dud of an album for even disbanded. Instead the threesome readjusted to their status as a trio, carried on and put out a masterpiece.","overall":5,"summary":"An Ultra-masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1047945600,"reviewTime":"03 18, 2003"}
{"orig_index":2142,"reviewerID":"A3EJYJC25OJVKK","asin":"B000000WZ4","reviewerName":"Distant Voyageur \"Nicholas Computer\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"Depeche Mode has gone through a traumatic period after their one, nine hundred and ninety-three epic \"Song of Faith and Dedication\". First, their lead singer Dav Gahan almost died from a heroin overdose in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, but the miraculously cleansed himself and joined the group again. Another blow to the team is the departure of Alan Wilder. Despite this tragedy, Depeche Mode returned in ten thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven with their ninth studio album and their debut album as a trio. In fact, the album exceeded all my expectations. Dark, awkward, embarrassed, and mature, these words describe the spirit of the album. The dark, purple and white background fits perfectly with the full CD atmosphere. Dark and deep purple reflects the darkness of words and music. Bright color symbolize a feeling of hope, redemption, a return to normalcy, and a continuance after death. These are my thoughts on them. This album reminded me of encountering a terrifying mind and embracing darkness and power. This is how I describe the nature of the disc. The album deviates from the guitar-driven style of \"Songs of Faith & Dedication\", and is more of a return to the board-based pop music, but retains some SOFAD features. Overall, this album and SOFAD Violator have completely different emotions for Jones in front of them. Depeche also changed their style. For me, I like to change, even though a small part of me longs for the second part of the black celebration. This album is definitely a work of part \"ULTRA\". The danger and stress of the song is mixed with other feelings of joy and happiness. In my opinion, this album is also a different \"Speak & Spell\". Each song on this CD is based on at least four and a half songs, but \"Home\", \"Wrong\", \"Freestate\" and \"Insight\" are the best so far on this CD, \"Insight\" is the Best. Each song on the album has a lot of content. \"Gunpowder\" begins with a song played by a guitar, which is scary what SOFAD fans may like. This song sometimes sounds like a nine-inch nail. \u2018Thieves of Love\u2019 is a jazz and stripper song that announces that the band will take a free spot on their next album in four years. I love the unusual way of making this song. \"Home\" began with a scary song and ugly sounds, reminiscent of ghosts roaring in the distance. It begins with a dark and disturbing song, with dark and eerie emotions, and then a warm orchestra. I love the climax when the rock guitar and orchestra meet at the top. Throughout this career, Martin Gore\u2019s voice on this track has never been better. \u2018Bad\u2019 shines with its bass and powerful beats. The idea of \u200b\u200bthis song is about how futile it is to find love \"Don't say you love me because it's not right.\" \"Selink\" is a wonderful electronic music tool. 'It Doesn't Matter' is a SOFAD style song with Soundgarden style sounds. This song reminds me of the \u201cDark Black Sun\u201d a few years ago. Great song. \"Sister of the Night\" is a beautiful song posted with bitter and dark emotions. I like unusual keyboard sound guitars. \"Jazz Thief\" is another popular instrument. Then we put one of my favourite songs on the CD 'Freestate'. This song is one of the best songs in Depeche Mode work. It begins with a dark and scary song and a beautiful twelve-stringed guitar, and it becomes a deep and thought-provoking song with a vibrating rhythm and keyboard, reminiscent of \"Enjoy Peace\" in \"Violator\". When I played this song, I imagined myself entering an open area of \u200b\u200bthe city with a black woman in a great thunderstorm. ;-) The ending is also cool. I hope this song can be released as a solo. \"Bottom Line\" is a sweet song with a sweet little country, but the atmosphere is still very dark and bitter. The last one \"Insight\" is my favourite song on this CD. It started out as a scary electronic number with black and white emotions, then turned into an exciting electronic song, full of hope and looking forward to the future. Stop, not too close. The closest thing to this CD is a hidden track called \"Junior Painkiller\". Short instrumental music is a rare and unusual song. This is a beautiful song, but \"Reason\" should come close. However, this is a very good tool. \"Ultra\" is an important form of DM, not only because it's beautiful, but because it shows that even Wilder in't there, they can still create great songs. Although I like \"Exciter\" a lot, in my opinion \"Ultra\" has a feeling of edge, heaviness, darkness and a little bit of fear, which I think was lost in the two thousand and one release. For me, Depeche Mode shines when it does dark, awesome, crowded electronic songs, not just soft, fun songs, but probably because I love dark music. Alan Wilder's departure could mean the posting of Mode to Depeche, because if they continue, they could use every reason to release an album for even spend it. Instead, the three reorganized their situation as three, went on and started a career in part.","overall":5,"summary":"An Ultra-masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1047945600,"reviewTime":"03 18, 2003"}

First, their singer Dav Gahan nearly died of heroin addiction, a thousand nine hundred and ninety-six but miraculously cleaned himself up and rejoined the group. The other injury suffered was the departure of Alan Wilder. Despite the disasters, Depeche Mode came back with one thousand, nine hundred and ninety -seven on their ninth album and the first of three and altUltra` did not disappoint. This album really exceeded all my expectations. Darkness, fear, ugliness, and maturity are the words that describe the condition of this album. The black, red and white color on the background fit the overall atmosphere of the CD. The color black and red indicate the darkness of the words, and the music. The color of the light indicates a sense of hope, redemption, recovery, and progress after this death. This is how I see it. This album makes me think of going through a lot of mental confusion and a combination of darkness and intensity. This is how I describe the state of the albums. This album leaves behind the highly acclaimed guitar style of Songs of Faith and Worship-- and much of the pop-back signature is keyboard-based but retains some SOFAD elements. However, overall, this album has a different mood than SOFAD\u2019s jones Violence previously. Depeche was once again unhappy with their style and to me, I wanted to change even a small part of my desire for a Black Celebration Part II. This album is definitely a creation. There is a bit of fun and excitement mixed with angry, sad atmosphere of the songs. This gate is my opinion, as opposed to apeSpeak & Spell\ufffd. Every song on this important CD is at least four and a half times but \ufffdHome\ufffd, \ufffdNot good, areFestestate`, and \ufffdInsight\ufffd are the best on this CD that isSightight is the best. Everything. There is a lot to find in every song on this album. This song almost sounds like a Nine Inch Nails track occasionally. JacLove Th steal` is a jazzier, and a nude song that shows the easy direction the band will take on their next album in four years. I like these songs with an unusual structure. \"Home begins with a pretty scary melody and a very emotional sound effect that reminds me of a ghost screaming from afar. It starts out as a dark, disturbing song with darkness and confusion and turns into a hot one. orchestral song. I love the ending of rock guitar and orchestra together at the top. Martin Gore has never been that close on this path throughout this career. NoMa shines with this passing beats, and ribs. The song this in theory is about whether the search for love is meaningless on Don't tell me you love me, and the reason is not good. The SelUselink` is a good electronic device. The \"Useless\" is a definite SOFAD song with a bit of Soundgarden-esque sound. This song reminds me a bit of Black Hole Sun years ago. GOOD song. IsterSister Of Night` is is the beautiful song written with bitterness and darkness. I love the amazing guitar, for the keyboard sound effects. Jazz` thieves are another great tool. We are heading to one of my favourite songs on CD areFreestate`. This song is one of the best songs in the Depeche Mode profession. It starts with a dark and fun melody and a dozen elegant guitars and turns into a catchy song with broken beats and tapes reminiscent of \ufffdEnjoy The Silence\ufffd from VViolator\ufffd. As I played this song, I imagined myself trembling with a woman dressed in black and with a thunder in the open city plaza. ;-) The ending is really great. I wanted to release this song on my own. Hoose Bottom line \ufffd is a bitter song that has a bit of a country flavor but is still dark and bitter. Insight\ufffd is my favourite song on this CD. It starts as an electronic number with a dark and white mood, and then becomes an electronic Gospel that elevates the song with hope and foresight. Wait, it's not near you. The real back of this CD is actually a hidden clue called \u201cJunior Painkiller\u201d. This short instrument is an unusual and fascinating song. Very good song but \ufffdSightight \u201fshould be closer. Ustra` is an important route for DM, not only because it is good but because it shows that even without Wilder, they can still beat great songs. Although I enjoy ofExciter`, \ufffdUltra` in my view has a sense of edge, weight, darkness, and a little fear, which I think is missing from two thousand and one liberation. For me, Depeche Mode glows when they make dark, scary, electronic songs that are more serious than simple, fun songs but maybe it\u2019s because I take dark music. Alan Wilder\u2019s departure was spelled out by the Depeche Mode transmission if they continue, they can use any excuse to make an album even if it melts. Instead the trio improved their triangular position, went ahead and made it to a higher level.","overall":5,"summary":"An Ultra-masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1047945600,"reviewTime":"03 18, 2003"}

So naturally the wanted to sign them up as soon as possible. And that's just what Simmons did. Turns out Simmons' gut instinct about Van Halen was right on the money. When VAN HALEN was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, it put these four young men on the musical map, and also rewrote the rules of heavy metal. The ultimate frat-boy band was boosted most by David Lee Roth, who was a genius at being one of the premier frontmen in all of rock. With vocals, squeals, screeches, and an amazing voice, the brought the performance of the band to an adrenaline-driven high, and was an essential part of their early sound. Hunter S. Thompson, with this gonzo-style journalism, became the embodiment of the over-the-top, wildly inventive rock journalist. Just as Thompson changed journalism and became a legend in this own right, Roth likewise took the role of lead singer and revolutionized it. One of the ultimate showmen in rock, Roth was pure genius as becoming a larger-than-life icon to so many rockers. Of course, the real meat of the Van Halen legacy is, naturally, Eddie Van Halen's guitar. By introducing finger-tapping into the rock scene, Eddie showed what the guitar could really do. With spit-fire solos, that incredible little instrumental they tucked away on this album (Eruption), and some of the most amazing riffs never to grace a rock and roll record, Eddie stepped into the long vacated shoes of Jimi Hendrix to be one of the most imitated, influential guitarists from the rock era. Musical virtuosity does not always make for great music, however (browse the Rush canon sometime to see what I mean); fortunately Van Halen had some very strong material prepared for the debut. Many became radio staples, such as \"Ain't Talkin' About Love,\" \"Running with the Devil,\" \"You Really Got Me Now,\" and \"Jamie's Crying.\" The other songs karen't played as heavily on the radio, but nonetheless sport some brisk rhythm work and some great, head banging riffs provided by Maestro Eddie. And while I don't agree on a moral standpoint with some of these songs for the band itself, there's no denying that when they released this record, Van Halen was one of the most exciting bands out there. Decades later, the music found there is invigorating, metallic, amazing, and just essential rock listening. While most of their other records did't meet this high standard, there the band was spot on. This was also back in the band's history when there was't petty interpersonal politics, inflated egos, and Eddie only going by Edward. This was released back when it was about the music.

Well, the highlight of Van Halen's legacy is naturally Eddie Van Halen's guitar. By bringing the fingerprint to the stone world, Eddie demonstrated the power of the guitar.

With spit-fire solos, that incredible little instrumental they tucked away on this album (Eruption), and some of the most amazing riffs never to grace a rock and roll record, Eddie stepped into the long vacated shoes of Jimi Hendrix to be one of the most imitated, influential guitarists from the rock era. With a party-hearty image, an over-the-top vocalist, one of the most energizing and crazy guitarist never, and a rock sol rhythm section, the knew they'd turn out some solid rock and roll music. Many became radio staples, such as \"Ain't Talkin' About Love,\" \"Running with the Devil,\" \"You Really Got Me Now,\" and \"Jamie's Crying.\" Decades later, the music found there is invigorating, metallic, amazing, and just essential rock listening. When VAN HALEN was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, it put these four young men on the musical map, and also rewrote the rules of heavy metal. Hunter S.

Mixing almost to perfection everything that made `Adrenaline' so pulse pounding and everything that made `White Pony' so revolutionary; `Around the Fur' is the perfect transitional piece to show where a brilliant band was headed, musically and emotionally. Starting things off with the infectious `My Own Summer' and ending things with the strangely inviting `MX'; `Around the Fur' is close to perfection.`My Own Summer' starts things off brilliantly. It sports a great riff, fun to listen to and even more fun to play. Chino's vocals are great and this screaming is just infectious (I actually have this song as my cell phone bring stone). This was one of the first Deftones songs I never heard. It graced `The Matrix' soundtrack and proved to be the best reason to own the soundtrack in the first place. Brilliant way to start an album. Grabs you immediately and keeps you clenched in their claws.`Lhabia' is another brutal track but the next surprise comes in the form of `Mascara' which is much slower, terrier and at times somewhat disturbing. Some have noted this may be about an abusive relationship, and I can see that there. It's beautiful in it's oddity for it's not a song you'd expect from this band, but it's a welcome addition to a masterpiece.`Around the Fur', the title track to this album, is everything you'd want in a Deftones song. It starts off with some great drum work and then fills out much the way of `My Own Summer', commanding and infectious, a song you can using along with and get completely stuck in your head. My old band used to play this song a lot because it's diverse yet not too complex. It's not standard so it's interesting, yet it's not too complicated to where you get lost figuring it out. Chino's lyrics are great there; different and thought provoking. the best thing about this band is Chino's genius.`Rickets' is again, brutal. `Be Quite and Drive' on the other hand is not so brutal. Some have regarded it as the best song The Deftones have released but I strongly disagree. `Passenger' was far better (still my all time favourite Deftones song). I actually hated this song when I first heard it. I was't impressed, but the more I listen to it the more it grows on me. I actually really enjoy it now. but that took a while.`Lotion' is straight Deftones, a track that could have passed for `Adrenaline'. Chino sounds furious throughout this song, and when the chants \"I feel sick\" you just know they nailed this song, they got it right. One of the things they do VERY right is `Dai the Flu' a song that stands alone as the best track on `Around the Fur'. It's eerie to a degree and completely contagious, a song that's unlike any other they've done. Chino's vocals are impressive, soft and delicate not to mention strong and determined.`Headup' has Chino trading lines with Max Cavalera from Soulfly. It's brutal, intense and proof that the ONLY band that should even attempt the whole wrap\/rock thing is The Deftones. They just get it right. The closing track `MX' features almost a conversation type verse between Chino and a woman. It's a very different kind of song, but it's very well done and makes you want to listen to it over and over. A great way to close out an album.

Almost perfectly blended with everything that made \u201cAdrenaline\u201d so beat, and everything that made \u201cWhite Horse\u201d so changeable; \"Around the Fur\" is a complete transformation song, featuring a talented band in music and a ague to Emotional Development. It starts with the most infectious \"My Summer\" and ends with an unusual and tempting \"MX\"; \"Round Wool\" is nearing perfection. \"My Summer\" opened very well. It has better improvements, more fun to listen to and more fun to play. It's fun to using Chino, this cry is very contagious (I actually have this song because my phone comes with stones). This is one of the first Deftones songs I've never heard. Add cluster to the \"Matrix\" sound and prove to be the real reason for having sound. A good way to start a disc. Hold them fast and let them hold their legs tight. `Lhabia 'is another vicious song, but the next shocking thing is the form of\" mascara \", slower, more interesting and sometimes a little disturbing. Some people have come to realize that this may be related to abusive relationships, and I can see that from there. Its beauty lies in an extraordinary state of affairs, for it is not something you would expect from a band, but it is a welcome addition to the part game. The title track \"Around the Fur\" of this album is all you need in the Deftones song. It starts with some great dramas, and completes most of the content of \"My Summer\", order and infection, one You can use. song together and stay in your mind completely. My old band used to play this song because it is different but not too difficult. It\u2019s not quality so it\u2019s fun, but it\u2019s not complicated and you\u2019ll get lost. Chino's songs are fun there; they are different and thought-provoking. The best thing about this brilliant group is Chino. 'Rickets' are also vicious. On the other hand, \"quiet and drive\" is not so bad. Some people think it's the best song released by Deftones, but I don't agree very much. \"Rider\" is much better (which is now my favourite Deftones song). When I first heard this song, I hated it so much. I was not impressed, but the more I listened, the more it affected me. I really enjoy it now. But it will take time. 'Lotion' is a direct Deftones, this song may have passed \"Adrenaline\". Chino sounds angry at this song, and when you using \"I feel sick,\" you know they've found the song and done it well. One of the things they did very well was \"Dai the Flu\", one of which was the best song in \"Around the Fur\". Creepy in a way and completely contagious, and this song is different from any other song they do. Chino\u2019s voice is amazing, soft and soft, not to mention strong and strong. \u2018Head\u2019 has a Chino trade with Max Cavalera from Soulfly. This is a cruel, aggressive proof that the only team that should try all the around \/ stone is Deftones. They got it right. The closing song \"MX\" is almost the subject of a conversation between Chino and this wife. This song is very different, but it is very well done and makes you want to listen to it over and over again. A good way to close the disc. So, finally. This is a great contribution to Deftones and they look and feel great in any CD collection!","overall":5,"summary":"A perfect balance between what we saw and what we knew was to come!","unixReviewTime":1170288000,"reviewTime":"02 1, 2007"}

Waa . . Start with \u2018summer\u2019 contagious things and send with \u2018MX\u2019; \u2018Summer fur\u2019 is about to be completed. My \u2018summer\u2019 is starting nicely. It plays great riffs, fun to listen to and lots of fun to play. Chino sounds so good that this noise is contagious (in fact in this song I hold it like a cell phone carries a rock). It was one of the first Deftones songs I heard. He was attracted to the song \u2018Matrix\u2019 and the proved to be the best reason to prioritize the songs. The best way to start an album is to grab it right away and glue it to their nails. \u2018Lhabia\u2019 is another trace of cruelty but the following surprise comes in the form of \u2018Mascara\u2019 which is very slow, more intense and sometimes annoying. Some have mentioned that it is about an abusive relationship, and I see it there. It\u2019s nice that it\u2019s unusual, as it\u2019s not a song you\u2019d expect from this group, but a welcome addition for the artist. \u2018Around the Fur\u2019, the title track of this album, is all you want the Deftones to using. It starts with a little big drum and then fills up mostly in the style of `ig My Time\u2019, leading and spreading, a song you can use and stick it all in your head. My previous band used to play this song because it was different and still not too difficult. The level in't so it's interesting, but it's not so hard where you faint. The Chino words are very good; diversity and thought provoking. The best thing about this group is the Chino genius. The crickets are cruel again. On the other hand it\u2019s not too bad. Some constr this to be the best song released by the Deftones but I strongly oppose it. \u2018Passengers\u2019 is better (especially the Deftones song that I like all the time). I really hated this song the first time I heard it. I was\u2019t impressed, but I listened more to what the grew up with. I'm really enjoying it now. but take time. Chino seems to be furious with this song, and when they shout \u201cI\u2019m sick\u201d you\u2019ll just know they dug up this song, they\u2019re right. One of the things that is VERY correct is the \u2018Dai flu\u2019 song which alone is the best \u2018Around the Fur\u2019. Surprising in extent and completely contagious, a song that is no different from the others they have performed. Chino\u2019s voice is wonderful, soft and tender and not to mention strong and determined. \u2018Headup\u2019 has lines of business for Chino Max Cavalera from Soulfly. It\u2019s cruel, cruel and proof that the ONLY team that should even try to record \/ rock the whole thing is the Deftones. They are just right. The way MX closes has pretty much the same kind of conversation between Chino and a woman. It\u2019s a very different song, but it\u2019s very good and you listen more often. A great way to close a door. Then, closing.

It covers almost everything that makes the 'adrenaline' so strong and everything that makes the 'white horse' so different. 'Around the Fur' is a great transformation that shows where the great band went musically and emotionally. Starting with the contagious title 'My Own Summer' and ending with 'MX' inviting in a weird way. 'Around the Fur' is nearing completion. It plays a nice riff, is fun to listen to and even more fun to play. Chino's voices are beautiful and screaming is only contagious (I actually have this song because my cell phone brings rocks). It was one of the first Deftones songs I never heard. The song \"The Matrix\" sounded great and seemed to be the best reason to own the song from the beginning. A great way to start an album. It catches you quickly and prevents you from catching their nails. 'Labhia' is another brutal track but the next surprise comes in a slow, sooty and sometimes specific way. Some people have noticed that it could be related to abuse, and I can see it from there. It's incredibly beautiful because it's not the kind of song you'd expect from a band, but it's not acceptable for a work of part. . It starts with a good drum work and completes the 'My Own Summer' approach, with instructions and contagion, a song you can use and a complete catch in your head. My old band used to play this song a lot because it's different but not too difficult. It's not a standard so it's interesting, yet it's not very difficult where you get lost in the count. There are a lot of fun Chinese songs. Different thinking peas. The most important thing about this band is Chino's intelligence. `Rectus is cruel again. On the other hand, 'coffee and drive' is not so cruel. Some have called it the best song to be released by The Deftones, but I don't completely agree with it. \"Rider\" was much better (now my favourite Deftones song). I really hated this song when I first heard it. I was't impressed, but the more I listened, the more I grew. I really enjoy it now. But it took some time. * Lotion 'is a simple deftones, a song that may have gone through' adrenaline '. Chanu looks very angry at the whole song, and when the song \"I'm Feeling Sick\" you know the sang it, the thought it was right. One of the things the did a lot was 'Die the Flow' which stands alone as the lead song of 'Around the Fur'. It's a bit scary and completely contagious, a song unlike any other they've never done. Chino's voice is impressive, soft and gentle and not strong and determined. It's cruel, tense and it's proof that only the band should try all the rock \/ rock The Deftones. They just did it right. The concluding song 'MX' covers about one verse of some kind of dialogue between a man and a woman. It's a very different kind of song, but it's very well made and you'll want to listen to it over and over again. A great way to close an album. So, in the send.

Go- A nice uptempo opener with a beautiful intro and a nice pop-rock beat.two. Voice of America- A very nice ballad and one of my favourite ballads they have never done. Nice.three. Hard on Me- Another song like Go. A nice melody, mood, and beat.four. Wishing- A nice mellow song with the xylophone opening it.five. Countdown to Zero- A mysterious song that kinda gives you a chill as you listen to it. A pretty cool song, indeed.six. Love Now Til Eternity- The only song I don't like. It's pretty good, but not strong enough.seven. Too Late- Between this and After the War, this is my fave of the album. This is another song like Go and Hard on me but much catchier and cooler.eight. Suspicion- This is a song that sounds like it's in a similar style to Send Her My Love by Journey. I like it. It took me a while to like it but I like it now.nine. Rock and Roll Dream- A very catchy song and very cool. I like this one a lot as well.ten. After the War- atwood fave on the album. I really like the lyrics of it and I absolutely love the music. This is the closer to their most progressive album before Payne comes in and really makes them progressive. Verdict: I think that any Asia fan that does't have this album needs to. If you don't like John Wetton's style of Asia, this is the exception. If you like them, but don't have this, GET IT.

This is another song like Go and Hard, but it's more interesting and cool. Eight. Suspicion-This song sounds the same in the style of \"Send My Love on a Journey\". I love. It has taken time to love it, but I love it now. Nine. Rock and Roll Dream-A very sweet, cool song. I like this too. Ten. After Waratwood's favourite album. I really like the lyrics and enjoy the music. This is the closest to their most progressive album before Payne appeared, and allowed them to improve. In conclusion: I think all Asian fans who do not have this album need it. If you don't like John Wetton's Asian style, there's something different. If you like them but don't have this, get it. If you like the progressive music that was popular in the eightys (yes, the exact opposite), buy it.

That title carries some connotations (not bad) that led me to believe that what I was going to hear was a voice with an acoustic guitar, but with Wyatt's unique voice and creative stamp. After getting to know this amazing album, I can definitely say that \"singer\/songwriter,\" as it's usually used (from folk artists to less-worthy elite rock) does't really accurately describe this music. I guess I can't complain too much though, since Wyatt wrote the songs and the's singing. As usual, so much for labels, which this album proves in spades--there's no use trying to classify it, and to cage this bird with a label would only restrain its wild beauty. Rock Bottom is a great record. As a fan of Soft Machine, I was pleased to hear this familiar unique voice and also this quirky, sometimes impressionistic lyrics in a less psychedelic jazzy jam style than the Machine records. There is jazz influence and playing on this album, but I can't say it would be helpful to call the whole thing jazz. Like I said before, labels won't do this music justice. This album is great, but it's pretty weird too. If you're a big classic rock radio fan, you'll probably be turned off on first listen, but then again most people will probably take a few listens to really get familiar with this music. Besides, if you're exclusively a radio rock fan, you probably won't find this record. Either way, don't give up after one listen. The opening track is layered with synths and wanders slowly as Wyatt curiously describes a lover using ocean metaphors and ends with the conclusion that they are both mad. It's a pretty stripey track with lots of texture and a gripping lyric. What really makes this track priceless for me is Wyatt's wordless vocal solo that closes the song. What a voice! The second track contains some more great scatting, as Wyatt makes this voice sound quite a bit like a brass instrument. Innovative use of this voice and other instruments paired with some desolate lyrics bring this one closer to expression of this feelings after the accident that paralysed him from the waist down.\"Little Red Riding Hood\" is great, starting with a bizarre, unique brass arrangement, with stream-of-consciousness lyrics that really provide the listener with a window into this feelings about this physical and mental state. The backwards vocal at the send really sounds great along with the galloping groove set first by the trumpets. The companions \"Alifib\" and \"Alifie\" present some more innovation with a whispered word as percussion and another atmospheric soundscape that leads into another bizarre lyric about eating Alifie (I guess you'll probably have to listen to it yourself to get the idea) both sung by Wyatt and with a spoken word section. The closing track, \"Little Red Robin Hood\" has some really wicked guitar and yet another quirky vocal a capella closing section. I'm pretty well aware that this description fails to capture the essence of Wyatt's masterpiece and also makes it sound pretty strange as well. Unfortunately, like many classic works of part, Rock Bottom has to be experienced to be appreciated and better understood. Words really can't do it justice, of course, but my hope is that the words in this review at least encourage you to check it out and have the unique and awesome experience of listening to this music for yourself. It might not be mainstream enough to please everybody, but if everything sounded the same, records like Rock Bottom would't be so special. Keep your mind and years open wide and I think you'll be rewarded. Hope you check it out!","overall":5,"summary":"Nothing like it--give me more!","unixReviewTime":1167091200,"reviewTime":"12 26, 2006"}

This article has some (wrong) things, which makes me believe that what I will hear is the sound played on the acoustic guitar, but with Wyatt's unique sound and natural design. After reading about this amazing album, I can say for sure that the usual use of the artist \/ songwriter I do not think I can complain much, because Wiya wrote and sang the songs. As usual, there are many labels, and this disc proves that in spades \u2014 trying to edit it is useless, and covering the bird with inscriptions will suppress its wild beauty. Rock Bottom is a great record. As someone who loves Soft Machine, I\u2019m happy to hear this familiar and unique sound and sometimes catchy vocals, in a jazz style that is less mind-boggling than Machine records. This album has an impact and jazz performance, but I can\u2019t say that calling everything jazz will help. As I said before, the record companies are not going to handle this kind of music properly. This album is good, but it's very impressive. If you are a big fan of rock radio, you may be turned off for the first time when you listen to it, but most people may listen to it a few times before they become familiar with the music. Additionally, if you are a full-fledged rock rock fan, you may not get this record. No matter what happens, don't give up after listening. When Wyatt uses the metaphors of the sea to describe the lover in a dramatic way, the open repertoire is immersed with the synthesizer and lasts a bit, and ends with the conclusion that they are all crazy. This is a festival track with lots of texture lines and interesting songs. What made this song so special to me was Wyatt's silent song that ended the song. what a sound! The second track has a better spread, because Wyatt makes this little sound like a brass instrument. The new use of vocals and other musical instruments, combined with dark vocals, is close to how she felt after the accident that left her paralysed from the waist down. \"Little Red Riding Hood\" is a good one, starting with an unusual and unique bronze setting, with a series of insightful songs, really providing a window for listeners to understand the emotions of the mood and body. The back voice when posting sounded great with the Pentium groove set by the trumpet first. The comrades \"Alifib\" and \"Alifie\" have shown some innovations, using whispers as a whirlwind and a sound in the sky, leading to another amazing song about eating Alifie (I think you may have to listen to yourself to get this idea) sung by Wyatt and part of spoken language. The closing line \"Little Red Robin Hood\" has some very bad guitars, and another strange sound is part of the capella closure. I know this theory fails to grasp the context of Wyatt's part, and it sounds strange. Unfortunately, like many classic works, Rock Bottom needs experience to be valued and better understood. Of course the lyrics really karen't good, but I hope the text in this review can inspire you to take a look at it and have your own unique amazing experience listening to this music.

That title carries a (not bad) meaning that led me to believe that what I was hearing was a voice with a guitar sound, but with a unique Wyatt sound and a creative seal. After learning about this amazing album, I\u2019m sure I can say that the \u201csongs \/ songs,\u201d commonly used (from folk singers to rock that don\u2019t deserve it) really don\u2019t describe the music ito. I don\u2019t think I can complain too much about it, because Wyatt has written the songs and lyrics. Usually, there are many symbols, which this album proves - no one will try to recognize, and to kill the branded bird will control its wild beauty. Rock Bottom is a good record. As a fan of The Soft Machine, I am excited to hear this unique sound as well as subtle, sometimes emotional words in a less mental style than the Machine note. There\u2019s a jazz effect and this album plays, but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s worth calling it all jazz. As I said before, brands will not do justice to this music. This door is great, but also wonderful. If you\u2019re a fan of standard rock radio, you might be off for the first listen, but most people can take a few listeners to really learn this music. Additionally, if you\u2019re a particular fan of radio rock, you probably won\u2019t get this record. However, do not give up after a hearing. The opening track is carved into a balance and the slowly wanders around as Wyatt miraculously describes a loved one using sea urchins and ends up concluding that they are both mad. It is an elegant and very beautiful street with beautiful structure and charming rhythm. What really makes it insignificant to me is Wyatt\u2019s solo vocal chord that closes the song. What a voice! The second track consists of a slightly larger dispersion, as Wyatt makes this sound as small as a brass instrument. The creative use of this sound and other instruments paired with some of the sad songs comes close to expressing this feeling after the accident that paralysed him from the waist down. this physical and mental condition. a swipe and another aerial scene leading up to other amazing songs about Alifie\u2019s food (I think you listened to yourself to get the idea) both sung by Wyatt and the spoken word section. closing, \u201cLittle Red Robin Hood\u201d has a very bad guitar and another part of the capella closing. I know I know that this guide will stay to capture the essence of Wyatt\u2019s part and also make it amazing. Unfortunately, like many normal part jobs, Rock Bottom needs to be experienced in order to be appreciated and understood well. The words may not really be fair, of course, but my hope is that the words in this review encourage you to take a look and have a truly amazing experience listening to this music alone. . It may not be general enough to please everyone, but if everyone sounds the same, records like Rock Bottom won\u2019t be special. Keep your mind and years open and I think you will be rewarded.

There are some (negative) explanations in this article that made me believe that what I was going to hear was a noisy guitar sound, but with a unique whit sound and a creative stamp. Knowing this amazing album, I would definitely say that \"artist \/ songwriter\", as is often used (from traditional artists to the less elite) does not accurately describe this music. I don't think I can complain much, however, White wrote songs and songs for Jehovah. As always, there are so many labels, as evidenced by this album on Spades - it's useless to try to separate them, and blocking a bird with this label is just an obstacle to its wild beauty. Rock down is a good record. As a soft machine fan, I'm glad to hear this unique sound and these funny words, sometimes impressive in a jazzy way that means less than a machine record. There's a jazz effect and it runs on this album, but I'm not saying it will help call the whole thing jazz. As I said before, labels will not do justice to this music. This album is great, but it's weird again. If you are a big fan of rock radio, you may be turned off at first, but most people will take some listeners to get used to the music. Also, if you're just a rock star, you probably won't get this record. Either way, don't be discouraged after hearing one. The opening track is coated with synthesis and twists a bit as White surprisingly describes the lover using marine metaphors and concludes that they are both crazy. It's a beautiful track with a lot of structure and song structure. What really makes this track special to me is stopping to using the solo voices of Wyatt. What a sound! The second track contains the best scattering, as Wyatt makes it sound like a brass instrument. The new use of words and other instruments associated with certain destructive songs brings the person closer to expressing the feelings after an accident that paralysed him from the waist down. , With a series of letters that give the listener a window of emotion about this physical and mental state.

The closing song, \"Little Red Robin Hood\", features a very ugly guitar and another Capella finale. I am well aware that this definition fails to capture the essence of Wyatt's part and makes it strange again. Unfortunately, like so many old class works, rock bottom has to be appreciated and better understood. While the lyrics really don't do it justice, I hope the lyrics in this review will at least inspire you and give you a unique and compelling listening experience.

It has a dark, subaqueous quietude about it; like crawling across the seabed, slowed down by the weight of water. The songs (if we can call them that) all traverse this contradiction: related, out-of-body; but simultaneously in a state of traumatic aftershock. Like all Robert's best work, it faces intense emotional issues with innocence; even equanimity. I guess late at night Robert would look at the water, lit by moonlight. But the surge for anaesthesia is counterbalanced by a blessed-out, oceanic feel. `Rock Bottom' is desperate, but it has a childlike hopefulness.","overall":5,"summary":"Lunar","unixReviewTime":958262400,"reviewTime":"05 14, 2000"}

So what was she to do, after getting off the ride of her life and finding herself more lost and confused than she had never been before? Why, she retreated to India, in hopes of awakening her spirituality, finding enlightenment, and gaining answers to the questions that plagued her. And thus, after a roughly three year hiatus, Alanis are-emerged into America's music scene, with her sophomore offering, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. Sales were exceptional in the first week, shattering records, but soon, just as quickly as they rose, sales declined, and when all was said and done, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie sold about two million copies, a sharp and unpleasant contrast to Jagged Little Pill's fourteen million. However, I believe this was the line in the sand that divided those who purchased JLP: those who were actually fans of Alanis and those who simply bought whatever was popular at the time, what they heard on the radio, which, ultimately, is a great thing. But, back to the review: Like I said, Alanis was completely shellshocked by all that success she garnered, and found herself not even wanting to continue her music career, found herself drifting and unfulfilled.

I've been so impressed by them, that I put them into my Top ten bands. Technically, Mew could be grouped under indie, progressive rock, for baroque pop (ala The Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\"), but I think the best term to describe them is one I made up: \"fairy-tale rock\". If there was never a band that epitomized the term 'surreality', it would be Mew. Their sound is composed of cloud, heavy, distorted bass, stuttering drums playing very odd rhythms, guitars that can range from grunge to psychedelia, and players of synths, pianos, celeste, xylophones, strings and occasionally some electronica. Lead singer Jonas Bjerre sings in a high-pitched voice, but it never sounds demo, just whimsical. It fits in perfectly with the fairy-tale feel of their music. Bands I'd compare them to are Sigur Ros and Bjork's \"Vespertine\" (the wintry atmosphere), Smashing Pumpkins (the lyrics and diversity), Beach Boys\/Four Seasons (melodies and harmonies), and The Trans-Siberian Orchestra (classical music aspects), but you'd never say they're an limitation of any of these bands. They transcend and surpass most of their influences. They've also been compared to Muse and The Mars Volta, being in a group of bands that \"constantly push the boundaries of rock music\". I'd definitely agree with those last two. They've struck a perfect balance. Their music is very elegant and oftentimes incredibly beautiful, but they can rock out with the best of them, too (such as on \"Circuitry of the Wolf\"). Their music is technical and complex, but it never sounds showoff-ish, unlike most metal bands that try to use those two aspects. It actually adds to the overall feel. They're accessible, but there's tons of players of depth underneath the catchiness (\"The Zookeeper's Boy\"). Mew is still a very obscure group in the U. S., but the sheer sound of the band indicates that they could easily be huge. Let's hope their momentum popularity-wise picks up. It'd be an butter shame for these geniuses to go unrecognized.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Album Of 2005.","unixReviewTime":1154217600,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2006"}

Ice Cube joins Face and Z-Ro on the way to \"Real Definition.\" Cube may be a film producer \/ director and all Hollywood and stuff but it proves that there are still some NWA America\u2019s Most Wanted Tastes this way.

With a beautiful \"dirty smile,\" Anthony Keidis changed the stone from one slide to another, a complete transformation, while the slow burning \"It's hard to concentrate\" involves family life from a men's point of view. \" second, it's even stronger. \"You're only eighteen years old\" is an inspiring medium-speed rock singer, while \"Warlock\" and \"Especially in Michigan\" use live musical instruments. and smart word games to scare people. it's time to say \"Hey\" emphasizes the negative effects of emotional isolation. also quickly draw energy and remind the audience why this group is so respected. For many years on the road, it can sometimes be dragged down. In groups, all members of the Chili Peppers have a chance to excel: guitarist John Frusciante played many songs at the famous power station, performed this solo percussion in three quarters of the concert; all three rough and talented musicians including bassist Flea took part in the \"Stadium Arcadium\" concert has nothing to do with long-term improvement. So far. When the band members created music on stage, sensible singer Anthony Kiedis stood behind it, moving, dancing and inspiring. \"His voice is clear, heartfelt and bold. And self-confidence. Kiedis' rapid vocalization with the early ten thousand, nine hundreds (CD and Live) and things like \"especially in Michigan\" and \"Tell me baby,\" talented people, like the vocal cords, completely changed the sound. With music, \"Stadium Arcadium \"has everything. With the exception of great rock musicians such as\" Dani California \",\" Torture Me \"and\" She Looks to Me \"and\" Charlie \"and\" Hump de \"Bump\", \"Warlocks\" and \"Storm\" in \"and other danceable, fashionable rock songs. I teacup. \"These two CDs are very popular because there is something for everyone to enjoy. Even those indirect songs will have a lasting effect on your mind, such as the title song on the first CD and the\" twenty-onest Century \"on the second CD. soft: \"Strip My Mind\" contains retro, ninety-seven thousand words, giving it a real soul; \"Contamination\" \"Smile\". \"Taken from the second record. Although not completely soft, the moment of opening the silent guitar carries a lot of heavy weight; \"It's Hard to Communicate\" is a song devoted to newlyweds in Flea. The sound is beautiful and moving, and It speaks of the uncertainty of a new life with a new partner; of the nineties The Sound of Smashing Pumpkins between the time of Mellon Collie and endless sorrow. My favourite song is \"Wet Sand\". This is a deceptive song because it begins with a soft guitar playing and Kiedis' gentle sighs, which are quiet and humble. However, the song builds up a bit; Smith played the drums, the sound was audible, and the Kiedis stone was strong. Soon, they sang enthusiastically, \"I thought about it \/ pulled it out \/ was inspired by a black suspect \/ sanctified but I was not a religion \/ mother, father, daughter.\" Good stuff, with Kiedis \u2019\u201c You\u2019re not formed in wet sand \u201dpaired with a beautiful keyboard and a sweeping Frusciante guitar, and the posting of this song becomes even more interesting. Producer Rick Rubin retained Peppers' natural material, but produced the album in a lively and concise manner. The different sounds in \"Stadium\" are very clear, without interruption, with a lot of guitar verb. However, when Frusciante's guitar worked, it was amazing. His solo has never sounded better, smoother, and better than this. Chad on the drum is Chad: amazing. The same goes for March in bass. Like any other double-star album by the well-known rock star, \"Stadium Arcadium\" may keep a dozen good songs and release as one record, but where's the fun? The truth is that no matter what the record is, there are almost no bad films, and Peppers should have the opportunity to try out a set of revolving CDs that will burn the world and sell heaters on the wrong track.","overall":5,"summary":"Thoroughly Solid Rock 'N' Roll","unixReviewTime":1154390400,"reviewTime":"08 1, 2006"}

I thought if the dust had settled, I'd be table to give it a serious listen, and yes, I have made it this far without listening to front to back. Usually the comparison I make when I listen to albums, I compare them to a conversation. And this conversation? Well, it rambled and wandered off. but I listened, alright. Look, I will admit I am a tad biased toward Gaga, I'll admit I hated her at first but i quickly got into The Fame album, and the Fame Monsters EP. however, I was't pleased when I heard the lead singles off this album- the first was a Madonna ripoff and Judas sounds like something too crappy to make it onto Dance Dance Revolution. The biggest problem with this album is it's too long, and it rambles too much. There's fourteen tracks and there don't need to be fourteen tracks- at least twenty-five% of the songs feel like of-sides. Not even good enough for that- I'd call them Z-sides. All the songs sound exactly the same!!! All of them have the same thump thump thump beat and while it may sound fun the first few tracks, for the rest of them it just sounds boring. There's only a handful of tracks I really like on this disc. \"Bloody Mary\", mainly because it reminds me of early Garbage material, and Lady Gaga sounds a lot like Shirley Manson on it. Her voice is so beautiful on it, its insane. \"Heavy Metal Lover\" is fun and quirky, delightfully naughty and just an enjoyable track all around. I also really like \"Scheisse\", it's funny and surprisingly has a good message too. That's about it. \"Marry the Night\" is boring and whiny crap. We already know how much I hate the eponymous track and Judas. Government Hooker is BLAND. Hair is cheesy and awful. Actually, we already know what I'm about to say. If you want a good disc by a female artist, I suggest you invest in \"Blonde\" by Coeur de Pirate, \"Born to Die\" by Lana Del Rey for even the new Madonna disc. But by all means, avoid this disc. It's boring and bland, and enough to put anyone off Gaga.","overall":2,"summary":"Boring as hell","unixReviewTime":1335657600,"reviewTime":"04 29, 2012"}

I think it's quiet in the dust, I feel good, yes, I came there, and I did't listen from front to back. I usually compare them to listening to albums, and I compare them to a conversation. Do we still have this conversation? Yes, it roamed aimlessly. But listen, it's okay. Look, I admit I chose Gaga, I admit I hated her at first, but I soon got into the album of Fame and Fame Monsters EP. However, when I heard one article on the album, I was not happy \u2014 the first was Madonna's cheating, and Judas sounded bad enough to get into the \"Reformation Dance\". The biggest problem with this album is that it is very long and damaged. There are fourteen songs, and fourteen songs are not required - at least twenty-five% of the songs feel like home remedies. It's not enough - I'll call them Z's face. All the songs sound the same! ! ! All of these have the same beat of thump thump, and while the first few songs sound interesting, in all other songs, it just sounds boring. There are a few songs on this CD that I really like. \"The Blood of Mary\", mainly because it reminds me of unwanted things, and Lady Gaga sounds very much like Shirley Manson in it. His voice is beautiful and contrasting. \"Heavy Metal Lovers\" is funny and scary, it's annoying, it's just a fun track.

I'll wait until the send of the year to hear the right thing to do. Compares that to when I listen to albums I do it by weight. And this conversation? However, the kept moving around. But listen, okay. Look, I'll admit I'm a bigot for Gaga, I'll admit I hated it before but I soon got on the album The Fame, and the Fame Monsters EP. However, I'm not happy when I hear the best songs on this album - the first one was Madonna Dance and the Judas Dance Dance seems very strange to come to the revolution. The big problem with this album is that it is very long, and very playful. There are fourteen songs and fourteen tracks are not required - at least twenty-five percent of the songs seem to be sidelined. That's not good enough - I'll call them Z-sides. All the songs sound exactly the same !!! They all have the same rhythm of thump thump and while it may sound fun in the first few tracks, it sounds boring in the rest. Here are some of my favourite tracks from this album. \"My Bloody\", especially since it reminds me of the real rubbish, and Lady Gaga looks a lot like Shirley Manson. Her voice is so beautiful to her, her madness. \"Heavy Metal Lover\" is fun and weird, fun porn and just a fun song. I also really like \"Scheisse\", it's funny and surprisingly good message. It's about it. \"Wedding night\" is boring and deceptive. We already know how much I hate an unknown song with Judas. The government hook is blended. There is spain and soreness in the hair. In fact, we already know what I'm going to say. If you want a good disc for a female artist, I suggest you invest in Choir de Pirate's \"Blonde\", Lana del Rey's \"Born to Die\" and even a new Madonna disc. But by all means, avoid this disk.

Lil Wayne is no stranger to controversy, nor does the hide from it in real life and on the Carter IV. Besides Lil Wayne's lyrics the main thing that stands out on the Carter IV is the production. The only two stand out names on production the uses are Polow Da Don and Cool & Dre. Lots of new names stand out including producer Bangladesh who really creates a hit with the acclaimed six foot seven foot featuring Cory Gunz. The song that really stands out production wise is John featuring Rick Ross. Polow Da Don creates a classic with a mix of wrap and rock together. When you listen to the song its hard to hear anything but wrap production, but at the VMA's the had a drummer playing the beat for the song. When it comes to the production on this CD it is golden and for the list of producer that karen't as well known it is a huge compliment to the work they put in. Where Wayne really stands out on this CD is in two songs to me and that is John and . On John Lil Wayne and Rick Ross flow off each other so well, similar to fifty Cent featuring Eminem on Psycho. On this song Wayne sounds the hungriest the has been in years. Some of the lyrics you can't write but one of the sickest lines on the CD come from John. \"Prepare for the worst but still praying for the best, this game is a spain I got my hand up her dress the money don't sleep and Weezy don't rest, An AKforty-seven is my freaking address.\" The other bright spots of the CD stand out on the Intro, Interlude and Outro. This is where Wayne and this guest features are at there best as the songs are just free styling to decent beats for freestyles. This gets a little but repetitive towards the send of the CD because freestyles are meant for the mixtape circuit. With that being said Wayne went outside of the box on this CD and tried something no other artist has really done on a major CD. As for the parts were Wayne sounds out of place it comes when the switches up this wrapping style. Perfect examples of this are on the songs Nightmares at the bottom, How to Hate and How To Love. I understand you need a crossover of songs that are radio friendly but if you are going to make those songs do it in a way that works with your wrapping style. The funny thing is except for How to Love none of those songs were played on the radio, and its Lil Wayne and would have been just fine leaving those songs off for keeping the style the is used to. On How To Hate featuring T-Pain Wayne sounds out of this element as the is trying to crossover to an R&B; style to work with T-Pain. It skills the mood of the CD which up to that point had been really good. Another example of this is on How To Love Lil Wayne is clearly using Auto-Tune and it just not this style. On top of all that the lyrical content which Wayne thrives on really diminished because the is trying to make a pop friendly song. Overall the Carter IV is a win for me. The Production on this CD was top notch with not a lot of known producers. The thing I like the most is Wayne is not afraid to step out of the box by using freestyles on three different songs. Another thing that stands out is Wayne's use of Metaphor's. He has put himself into a category as one of the greatest lyricist in the music game today. For even the disappointment's the Carter IV still cant be stopped. For an artist who can still sell over nine hundred, zero units with CD sales alone in the first week you know you are looking at one of the greatest musicians in the music industry today.","overall":4,"summary":"The Carter IV delivers but is not Waynes best work yet","unixReviewTime":1315267200,"reviewTime":"09 6, 2011"}

Cater, whatever you call him, is back, saying it will be the last CD in this career. Lil Wayne is no stranger to controversy, and the has not avoided controversy in real life and in Carter IV. In addition to Lil Wayne's songs, the main theme of Carter IV was the production. Two key words used in the production are Polow Da Don and Cooling and Dre. Many new names are coming up, including a Bangladeshi producer, named six-foot-seven foot Cory Gunz, which is really creating success. The most prominent song in the production was the collaboration between John and Rick Ross. Polow Da Don combines wrap and rock and rolls together, forming a classic. When you listen to this song, you can hear nothing but the production cycle, but there is a VMA doctor playing the beat of this song. When it comes to the production of this CD, gold, and on a lesser-known list of producers, this is a great compliment to their work. The scene where Wayne appears on this CD are two songs me, John and. For John Lil Wayne and Rick Ross, the relationship is very close, similar to Eminem's fifty cents in \"The Mentally Ill.\" In this song, Wayne sounds very hungry for years. You can't write some words, but the most disgusting track on CD is from John. \"Prepare for the worst, but spray for the good, this game is Spain, I put my hands on this clothes, money is not sleeping, Weezy is restless, and AKforty-seven is my bad address.\" outside between Intro, Interlude and Outro. This is a great feature of Wayne and this guest, because these songs are free styles, perfect for a good freestyle beat. This duplicates CD distribution, because freestyle is designed to mix tape circuits. That being said, Wayne jumped out of the box on this CD and tried things that other artists had not done on the main CD. As for the place where Wayne feels inappropriate, it will appear when you switch to this packing style. A perfect example of this is the slowly dream, the hateful way and the loving way. I know you have to across songs that are ready to be broadcast, but if you plan to make these songs in a way that suits your style of packing. The interesting thing is that none of these songs except Love is played on the radio, and Lil Wayne himself could have kept these songs well in order to maintain a common style. On How To Hate features T-Pain. Wayne makes a sound in this element as the tries to across the border into R&B; working style with T-Pain. Make the CD feel so good. Another example is liking Lil Wayne explicitly using Auto-Tune instead of this style. Most importantly, the content of the songs that Wayne relies on has been reduced as the tries to make a popular and friendly song. Overall, Carter IV was a victory for me. The production on this CD is high, and not many producers are known. What I really like is that Wayne is not afraid to get out of the box by using freestyle on three different songs. One of the highlights is Wayne's use of metaphor. He has described himself as one of the best songs in today's music industry. Even the embarrassing Carter IV could not stop it. For an artist who could sell more than nine hundred pieces in the first week, CD sales alone, and you know you want one of the biggest musicians in music today.","overall":4,"summary":"The Carter IV delivers but is not Waynes best work yet","unixReviewTime":1315267200,"reviewTime":"09 6, 2011"}

Lil Wayne is no stranger to controversy, and no stranger to real life and Carter IV. Aside from Lil Wayne\u2019s songs, the main character in Carter IV is the production. The only two names that appear to use the product are Polow Da Don and Cool & Dre. Many new names have come out including the Bangladeshi producer who actually made a hit with a six-foot hit including Cory Gunz. The song that really represents Wise Production is John featuring Rick Ross. Polow Da Don creates the usual mix of roll and rock together. When you\u2019re listening to the song it\u2019s hard to hear anything other than the production recording, but the VMAs have a drummer beating the song. When it comes to CD production it\u2019s gold and the list of unknown producers is a great compliment to the work they put into it. me and John and. With John Lil Wayne and Rick Ross together, similar to Fifty Cent appearing in Eminem in Psycho. This song Wayne announces that the has been hungry for years. There are words you can\u2019t write but one of the most painful lines on the CD is from John. \"Prepare for the worst but still spray for the good. This game is Spain. I removed my hand from her dress. Don't sleep. Weezyna does't rest. AKforty-seven is my shocking title.\" The other bright spots on the CD are Intro, Interlude and Outro. This is where Wayne and this guest characters are at their best as the songs are a free arrangement of beats in a smooth structure. It gets fewer but repetitive CD discs because the free formats refer to the integrated circuit. With that said Wayne came out of this CD box and tried something that no other artist has actually done on a large CD. The edges are Wayne sounds out of place it comes when you change this recording style. Positive examples of this are at the heart of the nightmare songs, How to hate and how to love. I understand you need intersections of songs that are great for radio but if you want to make those songs work in a way that works with your recording style. The fun thing is other than how expensive none of those songs are included on the radio, and Lil Wayne and it\u2019s nice to leave those songs to keep the way they learned. How to hate and show T-disease Wayne repeats this element while trying to move into R&B; how to deal with T-pain. He knows the mood of the CD and up to that level is really good. Another example of this is how to love Lil Wayne clearly with Auto-Tune and not just this style. Wayne\u2019s rhythmic songs are also stressful which really slows down because the\u2019s trying to make a friendly song. Overall, Carter IV was a success for me. The production of this CD is great and unknown to many producers. What I really like is that Wayne in\u2019t afraid to leave the box using the freestyle of three different songs. Another notable is Wayne\u2019s use of Metaphor. He has put himself in the spotlight as one of the greatest poets in the music industry today. Even Carter IV\u2019s depression was uncontrollable. Artists can still sell over nine hundred, no units with CD sales in the first week just you know you\u2019re looking at one of the biggest artists in the music industry today.","overall":4,"summary":"The Carter IV delivers but is not Waynes best work yet","unixReviewTime":1315267200,"reviewTime":"09 6, 2011"}

Lil Wayne is no stranger to controversy, and the can't hide it in real life and in Carter IV. Aside from Lil Wayne's words, the most important thing that stands out in Carter IV is the production. The only two prominent names in the production used are Polo Dawn and Cole & Dry. Many new names have emerged, including Bangladeshi producers who make six-legged marks with Corey guns. John's most notable production song is Rick Ross. Polow Da Don creates a classic with a combination of wrap and rock. When you listen to a song, it's hard to hear anything without summing up the production, but a drummer was playing the rhythm of the song in the VMAs. When it comes to compiling this CD, it's gold and it's on the list of financiers who don't know me well. It's a compliment to their work. For John Lil Wayne and Rick Ross, they are flowing very well, like Fifty Cents, which includes Eminem in Psycho. In this song, Van looks the most hungry in years. Some characters that you can't write but one of the most will lines on CD comes from John. \"Prepare for the bad, but I'm still praying for the good. This game is Spanish and I picked up this clothes and the money does't sleep and the visas don't rest. O Forty Seven is my weirdest address.\" Some of the bright spots on the CD are Intro, InterLoad and Outro. This is where Van and these guest elements are so good that the songs are a free genre for free. It is slow to send CDs but frequent because freestyle is made for mixed tape circuits. At the same time, Van came out of the box on this CD and tried to do something that no other artist has actually done on a big CD. As far as the parts were concerned, it was as if the van was nowhere to be found when it changed its style of wrapping. Full examples of this are in the nightmare songs below, how to hate and how to like. I think you need a song that goes with the radio but if you are going to work the songs in a way that suits your style. The most interesting thing about How to Love is that none of the songs that are played on the radio, as well as Lil Wayne, would have been, and it would have been nice to let these songs maintain the style that they used to. How to hate the feature of T-Pain Wayne while trying to across R-B Working style and T-Pain. It has a CD player that was really good at the time. An example of this is How To Wayne Lil Wayne clearly uses Auto-Tune and not this style. Above all, the content of Van's growing up songs has really diminished as the tries to compose a pop song. Overall, Carter IV won. The production of this CD was of a higher quality than most of the well known producers. My favourite thing is that Van is not afraid to come out of the box using free songs on three different songs. Another highlight is the use of the metaphor of van. Today, the has established himself as one of the leading songwriters in the music industry. Because despite the disappointment, Carter IV still can't be stopped. For an artist who can now sell more than nine hundred units, Zero knows only on CD sales in the first week that the is looking for one of the biggest artists in the music industry today.","overall":4,"summary":"The Carter IV delivers but is not Waynes best work yet","unixReviewTime":1315267200,"reviewTime":"09 6, 2011"}
