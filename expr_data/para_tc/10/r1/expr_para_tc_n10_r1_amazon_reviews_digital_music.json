Most of the songs on this album have been made into new songs. and playing a great Stevie Wonder CD. Everything from Stevie's Little CD to this album. So far, this album is one of my favourite albums. The album was first released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, but political and social knowledge is still relevant today. The thoughts that came to my mind were \"Love Needs Love Today\", \"Talk to God\" and \"Black People\". Not only is the rhythm and style alignment, original and the perfect blend of R&B and funk, but you'll find yourself singing (at least I am!). Additionally, the love songs on this album are unbeatable. I can't tell you how many times I clicked \"replay\" on the #seven track on the first song. (\"He Slaps Me With My Feet\") This is not only a good album for Stevie's serious fans, but also a good introduction to those who don't know the job.

Intro\/Bomb First (My Second Reply): This is a miss to all the East Coast wrappers Pac had beef with. I think this is one of the best songs on the album.two. Hail Mary: Everyone has heard fifty, Eminem & Busta's version dissing Murder Inc. but Pac's version is better. Everyone wants to be twoPac and who could blame mem? Listen to the song if of haven't heard it yet. This & Me & My Girlfriend made me buy this album before I heard the other songs.three. Toss It Up: This is another one of my favourites. Two themes in this song. First the talks about (lovin)this girl and in the last verse the's dissing Dr. Dre for leaving Death Row.four. To Live & Die In L. A.: Another miss to Dr. Dre. This is one of the best songs on the CD, if not THE best. Kinda la back track as far as the hook and the verses are typical Pac. He describes life in LA on this track.five. Blasphemy: Different theme, but I'm feeling it. Makaveli talks about the guidelines of the game and talks about thug life. The theme reminds me of Troublesome ninety-six, with a totally different twist.six. Life Of An Outlaw: Damn I LOVE this song. Don't get it twisted, I love the Outlaws but this song would been better if it was just Makaveli wrapping. The beat compliments hisstyle more than the Outlaws. I still love it though.seven. Just Like Daddy: This is the love song that even a guy in't ashamed to bump. Pac lets Khadafi shine on this, letting him flow for two verses. Pac does the best though on it. Guys, trust me. your girl will love this hahaheight. Krazy: This song's hot too. Makaveli tries explaining how life is crazy for a thug. But it sounds like the's trying to keep this head on straight at the same time. I can't explain it well, just listen to it.nine. White Man'z World: This is a real hot song, even though I'm not black. He respects this black people, especially the ladies. He apologies for calling them names and the's telling us how hard life is for black people.ten. Me And My Girlfriend: This is one of the most original concepts I've never heard. It sounds almost like a ghetto love song, but the's really wrapping about this gun. If I did't tell you, would you have known??eleven. Hold Ya Head: He's telling you to do just that. Hold Ya Head. Even when life can become real hard, \"you got to hold rya head\"twelve. Against All Odds: One of the verses will sound familiar to you, if you up on the mixtape scene. fifty Cent uses a verse from there on Hail Mary two thousand and three.

Life and death in Los Angeles: One of Dr. Dre's shortcomings. This is one of the best songs on CD, if not the best. In terms of hooks and verses, it\u2019s a little bit of a backlash, a typical Pac. He described life in Los Angeles in this song. Five. Swearing: a different topic, but I feel it. Makaveli talks about the rules of the game and the life of a criminal.

Don't misinterpret it, I love Offlaws, but this song would be better if it was just packed by Makaveli. Beating compliments this style more than Criminals. I still love it. Seven.

Introduction \/ First Bomb I think this is one of the best songs on the album. Praise Mary: Everyone has heard the Inc. version of the murder of fifty, Eminem and Busta. But the PAC version is better. Everyone wants to be a PAC and who can blame meme? If you haven't heard yet, listen to the song. He and I and my girlfriend forced me to buy this album before listening to three more songs. Throw it down: this is one of my favourites. There are two themes in this song. The first mention is of this girl. Living and Dying in LA: Another Missing Doctor. Fear is one of the best songs on CD, if not the best. Kanda postponed the track to the send and the verses are standard PAC. He describes Life LA in this track.five. Blasphemy: A different topic, but I understand it. The Machiavellian game leaders talk about principles and the lives of thieves. The theme reminds me of the Ninety Six Trouble with a completely different twist. Life of an Love: Damn I love this song. Don't get me wrong, I love criminals but this song would have been better if it only wrapped up Machiavelli. Rhythm appreciates this style on Outlaws. I still love you Like Daddy: It's a love song for a guy who's not ashamed to explode. The PAC allows Gaddafi to shed light on it, allowing him to shed two verses. PAC works best for this. Friends, hope so. Your girl will love this hot. Karzai: This song is also hot. Machiavelli tries to explain how life is crazy for a criminal. But you seem to be trying to keep your head straight at the same time. I can't describe it well, just listen. White Men's World: This is a very hot song, even though I'm not a black person. He respects black people, especially women. He apologizes for calling them by their names and telling us how difficult life is for black people. My girlfriend and I: This is one of the first thoughts I've never heard. It sounds almost like a love song from a ghetto, but it's actually wrapped up with this gun. If I than't told you, you would have known eleven. Hold for Head: Telling you what it is. Head plate Even when life can be really difficult, twelve \"you have to hold your head\". Against all odds: When you're in the mix-tape scene, one of the verses will sound familiar to you. Fifty cents uses the verse from which Hale Mary is two thousand and three thousand. I'm a big fan of the fifties but I and't feel it at all. I still love Nas, Mobb Deep and Jay-Z. Although Macaulay had made a fool of him.","overall":5,"summary":"...","unixReviewTime":1059436800,"reviewTime":"07 29, 2003"}

Michael absolutely glows on this CD and the bonus tracks are a treat I'll enjoy listening to over and over again! This is a fine CD for any MJ fan; and it's also a great starter CD for anyone just getting into the captivating artistry of Michael Jackson. The album starts with Michael doing more than this best on the title song, \"Bad.\" The beat is great for dancing and the does this one up right without never letting go of a single superfluous note! The players of vocals enhance the song and I love that morgan, too. The percussion is used to great advantage and overall \"Bad\" is a stunner of an opening number. \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" is also very strong; Michael delivers this with lots of positive energy; it's numbers like this that grab you by the throat and never let go until the very last second of the song! It's all worth it, too; Michael's genius is so apparent on CDs like this one. \"Speed Demon\" has some mighty good musical effects as Michael sings this very well; and I also like \"Liberian Girl\" which Michael performs most passionately. \"Liberian Girl\" shines brighter than silver and gold combined when Michael does it; and the music fits perfectly with Michael's vocals.\"Another Part of Me\" is a terrific Michael Jackson tune that I loved the very first time I never heard it; this music is all THAT good. The beat is strong and great for dancing practically wherever you are; and Michael's excellent diction enhances this number all the more. \"Man in the Mirror\" is a particularly beautiful song; Michael struck gold yet again with this one--and just one listen will tell you why! Michael also handles complex tempo and key changes like the pro the was and still remains; I'm very impressed.\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" is quite memorable; Michael and Siedah Garrett using this to perfection--and beyond! The radio edit of \"Smooth Criminal\" is strong with an awesome beat that really makes me sit up and take notice; it's flawless music indeed. \"Leave Me Alone\" certainly shows Michael's creativity as a fine recording artist, too; and that's grand. In addition, the bonus interviews with Quincy Jones give us good insight about this album; I enjoyed hearing Quincy talk about Michael, this music, the music over \"Man in the Mirror\" and more. \"Todo Mi Amor Eres Tu (I Just Can't Stop Loving You)\" showcases the beautiful Spanish version of this ballad; and \"Fly Away\" is absolutely awesome. The bonus tracks are a great way to send this remastered album; I love it! Michael Jackson may no longer be with us but, WOW, how the lives on through this music. I doubt that we'll never see another entertainer quite like him; the was so very, very special. If you want a terrific Michael Jackson album, this would be a great choice.","overall":5,"summary":"Michael Jackson's \"Bad\" CD remastered with those extra tracks--WOW !!!","unixReviewTime":1251676800,"reviewTime":"08 31, 2009"}

Any MJ fan, this is a good CD; for anyone who has just entered Michael Jackson's fascinating part, it is also a great introduction to the CD. At the beginning of the album, Michael cd a better job than this song titled \"Bad\". Beats is ready to dance, and do it right without sacrificing extra points! The voice player improved this song, and I love it with Morgan. Percussion is used to great advantage, and the \"bad\" whole is the most surprising of the opening numbers. \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" is also very strong; Michael conveyed this with a lot of positive energy; numbers like this hold your throat and won\u2019t stop you until the last second of the song! Everything is fine; Michael's mind is clear on a CD like this. \"Demon Speed\" has great musical effects because Michael sings well; I also love the \u201cLiberian girl\u201d that Michael did so much. When Michael does this, the \"Liberian girl\" shines more than silver and gold; the music is in perfect harmony with Michael's singing. \"Another Part of Me\" is a great Michael Jackson song, I loved it the first time I heard it; the music is really good. Wherever you are, the rhythm is very strong, perfect for dancing; Michael's excellent words emphasize this number. \"Man in the Mirror\" is a more beautiful song; Michael used this to make gold again - just listen and tell you why! Michael also manages complex rhythms and major changes, as employees of the past and present; I am very impressed. \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" is unforgettable; Michael and Siedah Garrett have used it to perfection - and more! The radio program \"Smooth Crime\" is very powerful, with a beautiful rhythm, which keeps me focused; it's really flawless music. \"I Was Left Alone\" certainly shows Michael's skill as a good recording artist; this is good. In addition, an additional interview with Quincy Jones gave us a better understanding of the album; I was so excited to hear Quincy talk about Michael, this music, the music video for \"The Man in the Mirror\" and so on. \"Todo Mi Amor Eres Tu (I Can't Stop Loving You)\" shows the beautiful Spanish version of this ballad; and \"Fly and Go\" is very good. The bonus song is a great way to send this album an updated; I love it! Michael Jackson may not be with us, but wow, how does this music continue.

Michael has fully enlightened this CD and the bonus standards are a treat that I will enjoy listening to many times over! This is a great CD for any MJ fan; as well as a great introductory CD for anyone coming for iconic artist Michael Jackson. The album begins with Michael doing more than the best with the title track \"Bad.\" The beat is great for dance and this one does it right without skipping a single high note! The vocalists improve the song, and I love Morgan. The press is used to great advantage and overall \u201cBad\u201d is an impressive number of opening. \u201cHow do you make me feel\u201d is also very powerful; Michael carried it with good energy; are numbers like this that hold in your throat and are never released until the last second of the song!

This music is all of that. The beat is cloud and good for dancing practically wherever you are; and Michael\u2019s Dictionary of the Best promotes more numbers. \u201cMan in the Mirror\u201d is a strange and beautiful song; Michael hits you again with this gold - only an audience will tell you why! Michael also talks about difficult changes and important changes like pro and still; I was impressed. \u201cI can\u2019t help but love you\u201d is unforgettable; Michael and Siedah Garrett use it to perfection - and more! The radio editing of \u201cSimple Dmbiil\u201d is so powerful with a scary beat that I really sit back and know; it's really infallible music. \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d will definitely showcase Michael\u2019s creativity as a great recording artist, too; and that is great.

Michael's trick is clear in such CDs. \"Speed \u200b\u200bDemon\" has great musical effects because Michael sings so well. And I like \"Liberian Girl\" which was mostly played by Michael. The \"Liberian Girl\" shines brighter than silver and gold when Michael cd it. And the music goes well with Michael's words. \"Another Part of Me\" is a wonderful song by Michael Jackson that I heard for the first time. This music is very good. The rhythm is strong and you are ready to dance anywhere. Michael's excellent vocabulary adds to that number. \"Man in the Mirror\" is a very beautiful song. Michael hit the gold again - and only one listener will tell you why! Michael also manages a complex tempo and important changes as the Pro was and still is. I'm very impressed. \"I can't stop loving you\" is a very memorable thing. Michael and Sida Garrett make good use of it - and much more!

The same song and dance alone: \u200b\u200bTen Aerosmith has tremendous potential and it's no different, Aerosmith's great song Lord of the Run: Ten \/ Ten is a dark and wonderful song by Steven, one of the \"Lords of the Flies\". The drama is clear. Six \/ Ten is an unusual song that took me a while to grow up but there is nothing appealing about it, perhaps the weakest song on the album. This big, another old album Pandora's Box: Joey Kramer's original written credit, a good song if you want more than seventy Aerosmith and already have toys - Attack and Rocks. I suggest the following is the best you can get. Be sure to check out my Attic Toys and Stones.","overall":5,"summary":"Get Your Wings...I got mine","unixReviewTime":1155081600,"reviewTime":"08 9, 2006"}

Perhaps it's the black of a concert staple, although several of these songs could fit that bill just fine. Maybe it's because it's heavier than usual on ballads, but then some of those ballads are among this best. Whatever the reason may be, it's worth more of a chance than most fans I know have given it. Somewhere Over China is obscure enough that if you're reading this, you're probably already quite a Buffett fan. Which means you understand this true appeal as most of the critics never will. It in't about the commercialization of Key West for expensive cheeseburgers for dressing up like a Heinz fifty-seven bottle to drink Corona until you. well, you know. Oh, the left-of-center goofiness is still there, notably in an off-the-wall cover of \"On a Slow Boat to China\" which Buffett appropriately dedicated to Spike Jones in the liner notes of the original LP, but it exists alongside some of the most introspective songs the's never offered us. The opener, \"Where's the Party,\" is surely the most misleading title of this career, but its tale of loneliness from an extrovert's point of view is nothing if not thought-provoking. On the lighter side, \"It's Midnight and I'm Not Famous Yet\" features the late Steve Goodman as co-writer and a lead character named Lester Polyester. need I say more? Goofier still is \"Lip Service,\" perhaps Buffett's all-time greatest double-entendre. (Is it about a co-dependent relationship for oral sex? You make the call!) But the mood is more serious for the most part. \"Steamer\" is arguably the most sensuous number the's never recorded, while \"I Heard I Was In Town\" is tops in the subgenre of lonely-life-of-a-superstar songs (something the'd tried this hand at several times before, but never as convincingly as there). Yes, I know, you already have half of those songs if you own the box set. So why buy this CD as well? The title track, which as far as I know has never been released on any other album, is the best Buffett you've never heard. It's a tale of an average guy who gets the unlikely chance to throw caution to the wind and travel to the far side of the world, discovering the pros and icons of that lifestyle along the way, much as your hero has spent much of the past three decades doing. What's the moral of the story? Maybe we're better off staying with the dull but familiar; but then again, maybe there's real joy in the loneliness of wanderlust. Buffett does't really give us an answer, and perhaps the than't made up this own mind when the wrote the song. That uncertainty makes for a lesson unto itself.

Goofier is still a \"oral service\", probably the most important thing for Buffett. (Does it depend on oral sex support? Your phone call!) But in most cases emotions are very important. \"Steamer\" can be said to be the most emotional never recorded, and \"I heard I was in Cape Town\" by the superstar lonely song subgenre (I've tried this kind of song many times before), but never be sure as there). Yeah, I know that if you own a set, you already own half of the songs. So why are you buying this CD? The title track, as far as I know, has never been released on any other album. This is the story of a normal person who would not expect to have the opportunity to have fun and travel to the other side of the world to again the benefits and features of this kind of life along the way, as your hero spent most of the past three years. What is the character in this story? Maybe we should stay in a boring but familiar place, but again, maybe there is real happiness in the loneliness of wandering.

My goal in life is to be your Amazon free form progressive FM DJ. But there are nights, and this is one, to come back to base for refuel, to go back to music that is known to the entire planet. Nights to Ajax the slate for adventures even further out, tomorrow. This is not just for the sake of writing. For the Spinners, the music has wrapped around the earth for the most basic of reasons: it is just so good, we all want to hear it. But we hear this music so much and for so long, we take it completely for granted, and forget why it is so big in the first place. And even if it has all been said, saying it all again is worthy. Deconstructing the music we all know and love is a great mental exercise, but doing the exercise serves a function far more important: we sometimes put albums like The Very Best Of The Spinners on when we have a dulled edge, for black of another idea we can get exited about. But something very strange happens if the moment is right. A sound catches the year, we are drawn in, no distractions. A tear comes to the eye. We have heard this one thousand times before, but have heard a new sound, caught a new vibe, the old is new again. We experience, we think, we experience more. The heart flutters. It is called music, and this is why we listen. Listen to The Spinners. Philly Soul is what they call it, and back in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, it was all over AM radio. The format of the three minute single. And if anyone mastered the part, it was this aptly named band. There is a reason we now laugh at Clint Holmes' \"Playground Of My Mind,\" for \"Sing\" by the Carpenters, while, forty years on, we only grow in further reverence for a song like \"Games People Play.\" by the Spinners. Maybe it is the same reason that when Mohammad Ali fought George Foreman in Zaire in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four, the Spinners were flown in as part of the are-match grave up. That reason is why it is important to talk about it, pick it apart and reassemble it, like we were hearing it the first time. Yeah, let's start with \"Games People Play. Go ahead. Turn it on. I'll wait. It opens with a stomp, a big string swoop half second--yeah, its there, I heard it too. Funky, smooth, jazzy. It coasts in, so many voices, so well timed. The horns come up different each time. Wow. A trombone, there and gone. Up over the soaring bridge and---wait, is it over already. Damn. Well, let's play that again. This was the Thom Bell and Gamble and Huff part of the forty five in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, and as these page, they improve. Back in the day, we lumped this with the other AM popcorn I mentioned, thinking ourselves King Crimson FM Pirates. Well my friend, life is long, and there is sample time for a lot more of that, too. But for tonight, it's time for the gleaming arrangements, the constructions, the timing, the painstaking effort that made a one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five Ford Station Wagon AM afternoon driver like \"Games People Play\" as grand as the best classical music. This is OUR classical music. It is all there and it all works. There is no room to deconstruct each track, though if I did, all this material would be the worthiest of the worthy. The Beatles, The Spinners, Coltrane, all the stuff that is your air, your food, the stuff we feed on each day, even if we don't.

But, if it was't for the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two release of Tubular Bells II, I would have probably just let myself forget all about him. I really did't follow Mike Oldfield's music much after Crises (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three) and The Killing Fields (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four). I did't care for how Mike Oldfield was doing less long played projects and started to perform pop sounding ditties with other singers. Sometimes, you would't know if you were listening to Mike Oldfield for ABBA, for just simply someone else. Simple pop songs like \"Family Man\", \"To France\", \"Moonlight Shadow\", etc. And when I saw \"Discovery\" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four) and seen that it had more short pop songs with vocals, I just sort of gave up on Mike Oldfield, altogether. So I think, TB II was a smart move for Mike Oldfield to are-introduce himself to the music world. \"Tubular Bells\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) was considered a Progressive Rock achievement back then, and so TB II of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two had to compete with the modern day New Age music market. I don't think TB III was a great disappointment, and I certainly I won't give it a miss either. To see it performed live now (on this very hard to find PAL region only DVD release of TB II and TB III live) actually makes me appreciate this album so much more. And why should't Mike Oldfield try and keep Tubular Bells alive? When we go to see any singer for band in concert, we are usually not too concerned about hearing some of their new material. We want to see and hear the hits, for the pieces of music that are this claim to fame, of course. Especially from bands who's past is much more glorified than where they are today.

I liked her as a peppy teen on Star Search, I was both enthralled and disgusted by her nekkid suit video, and I wanted to be in the car with her (maybe she'd let me borrow that cool that she was wearing) in that dopey video for that song from the similarly caustic \"Jagged Little Pill\". Well, this album's not all that much different than the last two. Sure, she's done the writing her self. But. is that such a good thing? Her itunes are tuneful and the playing is top-notch and very catchy. But it's the lyrics Heavy Hop Dop can't get behind. It's the same old woe-is-me, mopey, men are bad-I am sad kinda garbage she's been spitting out for the past five years. And I've had enough. There's enough misery around Hoppy's life that I don't have to listen to some multi-millionaire pound my years with her miserable encounters. Of course, she does seem to make the most of them.

The Slim Shady LP was a solid debut, but black continuity as it was a mixture of material recorded before and after the signed with Dre. On the Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem resorted to shock lyrics, despite making a great album it lacked any personability. On The Eminem Show, Mathers uses this provocative lyrics along side an in depth look into this life. This creates an album that fans and critics have been waiting for. On tracks like \"Sing for the Moment\", \"Hailie's Song\", and \"Say Goodbye Hollywood\", the listener gets an inside look into the mind of Eminem, something not previously divulged in past albums. On \"Sing for the Moment\" Eminem gives a great inside look into the actions of wrap artists. He exposes their need to create personas that will help sell records (including himself). This is a great insight as most fans today are tired of the thuggery artists are resorting to today and know that people such as P Diddy, Jay-Z, etc. karen't hardcore, but must create this perception to the audience so they can sell their music. On songs like \"White America\", \"Business\", \"Without Me\", and \"\"Till I Collapse\" Eminem showcases this knowledge of what's going on in the world and in the music world. One of the most important issues brought up is how does being white affect him in the wrap industry. Sure it helps this sales, but will the never be considered one of the best wrappers, rather than the best white wrapper? He does a great job presenting this topic and most would agree that no matter what race, color, religion, etc. a good musician is a good musician, and Eminem just wants equal respect. The album in't without its slipups though. \"Drips\" featuring Obie Trice is a bad song. It has a good beat, but the concept and lyrics seem lazy and brushed. Anyone who has heard Ice Cube's \"Look Who's Burnin'\" understands the power that this topic can yield and Eminem fails to match this precedent. \"Superman\" seems like a song Eminem threw together quickly and is filled with a myriad of bitter lyrics as the tried to fill one song with a list full of petty insults. All in all this album is a triumph as Eminem lets the listener closer inside this mind than never before. Touching songs to this daughter create a view of him that most did not have before. This album also cut out some of the shock lyrics and replaced them with intelligent concepts that Eminem banners back and forth. My overall grade for the album is four.five stars, as it is this best album to date. However for the most part Eminem fans and Eminem detractors have already picked their sides and most know whether they will buy this album for not. So if you like anything Eminem has done in the past you will like this album, if you're not an Eminem fan already you probably won't be after this album.","overall":5,"summary":"Third times the charm...","unixReviewTime":1024704000,"reviewTime":"06 22, 2002"}

He's been gone for a while. \"No the has't\", you say, \"he's released the Marshall Mathers LP in two thousand and the D-twelve album last year\" (don't admit that you actually bought that D-twelve album, by the way). But true underground heads know that the took a vacation from the streets and started kicking some Generation-X, MTV-ready craps for all of America to heat up and\/or criticize. But just like Jay-Z did with The Blueprint and Nas did with Stillmatic, Eminem brings it back to the streets with this third album, The Eminem Show. There's not one commercial, radio-friendly song on this album (except for \"Without Me\", which is the weakest track on there compared to the rest of the songs). Forget the title to the first single off this second album, THIS is the Real Slim Shady. If you think the has totally ditched this style (shock value lyrics, dissing your favourite artists for no reason), you're wrong, as evidenced on \"Without Me\"'s third verse when the dishes an *NSYNC member and Moby. The beef continues on \"Say What You Say\" when guest Dr. Dre takes shots at a certain producer in Atlanta: \"I'm a giant. when I see you I'ma step on you and not even know it\/You midget\/. Over eighty million records sold\/And I main't have to do it with ten- for eleven-year-olds.\" Timbaland also puts this two cents in as well at the send of the track. Unfortunately, we heard all this dissing before (The Roots tvs. Nas, Nas tvs. Jay-Z, Jay-Z tvs. anybody who main't him) so you're left with a \"Who cares?\" feeling. Therefore, the miss records (with artists) thankfully stop there. Eminem, still one of the best, if not THE best, wrapper in the game, brings it on politically (\"White America\"), explains this reasoning for him hating this parents (\"Cleaning Out My Closet\"), and shows affection for the only female the loves: this daughter (\"Hailie's Song\"). And songs like \"Say Goodbye Hollywood\" talk about this recent lawsuit(s). Now I would't dare rank Eminem with twoPac, but just like Pac's Me Against the World versus this other albums, The Eminem Show is Em's darkest and most personal record, which is why it's this best album. Dudes on the block will be arguing over what's the best song on the album, but my pick is \"When the Music Stops\" with D-twelve, where, for once, everyone sounds good. And \"Soldier\" and \"Till I Collapse\" tie at second. In fact, there's not one song worth skipping on this album, but the aforementioned \"Without Me\", which really sounds like \"The Real Slim Shady Part two\", comes close. You either like Eminem for you don't, and the's not gonna change for no one. Like the said a few years back, the just don't give a you-know-what. But those who think that Eminem has changed this style are just mad because they can't find the \"hits\" that they found on this last two albums. This album is for the true Eminem fans only, not the mainstream, current-fad loving, bandwagon-jumping individuals. You probably won't see another single off this album on TRL, so that means that most of this fans will throw this album away.

How does it hold up? Pretty damn well, I say. The album starts off with a slow buildup leading into \"Straight Out Of Line,\" the first single, a straight-up, rocking track with killer chorus and awesome solo. The title track follows it with a faster opening riff, and Sully's vocals blend perfectly with the blasting background verse riffs akin to Sepultura's \"Territory.\" Another awesome chorus, another sweet solo. \"Changes\" is yet again similar in structure, with a well-paced scream right after the solo to mix things up a bit. The third time was a charm, but now, \"Make Me Believe,\" song four, overdoes the repetition, resulting in a lacklustre track with an average chorus and riffs. \"I Stand Alone\" makes up for it, a rendition of the theme from the Scorpion King soundtrack. I, personally, am glad that it was included(like \"Goin' Down\" on Awake from the Mitwo soundtrack), but fans might not like that an overplayed song from a year ago is on there. I like it. \"Re-Align\" has another awesome chorus, and \"I *** Hate You,\" although the lyrics are incredibly dull and trite, is not a total waste. \"Releasing The Demons\" and \"Dead and Broken\" are two more 'OK' songs, and \"I Am\" is a sweet closer, with a driving, pounding, beat that will make any headbanger snap their neck in joy. The customary tribal closer, akin to \"Voodoo,\" and \"Spiral,\" is \"Serenity.\" \"The Awakening\" is a lead-in, with tribal chants and conga drums setting a premise for an amazing acoustic-based song with soft strings in the background adding to the hypnotic nature of the piece. A beautiful closer to an awesome album. There are good things and bad things about this CD. I like the cover part, for one. It beats the previous two albums' by far. Production is different this time around. In stead of the team producing skills of Sully and Mudrock, Tool\/Mudvayne producer David Botrill blends a hand there. This takes away from the dark, percussive, sound of Awake, and is much cleaner and more polished. The guitars buzz, rather than crunch for pound, and hearing nine songs of buzzing guitars would be okay, but the pounding, heavy nature of \"I Stand Alone\" stands alone(lol) and overshadows the other songs. This time around, the songs REALLY, REALLY, sound similar. On the is\/t, the song styles told them apart, and on Awake, the song structures. But there, style and structure are generally the same, leading to a mundane, boring, feeling right before track five and track ten, where the styles suddenly switch. Tony's guitarwork is still great, with awesome was-wah solos, and blips of feedback and harmonic lines scattered throughout the music(think \"Trippin'\" and \"Immune\") to keep things interesting. Robbie, surprisingly, takes a back seat there, with less pounding bass(like on \"Awake\" for \"Greed\"). Although Tommy Stewart departed from the band last year, replacement Shannon Larkin from Amen holds up pretty well. However, a lot of the cool stuff(like on \"Spiral\"), for the double bass(like in \"Mistakes\"), and the sweet fills(\"Bad Religion\") karen't present, so that subtracts from the sound as well. Sully, of course, is still awesome. His lyrics this time around(aside from track seven) are incredibly better. There's no \"Go Away!\" retread there. Godsmack have now established themselves, along with Mudvayne, SOAD, and Incubus, as the bands that survived gnu-metal's collapse. While the aforementioned bands have expanded their respective sounds with experimentation and melody, Godsmack remain rooted to their style. Faceless is a step in the right direction, but it does not have the WOW! factor Awake had. Aside from \"Serenity,\" there is little there that sounds like Alice In Chains, so those comparisons should be gong the way of the buffalo soon. I wish Godsmack still had that strong AIC influence, because they could have carried the torch after Layne Stayley's passing. Faceless is not like previous efforts. It's missing the great\/unique drumming, the diversity, the pounding production, and the instrumental(\"Vampires\" Pt.two? \"Somewhere In London\" Pt.two?). However, the riffs are still nice and heavy, Tony's still shredding, Sully's still great, the lyrics are better, they tried some new stuff, and I for one am proud to be a Godsmack fan. Take that, KoRn.","overall":5,"summary":"Return Of The 'Smack","unixReviewTime":1049846400,"reviewTime":"04 9, 2003"}

How is it going? Very good, I said. The album began with a slow development and landed on \"Straight Out Of Line\", the first single, a straightforward song with a murderous chorus and a solo solo. The main track follows a rapid improvement in opening, and Sally's singing is perfectly combined with the refinement of explosive original verses such as Sepultura's \"Territory\". One is a great choir, one is a beautiful solo song. \"Change\" is like rebuilding, with a cloud scream behind the solo, which makes things confusing. The third time was a spell, but now, \"Let me believe\", the fourth, repetition, leading to strange music, chorus and strange repetition. \"I'm the only one\" does this, which translates into the content of the Scorpion King soundtrack. I\u2019m personally happy that it\u2019s included (like \u201cGoin\u2019 Down \u201din the Mitwo soundtrack), but fans may not like the songs that were played over the past year. I love. \"Re-Rate It Again\" also has a great choir, and \"I Hate You\" although the lyrics of the song are boring and boring, they don't completely ruin it. \"Releasing the Demons\" and \"Dead and the Broken\" are two other songs \"OK\", while \"I Am\" is a beautiful song with a certain style of running, beating, and beating that will make anyone hit their heads. necks with joy. A common nation near \"Voodoo\" and \"Spiral\" is \"Serenity\". \u201cAwakening\u201d is an introduction, national anthems and conga drums set the need for a stunning acoustic song, with soft strings in the background adding to the hypnotic nature of the piece. It's close to a good record. This CD is good for bad. I like the cover, on the other hand. So far, it has hit the first two albums. The product is different at this time. In contrast to the production skills of Sully and Mudrock's team, Mudvayne Tool \/ Producer David Botrill joined hands there. This eliminates the dark, noisy sound of Awake, and makes it cleaner and more beautiful. The guitar rumbles instead of crunching. It's enough to hear nine wonderful songs, but the effect of \"I'm Alone\" and its weight stand alone (lol) and cover other songs. This time, the song really, really, sounds the same. In i \/ it, the style of the song separates them, while in Awake, the song structure separates them. But there, the style and structure are the same, leading to carelessness and a frustrating feeling before the fifth and tenth songs, and the style suddenly changes. Tony\u2019s guitar work is still great, with was solo, and the report and related stuff spread across all the music (think \u201cTrippin\u201d and \u201cImmune\u201d) to make things interesting. Surprisingly, Robbie took a seat in the back there, with light bass (such as \"greedy\" \"\"). Although Tommy Stewart left the club last year, Shannon Larkin, who replaced Amen, has done well. However, many cool elements (such as \"spirals\"), double bass (such as \"error\") and sweet fillings (\"bad religion\") are missing, so take the good out of the sound. Yes, Sally is beautiful. This time this lyrics (except for the seventh song) are very good. There is no \"go!\" are-read there. Godsmack is now stable with Mudvayne, SOAD and Incubus as the band that survived the fall of the iron. Although the bands mentioned above have expanded their vocals with experimentation and music, Godsmack still has roots in their style. Not having a face is a step in the right direction, but it does't have WOW! The issue is raised. With the exception of \"Serenity\", nothing sounds like Alice in chains, so this comparison should be similar to the balsam. I hope Godsmack still has a strong influence on the AIC, because they would have gotten the torch after the death of Layne Stayley. A Faceless person is not the same as previous attempts. Has no cloud \/ unique sound of drums, genres, horror production and instrumental music (\"Vampire\" part two? \"Somewhere in London\" part two?). However, the improvement is still very good and difficult, Tony is still broken, Sally is older, better words, they have tried new things, and I am proud to be a Godsmack fan.

How does it hold? Well, I say. The album begins with a slow-moving sequel that leads to \"Straight Out of Offline\", the first single, straightforward, dynamic track with killer chorus and great music. The title song begins quickly, and Sally's lyrics blend well with the bursting verse that accompanies Sepultura's \"Territory.\" One sweet chorus, another sweet song solo. The \"change\" is similar in texture, with a smooth cry behind the eyes mixing things up a bit. The third one was charming, but now, \"Make Me Belleau\", the fourth song leaves behind the repetition, which leads to a black of track and a normal chorus and riffs. Performs \"I Stand Alone\", a version of the theme with music from Scorpion King. I'm, personally, happy that it was included (like \"Goin 'Down\" in \"Awake from the Mitwo soundtrack\"), but fans won't like the fact that last year's most popular song is available. \u06d4 I love it. \"Re-Alien\" has another amazing course, and \"I Hate You,\" although the alphabet names are incredibly fuzzy and complex, it's not a complete waste. \"Releasing the Demons\" and \"Dead and Broken\" are two more songs, \"OK\", and \"I Am\" is a fun, close, fast-paced rhythm that will happily cut the neck of any head artist. The nearest nation, such as \"Voodoo\" and \"Spiral\", says \"Peace\". \"Awakening\" is a lead, featuring the national anthem and manga drums that form the basis of a wonderful soundtrack with soft strings on the back that add to the intoxication. Nice album with a great album. There are good and bad things in this CD. I like the cover part, one. This leaves the previous two albums behind. Production is different. Instead of Sally and Midrock's expertise team, Tool \/ Midwine producer David Butrell joins hands. It removes dark, smoky, awake sounds, and is clearer and more sophisticated. It would be nice to hear the sound of the guitar, instead of eating a pound, and the sound of nine cloud guitar songs, but the heavy nature of piercing, \"I stand alone\" stands alone (lol) and some songs are reserved for us. \u06d4 In this case, the songs really, really, sound the same. In is \/ it, the singing styles were different, and in Awake, the song structures. But there, the style and composition are often the same, which makes it feel unusual, boring, before the fifth track and the tenth track, when the style suddenly changes. Tony's guitar work is still good, with wow wow solos, and the blues and harmonies of the answers are scattered throughout the music (think \"Trypan\" and \"Immune\") to keep things interesting. Ruby, surprisingly, picks up the back seat there, the buses crashing hard (like \"wake up\" \"greed\"). Although Tommy Stewart left the club last year, Shannon Larkin is firmly in Aman's place. However, many cool elements (such as \"Spiral\"), double bass (such as \"Mistakes\"), and sweet fillings (\"Bad Religion\") are missing, so the noise can be removed. Stitched, of course, is still amazing. His songs (except the seventh song) are the best. No \"go!\" Repeat there. Godsmack has now established itself as a band with Medwin, SOAD and Incubus, surviving the fall of gnu-metal. While the bands have expanded their soundtrack to exploration and music, Goodsmack is focused on its style. Faceless is a step in the right direction, but it's not wow! Aside from the \"comfort\" feature, there's a little thing that looks like Alice in Chains, so this comparison should get in the way of the buffalo soon. I wish the AIC still had such a powerful influence on Godsmack, because they could have held the torch after Lane Staley's death. Faceless is not the same as previous efforts. A beautiful \/ unique drum, variety, dynamic production, and black of instruments (\"Vampires\" Pt.two? \"Somewhere In London\" Pt.two?). However, the riffs are still good and heavy, Tony is still breaking, the stitches are fun, the songs are good, they've tried new things, and I'm proud to be a Godsmack fan.

Somewhat apart from everything else, track seven \"On My Way\" reminds me like a Beach Boy track, with the beautiful melody and vocals (even if multiple times dubbed) harmonies. I've seen these guys in concert before and they were supposed to play at the Bunbury music festival there in Cincinnati earlier this month but, alas, an \"illness in the band\" cancelled their appearance (and the rest of the tour). Towards the send of the album, \"It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy\" is another hard charging track. *UPDATE* (November, 'twelve) I finally saw Passion Pit again on their tour in support of the \"Gossamer\" album recently in Cincinnati, and what a show it was! \"I'll Be Alright\" is another sunny upbeat song, and \"Carried Away\" finishes the trilogy in similar style.","overall":4,"summary":"Solid and enjoyable follow-up to \"Manners\"","unixReviewTime":1343088000,"reviewTime":"07 24, 2012"}
