3814,"Man pooh man! What a piece of crummy film-making! But this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though I hate to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the border of Cupertino) we had this thing called The G Channel on your cable system. And they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in lust and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her dopey adventures in the Grand Canyon in the one thousand, nine hundred and forty. The script makes almost no sense, the direction is poor, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance, a lot of dialog that's so bad it's good and a nice Carole King song played over the send credits. Maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick. And they, everybody knows there main't no gold in the Grand Canyon!",negative

8734,"Wow. I can't believe just how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T three) really is. I'd heard the rumours, read the reviews - but had to make my mind up for myself. Well, let me tell rya - IT BLOWS!!! The worst acting of any film never made, dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted, inept and laughable gore FX, no discernible plot, ""cinematography"" that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder, weapons props that are no joke - made out of tin-foil - the list goes on and on. Three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and tin-foil swords. Two of the captives are freed along with a rebel of the island freaks, and are given a day's head start before they are hunted down by the rest of the ""tribe"". that's pretty much it. Honestly - this is one of THE WORST films I've never had the misfortune to subject myself too. The budget had to be about $two hundred and was spent entirely on the gore FX (which actually may not have been a bad idea. ). There is NOTHING to ZOMBIE DOOM other than strung-together ridiculous looking gore scenes with lots of HORRIBLY dubbed dialog. This film makes other no-budget outings like PREMUTOS: LORD OF THE LIVING DEAD look like TITANIC. Some may rank ZD in the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category - and I guess if you're REALLY drunk for high and watching it with a few friends MSTthreeK-style - I guess it could be looked at that way. But not by me. I hated pretty much everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM for ZOMBIE ninety (which is equally appalling and is included as a ""bonus"" on the Shock-O-Rama release of ZD) is indicative of Andreas Schnaas' other works - then the should be banned from never having anything to do with making a film never again under penalty of death. There is one amusing young-fu battle in the latter half of the film, and a lot of blood - so I'll grant this one a VERY generous three/ten - Do yourself a favor and skip this.",negative
8734,"Wow. I can't believe how bad the ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T three) is. I’ve heard the rumours and read the comments — but I have to decide for myself. Well, let me tell you rya-exploded! ! ! The worst performance of any movie that has not been photographed, the dubbing that has to be done with all the participants is completely destroyed, the FX with improper blood and absurdity, none of which is visible, it seems my grandmother shot with her camera ""Cinema Photography"", equipment and and props are a joke made of tin-list file is endless. Three people were trapped on the island, and a group of frightened men fled around carrying plastic and swords. The two captives were released along with the rebels of the great beast on the island and received guidance one day before being hunted by other ""tribes"". That's very nice. Honestly — this is the worst movie I’ve never had the misfortune to allow myself to suffer. The budget should be about $ two hundred and fully spent on gore FX (this may not be a bad idea.).

And Dennis Hopper is the only visionary / scientist who has been prepared for the worst, and who has seen it. But what is the real purpose of Stevens (Sony D'Angelo)? He is angry because Dennis has decided who will be saved for destruction! Although it clearly tells Stevens that Dennis' character did everything to warn people of danger, Jehovah was mocked. The shopper character was the boy who put this finger in the pool, now Stevens accuses him of 'picking and picking' ???

42206,"I have some of the older videos and adds of Dr. Who. I've played them over and over. I adore each of the ""Doctors"" for different reasons. But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was cancelled, even though it was still one of the mainstays of the BBC line-up. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the Doctor stayed alive through the fans. BBC graciously allowed fans to write books, and cartoons. The momentum of Dr. Who has been steady even after one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. Then they took a chance with Paul McGann. The movie was flawed, but it gave the BBC an idea of what we wanted. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, the ""man"" was gone and the newbies at the BBC felt it was time to bring the Doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in America, the Sci-fi Channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well, although the writers were having to start over and explain the Dr. Who mythology for new viewers.

Unfortunately, ""Man with the Screaming Brain"" was itself a disappointment. Set in Bulgaria--where the Sci-Fi Channel makes its Saturday night original films--""Man with the Screaming Brain"" is a curious mix of 'fiftys B-movie horror, body-switching comedy, violent revenge flick, and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If that does't make sense, well, neither does ""Man with the Screaming Brain."" Campbell plays a pharmaceutical company CEO who visits Bulgaria with this estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former Communist country's half-finished subway system. The two fall in with a former KGB agent turned cab driver, and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy woman. A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and this goofy assistant (Ted Raimi), who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection, steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab driver's brain into Campbell's damaged skull. Also, they put this wife's brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at hand. Campbell escapes, and with a hastily-restitched skull and the voice of the cab driver--whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of this body--echoing in this head, sets off to find and kill the gypsy.

Just as the was playing this own evil hand in ""Evil Dead II,"" Campbell is adept at making this body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind. At times, ""Screaming"" comes closest to another Steve Martin film, ""The Man with Two Brains,"" as it also takes a silly approach to 'fiftys sci-fi clickés.

46830,"""Creep"" is a new horror film that, without a doubt, will please many genre fans simply because it's so down to the point and unscrupulous! It has many genuine shock-moments, a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension. What it has't got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that did't bother me for one second. When the send-credits start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer Christopher Smith (in this debut) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the ""creep"" in the London subway. The story revolves on the young and haughty Kate, who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous factor George Clooney who's in town to present this new film. She falls asleep in the subway, misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network. Things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and skills/kidnaps people to experiment upon. Even experienced homeless people, security guards for sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster! I really dug the creep-character! He's nauseating, hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating. Christopher Smith only leaves us clues and hints, and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background. I reckon this in't very original, and I'm sure many people won't appreciate the black of content, but I forgive Smith and I think it's better this way than going over the top completely, ""Jeepers Creepers""-style (that particular film started out great as well, but as soon as the Creeper's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort). The obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore! There's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up, as well as the sound effects, are very convincing. The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used. There also is some acting-talent present in this film, with Franka Potenta (Run Lola Run) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool German film ""Anatomie"". Creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an undemanding mood and Christopher Smith definitely is a director I'll keep an eye on.

I could't hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit. It was a ""okay. it was just barely entertaining enough to sit there for the entire movie but now let's get out of there as fast as possible!"" type of exit. This is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily. Any thought as to, ""what's the point of that?"" will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing. Okay. SPOILERS follow. So, basically, a scientist creates ""the Machine"" that is capable of creating other, intelligent, robotic life. Evil humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that the is also at fault. He gave the Machine this intellect, but did't give it this heart. The Machine goes Skynet on humanity's collective ass and wipes out all life on earth, finally slowly powering down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock-puppets. Each one, containing a piece of the scientist's soul. The last one, #nine wakes up not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets up with another like himself, #two. Well, #two gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. #nine finds more like himself hands sets off to rescue #two. They succeed.#nine notices that there is a matching whole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life. pulling out #two's soul in the process. The movie then continues with action scenes with #nine trying to rescue this soul-yanked compatriots. They eventually succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go up into the clouds. It then trains and we see life returning back to the planet. Hunh?!? That makes no sense. None at all. Why the check did the scientist want to split this soul into nine homunculi? What did it accomplish? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!? Why did the expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a ""soul"" to fight the first. at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success. Why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps?",negative

Make a monster weapon that can control everything. But does “soul” have the power to destroy both life and death? Really? This is something that makes my head spin. Here, we have a CGI movie. Do it scientifically. Do they use it to convey to us the message that science will destroy the earth and at the same time promote the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they humbly asked one of the characters to ask: ""What are you doing now?"" (or something similar). I do not feel well, for the crowd rose immediately and crested on their way out. This is ""okay. It's just fun enough to sit down and watch the whole movie, but now let's get out of there quickly!"" Exit type. This is another movie you can't imagine if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visible effects, and nod your head carefully. Have you never thought, ""What's the point of that?""

So basically, scientists have developed “machines” that can create the life of other intelligent robots. Wicked people use it as a weapon. However, scientists recognize that this is wrong. He gave the machine this kind of intelligence, but the never gave this heart. The machine enters the Skynet into the human asshole, destroys all life on earth, and eventually the energy slows down. However, scientists have been table to survive and create dolls to travel in socks. One has the soul of a scientist. Lastly, #nine wakes up unaware of the world. He saw a strange weapon nearby and picked it up. He met someone like him, #two. Yeah, # two caught by the last heavy machine. #eine gets as much as her hands and starts to rescue the #two. They succeeded. #nine realized that there is something completely compatible with the device perfectly. He plugged it in and the machine came back to life. In the process, exhale #two. So the movie continues with episode # Nine trying to save this country with a soul taken. Eventually they succeeded and destroyed the machine. They rescued the souls of fallen relatives who had fallen on the clouds. Then the started training, and we saw life coming back to earth. Humph? ! ? This is vanity. no one. Why do scientists view the soul as being divided into nine parts? What does it accomplish? Are they designed to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine is dead! Why bother? ! ? Why do you expect the nine animals to succeed when there is nothing else to do? Why not make a second intelligent machine, but use ""soul"" as opposed to the first. At least it seems like it will have a fair chance of success. Why should they allow their souls to suck into a machine with a machine, then destroy the machine, and release the soul to bring life back to earth?

A reference. Only this apology was made. Jon Bon Jovi is like a woman. In fact, Bon Jovi and the two girls Vampire, Natasha Wagner and Arly Jover are probably together in the same outfit. In other words, it’s hard to say which is better for the anorexic ramp-model. Bon Jovi has the most attractions. Atleast the looks happy when the smiles. The two Vampire Girls on the other hand are all desires and complaints. At one point they almost kissed each other, but stopped. It’s amazing how every vampire movie has some vampire characters. At one point, Arly Jover gives the fellatio Vampire Hunter a very dumb and then sucks this blood while doing the act of sex. It’s going to be a moment of excitement other than getting the film to seem like a whole prank, and the guy’s point seems to be just amused while watching Arly Jover move this head to look like nothing happened. As it progressed, many heads were torn, and blood flowed. These scenes have little suspicion about the construction that when it happened it was almost ridiculous, and there were no “terrorist” payments on the site. All you get from an audience member is a feeling that ""Wow, there's definitely a lot of red paint scattered on the walls. I'm wondering who needs to clean it up."" Throughout the film, the Vampire Hunters who seem to be trying to kill Arly Jover (the top vampire in the world ??) keep talking to him. At one point, Bon Jovi enters a neglected church only after being shot narrowly (and the does it again), saying ""I'm not trying to hurt you. I want to talk to you. I want to get to know you."" HUH ?? Of course, the dumb vampire jumped up to say hello, Bon Jovina put it on again using another sticky device. “Why can’t I be friends” a thousand, nine hundred and seventy songs sung by WAR became the theme of this film. In addition to all the other moments of stupidity, there were a series of spills when Natasha Wagner was removed from all her Vampire blood, and the people of town were all in line to donate her translations. of blood. I don't think Blood Type matters? However, all of this Vampire blood was removed. Bon Jovi then decides that if that blood is given to him, the can defeat Arly and become a vampire as well. Of course, like the vampire blood transferred to him, none of this healthy blood was removed. So obviously Bon Jovi walks twice as many people in this body.

Her fear is that this is the only thing that has revealed it. John Bon Jovi looks like a girl. In fact, Bon Jovi and two vampire girls, Natasha Wagner and Early Jover, are almost identical in the same outfit. In short, it was difficult to say which Anorex ramp model was the best. Bon Jovi's heart is very good. At least the looks happy when the smiles. The two vampire girls, on the other hand, all have spain and complaints. Sometimes they would kiss each other wet, but they would stop. Surprisingly, every vampire movie has a certain vampire code of ethics. On one occasion, Early Jover gives a dumbfounded vampire hunter a falcon and sucks blood while having sex. It would be a thrilling moment without being photographed as an overall idiot, and the male character looked happy when Early Jower saw him shake this head to mimic something that was clearly impossible. About a year, a few heads are removed, and the blood jumps too much. There's a bit of a built-in suspicion in these scenes that it's almost ridiculous in the event of an incident, and there's no ""terrible"" payment from the scene. As an audience member, you just realize, ""Wow, this was really a lot of red paint running down the walls. I wonder who should clean it."" Throughout the film, this vampire hunter who apparently tried to kill Early Jover (the world's tallest vampire ??) kept coming back. On one occasion, Bon Jovi goes to an abandoned church and after shooting him with a wire (and sometimes the does), the says, ""I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm just trying to hurt you."" I want to talk. I know you. "" no ?? Of course, the dumb vampire jumps to say hello early and Bon Jovi reconnects it with another encryption machine. The song ""Why Can't We Be Friends"" was supposed to be the theme song of the movie. Aside from all the other stupid moments, there is a series of transfers where Natasha Wagner sheds all her vampire blood, and everyone in town stands in line to donate blood for the transfiguration. I don't think blood type is important? However, all her vampire blood has been removed. Bon Jovi then decided that if the blood was transfused, the could defeat Early again for being a vampire. Of course, since vampire blood is transmitted to it, none of the healthy blood is extracted. So apparently Bon Jovi walks around with twice as much blood from this body.

26221,"While I do not think this was a perfect ten, I do agree it was way above a six which is what it's rated there. No, Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before. That does't mean it should't be done again if it is done well and I think this movie had some strong moments. The acting of Claire Danes, as already mentioned many times, was flawless as was Kate Beckinsell and I Think Bill Pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances(Pullman's wife, the crooked cop, skip for trip for whatever this name is). The cinematography was also beautifully filmed, there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some negatives(three major jones that I found) as well. Here is what I did't like about it-the friendship between the girls-In fact, the girls' own individual personalities-were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic. It would not have been improbable to close interest before then, because, despite the positives, more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested, were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much Jumping around without the character and scene development I think would have been appropriate for this type of film. That, however, is not my major problem. And WARNING-SPOILER ALERT. The ending as mentioned dozens of times already, was AWFUL. It was awful in two respects. Firstly, even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood, I wanted a happy ending! Yes, it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this, there is a Sense that justice will be served and I did sit through it to see that. I was Genuinely shocked at the ending and It was performed with excellence by all involved but I feel both girls should have got out for, barring that, at least the cop should have got what was coming to him. I mean nothing happens To the bad guys, they all get away with it. Very disturbing. Also, I do not understand the ambiguity of the ending. I understand endings that are inspired to make one think, but this was not a mystery for ""Clue"" type movie we were watching, and I would have liked to know something about what actually happened, who was guilty etc, with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since I somehow doubt there will be a sequel, I did not want to be kept guessing.

It is impossible to erase interest before that, because without the good thing, the characters' immediate growth should be improved, and some scenes (such as when the girl was captured) were almost covered, so connect very little without character development and scenes that I think are good for this kind of movie.

However, this movie has a lot to like, and performance is at the top of the list. I will give this movie a score of seven to five and it says it is worth watching.

First of all, there are some great things about this film, but they are all cutting-edge elements and a young film.

I am reading books now So I think this movie has pushed me beyond that. I saw him for free in the Hollywood cemetery and was very disappointed. A question from a listener to the director about Native American references, such as using ""booking money"" instead of better cuts in the film, is basically all about the film. National References --- Native American references were felt and created out of place. It is clear that this director and writer has tried to deal with a stadium in which the has never played before. They should have stuck to the old adage, ""Write about what you know."" If you really know this you will not see it in the movie. The beauty of this unique culture has not been given due justice. Clichés and ON The NOSE --- I agreed to watch this movie on the grounds that it was indie. So I caught it with high expectations. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" was indie and had seen her before she became so popular. Before the came out until it was fully released I was just curious about what it would be like to kill him. Unfortunately, I could't say the same thing about the ""expiration date."" ""Sunshine"" took us to the click title, but the filmmakers were so clever in their style that the result would have taken us away from the ""click"" strip. The film, on the other hand, had no way of falling off the ballot because it was already created from scratch. Psycho to Antix, Hendrix pairs, etc. I hate to say it, but the best and best film I've seen in both the Indies this year. ""Miss Miss Shine"" is the lead single and the movie has been a nightmare. I wish I could say something different. But I congratulate the filmmakers for doing well in the cemetery with their families.",positive
