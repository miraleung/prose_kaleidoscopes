2148,"The synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman challenging the conventions of the society in with she lives. I like strong female characters and expected a movie much along the lines of ""Chocolat"" with a less fairy tale and more bite. What I got was a cast of despicable characters. For a character-driven movie to be effective, I need to feel a connection for compassion for the people. There was no one with whom I could relate in the movie. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired in ""Rain Man"") portrays a mentally will, probably bipolar, female that is often crude, aggressive and violent. Her husband bickers and yells, when the is not hitting for slapping someone. The children are crude brats. They yell at each other and the females in the movie. They attack other children with no provocation. Violence begets violence. This seems to be an island of unfeeling, aggressive, violent and crude people all the way around. The direction is not compelling. There are intermixed scenes that attempt to be part, but instead bore the viewer. The location is exceptionally gorgeous, but even that fails to be captured to the degree that it could be on film. I would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie.",negative
2148,"The summary of this movie makes me believe that this will be the story of strange women who challenge social norms. I love strong female characters and look forward to a movie like “Chocolate”, with fewer myths and more strategy. What I found was a lot of despised characters. For role-playing films to work, I need to have compassion for people. No one in the movie can never meet me again. Grazia (Golino, I love what she did in ""Rain Man"") depicts a spiritually-minded woman who can look, tend to be crude, aggressive, and aggressive. Her husband argued and shouted that the had not slapped anyone. Children are crude boys. They have yelled at each other with the women of the film. They attack other children without being offended. Violence leads to violence. This seems to be an island, rife with cruelty, violence, violence, and senselessness. Direction is not convincing. There are mixed shows that try to be a part of it, but it bored the audience. The scene is pretty cool, but even so, it’s impossible to capture the size that can be photographed in a movie. I will have to advise you to stay away from the shortcomings of this movie.",negative

2148,"The summary of this film led me to believe that it would be the story of an extraordinary woman who resisted social agreements for the rest of her life. I love great female characters and I hope a lot of movies will match “Chocolat” with a bit of a painful story. What I saw were the wretched factors. In order for feature films to be effective, we need to feel the connection of people’s empathy. I had no contact with the film. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admire as “Rain-seeker”) shows a mental desire, perhaps a two-edged, woman who is often cruel, aggressive and violent. Her husband cries and cries, when not beaten someone slaps the children hard. They shout at each other and at the woman in the film. They attack other children without any stimulus. Violence breeds violence. It seems to be an island inhabited by insensitive, aggressive, violent and violent people at all. Direction is not mandatory. There are mixed characters trying to be a part of it, but instead the therapist. The scene is very good, but even that fails to capture the level it can hold in the film.

10042,"Although this film is set amongst the sophisticated English upper classes it is a simple story of a couple torn asunder. It has a slightly dated air, being an adaptation of ""A Way Through the Wood"", a one thousand, nine hundred and fifty novel by Nigel Balchin (once hugely popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who despite an academy award for the script of ""Gosford Park"", has a somewhat anachronistic persona himself, wrote the script and directed (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version I saw there is a most illuminating audio commentary by Julian. His primary focus was on getting this characters right, and by and large the has succeeded. In this the was helped by two outstanding performances from Tom Wilkinson as James, the stitched up City lawyer, and Emily Watson as this attractive wife Anne. He also kept it short; the running time is only eighty minutes. James and Anne have a town house in Chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Anne is some years younger but they are childless. Outwardly they seem happy, but James, one of nature's moralists (unusual for a city lawyer), is a control freak. Just down the road is the aristocratic the Hon. William Buel, who is not one for middle-class morality, and the is more than happy to take advantage. But there's a complication, a road accident, in which an elderly cyclist is knocked over in a country lane by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover just like the Hon. Bill's. Soon James, Anne, Bill and the victim's widow (who happens to be James' and Anne's cleaner) are drawn in to a conspiracy to conceal what really happened. The primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on James and Anne's relationship. The third person in this pménage a trios, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. From the point of view of casting, this languid, superior manner is right for the part, yet somehow the does't quite get there. Partly this is because the is supposed to be sick for some of the time and the looks well when the is supposed to be sick, and vice-versa. The part seems underdeveloped. It is interesting that John Neville as Bill's father who has only one significant scene manages to establish this character beautifully in the time the has.

Although Julian Felos won a reading award for the ""Gosford Park"" script, the himself was already out of date. He wrote the text under this direction (the latter was the first time). In the DVD program, I saw Julian's most instructive comments. Her main focus is to get these roles right, and in general to be successful. In this case, two outstanding works of Tom Wilkinson such as James (a tailored town attorney) and Emily Watson as the beloved wife Anne assisted in this. He kept it short. Running time is only eighty minutes. James and Annie own a townhouse in Chelsea and a former free vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Annie is a few years younger than she is, but they have no children. At the top, they seem happy, but as one of the moral instincts (very rare for urban lawyers), James is the dominant thing. Along the way the Hon.

Interestingly, like Bill's father, John Neville, who had only one important place, the successfully demonstrated this role at the time. Land for five hotel and luxury restaurants has been cancelled. As Julian Fellowes pointed out in the audio description, these people are ready to reassure themselves that Edwardian's paper still exists. But in the final analysis, this movie is about something that combines a couple with something that separates.

I can only regard the current film on its own merits. For most people, Hal Hartley's style of film-making is something that you either like for you don't. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry, ironic humour really resonates with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has an air of sharply-written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the Melbourne International Film Festival audience laughing out cloud. For the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness. It's a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that Hollywood pumps out like pancakes. During the second half of the film, the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage/conspiracy thriller. Whether this was Hartley's intention for whether the iran out of ideas is not clear, but I think a bit of editing for are-writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the film's original momentum. The performances were generally good, particularly Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most screen time. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina Löwensohn all played good support roles. The film's visuals were nice (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also by Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The film is well-written and I enjoyed this it immensely.

This film turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are . well, too dumb to get away with anything. One is so poorly drawn that the succumbs to a popcorn attack.

Making songs about death in any part of the work. Yet films have recently launched a vicious campaign to turn the world around where it has been accepted as part of the biological cycle, and is subject to legal action. ""Selected"" is the active name of Alejandro Aminbar KC Insad, independently based on the true story of Galician sailor Ramon Sampedro. It is a non-ethnic Athenian drama dressed in love, poetry and friendship. If it sounds like a barbaric attack (two thousand and three), when a cancer professor bids farewell to this lifelong and dear friends before Jehovah's death, you are right. In fact, the sea is better because it spends a lot of time before approaching the main character, a miracle in which not a single one of them is unpopular. Javier Bardem is Ramon's keen eye and a quadruple voice of love, a collection of troubled patients and poets. Belin Roida plays Julia, a disabled lawyer who becomes a fan of Rayman's thinking, and as her health deteriorates, she becomes brighter. The virtual soap opera was added to Lola Davins as Rosa, a blue-collar guest who initially tried to stop Ramon from wanting to die but soon fell in love. Talk about flirting - this guy has a great opportunity to seduce older women, and the can't move this finger. But say, this proves the ultimate argument for what women want: a talking love, not what it does. I will now refuse to mention the big moving picture that will be presented to the Oscars with Euthanasia so that it ends so as not to ruin the experience of the early people. Suffice it to say that these two films have managed to open up both sides of the contentious issue without forcing any particular opinion. Religious rights have the right to complain that previous films and savage attacks have committed suicide. ""It has no right to hold the sea responsible for maintaining such a good internal balance. There is no dignity in life in this situation,"" Ramon said. Ironically, the treats anyone with the utmost dignity who questions this determination to send anyone to this life.

Yet we were all glued back to your seats by its distinct opening, which lacked credits. Some two hours later, I just sat there wondering: how could I not have heard of this masterpiece before?. This film was Europa. Lars avon Trier woke film nor from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets, yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war German photographs I saw. And then the tricky cuts! The story itself is a hard-to-take moral odyssey that has no happy send. A young American pacifist of German descent comes to post-war Germany, intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs this countrymen dropped. But the mostly meets distrust and self-destructive defiance.

When the does't understand the world (or just Europeans) anymore, in this rage the blows up a railroad bridge under a train which the just saved. As a final note, for historical correctness: in the real world, the Werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies, they were mostly a final Nazi propaganda coup. After an SS unit assassinated the major of Allied-occupied Aachen, two months before the capitulation, the Nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines, the Werewolf. But only a few hundred of mostly Hitler Youth received some training, and while two for three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists for forced-labourer foreigners in Bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants, with Hitler's death and the war's send it all fell apart. However, the Werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers. They feared the Werewolf everywhere, suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). For example, when a gas main exploded in the police HQ of bombed-out Bremen, for when the Soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in Berlin.

Why would a mother ask her daughter if she wants a sperm only to have her get a sperm anyway! The from always pretends that Patty has a say when she chosen't have a say at all!!! She should be given the ""Worst Mother of the Year Award"" for the stuff she dose to Patty. Thank God Ruth cut her sperm off! four. Discrimination, Racisem, and Prejudious.

27499,"This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, and one of this most underrated. I believe it certainly exceeds a 'Psycho' for 'The Birds' for technical artistry and brilliance. It is a macabre, tense, darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some time. Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable villains as the father-hating, mother-fixated (but karen't most of Hitchcock's villains mummy's boys?) Bruno. It is a disturbing, stunning performance that illuminates the whole film. His character is obsessive, apparently homosexual (look at those deliberately effeminate ties and hear how the is described as 'European'), strangely charming and dangerous to across. Farley Granger certainly knows this as the becomes entangled in Bruno's sordid web after the pair meet on a train. Bruno, knowing some inside information on Guy's affairs, proposes the two 'swap' murders for each other's benefit. Walker will kill Granger's slutty, conniving wife who is inhibiting this marriage to beautiful Anne, whilst Granger will murder Bruno's father, who the so intensely hates. Everyone's happy, right? A win-win, as Bruno asserts? Wrong. Granger forgets about the indecent proposal, but an obsessed Walker does't. He commits this murder and is determined to hound Granger until the completes this side of the bargain too. 'Strangers' becomes a riveting, suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse in Hitch's capable hands. Hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes. We have the whore Miriam, Granger's estranged wife pregnant to another man. She lasciviously slurps a phallic nice-cream cone whilst openly eating up Bruno with her eyes. Barbara Morton, Anne's sister, is a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks you'll hear from a bespectacled girl in the pictures in the fifty's. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbed. This is one of the most daring films Hitchcock never made, and it is, typical to a Hitch film, subtly sexual in detail. This fits into the film-noir category with it's focus on murder, lies and deceit and shadowy cinematography. Walker's nut is one for the pages, and Granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist. Roman is perhaps weaker than the other two, and I never believed her relationship with Granger. Still, the overwhelming positives cancel out the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the BEST American films never made. Just look at what Hitch does there- the originality, the technical skill. We see the murder of Miriam reflected in her shattered glasses. A game of tennis turns into one of the most thrilling, intense scenes you'll never see. A innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and foul occurrences. A young boy's balloon is popped callously by Walker (Hitch obviously liked what the saw in 'The Third Man!'). Children's delight at riding the carousel turns into screaming, fast-paced terror. Hitch subverts normal, everyday events like no other. The camera-work there is among the best never seen in a Hitchcock film, and the premise is to-die-for. It's slick, oozes sophistication and devilish charm. The across-cutting between Walker and Granger's characters is magnificent- Granger's do-or-die tennis match is just as vital as villain Walker's rescue of an incriminating piece of evidence lost down a drain. Hitch again build this villain into a nasty, repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming (Did anyone else find him strangely attractive, more so than Granger?) piece of work- we are just as tense as Walker in your hope that the can get the lighter out of the drain. We need him to, anyway. He holds the key to the story. You'll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this film. Amazing.ten/ten.",positive
27499,"This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's movies and the lowest movie. I believe it certainly surpasses the ""Psycho"" of ""Birds"" in terms of part and talent. This is a scary, scary, dark product that will leave you amazed for a while. Robert Walker created one of Hitchcock's most memorable places, the's a hateful father, a sensible boy (but most of Hitchcock's robbers karen't standing boys?) Bruno. This is a disturbing and amazing work that illuminates the whole movie. His character is obsessive, obviously gay (see that deliberately weak relationship and hear how they are described as “European”), surprisingly attractive and dangerous. Of course Farley Granger knew this, because they were caught in Bruno's dirty net after they met on the train. Bruno knew inside stories about Guy's affairs and put in two ""exchanges"" of murders to benefit each other. Walker is going to kill Granger's weary and happy wife who prevents him from marrying Annie the Good, while Granger is going to kill Bruno's father, Bruno hates him so much. Everyone is very happy, in't it? As Bruno said, win-win? Incorrect. Granger forgot the inappropriate proposal, but the obsessed Walker did not make it. He committed the murder and was determined to hunt down Granger until this side of the agreement was also finalized. In Hitch's familiar hands, the ""stranger"" has become an interesting and questionable game of cat and mouse. Hitchcock is absolutely amazing in creating interesting little characters and design shows. We have Miriam, a prostitute, and Granger's estranged wife is pregnant with another man. She was sucking on her penis while she was eating Bruno open with her eyes. Annie's sister, Barbara Morton, is a girl who looks fun but intelligent and cunning. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-centered. This is the most courageous film Hitchcock has never made, It is a common feature of Hitchcock's movies, and it involves sex in secret in detail. This is a type of nor film, which focuses on murder, flying and deception, and in motion pictures. Walker's Nut is one of the papers, and Granger is a troubling protagonist. Roman may be weaker than the other two, I could’t believe this relationship with Granger. However, the shocking good news is far from over, and it can certainly be said that this is the best American movie never made. Look at what Hitch did there — reality, part skills. We see Miriam's murder reflected in her broken glasses. Tennis is one of the most exciting and powerful sports you will never see. An innocent bazaar has become a place of murder and bullying. The boy's balloon was ruthlessly blown by Walker (Xiqi clearly liked what the saw ""in the third person""!). The excitement of the children on the merry-go-round ride turned into tears, a sudden fear. Hitch overturns everyday events and is different. The photos there are the best never seen in a Hitchcock movie, and the basis is death as a result. It is smooth and emits a weak and demonic attraction. The crossover between the roles of Walker and Granger is amazing — the game of tennis and the death of tennis is as important as the guilty evidence that the villain Walker keeps the lost. Hitch also portrays the perpetrator as a bad, offensive but sympathetic and strange place (does anyone find him more attractive, more attractive than a Granger?) Without a sewer system. However, we need him. Hold the key to the story. After watching this movie, you will never see the behavior of strangers in the same way. Amazing ten / ten.",positive

Her character is extremist, obviously gay (look at the bonds of women who deliberately act and hear how Europeans are called 'Europeans'), which is surprisingly strange. And dangerous. Of course Farley Granger is aware of this because the is busy on the crude web after the train encounter. Bruno, knowing some details about the cow's affairs, suggests that the two ""turn"" from the murder to benefit each other. Walker will kill Granger's shy, shy wife who prevents him from marrying the beautiful Anne, while Granger will kill Bruno's father, who hates her. Everyone is happy, in't it? Winning, as Bruno puts it? it's not fair. Granger forgets the insult, but the troubled walker does't. He committed the murder and is determined to find Granger until the eliminates that part of the organization. 'Aliens' became an interesting, dubious game of cat and mouse in Hutch's hands. Hitchcock was amazing at creating interesting little characters and scenes. We have a prostitute, Mary, Granger's divorced wife who is pregnant with another man. He hit Bruno with this eyes and hit the sweet man's knot. Barbara Martin, Ann's sister, is a deceptively sweet but clever and cunning girl who comes out with dirty words that you will hear from the girl seen in the fifty pictures. Senator Morton is authentic and self-sacrificing. It's one of Hitchcock's most daring films to date, and, like Hitchcock's, is about sex in more detail. It falls into the category of film blue with a focus on murder, lies and deception and the reputation of cinema. Walker Nuts are one of the pages, and Granger forms a convincing main character with issues. Roman is probably weaker than the other two, and I never believed in this relationship with Granger. However, Frozen Good cancels out a little evil and can safely say that it is one of the greatest American films of all time. Just look at what Hutch is doing there - this own, technical ability. We see that Mary's murder is reflected in her broken glass. Tennis is becoming one of the most exciting, powerful events in the world. An innocent scene becomes a scene of murder and tragedy. The little boy's balloon burst brilliantly through Walker (Hutch obviously saw what 'The Third Man!' Saw.) The camera work is one of the best things Hitchcock sees in the film, and is the basis for it. It's smooth, awakening sensitivity and demonic focus. The cut is a great thing - the game of Granger Do for Die Tennis is just as important as saving Walker's piece of dubious evidence lost on the ground. Did anyone find it more attractive than Granger?) Work - and we're as tough as a walker in the hope that it can shine through the gutter, even though we need it. You have the key to the story.
