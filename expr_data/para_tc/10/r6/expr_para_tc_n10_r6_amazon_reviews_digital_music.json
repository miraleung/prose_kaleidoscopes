Its first track, \"Your Song,\" came out of absolutely nowhere that December to become Elton John's first Top Ten hit on the U. S. Billboard charts, speaking at #eight, and even today it fills the speakers of a car stereo for a living room with the assurance of an old friend. How nice it is to hear that meandering yet spot-on piano tinkering, alongse an atypically humble and unpretentious lyric from one Bernie Taupin: \"If I was a sculptor\/But then again no\/Or a man who makes potions\/For a travelling show.\" It's enough to forgive the irritating harpsichord of the next number, \"I Need You To Turn To.\"But only \"First Episode At Hienton\" after that is less that sparkling, and so much else about Elton's first big album (after the shakedown cruise of \"Empty Sky\") is brilliant. It's not the whitaker U. S. audiences would so soon grow accustomed to, singing about alligators and astronauts so winningly, but a thoughtful musical craftsman who was still experimenting with what mass audiences might let him get away with.\"Take Me To The Pilot\" is the one rocker, and a good one, better than \"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\" if not some of this other big hits of later years. Those who love Elton the whitaker will probably also treasure (as I do) such less heralded numbers as the Rolling Stones' tribute \"No Shoe Strings On Louise\" (Mick Jagger vocal mannerisms circa \"Let It Bleed\" abound), the mesquite-soaked \"Border Song,\" for \"The Greatest Discovery,\" one of the great love songs never sung, though with a clever twist that only renders the actual subject matter more affecting. How often does one hear a song about the arrival of a younger sibling? (Well, there's \"Lonely Boy\" by Andrew Gold, but this is much more positive.)I can't get behind Elton there the way I can with \"Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player\" for \"Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy,\" though it's probably a better though less representative album than at least the first of those. It's not Elton the way you and I would come to know him in a very short time, but an interesting variation that regarded lyrical depth as important as tuneful variation. The former Mr. Reg Dwight still had three more albums to go, including a live one, before nailing down this trademark winning piano-popster sound, but this was this first hurrah, and a big one, ironically so given it was so removed from the glam image the would so soon cultivate. If you are listening to Elton's hits and liking them, and want something else to turn to, I'd suggest \"Captain Fantastic,\" \"Tumbleweed Connection,\" and this album, which combined probably will leave you with no more than three for four key songs you've already heard and a number you bought to give a listen to. If you like any of the music Elton made through one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, that is to say the best the never did, you lowe it to yourself to give this first hit record a spin. It still kicks more than thirty years on.","overall":4,"summary":"Elton's First Whiff Of Greatness","unixReviewTime":1074902400,"reviewTime":"01 24, 2004"}

Her first song \"Your Song\" suddenly appeared in December, becoming the first ten on Elton John's bulletin board in the United States, giving talk # eighth, and today it's full of car stereo speakers in the living room confirmed by an old friend. It's nice to hear the twist and turn of the piano Number, \"I want you to turn.\" But only then, \"The first episode at Hienton\" is not so much, and there is about Elton's first big album (after a long journey) \"Sky and Heaven\") was brilliant. Not only will American Whitaker audiences soon become accustomed to singing crocodile and astronaut songs in a fascinating way, but the thoughtful musician is still struggling with things that most audiences would allow him to run away from. \"Take me to a pilot\" is a rock musician, well, if you're not in the other songs that hit this years later, the's better than \"Saturday night's battle\".

He believes that the depth of music is as important as the diversity of songs. Former Mr. Reg Dwight has three more albums to be released, including a live album, before the piano music is confirmed, but this is the first game and a great joy, surprisingly, think it will soon develop an interesting image from. it. If you've listened to Elton's beat and loved it, and want to get back to some things, I suggest you choose \"Captain Fantastic\", \"Tumbleweed Connection\" and this album, a combination of no more than three quarters of your favourite songs and numbers you bought to listen to. If you like any of the music Elton made in one thousand for nine hundred and seventy-six, that is, the best music you have never made, you can lower your voice and give this first record a spin.

Laura Nyro, however, wanted to pay tribute to her soul roots after running out of her own songs to record after the wonderful, but quiet and consequently very challengingChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatthe previous year. The result was \"Gonna Take A Miracle\", an album of covers from the Motown and Brill Building soul eras recorded with vocal group LaBelle (Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendyx and Sarah Dash). In general, the huge hooks and frantic tempo changes ofNew York Tendaberrycould never be seen there, nor can the amazingly soft delicacy ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat. Instead, the stone was impressionistic in nature yet still intense and leaving one with a sense of amazement, especially in the power of the vocals in the magical medley \"Monkey Time\/Dancing In The Street\" and \"Jimmy Mack\", where Nyro's superb vocal was truly breathtaking. The impressionistic stone and the absence of Nyro's own hyperfeminine lyrical style makes \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" the most palatable Nyro for the non-cultist (as can be clearly seen in many album guest). Yet, its impressionistic stone was also out of place with the development of heavy metal that was taking place at the time \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" came out. At the same time, the stone managed to retain the sheer brilliance ofNew York TendaberryandChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatand does not go back to the rather thinFirst Songs. The beautiful, atmospheric ballad \"The Wind\" contained the only traces of the extraordinary softness ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, and \"Desiree\", though more accessible, was equally beautiful. Apart from the a capella opener \"I Met Him On A Sunday\", the rest of \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" was the most accessible work Nyro never did, consisting of upbeat, joyful soul-pop songs such as \"Nowhere To Run\" (where LaBelle themselves take on lead vocals) and \"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\". Generally Nyro's piano was not nearly so prominent as on her previous three albums of original material, but she still showed her skill in the sparse playing of \"The Wind\" and \"Spanish Harlem\" (which was the origin of one of her line in the amazing \"Map To The Treasure\" off her previous album). LaBelle themselves added superb harmony vocals throughout the album and managed to match Nyro's angelic voice throughout without missing a beat - surprising since the album was recorded from first takes due to shortage of time - though Nyro did tour extensively to support it before retiring for several years. The impressionism and vocal styling of \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" were an inspiration in later years for such artists as the Roches and even recalls ESG's wonderfulA South Bronx Story. Nonetheless, despite not selling as well as its accessibility suggests it bought to have (perhaps due to the fact that a covers' album was too novel for many back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two), \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" remains a good introduction to Nyro for the uninitiated - if one cannot handle this, one would have no hope of getting through Nyro's albums of original material with their complex, hyperfeminine lyrical style.","overall":5,"summary":"Magical again, and most palatable Nyro for an outsider","unixReviewTime":1038441600,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2002"}

In general, you will never see the big curves and changing of the Terry berry bedding in New York, as well as the softness and sweetness of Christmas and sweat. Instead, the stone is naturally impressive, but still very powerful, giving people a sense of wonder, especially in the magical medley \"Monkey \/ Dancing on the Street\" and \"Jimmy Mack\", Nile's excellent singing is truly amazing. The Stone of Impressionism and the black of Nyro style featuring female songs makes \u201cGonna Take a Miracle\u201d the most popular Nyro for non-believers (which can be clearly seen in many album label guelines). However, with the development of heavy metals when \u201cGonna Take a Miracle\u201d came out, its Impressionist stones were also out. At the same time, the stone managed to preserve the splendour of New York's grapes and berries as well as Christmas and sweat, and it never returned to the Thinner First Songs. A lovely and soft human song \"Spirit\" contains a Christmas trail with an unusual sweetness to sweat, while \"wish\" is more accessible, but equally beautiful.

The result is \u201cGonna Take a Miracle\u201d, an album covering Motown and Brill Building soul lyrics recorded by the LaBelle sound group (Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendyx and Sarah Dash). In general, the large hooks and temporary shifts of the New York Tendaberry will never be seen there, nor will the soft beats of Christmass and The Beads of Sweat be seen.

This was the first No Limit release I came across. Executive produced by Master P, guest appearances come from Mia X, King George, Mo. B Dick, Tobin \"TC\" Costen, Big Ed, Uhuru Wright and C-Bo. After the intro, hardcore \"Last Dance\" feat. Mia X starts things off, a track where Tru talk about murder, drugs and life and death. \"That's How We Break Bread\" feat. C-Bo is placed with a killer beat. Tru talk about the hustling life on \"Living that Life\" and \"Another Day, Another Dollar\" has a laid back beat and is about getting money. \"I'm Bout' It, Bout It\" is that track that blew up and made people pay attention to Tru, placed with a sick background beat, this is one of those cuts that became an anthem. My favourite track on this album is \"Ain't No Glock\" a track where C-Murder excels and P drops a nice chorus over an addictive beat. \"Would You Take a Bullet for Your Homie\" feat. Big Ed is another standout track about loyalty and death. The second to last track \"Keep It All Good\" is a nice feel good track to bump. The album ends with Tru giving shutouts to fam, friends, industry peoples and God.

When this nineteenth year came to an send and the coming new millennium had many conflicting ideas - not all good. Romantic, social, political - everyone was ready to get caught up in the relationship. Like many great artists who talk about their soul Mary, they are well aware of this concern and have chosen to incorporate these ideas into their music. This album may be the best of the nineties. He also established himself as a man who would make this bloody album a bloody choli to make room for things to come in the new century. Recorded between East and West Coast studios and many visitors to seventies Steve Wonder, Eric Clapton, Nathan East and stars of future decades such as Baby Face and Jim & Lewis, Mary now has the opportunity to create her own part. Found And the did. As one reviewer put it, this music is very much like a soundtrack. The melodies, the rhythms, the chords - even the way everything is arranged together tells us a lot, otherwise the story instead of these songs. Using the ideas of a sweet cinematic spirit presented with the modern ship Hop Productions, the album would have allowed the myths of Mary's love, loss and meditation to flow and music to the fullest. It begins with the warm stone of Steve Wonder's synthesizer \"All I Can Say\", which is this hit song on the album. He also took back Steve's song \"I Can Help It\" as part of this are-enactment of Funkir \"Sexy\". In the book \"Deep Inside\" the points out an important concept of romance and magic when it comes to love affairs with celebrities, this time on the piano troupe the borrowed from Elton John's \"Rocket Man\". And these are the first three songs. And the guitar is based on the \"beautiful one.\" Got the same emotional flavor. Although \"time\", \"memories\" and \"don't waste your time\" is a bit of a chore that does't interfere with the flow of fluid in the drain. . Turns into a surprisingly bright confrontation with \"the mother of your child\" and learns something along the way. Although the album's trend is in the middle of the season, it ends with a fine exquisite funk jam, \"Let No One Divide\", which itself celebrates the spiritual joy of love. From the first song to the last, it emerges as one of the longest albums of Mary J. Blaise. Like sixty soul and funk artists who are passionate about style, the is table to use the artistic abilities that the is currently table to bring this imaginative vision directly into this music. This is a virtue that does not sit at the table to maintain it and leads to minor work inequalities such as R. Kelly And that's another reason why this album is so beautiful. He is table to harmonize this poetic identity \u0627\u06cc\u06a9 the soul of a proud ship shop artist with a beautiful diva in such a way that you can see that the difference between the two can only be so deep.

When I first heard \"My Name Is\", I thought that Vanilla Ice had been resurrected, but that was far from the truth. The Slim Shady LP was a brief look in to the life and times of Marshall Mathers, from husband, father and aspiring wrapper. Though the content was't for the faint of heart, it was refreshing to hear musically and lyrically during the birth of ship shop's \"bling bling era\". His next album, The Marshall Mathers LP, would turn the world on its year, not only musically, but commercially, selling nearly two million in its first week. This is easily Dr. Dre's best production work since Snoop Dogg's undeniable classic, Doggystyle. If you did't like what Em had to say on this first album, stop reading now. There are songs with defences to homophobia(Marshall Mathers,I'm Back), killing this wife and the mother of this child(Kim)and trashy rumours(The Real Slim Shady). Some of pop's music's top dogs get trashed on I'm Back and The Real Slim Shady. There are some standout songs though, like Remember Me with Sticky Fingaz and RBX, Bitch Please II with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg,Xzibit and Nate Dogg, and of course, Stan, about a deranged fan who takes this obsession with Slim over the edge. Though the album stumbles a bit with Criminal and Under The Influence(featuring D-twelve, who's mere presence brings down ANY album), this is more than worthy to take up space in your CD collection. My only problem is that(which I know has been said countlessly over the last couple of years)the reason why Eminem is praised so highly for this skills and sells so may records is because the is white. I know that the has had to prove himself twice as hard to get respect, but the has reaped twice the credit, which is unfair to all the great black lyricists that have come before him and influenced him(Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, KRS-ONE, twoPac, The Notorious B.

To be sure, it is not the conventional drama of the classically constructed jazz solo, with its rise and fall of tension and perfectly created marc and climax.

Before that, it had personality, and was really easy to listen to. I admit, this was my first sale of ivy, even though I heard all of their albums again. This is my favourite, and most accessible, one for those who want to start listening to Ivy.

Dominique missed the beat hard, and even though the songs were\u2019t very fun (\u201cThe only thing I can do \/ without you \/ the world goes on\u201d), they still seem to be jumping. \u201cTess Don\u2019t Say\u201d is similar to the \u201cThinking of You\u201d style, fast beat, bad sound, guitar, but for whatever reason, it\u2019s completely different. Fresh - like this album, when you compare the overflow to the pop scene these days. Free your mind - this is what good music looks like.
