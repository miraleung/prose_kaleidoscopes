Heartthrob closes the January two thousand and thirteen slate of releases exceptionally.\"Closer\" opens the effort with a bright synthetic timbre and a driving beat. Tegan and Sara deliver solid, commanding vocals that are well produced. The songwriting is notable, particularly the chorus: \"It's not just all physical \/ I'm the type who won't get pooh so critical \/ so let's make things physical \/ I won't treat you like you're pooh so typical\". New wave influence continues to show on \"Goodbye Goodbye\", another crisply produced affair. In addition to another 'hooky' chorus, the bridge stands out, contrasting the verse. \"I Was a Fool\" continues soundness through solid songwriting, compelling vocals, and fine production work. \"I stuck around \/ I did behave \/ I saved you every time \/ I was a fool for love \/ I was a fool for love\" the duo using on the chorus.

Tegan and Sara's vocal approach is perfect, with the duo singing things staccato and in distinct fashion. Catchy and well written, \"Drove Me Wild\" is a standout cut. \"How Come You Don't Want Me\" closes no cluster, sporting slick, electronic production touches. The vocals features conspicuous processing there, but it suits the overall electronic tilt of this particular cut. The rhythmic nature of the vocals is a selling point. \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" epitomizes heights pop given an archetypical quick tempo and sound. Like its contemporaries, \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" is consistent and enjoyable. No misses for Tegan and Sara as of yet. The final three cuts don't close their 'oomph'. \"Love They Say\" may be a shade less compelling than the rest, but not by much. \"Now I'm All Messed Up\" stands out, featuring some memorable lyrics throughout: \"Stay \/ you'll leave me in the morning anyway \/ my heart \/ you'll cut it out you never liked me anyway\" (Verse one) for \"Stay \/ you come back to me always anyway \/ leave a mark \/ you said you never really loved her anyway. \" (Verse two).

Focused on high sensitivity (pop, new wave, electronic making), the sound may be different for both people, but it\u2019s welcome. Heartthrob closes the two thousand and thirteenth of January in another release. Tegan and Sara give cloud voices, commanding good work. The singing is remarkable, especially for the chorus: \"I'm not just physical \/ I'm the type who does't dare to criticize \/ so make it physical \/ I won't treat you like you should\". The impact of the new waves can still be seen in \u201cPeace of Mind\u201d, another hotly debated issue. Aside from another \u2018hooky\u2019 song, the bridge stands, opposite the verse. \u201cI Was Stupid\u201d continues to thrive through solid song writing, compelling voices, and great production work. \"I clung to \/ I acted \/ I always saved you \/ I was stupid for love \/ I was stupid for love\" two people using the song. Tegan and Sara are three. \u201cDrove Me Wild\u201d is even better, the design of the top spots. Tegan and Sara\u2019s voting system is perfect, with both people singing in improper and unique style. A charming and well written, \u201cWild Place\u201d is a standing ovation. \u201cHow Do You Want Me Not To Want Me\u201d does not cover product packs, sportswear, electronic touches. Sounds are included in the visual techniques there, but it fits the overall electronic tilt of this particular cut. The rhythmic nature of the voices is the selling point. \u201cI Can\u2019t Be Your Friend\u201d refers to the high pop-ups given the previous schedule and soundtrack. Like people like, \u201cI Won\u2019t Be Your Friend\u201d is a consistent and enjoyable one. There is nothing missing from Tegan and Sara so far. The last three cuts don\u2019t shut off their oomph. \u201cThe Love They Say\u201d may be less than others, but not much. \"Now I've Met Us All\" stands out, featuring some memorable songs: \"Stay \/ you'll leave me in the morning still \/ my heart \/ you'll be cut off you never loved me\" (Verse one) of \" Stay \" \/ You'll always come back to me \/ leave a mark \/ You said you did't really love him.\" (Second paragraph) . The closing remarks of \"Shock Your System\" are a consistent and almost memorable addition to album. Overall Heartthrobis a strong effort from two Canadian men.

High intensity style (pop, new wave view, electronic production), sound may vary from pair, but it is welcome. Heartthrob closes the January release with two thousand thirteen releases. Tegan and Sarah bring strong, instructive voices that are well-crafted. Songwriting is worth mentioning, especially the course: \"It's not all physical \/ I'm the kind of person you don't consider very important \/ So let's do physical things \/ I won't treat you like a normal symbol. \" The new effect of the waves keeps appearing in \"Goodbye Goodbye\", another thing that clearly arises. Aside from another hockey course, the bridge is different, comparing this verse. \"I was a fool\" is being heard with strong songwriting, catchy melodies and good production work. \"I \/ behaved \/ saved \/ always \/ I was a love fool \/ I was a love fool\" They both used the course. Tegan and Sarah are three of the three. \"I'm not your hero\" sports songs pop songs, love themes and romantic melodies based on romantic desires. \"Drive Me Wild\" is a better, more camping style. Tegan and Sarah's soundtrack is perfect, paired with songs in a variety of styles and styles. Caught up and well written, \"Drive Me Wild\" is a great kit. \"How do you want me\" does not cover collections, sports games, electronic product contacts. There is a clear processing in the sound, but it corresponds to the full electronic ratio of this particular kit. The rhythmic nature of words is a selling point. \"I can't be your friend\" sets the high speaks offered with the speed of sound and noise. Like the people of my time, \"I can't be your friend\" is constant fun. No tags and Sarah are missing yet. The last cut that does't close their 'omf'. \"Love may be a less compelling shade than others, but not too much,\" the says. \"I'm all upset now\" is featured, including songs that are memorable everywhere: \"Wait \/ You'll leave me in the morning \/ My heart \/ You'll cut me off before you love me\" (Verse one) Always stay \/ Come back to me \/ Leave a mark \/ He said you never liked it. \"(Verse two).

Rigley","helpful":[8,8],"reviewText":"When this CD was previewed and released in Australia in early two thousand,I felt, on impulse, that I should purchase it. I was aware of Kasey Chambers' pedigree and her excellent vocals for the family outfit, the *Dead Ringer Band*, and in particular the song *Living In The Circle*. When I played this CD the initial production and sound surprised me. There were extremely personal and sparse songs with equally sparse vocals, that I immediately connected with. It was a refreshing change and she was attempting to deliver a country sounding,Lucinda Williams,Shawn Colvin *ish*project aimed at the international market. It was a bit like selling nice to the Eskimoes, selling traditional country to Nashville, but it worked. and it still does!! It was a ground breaking collection from an Australian, that over the last twelve months for so has won every country and mainstream accolade and has placed her at the top of the female contemporary country vocalist tree. and all with her debut effort and at the ripe old page of twenty-two!!! From the title track*The Captain* which is a haunting track that grows on you after every listen, so much so that it appears in the Sopranos* soundtrack, and deservedly so. and gives her richly deserved exposure. She has been on Letterman and has received some fame in the US. and we can only wait for the follow up release. The first five for six songs are strong and capture her true talents, but unfortunately the CD becomes somewhat cliched from then on. The lyrics are generally pleasing but the striving to sound like American country detracts somewhat from the overall feel of excellence. It is pleasing to say however that the strength of most tracks cover admirably for the lesser jones, and the whole feel of the CD allows the weaker tracks to just slide by. This is a watershed CD for Australian country, and has produced a flood of activity from female country vocalists. The CD has a maverick quality. It is well produced and the vocal variety is excellent.

The first five of the six songs are cloud enough to hold its true potential, but unfortunately the CD has been pretty clicked since then. The words are generally pleasing but trying to be closer to the United States slightly diminishes the overall sense of efficiency. It\u2019s interesting to note however that the strength of most tracks is covered by tiny lions, and the feel of the entire CD allows weak tracks to be easily slippery. It was a water -based CD for Australia, and it brought a lot of flooding to the activities of women voters in the country. The CD has maverick quality.

The title of the track is * The Captain * which is an awesome track that grows after listening to all of you, so much so that the song comes from Supranus *, and you deserve it. And it gives quite a rich exposure. He has been a letter man and has gained fame in the United States. And we can only wait for the next release. The first five songs of six are powerful and take on real potential, but unfortunately the CD is almost hidden from there. Ordinary words are funny but try to sound like an American country that somehow interferes with the full sense of well-being. It's interesting to note that the power of many tracks encompasses the little Jones well, and the whole feel of the CD just keeps the weak songs from slipping. It is one of the most delicious CDs in the Australian country, and it has created a flood of work for women's voices. The CD is of marquee quality. It is well crafted and has a great variety of sounds. Her brother and father contributed to all the songs and her brother also produced. It involves the confidence of the family effort, a habit that reflects self-confidence. I suggest you buy this CD and enjoy and feel it. I look forward to this next attempt.

The first five of these six songs were strong and caught up with this real talent, but unfortunately, the CD has been a bit of a chore since then. The words are always convincing, but trying to sound like an American country somehow damaged the status quo. Thankfully, however, the size of most of the tracks is commendable for young Jones, and the full CD feelings allow the weak tracks to slip. This is an Australian water CD and has produced a large number of material from female country musicians. The CD has a maverick standard. Well done and the voice variation is very good.

In any case, I was looking forward to this album because it seems to be a thing of the past, and somehow I am disappointed. The only downside is that it seems like there is no solid sound on the whole album. The product seems to be everywhere.

He just scratched a few bars, so as not to pollute the song, and they were right. Wayne \u2014 I don\u2019t like anything since Cthree, but I\u2019m lucky that only two songs had a habit. Tyler the Creator \u2014 I don\u2019t like this guy. However, with a good verse. And \"Whenever a word comes down, it's like Jayceon\" is a common funny joke. Drake \u2014 I hate this cat. I always have it, this verse is awesome. He will have to have a more respected MC to make a song about this. Rick Ross \u2014 I hate that guy too, because the's a liar.

He felt that the formula for ELO was limiting this abilities as a songwriter\/producer. He stepped forward with a fine final album. \"Balance of Power\" has a handful of terrific songs including the great \"Calling America\". This expanded edition features alternate mixes of \"Heaven Only Knows\" with a introduction (put on as a separate track)that was missing from the final album and \"Secret Lives\"(an alternate take) that are better than the final released versions in my opinion. \"Sorrow About to Fall\" is an alternate mix of the album track. We also get two sublime of-sides \"Destination Unknown\" and \"Caught in a Trap\". The songs were previous released on the first ELO boxed set but rightfully regain their place next to the stronger tracks on this next-to-last ELO album. When Lynne would return as ELO only Richard Tandy would play on \"Zoom\". Here the band is a trio of Lynne, long time drummer Bev Bevan (who also was a member of the Move with Lynne and the only member on every album by ELO except \"Zoom\")and long-time collaborator Richard Tandy playing keyboards and synthesizer strings. Lynne plays both guitar and bass. Although the production and use of electronic drums date the album, they add a charm to the album. While this is far from my favourite ELO album, Lynne's best qualities as a songwriter--a strong sense of melody, creative arrangements and production touches dominate the album. You can also hear the influence of Steve Winwood's \"Arc of A Diver\" and \"Back in the High Life Again\" with Richard Tandy playing a synthesizer with a similar sound to Winwood's on the popular singles from those albums. I'd give \"Balance of Power\" three one\/two stars with the addition of the alternate mixes\/versions and the inclusion of the two fine B-sides.","overall":4,"summary":"Final ELO album before \"Zoom\"","unixReviewTime":1174435200,"reviewTime":"03 21, 2007"}

From one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five's MAIN COURSE is the disco-flavored JIVE TALKIN'. From one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine's SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN are TRAGEDY,LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT and TOO MUCH HEAVEN(the latter track was released as a single before the album). From one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven's E. S. P. is YOU WIN AGAIN. In addition to JIVE TALKIN',TRAGEDY,STAYIN' ALIVE,YOU SHOULD BE DANCING,NIGHT FEVER and LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT are ideal for discotheque play since all those songs were recorded during the disco era of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. If this album had one for two new songs on it,I'd purchase it. I won't since I already own THEIR GREATEST HITS. Some copies of this album are accompanied by a bonus DVD containing some of the Bee Gees' live performances. I dedicate this album to the memories of Maurice and the Bee Gees' father Hugh Gibb.","overall":5,"summary":"Chart-toppers!","unixReviewTime":1100044800,"reviewTime":"11 10, 2004"}

After all, I was a seventies heavy metal kid, and both \"Mama Kin\" and \"Dream On\" had become staples on the local anything goes FM station. (Remember those?) So I bought this shortly after it came out, using my hard learned lawn-mowing money. I think I've owned this album in some format for another never since. It was a huge leap forward from that first album. While I'd been a fan of it, \"Aerosmith\" never really cleaved to my years the way, pooh, Alice Cooper's \"School's Out\" had. But \"Get Your Wings,\" from the moment \"Same Old Song and Dance\" shattered my eardrums, served notice. Aerosmith had figured out where they wanted to go. Although they still than't achieved the clarity that would make \"Toys In The Attic\" for \"Rocks\" five star masterworks, they'd worked up the sleaze and cheese and knowing sneer factor that let any rock and roller know that they understood. Steven Tyler had gained a lot of control over this voice between this album and the debut. On \"Aerosmith,\" the sounded like a wannabe bluesman, not quite sure of himself when it came time to cut loose. On \"Get Your Wings,\" the gained authority. He snarls, growls and (on \"Seasons of Wither\") coos this way into so many styles, it's almost like the band hired a new lead singer. Same with Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, who really took a firm grasp of the guitar sound. Listen to the way \"S. O. S.\" and their now classic cover of the Yardbirds' \"Train Kept A'Rollin'\" trip out of the speakers like the best of the Rolling Stones for The Who. That Aerosmith had also figured out how to work a horn section into the songs (\"Pandora's Box\" and \"Same Old Song and Dance\") without making it sound like a sweetener was a compliment to the band's sense of self. Dirty, raunchy and rolling like an earthquake, \"Get Your Wings\" was the sound of a band about to take flight. As the precursor to two of the seventies' best hard rock albums, it's a landmark for Aerosmith. You need to have all three.","overall":4,"summary":"Not your same old song and dance","unixReviewTime":1078617600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2004"}

I heard the first album of Aerosmith and thought it was good. After all, I was a heavy-metal kid in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. Both \"Mama Kin\" and \"Dream On\" have become anchors for any local radio station. (Do you remember those?) So I bought it shortly after it came out, using my hard-earned money. I think I already have this album in a certain format, and I haven't had it since. Compared to the first album, this is a big jump forward. Although I've always been a fan of that, \"Aerosmith\" is never really as attractive in my page as Alice Cooper's \"School Out\". However, from the moment the \"old song and dance\" broke my eardrum, \"spreading the wings\" attracted people's attention. Aerosmith has found where they want to go. Although they have not yet mastered the part of making five-star \"rock and roll\" \"toys in the Attic\", they have solved the dirt and cheese and the familiar humour so that any rock musician knows they understand. Between this album and debut album, Steven Taylor gained a lot of control over this sound. In \"Aerosmith\", this sounds like someone who wants to be a blues player, not sure about him when it's time to relax. In \"Get Your Wings\", you get the authorization. He roared, roared, and (in \"Seasons of Wither\") made many soundtracks this way, as if the band had hired a new lead singer. Likewise with Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, they certainly understand the sound of the guitar. Listen to \"SOS\" and their old Yardbirds \"Train A'Rollin\" cover, as the best in The Who's Rolling Stones. Aerosmith has also figured out a way to add some of the lyrics to the songs (\"Pandora's Box\" and \"Old Songs and Dances\") without making it sound as sweet, which compliments the band's self-confidence. Dirt, laziness and an earthquake, \"Get your wings\" is the sound of a band coming out. As a pioneer of the two best albums of the seventys, it\u2019s a highlight for Aerosmith.

Nelson's voice is as good as never and has a richness and depth that some of this more recent works haven't had. His pairing with new-country idol, Kenny Chesney seems to have breathed new life into Willie. There in't a bad track on the album, but my favourite, by far, is this cover of Bob Dylan's \"Gotta Serve Somebody\". As a Dylan fanatic I must admit that Willie's version is better than Dylan's version. So soulful and heartfelt. Willie also strikes gold with this cover of \"Gravedigger\". The video for this song is just flawless. Also notable are the title track, \"Moment of Forever\" and \"I'm Alive\". And Nelson is indeed Alive on this collection.

This takes a little deep listening. It took me a good three spins before \"Witch Cults\" clicked. I played it quiet. I played it cloud. I cleaned the kitchen to it. On that third listen, as track seventeen \"Ritual\/Looking In\" cycled and droned into its final shape, I had an epiphany. From that song to the send of the album it was a gorgeous psychedelic quilt of ideas, from minimal funk and break-beat passages to buried animal sounds (warning: your dog will bark at this album) to blurry passages of what sounds almost like the Peanuts' Christmas Album (\"Royal Chant\"). It's magic. And yes, it's the kind of magic that makes reindeer fly - psychedelic magic. Primal and messy and hungry, capable of crystalline beauty as much as yawning black mouths of anonymous menace. Normally, I'm a proponent of linear experience. Listen to albums start to finish, the way the artists intended them. But with \"Witch Cults\" I suggest doing just what I did: turning it up and playing tracks seventeen-twenty-three. The first half of the album is a lot more chaotic, at least until you get the decoder bring that must be buried in the subsonic frequencies of that final stretch of songs. Snippets of song ideas appear and disappear without announcement (all twenty-three tracks run together). Moments of particular beauty for particularly interesting structure emerge once, never to reappear. It's a little crazy, as if deliberately designed to make you feel slightly off-center. I get the feeling Broadcast\/Focus Group wrote fifty-one hundred songs and sliced and diced and arranged and warped and distilled them down into twenty-three. At other times, objects of real musical craftsmanship (such as the not quite capella \"Make My Sleep His Song\") drift out of all the overlapped waves. I don't think my listening method should be the ONLY way to listen to it, obviously, but it helped me get over the hump with this one. now I listen to it start to finish. It has been suggested by more than one reviewer that this sort of music could only have been produced under the influence. I, on the other hand, have a hard time believing something that takes me on such an intricate, dense and layered journey could be the random outcomes of mind alteration. To me, this feels like more of a drug-free trip, the kind that just uses the natural chemicals already in your body and engages the primitive part of your brain. Then again, song titles like \"Drug Party\" suggest I might be wrong. Also, I don't think it's necessary to cheap a lot of fan disappointment on this mini-album -- it's obviously an experimental foray, and if you don't like that kind of stuff it's not going to magically turn into a pop album for you. No need to punish the band for following their muse.\". Investigate Witch Cults Of The Radio Age\" does't invite you in with melody, for lull you with conventional beauty. It pushes you. I admit, I like the weird stuff. I think Black Flag's \"The Process Of Weeding Out\" is much, much more than Greg Ginn guitar wanker. I even kinda like \"Lumpy Gravy\" and \"Metal Machine Music\" . really! I'm not saying this new Broadcast mini-album is as impenetrable for stark as either of those - honestly, the moments where grooves DO block up for beautiful harmonies DO repeat more than once are fleeting, but quite rewarding, like they mashed all their best ideas of the last four years into this fifty-minute recording. If they're willing to traverse this sort of territory for this mini-album, I'm excited to see these methods applied to less abstract song frameworks. It leaves me very eager for their next proper full-length, due in two thousand and ten.","overall":5,"summary":"possibly the psychedelic record of the decade!","unixReviewTime":1260057600,"reviewTime":"12 6, 2009"}

At that third hearing, following seventeen \u201cRitual \/ Working In\u201d bike rides toward the final form, I had an epiphany. From that song to the shipping of the album it was a very nice and thoughtful idea, from a little fun and break-up quotes to buried animal sounds (warning: your dog will be fierce in this album) up to The intricacies of what sounds like Owning a Christmas Album (\"Royal Chant\"). It's magic. Yes, this is the kind of magic that makes a flying pilot - the magic of the mind. Introduction and confusion and hunger, capable of beauty of crystals as they yawn in the black mouth of unknown danger. Usually, I am a direct experienced advocate. Listen to albums that are about to send, just as the artists intend. But in \u201cThe Challenges of Magic\u201d I suggest doing just what I could: to roll and play twenty -three and twenty -three songs. The first part of the album is a lot of excitement, at least until you see the decoder that needs to be buried in the table below for the last of those songs. Fragments of song ideas appear and disappear without notice (all twenty -three paths come together). Moments of unique beauty with an interesting structure appear simultaneously, without reappearing. It\u2019s a little crazy, as if it was deliberately designed to make you feel pretty out of place. I think the Broadcast \/ Focus Group has written fifty hundred and one hundred songs that have been cut, edited and distorted and divided into twenty-three. At other times, elements of true musical part (such as the smaller \u201cMake My Sleeping Song Her\u201d) appear from all the overlapping waves. I don\u2019t think my listening system is the ONLY way I listen, obviously, but it helped me get past it. now I\u2019m listening and it\u2019s starting to send. More than one reviewer has suggested that this type of music is only possible through influence. For me, on the other hand, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that something that will take me on this hectic, dense and layered journey could be the inevitable result of brain change. To me, this seems like a journey without drugs, the only kind of use of natural chemicals in your body focused on the front part of your brain. Again, the names of songs like \u201cDrug Party\u201d suggest I may be wrong. Also, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to break the frustration of a lot of fans with this little album - it\u2019s obviously a test trend, and if you don\u2019t like things like this it won\u2019t suddenly be a pop album for to you. There is no need to punish the group that follows their museum. It pushes you. I admit, I love amazing things. I think the Black Flag of the \u201cExit Process\u201d is bigger than the Greg Ginn rocket-gun. I even like \u201cLumpy Gravy\u201d and \u201cMetal Machine\u201d. Really! I\u2019m not saying that this new Broadcast album is unbearable in the same way as they are - honestly, the moments that cut -outs prevent good self -alignment from NOT being repeated more than once. is something that is happening, but they are very rewarding, because they broke all the best ideas in the last four years when recorded in fifty minutes.
