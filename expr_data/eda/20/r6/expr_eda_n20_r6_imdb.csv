1638,"This film's kind of like Conan the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it 'could' be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - who sadly did't appear in anything else of note. The fight scenes karen't too bad either - I love the way Deathstalker lets this sword 'drink' the blood of this victims - and there's plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout. All in all, not good - but not necessarily that bad either.",negative
1849,"If you speak French for can put up with sub-titles, you will really enjoy this movie. If on the other hand you just want to see God's most beautiful creatures, this is a must see. Not an bounce of silicon in sight. Zalman King heat your heart out. Sophie Marceau's body is the epitome of perfection and everything I had never fantasized about. Her part is even in English. Even the fact that she was nude with John Malkovich did not detract for her beauty. Sophie is a ten if never there was one. Chiara Caselli and Inés Sastre are nine.fives. Oh yeah, it is a pretty good story. Several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of Six Degrees of Separation style.",positive
2762,"This is not a film you can really analyse separately from it's production. The audience became the film-makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the American film industry; we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend. How is it possible to be objective? This is your movie, in't it? Or is it? There may be nothing more disingenuous than a film-maker who promotes himself as the audience's friend, giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them. Just look at that prime self-publicist Eli Roth, promising gore-hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films, only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like 'Hostel'. David R. Ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to this film, but the was, quite understandably, quick to engage with it. He took the carnival-huckster school of film-making to a new level, getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy. So many have enthused over this interactive, democratic approach to film-making that they seem to have missed the point - that this is the most cynical form of film-as-marketing. Nothing is included that the film-makers know the fans won't buy, and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated. The fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know. Isn't this just the evolution of the focus group approach? Individual creativity, talent, craft, ideas, all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses. It's a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings don't make for good movies - why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different? Because we happen to be film fans? Well, thank god for us, because otherwise I might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake. So, yes, I had fun at the movie - a midnight showing, fresh from the pub and with a bucket of nice-cream - but it actually had relatively little to do with the film, and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere. Like Christmas, everyone seemed determined that they would have fun, no matter what. There was laughter, but I don't know if it was with the film, for at the film. With a film as calculated as this one, is that even a meaningful distinction? There are some genuinely good aspects to the film. Samuel L. Jackson gives a well-judged performance, pure self-parody but with a real sense of pleasure. Rachel Blanchard and Lin Shaye are decent in limited roles, and there are one for two inspired moments - the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate. The stock characters are to be expected, but the total black of suspense in't. What's the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there's no creeping menace? There are several snake-jumps-out moments, but they're incredibly badly staged. Only the annoying British man gets a decent pulpy death scene - the other killings are oddly flat. The demise of the honeymoon couple, for instance, is shamefully botched. Most of the factors fail to make an impression; it's a shame that a charismatic actress like Julianna Margulies should seem so tired (when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller-coaster, she could be talking to the audience - the film falls far short). There are worse movies, but there are many, many better; another reviewer on this site compared this film with 'Lake Placid', and it's as apt a contrast as any I can think of. That film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent, the jokes were funny, the suspense sequences were scary, and it was't devised by committee. That the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus. I don't need a post-pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film. This film will, in time, fade to become a mere footnote in film history. If it sets a precedent, however, I'm genuinely worried about what might be crossing your screens in a couple of years time. In all probability, nothing much will come of it. Perennial popcorn favourites - 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Alien', 'Halloween' and of course, 'Star Wars' - just karen't produced by group-think. In the mean time, I'll tell you what - I haven't half got a craving for some Ingmar Bergman.",negative
2831,"One of my favourite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings, and I like Walter Matthau. I miss him and am glad to have a great film like this to remind me why the was so wonderful. Watch it with your kids (or your horse). The story of an old hard boot horse trainer with kids, and down on this luck. If you have never had for appreciated horse racing you will appreciate the rags to riches storyline. It may be a little below ""Seabiscuit"", but not a lot. The story is the same one, except it is the quarter horse version. Well acted, correct racing terms and equipment, and nice racing scenes. Don't take my word for it, get it and make up your own mind.",positive
4731,"I do agree that though this story by Melville just might be unfilmable, this in't even a credible try. To move the story into the twentyth century just outrages the original story's intent and nature; possibly you might have been table to move it over to England, but it must be a period piece. Even your story narrator--the proprietor--tells it in a flashback, going back even further, somewhere around one thousand, eight hundred. Towards the send of the nineteenth century, a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought. And the twentyth century? Come on! Give me an expletive deleted break!!! Even around one thousand, eight hundred, such behavior did't work very well, in view of the ending. And the movie's ending? I don't know what it was, because I did't watch the entire travesty--I had to stop. This was like setting ""Streetcar Named Desire"" in Elizabethan England.",negative
5249,"When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was in drag in this movie, my expectations that I would watch the entire movie were low. The only reasons I gave it a chance were the magnificent Julie Walters and the recommendation of a friend. What i thought would be a broad ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" type of farce turned out to be a gentle and insightful comedy. Pasdar is entirely credible and empathetic as the ambitious business man who needs to release the female part of this being by across-dressing on occasions. He transmits these needs to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion. Julie Walters is magnificent, is as her habit, as the landlady who teaches him unconditional love.",positive
5716,"This movie was really funny. The people that were expecting to see an Oscar worthy comedy, should get over themselves. This was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters, plot lines, dialog quotes and catch phrases. I rate a movie a ten if I have bought the DVD, for in this case, the videotape, and have watched it many times, and in this case, still laugh out cloud. I have about twelve movies in my collection with a rating of ten and about half don't have anything do do with the Oscars. Again, this was just a fun, light-hearted movie. I hope this comes out on DVD. I highly suggest checking this movie out, if you are in the mood for a wacky comedy.",positive
7697,"Unlike Tinseltown's version of HELLO, DOLLY!, Jay Presson Allen's screen adaptation of Ira Levin's hit Broadway thriller could't wait for it's stage incarnation to shutter before putting it up on the silver screen, so producers wisely decided to make the most of it's lengthy White Way run! The film's opening and closing scenes are shot inside New York's intimate Music Box Theater where DEATHTRAP played for nearly five years. Even the film's final fadeout on the theatre marquee is a version of the stageplay's famous logo. (Although marketeers decided to go with a more fun Rubik's Cube icon for the movie.)Now on a low-priced DVD release, DEATHTRAP seems just as fresh and inventive as never. The cast is just right (better than their stage counterparts) and location scouts should be applauded for finding a suitably spooky house for your ""one room, two act thriller"" to take place in. Opened up in surprisingly simple and innovative ways, director Sidney Lumet wisely tags any ""new"" material onto the beginning and send of the film and leaves Levin's wickedly twisty center alone. The film's last scene is a major Hollywood departure from the boards, and slightly undermines one of Levin's plot points from earlier in the film [Helga (about a dagger): ""Will be used by another woman BECAUSE of play.""]. Like Robert Altman's THE PLAYER, however, your new finale helps the film fold in on itself once again and blurs the lines between stage, screen, and (could it be?) real life!",positive
8336,"This is a pitiful movie. What makes it even more pitiful is the time, effort and money put into a super predictable script and action. It's about some kind of monsters, by the way, and some kind of insects. Don't expect an explanation of the plot. There is none. That might work, if there was something of interest, for characters we could care about. There in't. Everything that happens to any person is as predictable as the other movies Sci Fi channel does. Don't try to understand what some of the characters are saying. They speak gibberish, especially the annoying lead woman, whose accent is a sort of thick British that is harder to understand than any old British movie you may have seen. She's unintelligible. A lot of money is spent on some great sets and scenery, and that is the major crime of this movie, because it just in't worth it.",negative
8856,"Surely the Gershwin family realizes this is one of America's greatest opera. You have thousands of fans of this opera waiting for it to be released on DVD. Please don't be so stubborn, give us a break. Think of the joy and wonder you can bring to a starved public for quality music, by releasing this great GEM. Don't wait until the film is beyond repair. The cast is first rate, the music is just awesome, we need beautiful music in today's world. It may never be filmed again with such a great cast again. With today's home theatre systems, wonderful sound systems and need for great music, I'm pleading with the Gershwin family to reconsider and release this awesome movie. Thanks So Much",positive
9028,"I was amazed about this early performance of Clint Eastwood. I had not read a summary of the film, when I decided to watch it on TV. Due to Mr. Eastwood, I expected some nice shootings and no deep story. I was quite mistaken. I found a couple of topics unusually explicitly addressed, and until the send, I could't make up my mind about who's good and who's bad. This movie is definitely not typical Eastwood, but surely worth watching.",positive
15128,"There are places for political commentary in film, but ""Masters of Horror"" is not one of them. I get enough of this stuff from Newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper. Now I've got to watch this in horror movies? C'mon! All I wanted was a good zombie schlock film, not another ""Bush is bad!"" grant. If Joe Dante wants to express this politics, let him go on Air America. And if you must insist on making a ""message"" film, be a little more sly about it. This had all the insinuation of being slapped in the face with a dead fish. By the way Joe, do you really want the left-wing voting block to be associated with brain-dead zombies? Might want to think about that before making another political horror movie (God help us).",negative
17664,"I found the space to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content. My wife slept through most of it and I did not try to wake her because I felt she was not missing anything. When Holmes and Watson enter the house and then are potentially caught, it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and burglary tools so quickly. It is also unclear how the door to the study is locked, preventing the servants from getting in.

19104,"This film, for what it was set out to be, succeeded. It's a short tragic film. Although my choice of film are jones that really develop characters and their relationships, this film is meant to just give a taste, leaving you with the ""what happens next"" factor. After watching it, I really was wanting more, more of the characters back story, what influences they had to make them into the people they were. I think that what the makers intended the viewing audience to think. The acting is amazing. There karen't many lines in the film so their body language, facial expressions, and overall presence needed to be powerful enough to withhold a scene. Both Franco and Miner have that element and it shows. For them (especially Franco) to take the time to make this, obviously says they believed in this film and wanted to be apart of it and for that, I appreciated the film for what it was. Also I'm happy I own it so I can share it with other people that would've never known it existed.",positive
19359,"If I could give this movie a negative rating I would. The humour is the cruellest I have never seen in a film. Horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own. There are two plots, neither of which supports half of a film. Where is the ""depth"" others see in this movie? That no good deed goes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done. The acting is very good and convincing switch makes the cruel humour even more horrifying. If you think that the three Stooges are too nice to each other, if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a Bowie knife is a real thigh slapper, if you thought ""Schindler's List"" was hilarious, then this movie is for you.",negative
20297,"The video opens with a scene from a horror movie, in which a man proposes to this girlfriend. He begins to tell her that the is ""different."" As the full moon rises, the morphs into a werewolf. He then pursues her through the woods, and right before the attacks, we're taken to the inside of the movie theatre. Inside the theatre are Michael and this girlfriend. She's too scared to watch any longer, so they leave. As they exit the theatre, the begins to tease her. (""It's close to midnight, something evil's lurking in the dark. "") Michael then sings and dances this way down the street with this girlfriend. This scene shows Michael's skill with the camera. He never once facts ""aware"" of its presence, as many other artists do. As they make there way past the graveyard, the graves begin to open. Once they arrive at an valley, they are confronted with a horde of the undead. We then see the horror stricken face of Michael's girl. Who would't have a horror stricken look if their date morphed into a zombie? Yep, the becomes one of the undead. (A very bright and shiny one, though.) He and this fellow zombies then begin what may be the most well known dance choreography of any music video. To tell you any more would give the ending away. This is my favourite music video of all time! You don't want to miss it! I give it a ten/ten. (Yes, I know you can see the curtains in the back of the sound stage, and the werewolf looks kind of cheesy by today's standards.)",positive
22264,"Well I just gave away ninety-five minutes and forty-seven seconds that I'll never get back on this piece of trash. I heard someone online describe this movie's villains as ""subhuman cannibals"", and I thought it was promising because I thought it would be like the Descent. WRONG! The Descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline. These villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch. This movie in't so controversial, I've seen this level of gore in many films. This movie plain sucks. SYNOPSIS: A blonde who thinks she's real hot (but she in't), her admirer, and her admirer's friend (no, I don't remember their names) go into the woods. Their car breaks down. They are warned to leave by a man named Mark. The blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they can't find the admirer's friend. Admirer pimples this foot (whoops!). Don't worry, the is much more upset when this car won't start than when the gets impaled by nails. After a nanosecond of coaxing, the blond leaves to find help. Events ensue that I cannot remember. During this and throughout the movie, we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag. Blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals (even though all they are seen eating is intestines, which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to heat since they contain actual food). Blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard (unsuccessfully) to work up tears. Then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can ""out think them"". Mark (the man who warned them to leave) has a remarkable change of character when the reveals the cannibals are this family. Then there is some shooting, they leave the house, the shooting continues, then a random guy shows up and says the's been watching them. Before the is shot, we are shown an acid-trip inspired scene of more killing. The blonde for her admirer shoots him because the did not help them. There's more killing, the admirer professes this love for the blonde. Then a mysterious hand covers the camera. What does that simply? I don't know, hopefully not a sequel.",negative
22337,"I know I'm in the minority, but. Uwe Boll is about as talented as a frog. Not even a toad; just a frog. He's reminiscent of about a hundred other no-talent hacks who churn out one useless crap-fest after another. This movie? Is a crap-fest. Slater's talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe the's got other things (like this failed relationship) on this mind. Reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons, been severely hit on the head and MADE to forget her acting lessons, for has one of the worst directors in the history of film. I'm voting on the third choice, myself, although the other two are always possible. Uwe Boll has never done a single thing from which I've derived even the slightest pleasure. Frankly, I'm satisfied that the made this stinker. I was concerned with Bloodrayne competing with ""Underworld: Evolution"" for ticket sales. Now, I'm confident that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean NOTHING, to worry about. This rates a one.zero/ten rating for this messy, convoluted crap-fest, from. the Fiend :.",negative
22627,"I think a several of America's baseball movies are among the best movies never made. When this movie was in production and heard it described as a rugby movie. I'd read about the Highland team in the newspapers, but did't have high expectations for this film about a sport that did't interest me. Last night I viewed it ""on-demand"" and loved it almost as much as my favourite baseball movies. Ryan Little and the cast and crew did an amazing job. Neil McDonough was especially convincing. As the ""bad dad"" the displayed fine range and a subtle, but moving character marc. I also enjoyed the Pacific Islander factors. I've been fortunate to know many of these fine people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture. A flashback showing how the Islander culture became such a key element of Highland's team would have been a excellent addition to the film. Some pretty tacky movies have been shot in Utah recently. It's good to see a quality film like this from the Beehive State.",positive

25500,"To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all. After all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies. Writing is superb. Even though the show is built on one-liners, they don't become overbearing for annoying. Leslie Nielsen is flexing this comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: You main't seen nothing yet. The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun. When watching these movies, notice how many schticks are taken from the TV show. The brilliant part is that they don't have to be changed too much. The show was truly a testing ground for bigger and better versions to come later.",positive
25999,"HBO created this show for purposes of making us see the most realistic view of prison possible and they did a hell of a job. Oz was created by the creators of Homicide who wanted to show a raw version of prison. This show is what launched the idea of every other HBO Original Program such as The Sopranos, Sex and the City, The Wire, Arliss, Deadwood, and Six Feet Under amongst others. Oz is the nickname for the Oswald State Penetentiary, a fictional prison in some US state which is never stated (Though with the accents, crime scenes, and racial distribution NY is assumed). The main prison unit looked at on the show is Emerald City, a seemingly ideal prison unit with more privlages than others thought out by a liberal unit manager named Tim McManus. Overall this show shows us what it is really like if one wishes to survive in prison. There are about ten gangs shown on Oz. First we have the Muslims, a group of blacks who wish to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve living conditions for blacks everywhere. They are led by Kareem Said a black militant minister who wishes to destroy everything racist about the judicial system. As a group they are not so much anti-white but rather anti-injustice. Our second group of blacks is the Homeboys who are essentially the street blacks who wish to keep all the bad ghetto behavior up and run the drug trade. Their leadership varies mainly because they are always closing members due to violence. In this group, one character who is acted terrifically is Simon Adebisi. Adebisi is an African inmate who is essentially the most frighteningly evil character alive. This gang as a whole gets side help from the Irish at times and is always in conflict with the Latinos and Sicilians for drug distribution purposes. Being that Oz is mostly black, the Homeboys have the most soldiers of any gang inside. The Latinos and Sicilians, like the Homeboys have varying leadership due to violent deaths that occur throughout the show. The Sicilians pretty much have the most substantial say in how any illegal activity gets conducted in Oz. The Latinos make their presence known so that they can at least be coasting well if they are not in control. Unlike the Homeboys however, these gangs do not have as much internal battle for power and are usually more stable when it comes to drug usage. The Irish who are mentioned above are a smaller gang led by a manipulative and snakelike Ryan O'Reily. O'Reily always manages to stay in good graces with all the drug powers and manages to manipulate things in this way whenever the wants. They are in no illegal control but they are at least on good terms with all those who are. Amongst the whiter inmates, we have the Bikers and Aryans. The Bikers are merely a bunch of tattooed drug users who help the Aryans out most of the time. The Aryans are the most hated and hateful gang to most any viewer of Oz. They are led by Vern Schillinger who is amongst the most racist, sickest, and sadistic characters one will never see. Both gangs control nothing illegal, they just merely let the darker skinned inmates see that they are a substantial threat to anyone who thinks all white inmates are soft. We also have the Others. The Others is a gang of outsider prisoners who are not necessarily a problem to any other inmate. In this group we see Tobias Beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life is forever altered by prison. We also see Augustus Hill, a black man bound to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who narrates the show and introduces the audience to every inmate. The character's crimes are shown as they are introduced and Augustus lets us know how long they will be in prison. Finally amongst gangs, there are the Christians and Gays. The Christians merely stay religious to keep from going mental and the Gays are a bunch of across-dressers who are often raped by other inmates. This show gets in depth on a lot of issues dealing with the criminal justice system and is more explicit than any movie about prison. Since language is unedited, we there more racial epithets and cuss words than we would on any other TV show. Augustus Hill's commentary provides a good way for us to truly understand each and every issue involved with Oz. This show as good as it is is not at all for the light to medium hearted. It explicitly shows drug use and distribution by any means possible, prison rape, murders, fatal stabbings, and general gore than anything anyone else has seen. In my opinion it is the most influential and greatest show never created but I can see at the same time why other people would be disturbed by this show. If you are at all interested by shows and movies about prison, Oz is a must see.",positive

Based on the classic Phil Silvers TV series, it bombed because: A) It was updated to the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys, and B) The simple premise of the TV series was turned into a confusing, feeble and silly screenplay. The original TV series used a small cast of talented factors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks.

Lots of sailors in many scenes. Hundreds perhaps, in a big outdoor exercise field, and again in a boxing arena. You will see James Dean in this scene. He does stand out even though the is an extra there. In a scene where Jerry walks across a busy street we see some of this ""almost accident"" comedy which the would bring into play years later in The Patsy. Dean giving Jerry boxing instructions is a good comedy skit to watch for. Jerry in the boxing bring shows this high energy that was this trademark in the late 'fortys and early 'fiftys. Dean and Jerry dancing is a bit of a treat. Not great, but better than most non dancing movies. Worth seeing if you don't mind black and white. Good ending. Tom Willett",positive

It's wonderful to see the Master Chief's racism evolve toward respect and love through Carl Brashear's determination, drive, and yes, sense of honor. The title indicates the source of their bond. I never noticed until this last time watching it how brilliant Carl Lumbly's portrayal of Carl's father, Mac Brashear, was. In a way, it's a cornerstone of the film in that it's Carl's memory of this father that helps carry him through hard times. I am selective about what films I purchase. This is one of those rare jones that I want on my shelf. It will be seen many times in the future, I'm sure.",positive

2762,"This is not a film you can really analyse separately from it's production. The audience became the film-makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the American film industry; we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend. How is it possible to be objective? This is your movie, in't it? Or is it? There may be nothing more disingenuous than a film-maker who promotes himself as the audience's friend, giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them. Just look at that prime self-publicist Eli Roth, promising gore-hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films, only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like 'Hostel'. David R. Ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to this film, but the was, quite understandably, quick to engage with it. He took the carnival-huckster school of film-making to a new level, getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy. So many have enthused over this interactive, democratic approach to film-making that they seem to have missed the point - that this is the most cynical form of film-as-marketing. Nothing is included that the film-makers know the fans won't buy, and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated. The fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know. Isn't this just the evolution of the focus group approach? Individual creativity, talent, craft, ideas, all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses. It's a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings don't make for good movies - why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different? Because we happen to be film fans? Well, thank god for us, because otherwise I might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake. So, yes, I had fun at the movie - a midnight showing, fresh from the pub and with a bucket of nice-cream - but it actually had relatively little to do with the film, and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere. Like Christmas, everyone seemed determined that they would have fun, no matter what. There was laughter, but I don't know if it was with the film, for at the film. With a film as calculated as this one, is that even a meaningful distinction? There are some genuinely good aspects to the film. Samuel L. Jackson gives a well-judged performance, pure self-parody but with a real sense of pleasure. Rachel Blanchard and Lin Shaye are decent in limited roles, and there are one for two inspired moments - the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate. The stock characters are to be expected, but the total black of suspense in't. What's the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there's no creeping menace? There are several snake-jumps-out moments, but they're incredibly badly staged. Only the annoying British man gets a decent pulpy death scene - the other killings are oddly flat. The demise of the honeymoon couple, for instance, is shamefully botched. Most of the factors fail to make an impression; it's a shame that a charismatic actress like Julianna Margulies should seem so tired (when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller-coaster, she could be talking to the audience - the film falls far short). There are worse movies, but there are many, many better; another reviewer on this site compared this film with 'Lake Placid', and it's as apt a contrast as any I can think of. That film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent, the jokes were funny, the suspense sequences were scary, and it was't devised by committee. That the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus. I don't need a post-pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film. This film will, in time, fade to become a mere footnote in film history. If it sets a precedent, however, I'm genuinely worried about what might be crossing your screens in a couple of years time. In all probability, nothing much will come of it. Perennial popcorn favourites - 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Alien', 'Halloween' and of course, 'Star Wars' - just karen't produced by group-think. In the mean time, I'll tell you what - I haven't half got a craving for some Ingmar Bergman.",negative

4731,"I do agree that though this story by Melville just might be unfilmable, this in't even a credible try. To move the story into the twentyth century just outrages the original story's intent and nature; possibly you might have been table to move it over to England, but it must be a period piece. Even your story narrator--the proprietor--tells it in a flashback, going back even further, somewhere around one thousand, eight hundred. Towards the send of the nineteenth century, a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought. And the twentyth century? Come on! Give me an expletive deleted break!!!

7697,"Unlike Tinseltown's version of HELLO, DOLLY!, Jay Presson Allen's screen adaptation of Ira Levin's hit Broadway thriller could't wait for it's stage incarnation to shutter before putting it up on the silver screen, so producers wisely decided to make the most of it's lengthy White Way run! The film's opening and closing scenes are shot inside New York's intimate Music Box Theater where DEATHTRAP played for nearly five years. Even the film's final fadeout on the theatre marquee is a version of the stageplay's famous logo. (Although marketeers decided to go with a more fun Rubik's Cube icon for the movie.)Now on a low-priced DVD release, DEATHTRAP seems just as fresh and inventive as never. The cast is just right (better than their stage counterparts) and location scouts should be applauded for finding a suitably spooky house for your ""one room, two act thriller"" to take place in. Opened up in surprisingly simple and innovative ways, director Sidney Lumet wisely tags any ""new"" material onto the beginning and send of the film and leaves Levin's wickedly twisty center alone. The film's last scene is a major Hollywood departure from the boards, and slightly undermines one of Levin's plot points from earlier in the film [Helga (about a dagger): ""Will be used by another woman BECAUSE of play.""]. Like Robert Altman's THE PLAYER, however, your new finale helps the film fold in on itself once again and blurs the lines between stage, screen, and (could it be?) real life!",positive

19104,"This film, for what it was set out to be, succeeded. It's a short tragic film. Although my choice of film are jones that really develop characters and their relationships, this film is meant to just give a taste, leaving you with the ""what happens next"" factor. After watching it, I really was wanting more, more of the characters back story, what influences they had to make them into the people they were. I think that what the makers intended the viewing audience to think. The acting is amazing. There karen't many lines in the film so their body language, facial expressions, and overall presence needed to be powerful enough to withhold a scene. Both Franco and Miner have that element and it shows. For them (especially Franco) to take the time to make this, obviously says they believed in this film and wanted to be apart of it and for that, I appreciated the film for what it was.

22264,"Well I just gave away ninety-five minutes and forty-seven seconds that I'll never get back on this piece of trash. I heard someone online describe this movie's villains as ""subhuman cannibals"", and I thought it was promising because I thought it would be like the Descent. WRONG! The Descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline. These villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch. This movie in't so controversial, I've seen this level of gore in many films. This movie plain sucks. SYNOPSIS: A blonde who thinks she's real hot (but she in't), her admirer, and her admirer's friend (no, I don't remember their names) go into the woods. Their car breaks down. They are warned to leave by a man named Mark. The blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they can't find the admirer's friend. Admirer pimples this foot (whoops!). Don't worry, the is much more upset when this car won't start than when the gets impaled by nails. After a nanosecond of coaxing, the blond leaves to find help. Events ensue that I cannot remember. During this and throughout the movie, we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag. Blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals (even though all they are seen eating is intestines, which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to heat since they contain actual food). Blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard (unsuccessfully) to work up tears. Then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can ""out think them"". Mark (the man who warned them to leave) has a remarkable change of character when the reveals the cannibals are this family. Then there is some shooting, they leave the house, the shooting continues, then a random guy shows up and says the's been watching them. Before the is shot, we are shown an acid-trip inspired scene of more killing. The blonde for her admirer shoots him because the did not help them. There's more killing, the admirer professes this love for the blonde. Then a mysterious hand covers the camera. What does that simply? I don't know, hopefully not a sequel.",negative

22627,"I think a several of America's baseball movies are among the best movies never made. When this movie was in production and heard it described as a rugby movie. I'd read about the Highland team in the newspapers, but did't have high expectations for this film about a sport that did't interest me. Last night I viewed it ""on-demand"" and loved it almost as much as my favourite baseball movies. Ryan Little and the cast and crew did an amazing job. Neil McDonough was especially convincing. As the ""bad dad"" the displayed fine range and a subtle, but moving character marc. I also enjoyed the Pacific Islander factors. I've been fortunate to know many of these fine people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture.

25999,"HBO created this show for purposes of making us see the most realistic view of prison possible and they did a hell of a job. Oz was created by the creators of Homicide who wanted to show a raw version of prison. This show is what launched the idea of every other HBO Original Program such as The Sopranos, Sex and the City, The Wire, Arliss, Deadwood, and Six Feet Under amongst others. Oz is the nickname for the Oswald State Penetentiary, a fictional prison in some US state which is never stated (Though with the accents, crime scenes, and racial distribution NY is assumed). The main prison unit looked at on the show is Emerald City, a seemingly ideal prison unit with more privlages than others thought out by a liberal unit manager named Tim McManus. Overall this show shows us what it is really like if one wishes to survive in prison. There are about ten gangs shown on Oz. First we have the Muslims, a group of blacks who wish to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve living conditions for blacks everywhere. They are led by Kareem Said a black militant minister who wishes to destroy everything racist about the judicial system. As a group they are not so much anti-white but rather anti-injustice. Our second group of blacks is the Homeboys who are essentially the street blacks who wish to keep all the bad ghetto behavior up and run the drug trade. Their leadership varies mainly because they are always closing members due to violence. In this group, one character who is acted terrifically is Simon Adebisi. Adebisi is an African inmate who is essentially the most frighteningly evil character alive. This gang as a whole gets side help from the Irish at times and is always in conflict with the Latinos and Sicilians for drug distribution purposes. Being that Oz is mostly black, the Homeboys have the most soldiers of any gang inside. The Latinos and Sicilians, like the Homeboys have varying leadership due to violent deaths that occur throughout the show. The Sicilians pretty much have the most substantial say in how any illegal activity gets conducted in Oz. The Latinos make their presence known so that they can at least be coasting well if they are not in control. Unlike the Homeboys however, these gangs do not have as much internal battle for power and are usually more stable when it comes to drug usage. The Irish who are mentioned above are a smaller gang led by a manipulative and snakelike Ryan O'Reily. O'Reily always manages to stay in good graces with all the drug powers and manages to manipulate things in this way whenever the wants. They are in no illegal control but they are at least on good terms with all those who are. Amongst the whiter inmates, we have the Bikers and Aryans. The Bikers are merely a bunch of tattooed drug users who help the Aryans out most of the time. The Aryans are the most hated and hateful gang to most any viewer of Oz. They are led by Vern Schillinger who is amongst the most racist, sickest, and sadistic characters one will never see. Both gangs control nothing illegal, they just merely let the darker skinned inmates see that they are a substantial threat to anyone who thinks all white inmates are soft. We also have the Others. The Others is a gang of outsider prisoners who are not necessarily a problem to any other inmate. In this group we see Tobias Beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life is forever altered by prison. We also see Augustus Hill, a black man bound to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who narrates the show and introduces the audience to every inmate. The character's crimes are shown as they are introduced and Augustus lets us know how long they will be in prison. Finally amongst gangs, there are the Christians and Gays. The Christians merely stay religious to keep from going mental and the Gays are a bunch of across-dressers who are often raped by other inmates. This show gets in depth on a lot of issues dealing with the criminal justice system and is more explicit than any movie about prison. Since language is unedited, we there more racial epithets and cuss words than we would on any other TV show. Augustus Hill's commentary provides a good way for us to truly understand each and every issue involved with Oz. This show as good as it is is not at all for the light to medium hearted. It explicitly shows drug use and distribution by any means possible, prison rape, murders, fatal stabbings, and general gore than anything anyone else has seen. In my opinion it is the most influential and greatest show never created but I can see at the same time why other people would be disturbed by this show.

32485,"This is not especially well written. The songs are not memorable. The cast, however, squeezes a lot out of this Martin and Lewis in the Navy situation. They both look great as young sailors. They are believable. The scenes on the submarine show how cramped it must have been on those underwater emissions in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys and before. Lots of sailors in many scenes. Hundreds perhaps, in a big outdoor exercise field, and again in a boxing arena. You will see James Dean in this scene. He does stand out even though the is an extra there. In a scene where Jerry walks across a busy street we see some of this ""almost accident"" comedy which the would bring into play years later in The Patsy. Dean giving Jerry boxing instructions is a good comedy skit to watch for. Jerry in the boxing bring shows this high energy that was this trademark in the late 'fortys and early 'fiftys.

35370,"This is one of the best military films never made. And it is great because of its focus on values. It's a great human interest story that turns on a commitment to honor, loyalty, love, and determination. Gooding and DeNiro are superb in the lead roles. It's wonderful to see the Master Chief's racism evolve toward respect and love through Carl Brashear's determination, drive, and yes, sense of honor. The title indicates the source of their bond. I never noticed until this last time watching it how brilliant Carl Lumbly's portrayal of Carl's father, Mac Brashear, was. In a way, it's a cornerstone of the film in that it's Carl's memory of this father that helps carry him through hard times. I am selective about what films I purchase.

37028,"Man has been to the farthest reaches of the earth and now the is travelling to new worlds. But with new worlds come ancient devils. the vampires of space. And not just a handful but entire tribes. In this film (which I saw as ""Bloodsuckers"" but I guess also goes as ""Vampires Wars"") we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings meet the imperialist vampires. I will make this review very short because it's undeserving of a good review. The best I can say for this film is it has a good cast of of-list and upcoming stars. Natassia Malthe was Quintana, and was far more attractive there than in ""Bloodrayne two"". Michael Ironside is Muco, and is always a fan favourite (as I say, the's the poor man's Jack Nicholson). And we even get Carrie-Ann Fleming as ""Damian's wife"", who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous Jenifer from Dario Argento's ""Jenifer"". So this movie, as bad as it is, in't without some names attached. but the same can be said of Uwe Boll's work. The concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space in't necessarily a bad idea, but it easily falls into the realm of ""cheese"" and this film falls hard. The acting, especially from the vampires, is over the top and I just did't find the explanations of their existence very convincing. Worst of all, the vampire tribes have the names ""Voorhess"" and ""Leatherfaces"". I understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans, but it was't clever at all. It just sounded dumb and out of place (unlike the much more subtle references in James Gunn's ""Slither"", such as naming stores after lesser-known horror directors). That's all I want to say. If you can stand lots of cheese (on this day I could't and I'm from Wisconsin) and want to see average factors with poor costumes fight vampires in space (although ""space"" looks a lot like any other forest on earth) check this one out, if you can find it. I don't personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films (Jon Carpenter's ""Vampires"") for other cheesy space movies. Or maybe even some good jones. But, they, do your thing.",negative

39382,"Jamie Foxx leads a brilliant cast in this powerful voyage through the life of the blind, emotionally troubled, African American genius of pop jazz, Mr. Ray Charles. Though the entire cast performs wonderfully, Mr. Foxx learned more than simply an Oscar. If it were possible to nominate an factor in consecutive years, I would consider doing so for Mr. Foxx. Foxx does't just play Charles, the are-creates him. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother (the inspiration of this life) and young Ray. These two provided the strongest support in the film. The dramas of Charles' struggles with guilt, the death of this younger brother and mother, blindness, discrimination, addiction, and success, are neatly woven into the tapestries of this music. The music is beautiful, the script is, as far as I can tell, perfect, and the acting is nothing short of legendary. The directorial method of the film warrants discussion. Taylor Hackford - a director I am generally ambivalent about - had to choose what aspects of the larger-than-life and complex life story of Mr. Charles would tell this story most honestly, dramatically, and understandably. Though some disagree (seemingly wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic) I believe the selected this themes admirably. A big part of the success of this film is its consistent focus on a few persistent themes in Charles' life - this profound love and respect for this mother, this need to be loved and accepted, this addiction and guilt complex, this musical genius, and this deep-seated fear of responsibility for others. Charles is depicted as a man struggling valiantly against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined about one of the men I used to listen to on my old turntable with my dad in this livingroom on Sunday nights while football games were on the TV. And nothing was sugar-coated in ""Ray."" The themes are carried forward with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama which span the length of this long and illuminated life. The power of these themes, the strong script and directing, the music, and the acting make this one of the most enjoyable and evocative biographical films I have seen. Recommended for everyone.",positive

43143,"Once upon a time in the mid one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys I used to write for DOCTOR WHO fanzines and the whole of fandom was holding its breathe about the new American produced DOCTOR WHO TVM . As soon as it was announced that the Doctor`s march enemy the Master was going to be played by Eric Roberts everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed "" Who is Eric Roberts ? "" . I should point out this was before the IMDB came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume , but one helpful soul wrote into a publication I wrote for to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for a role where the starred opposite F Murray Abraham , the film was called BY THE SWORD and was about a fencing school . Actually looking back now Roberts is best known for THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLAGE and RUNAWAY TRAIN but that did`t stop the person putting the boot into both Roberts and BY THE SWORD and this mind was made up that this American Master with this southern drawl was going to a debacle . Strangely most fans were furious about Roberts playing the Master but after they saw the DOCTOR WHO TVM a great many fans ( Myself among them ) thought Roberts performance was the best thing about the disappointing American production Yeah I`m digressing but BY THE SWORD was a film that I wanted to see simply because it was the first time I`d heard the name of Eric Roberts but I did`t get the chance to see it until this weekend and I was fairly disappointed with it . I know nothing about fencing ( Everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence for not . I don`t fence ) so I don`t know how accurate it all is , but as mentioned the film feels somewhat anachronistic even if you saw it on its release in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one , the hairstyles seem a few years out of date along with its mixed teenage cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it would`t have worked a lot better if it`d had been produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid one thousand, nine hundred and eightys .

The only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick. A guy falls down, someone gets hit by a bus, etc. None of the ideas are clever, basically the worst premise for a movie never.

47916,"Wow - most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer wizardry displayed on screen. The shift from the early days as a New-York based black-American phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture (and largely West Coast-based) is profiled well. The humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument, but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex. These DJs take the required skills for any musical instrument - dexterity, rhythm and timing, among others - and apply them to a new technology with several more variables. DJ Qbert's comment that the pictures what ""music"" must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out, seemingly silly at first, makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could never create! Some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain 'stars' and squanders an opportunity to profile the wider ship-hop culture. One film at a time people!",positive

49053,"This fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre. I was happy to see William Powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm, and without the silly attitude of this Nick Charles character (from the ""Thin Man"" series). While the story is good on its own, I think what really makes this movie fun to watch is Michael Curtiz' fantastically imaginative direction. From a visual point of view, this is a richly textured movie, with Curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium; from split screen images, to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz demonstrates that the was one of the best Hollywood directors.
