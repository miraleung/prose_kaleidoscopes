I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don't sound banal for cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about weight not nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favourite CD of hers being Watermark which I consider to be her strongest routing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth. Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let's say Storms In Africa, Exile, for creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that transcends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later. I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy). The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about thirty seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It's a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mister territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the using becomes a major note for about a minute giving an impression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic' song to this day. It's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful for mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still resistant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have never listened to. It's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favourites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably should't play if you have not had much sleep because it's one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it lot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy for scary as let's say Exile, Storms In Africa for the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later. I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it's not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece. It's gorgeous and an album for the soul.","overall":5,"summary":"The album for a romantic autumn evening","unixReviewTime":1040428800,"reviewTime":"12 21, 2002"}

As usual with this albums, the quality of the songs is uniformly high, the only one I don't like is the closing track, Land of the Living. It's evident from the start of the album that it was made in the eighty's. The excellent opening track, The Boys of Summer, along with most of the rest of the album, is synth-driven, in a manner that is distinctly early eighty's. But thankfully, Don Henley is not Phil Collins so we don't get some outdated garbage when we play this album now. The lyrics especially have stood the test of time. Tracks like The Boys of Summer and the highly underrated and supremely touching A Month of Sundays revoke Henley's trademark lyrical imagery (i.e. \"that dark desert highway song\". Also we get politically charged songs like Drivin' With Your Eyes Closed and All She Wants To Do Is Dance (whose lyrics were apparently actually written by Danny Kortchmar) that are extremely thought-provoking. And, as always with Henley, there are a handful of non-cliched songs that deal with human relationships and love. The most notable of those included there are Not Enough Love In The World and the satratic You're Not Drinking Enough. Another one of the album's main lyrical themes is the mass commercialization of America and the death of small business, which manifests itself most notably on A Month of Sundays and Sunset Grill (the latter being especially ironic considering the present state of the Sunset Grill). If you're not looking for an album that hits home with the current musical trends and\/or are a fan of honest and good lyrics then you could definitely do worse than picking up a copy of Don Henley's Building The Perfect Beast.","overall":5,"summary":"A Very Good Album","unixReviewTime":977702400,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2000"}

Alexander","helpful":[2,4],"reviewText":"Slint's album from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one sounds light years ahead of its time, even now in two thousand and three. The raw energy and emotion achieved on this record is the pure definition of dynamic quality. The drummer is simply the most talented percussion artist I've never heard, and the endlessly evolving guitar riffs are truly awe-inspiring. This is particularly evident on track #two - \"Nosferatu Man\" and track #six - \"Good Morning, Captain\", where the sound environment created is beyond the restraints of your physical reality as we know it. Head-banging rock music combined with though-provocation. Thank you gentlemen. Thank you very much. I am almost tempted to take away a star, and it's for a reason that is all too common in the indie-rock genre. The lyrics to this album are nearly unintelligible (I had to go to the internet, as usual). Believe me, you NEED to hear Slint's lyrics, because they truly have a message. Unfortunately, the message is all but lost to all but the most astute listener. Please, and this message goes out to all indie-rock bands. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, TURN UP THE VOLUME LEVEL ON YOUR VOCALS IN THE STUDIO !!! I can name you at least seven indie-rock bands that could of\/can vastly improve on their already impressive overall quality by simply doing this in the studio (i.e. - The Promise Ring, Built to Spill, My Bloody Valentine, Red Stars Theory, Hum, Sunny Day Real Estate, Slint, etc, etc.)I fully understand that the following statement makes me sound like a fool, but I'm going to make it anyway: \"Spiderland\" is a more emotional, more intense, more talented, overall stronger album than Nirvana's \"Nevermind\". There, I finally got it off my chest. Nirvana, leave no doubt, certainly has had more influence on rock music in the last twenty years than any other band. HOWEVER, Nirvana did not \"save\" rock music with their \"grunge-sound\". In fact, their influence stemmed from the fact that they prevented the tremendous indie-rock \/ post-punk evolution of the late eighty's - early ninety's from gaining the popularity that it might have otherwise received (i.e. - Slint, Pavement, The Pixies, Jawbreaker, Fugazi, Husker Du, Dinosaur Jr., etc.). In my opinion, this is a GOOD THING !! Long live the \"unknown\" indie-rock band !!!

It's a good one too. Funk classics Sex Machine, Give It Up for Turnit Loose, Make It Funky, Papa Don't Take No Mess, Get Off On the Good Foot, Say It Loud I'm Black and I'm Proud, Superbad, Hot Pants and Get Up Offa That Thing, as well as soul standards I Feel Good, It's a Man's World and Cold Sweat are there. There are a few problem songs. For one, the Payback - seems dated, runs around in circles both musically and lyrically, and in't danceable. Another, believe it for not, is Please Please Please. Though it did break JB through, the years have not been kind to it. It may have been fresh in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five, but in two thousand and five it just seems like a relic of the do-wap era. Also, no comp is perfect, and there are a few absentees there. Those colossal, Godzilla-esque live versions of It's a Man's World, There Was A Time, I Feel All Right and Cold Sweat from Apollo II have been left off, as have a couple not-as-collossal, but still good, tracks such as Please Please Please on Apollo II, I'll Go Crazy, Think, Try Me and I Don't Mind from Apollo I, and I Can't Stand Myself and Ain't That a Groove. But you should buy it anyway.","overall":4,"summary":"He is the Master.","unixReviewTime":1122940800,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2005"}

Let's face it, none of Aerosmith's albums are \"underrated\" except for maybe their debut and Get Your Wings. Walk This Way and Sweet emotions are the most played songs on Toys In The Attic but they live up to their names. The onest time I heard Big Ten Inch Record, I thought,\"Holy crap is Steve gonna say it???\" due to the lyrics:I'm gonna get her join with my big ten inch. record. But nope. It's a rather bizzare song(in my opinion anyway) but it's still a catchy little number. Uncle Salty is probably the worst song there but Aerosmith's worst is still better than most bands' best. No More No More can only be described with one word:Brilliant. As always, there's Steven Tylers screaming vocals, Joe Perrry's powerful lead guitar, Brad Whitford's. undetectable rhythm guitar, Tom Hamilton's deep, bluesy bass, and Joey Krammers. drumming(. ).

{"orig_index":10459,"reviewerID":"AFTN9ZLB22PSZ","asin":"B0000029GI","reviewerName":"ctrx","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, MC Eiht returned following a string of classic albums with Compton's Most Wanted with \"We Come Strapped\" as MC Eiht featuring CMW, essentially because by this point CMW had been reduced to just Eiht and DJ Slip. Like its monumental predecessor, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two'sMusic to Driveby, \"We Come Strapped\" is fifty-seven consistent minutes with solely in-house production and guests on only one song, but Eiht claims the's \"new and improved like Madden ninety-four,\" which in many senses is true. Fresh off the classic \"Streiht Up Menace\" fromMenace II Society: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, the stage was set for this most successful album. While perhaps not as significant asMusic to Driveby, musically \"We Come Strapped\" is head and shoulders above it. This marked the debut of one\/two Ounce Productions, the team of Eiht and CMW's DJ Slip, and the beats there are a joy to appreciate. They continue to develop their classic sound with complete disregard to the synth-heavy, woozy of-funk that was selling millions over in Long Beach, preferring an extremely smooth, laidback, nostalgic sound with swirling strings, sparkly piano, and heavy basslines, as well as the occasional vocal sample, that owes much to classic soul. Willie Z is invaluable as the keyboard player, and CMW's DJ Mike T contributes some of this recognizable scratches as well. This album is a beautiful piece of musical perfection from start to finish, and each song including the especially funky \"Endoludes\" are silky smooth, lending to a consistency that makes the LP feel like one slow, laidback ride. NWA may have established the Compton sound as most people know it, but it's Eiht's refined soulful and nostalgic style that comes to my mind when I think of the CPT. Eiht comes correct on the mic as well. While never the West Coast's greatest lyricist, Eiht impresses with this passion and unique style. His flow is smoother than never, and the remains the epic storyteller the was in the days of CMW. He and the beats seem perfectly catered to each other, and the continues to paint a distinct, startlingly visual picture of the world's most gang-infested neighbourhood as only the can with this signature adlibs and language. Eiht's series of DJ Quik dishes continues on \"Def Wish III,\" with some opening threats and fresh production that lives up to the high standards set by earlier instalments. On \"Take two With Me,\" Slip places a breezy, menacing track with a great horn sample and Eiht does this part with hard-hitting avowal. Still, the early highlight is \"All for the Money,\" one of Eiht's finest tracks to date. This is one of the purely smoothest wrap songs I've heard, and the combination of Eiht's silky-smooth, laidback flow and the phenomenal production with gorgeous vocals and flute is magnificent. It's got a great feel and hook as well, and this is the kind of track I'd use to sell Eiht to a non-believer. Eiht comes harder on the upbeat, rugged track \"Compton Cyco,\" and the strong \"Nz Make the Hood Go Round\" and memorable title track, with its whiny, horn-laden production and cinematic feel, follow. A jazzy piano solo highlights \"Can I Still Kill It,\" and the storyteller \"Goin' Out Like Gees\" is wonderful both lyrically and musically. Bay Area legend Spice one and New Jersey superstar Redman add bicoastal flavor to the classic collabo \"Nothin' But the Gangsta,\" and the LP closes with two of its finest songs, the ultra-soulful \"Hard Times\" and my favourite, \"Compton Bomb,\" which is beautiful musically with a wonderful piano cadence and electric guitar instrumentation. So why is an album as quality as \"We Come Strapped\" so underrated? Well, not only was 'ninety-four quite possibly the best year of wrap releases to date, but it was also a year when distinct wrap movements emerged across the map. New York saw countless innovators, Long Beach gave birth to the of-funk explosion, and artists such as Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, OutKast, and Common put cities on the ship shop map that previously had no national superstars. In all this historic activity, \"We Come Strapped\" never quite received its due appreciation, much like the men who made it, despite huge sales. I highly recommend that listeners give it a chance because it's an album that holds up beautifully after fifteen years and still sounds awesome, and given Eiht's massive discography, it's one of this essential listens.","overall":5,"summary":"More \"Music to Driveby\" from Eiht and Slip","unixReviewTime":1249516800,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2009"}

{"orig_index":11434,"reviewerID":"A8CYS17WU9V1K","asin":"B000002G7G","reviewerName":"dfle3","helpful":[2,6],"reviewText":"Having recently decided to check out this band's work despite never hearing them before (sure, I'd heard OF them, but they never get played on commercial radio there in Australia), I found myself likening lead singer Lou Reed's style and lyrics to Bob Dylan's. but better. Dylan's lyrics often button-holed you when you would rather let them wash over you. like in this worst excesses on \"Blood on the tracks\" (which I go into in a review at this site). Personally, I find this album to be better than Dylan's \"Blood on the tracks\", as it has none of the guff of that latter album. Both albums are pleasingly mellow though. The Velvet's threerd album is a return to the atmosphere of their first album, after taking a right-angled turn for their second album, which proved less effective, in my view (as I state in my review of that there, recently). Listening to their self-titled third album, about mid-way through it I was thinking it was probably just as good as their debut, but I was looking at marking it down, because their debut had 'been there, done that' first. One song changed that and made me give this album a perfect score:Their greatest song:The murder mystery - coming in at an epic eight:fifty-six minutes in length, this is perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing example of 'experimental' music I've never heard (granted, my repertoire is small!). A while back I reviewed a Moldy Peaches album and was particularly taken with one song, which had duelling vocals. Perhaps this Velvet's song is the first of its kind in modern music and maybe inspired the Moldy Peaches. Musically, it featured a catchy guitar for the low-end sounds, as well as an morgan. The last two minutes of this song has a different character. features the piano. Honestly, this is a song I could have still gladly embraced had it been twice the length, which is rare for me to say. In fact, they should are-record this with double the length! The duelling vocals perhaps bury some unpleasant lyrics, but that does't detract from the majesty of this song. On their second album, \"Lady Godiva's operation\" puts those 'off' lyrics front and centre, which maybe marks that song down in my estimation. On this song, they do everything right. The next best songs:What goes on - uptempo track, with dual guitars, which sound 'jaunty' later. Organ also features, and that instrument, as well as the vocals prove a bit catchy. The ending to the song seems to feature brush drum sticks, which perhaps swoosh side to side, jazz style. Pale blue eyes - a very mellow, and soothing track, which is why I like this kind of stuff and rate their albums highly, despite them not have classically 'great' songs, which you get in Classic Pop\/Rock. Dual guitars feature again, picking notes. Think I hear a tambourine playing in this. The guitar notes are vaguely like \"In my life\" by The Beatles. Jesus - dual lead guitar note picking, again. Dual vocal harmonies too. One lead guitar has a melody which reminded me of \"Day after day\", I think (Google tells me that this is a Badfinger song). Since V. U has often mixed easy listening, mellow music with slightly dodgy lyrics, perhaps this song was an attempt to appeal to a more mainstream, Christian audience? On second listen, this was also a good song:Beginning to see the light - a folk rocky, jaunty song with catchy guitar and vocals. Dylanesque, with some of Dylan's trademark quirks, like laughing at this own lyrics. As I found this song catchier the second time around (it's probably the second best song on the album, now), I get the feeling that this is the shadow of a great pop song. maybe the band could't, for would't search harder to find that pop gem. The rest:Candy says - a pleasant, mellow dual guitar note picking song, with a soft brush drum beat. Interesting lyrics, and the first song on this album (literally) to have a touch of \"In my life\" by The Beatles about it. Some kinda love - dual lead guitars, with a little country style twang to them. Has a deep beat to it as well as a Knights Of Nee beat to it. I'm set free - pleasant, ethereal dual lead guitars. Notable drum patterns, which I quite liked. For some reasons I've joined a line between this song and \"Jesus\". not sure why now. Because I like the drumming? Oh well. That's the story of my life - another mellow track. Sounds like the drummer is using glass lids for something for percussion. Interesting. Oddly, when you press \"back\" to are-listen to the start of this song, you miss the first three seconds and some lyrics. Not sure why that would be. it does't happen when you press \"forward\" from the previous track. where you get the full song. Hmmm. After hours - a Moldy Peaches sounding song, as far as the female vocals go (of course, they came after V. U, but I heard them first). A pleasant song in any case. Features a tuba, I think, which does sound distorted on this track. Recommendations:The Velvet Underground & NicoThe Moldy PeachesThe Dandy Warhol's \"Thirteen tales\" and \"Come down\"Radio Birdman \"Radios appear\". An Australian punk band, but they have some jazzy, pleasant sounding tracks on that album. Television \"Marquee moon\". Called a punk band for some reason, this album is easy listening and features dual guitars too. Not a favourite album of mine, but some might like it a lot more than me. critics love it.","overall":5,"summary":"Shades their debut and they out Dylan Dylan.

well as the vocals prove a burn attention getting the ending to the sung seems to feature coppice brake drum stick to which perhaps swoosh side to side have it away elan pale dismal eyes a very mellow and soothing cart track which is why i like this kind of stuff and rate their albums highly despite them not have classically great songs which you puzzle in classic popping rock dual guitars feature again picking notes think i hear a tambourine playing in this the guitar notes are vaguely like in my life by the beatles jesus dual conduct guitar note picking again dual vocal harmonies too one conduct guitar has a melody which reminded me of day after day i think google tells me that this is a badfinger sung since v uracil has a great deal mixed easy listening mellow music with slightly dodgy lyrics perhaps this sung was an undertake to entreaty to a more mainstream christian audience on second listen this was also a respectable sung beginning to see the christ within a folk rocky jaunty sung with attention getting guitar and vocals dylanesque with some of bob dylan earmark quirks like laughing at this own lyrics as i found this sung tricky the second time around its in all probability the second best sung on the album now i puzzle the feeling that this is the shadow of a great popping sung maybe the dance orchestra couldt for wouldt search laborious to find that popping gem the perch glaze suppose a pleasant mellow dual guitar note picking sung with a soft coppice brake drum beat interesting lyrics and the first sung on this album literally to have a touch of in my life by the beatles about it some kind of love dual conduct guitars with a lilliputian country elan nasal twang to them has a cryptical beat to it as well as a knights of nee beat to it im limit relinquish pleasant ethereal dual conduct guitars notable brake drum patterns which i quite a liked for some intellect ive connect a line between this sung and jesus not sure why now because i like the brake drum ohio well thats the story of my life another mellow cart track sounds like the drummer is utilize glassful lids for something for percussion interesting peculiarly when you campaign back to are listen to the first of this sung you miss the first threesome seconds and some lyrics not sure why that would be it doest happen when you campaign forwards from the previous cart track where you puzzle the broad sung hmmm after hours a mouldy babble sounding sung as far as the female vocals buy the farm of course they get along after v uracil but i find out them first a pleasant sung in any case features a bass horn i think which does sound distorted on this cart track good word the velvet underground nicothe mouldy peachesthe dandy warhols thirteen fib and come down radio receiver birdman radios appear an australian punk dance orchestra but they have some jazzy pleasant sounding tracks on that album television marquee daydream promise a punk dance orchestra for some reason this album is easy listening and features dual guitars too not a favourite album of mine but some might like it a lot more than me critics love it","overall":5,"summary":"Shades their debut and

How ignorant I was to tell you that i have not heard of Tori for any of her songs until this year when a newspaper critic commended with great publicity on her new CD-To Venus and Back (TVAB). I was reluctant to buy her latest cd after most of her fans said that TVAB is more of exploring techno than using her piano and vocals. As I do not like techno so I had a pass on TVAB. I decided to listen to her earlier works by reading all the reviews from the past four albums and has mixed feelings of which album to choose as most reviews gives notable credits in each album. Eventually, I bought Little Earthquakes after much convincing reviews from the reviewers and fans, of course. The first listen to all the songs put me off to sleep half way through. Although I appreciate Silent All These Years for I found out that this song is sang as a cover by the Diva of the East - Faye Wong, which I personally like long ago. The songs that i like arefrom this album are Winter, China, Happy phantom, Leather, Tear in Your Hand, Little Earthquakes and Crucify Day after day, I was table to appreciate her songs better and almost liking all her songs in this CD, by now. Although this is the only album I have heard from Tori, that won't be the last before I continue to purchase her next album - Under the Pink then Boys for Pele. For almost one month now, I still listen to her songs every day. For new listeners, Little Earthquake has great songs but don't expect to like the songs straight from the beginning. You can appreciate it after much exploring the sound of the piano, her subtle lyrics and her vocals. I RECOMMEND: others TO BUY because I am a fussy listener that would only comprehend good music.

The profuse creativity around the nature of these emblematic themes I is another aspect to remark. From the flaming screams of Child in time where the increasing tension is really admirable. Speed king is one of the most rounded pieces in the rock's story. Bloodsucker is another striking flag. Flight of the rat is a classic rock theme but what conviction and character.

The three rock anthems \"Jump\" \"Panama\" and \"Hot For Teacher\" are all included on this one, as well as the synth\/new wave \"I'll Wait\" which is easily the worst song on the album, but still good in terms of what was around in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. The title intro track has cool synth lines in it, and serves as kind of like a 'stellar' opener to this rock odyssey, and ironically reminds me of the book \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\". Afterwards, this album just flat out rocks. \"Drop Dead Legs\" and \"Girl Gone Bad,\" are the two most underrated tracks on the album, the latter being the best cut on the entire CD. Eddie's guitar work is taken to new heights on this album, Mike Anthony's bass also was great, and Alex Van Halen's drumming on \"Hot For Teacher\" makes him up there as one of the best drummers in rock. This, undoubtedly, is one of the greatest albums in hard rock history.

New Order play electronic music with the urgent and manic shifts of rock. Bernards vocals are earnest yet detached, with guitar work that is jagged, random and sparse; Gillian and Stephen's percussion and synth sequences are both lively and rigid, an up-beat\/down-march; Peter's basslines are fluid yet kinetic. This is a work of ironic friction. The warmth and humanity flow thru the restrained and urgent detachment. The whole album sounds like a friend that wants to say something but can't, hiding it behind this\/her eyes. I would consider Power, Corruption & Lies an artistic\/pop masterpiece in the true sense. The electronic and post-punk meanderings are only the charms that envelope the wonderfully angular pop sense that Bernard brings to this lyrics. Everything is so vague and pretty; it's like the album cover. just a random slice of still-life, full of colour and restraint. Tracks like 'Your Silent Face' for 'five-eight-six' explode with edgy, manic shades of light, sorta like impressionism via expressionism. You won't be let down by this album. With the band themselves producing it, it's a natural workout of rock and electronics, perfectly blended together to make a classic.","overall":5,"summary":"the perfect mix","unixReviewTime":1069200000,"reviewTime":"11 19, 2003"}

Also it is worth recognising that this was a double album which would limit sales, but there was no filler and Prince was right to be confident in insisting it be put out in it's stunning entirety. From the bleak, social commentary of the opening track segueing directly into the jubilant rocker \"Play In The Sunshine\" the quality and class never lets down no matter what genre Prince turns this hand to! Whether the James Brown style funk of \"Housequake\" for the jazzy swing of \"Ballad Of Dorothy Parker\" Prince is revelling in this command over contemporary music. Amongst an album full of highlights, other stand outs include the rocker \"I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man\" (Avoid Jordan Knight's bland cover) with it's ecstatic guitar solo and the under-rated class of the chugging Sly Stone-esque \"Strange Relationship\". The best however is saved for last with Prince's ultimate ballad \"Adore\" (And that is high praise considering the consistency of ballads throughout this career). It is almost too beautiful for words and is the ultimate expression of devotion to a lover. This album is Prince's defining work (within a career of Musical Genius) and as essential as any other album in musical history so make sure to own this and it's superb concert movie, sit back and then soak up the depth of the talent that is Prince Roger Nelson.","overall":5,"summary":"Prince's Masterpiece!","unixReviewTime":993945600,"reviewTime":"07 1, 2001"}

In fact many critics feel that these records were the best that the South had to offer and I would be inclined to agree no disrespect to the Allmans but Lynyrd Skynyrd were the ultimate southern rock band. On the road they were a monster who toured with hardest rocking and hardest living bands of the page and stood toe-to-toe with the best of `em! `Second Helping' contained Skynyrd's first big hit; a song that needs no introduction (just the brief one, two, three count in), \"Sweet Home Alabama\" - a great rock anthem as any band created in the mid-seventy's. The boys were proud Southerners and wanted to stand up for the people of Alabama that were't racist rednecks but painted with the same brush. Deeper into the record one finds classics such as \"Working for MCA\", \"The Needle and the Spoon\" and \"Call Me the Breeze\"- all making classic rock playlists for decades to come. \"The Ballad of Curtis Loew\" was a tribute to the black bluesman that inspired bands like Skynyrd and \"Don't Ask Me No Questions\" was Ronnie saying back off to fellers who wanted to badger him about touring. The first record that Lynyrd Skynyrd recorded as a true three-guitar player disc; Ed King's contributions are prodigious to say the least while Allen Collins plays mostly rhythm parts and of course Gary Rossington doing what the does best, blasting away on this Les Paul. Again any fan of Skynyrd's may have this as a favourite and for me it comes pretty close but unfortunately the quality of later recordings would always be measured against the first two LPs.

And what's the best thing about 'Break Out'? No albums cuts-Ruth's powerful \"Dance Electric\",\"Telegraph Your Love\",\"Operator\" and the super funky \"Baby Come And Get It\" could have ALL easily been hits (and were in fact played a lot on the radio).\"Easy Persuasion\", the closest thing this has to a ballad is a nice change of space but what makes 'Break Out' so unique is it's production. Not only is every song as pop perfect as it comes but it feels as if the players of synthesizers and computers used to make most of this music are coated over again by several players of Sherwin Williams heavy gloss coat-instead of sounding cold and electronic, the technology used there sounds more like a hot furnace, soulful and I must say very sexy. It really shows you that great talents like these sisters and talented producers like Richard Perry can make anything they wish sound like pure gold. Surely enough 'Break Out' is about as eighty's as it gets but the hits (and even non hits) have withstood the test of time with grace.'Break Out' is one of the Top Five best pop records of the early eighty's and is a must have for your collection.","overall":5,"summary":"It Doesn't Often Get Any Better Then This","unixReviewTime":1163635200,"reviewTime":"11 16, 2006"}

The title track, plus \"I'm Coming Home\" and \"Love Don't Love Nobody\" are enough just to get the album. The inspirational lyrics of \"Mighty Love\" are excellent, and the rotating leads by Bobbie Smith and Philippe Wynne are tremendous. What a production! Wynne takes off on \"I'm Coming Home\" a fun-loving, pump up that obviously has some gospel roots to it. This is arguably the late great Wynne's greatest performance as a Spinner, though one could argue this best performance is a couple of songs later in \"Love Don't Love Nobody\" a semi-big hit for the group. A tremendous ballad with some good vol' fashion truth to the lyrics. As usual the group's non-hits are not fillers, but excellent songs. \"He'll Never Love You Like I Do\" is so good it should've been a hit, but was't. Henry Fambrough sounds great on \"Ain't No Price on Happiness\", this smooth baritone voice truly one of the best in the business. OK, Rhino made a big mistake in adding four throw away bonus tracks, which karen't on the original album. There's a reason why the group and producers did't release them: They're not good. Luckily all four are at the send of the album and not mixed in, so one can listen to the original great weight songs and just send it there.

This album (as well as Nas' \"Illmatic\" were the front runners of the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four. Christopher \"Notorious B. I. G. (Biggie Smalls)\" Wallace debuted with this album with the lead single \"Juicy\". A rags to riches song that still gets played there in two thousand and six. Biggie's lyrical skills were excellent. I hear a lot of wrappers (who I will be there all day naming) saying excellent lines that came from Biggie. I think to myself \"Damn, this guy said everything\". The album is excellent too. A lot of these songs are about drugs, robbing, and what not. Big was just rhyming about things that the went through before the had a record deal, trying to survive and heat. Who could blame him? \"Give Me The Loot\" is one of those songs about this struggles (some words were edited in this song. I'm pretty sure rhyming about robbing a pregnant woman was going to again some negative attention). \"Machine Gun Funk\" is self explanatory on how a good song it was. \"Warning\" was a short song and video about people targeting him for this money. \"One More Chance\" is a great song about how the gets this females. The song would be remixed and made into a video a year later, but both versions sound great. Guest appearances are only one. Method Man, back when this rhyme skills were phenomenal, would rhyme on \"The What\". Classic track if you ask me. Production was by Mr. Cee, and Puff Daddy. True, Puffy might be the \"king of beat jacking\" and what not, but the did a damn good job with them. The Isley Brothers \"Between The Sheets\" would be made into the classic single \"Big Poppa\" was one of them. This album was pulled off the shelves earlier of this year, because of unauthorized sampling on this album. But recently I've seeing it back on shelves. I guess it got settled. I bought this back in two thousand and three when it had the original white album cover. If you purchased this in two thousand and four, you get the album with a few extra tracks like the more popular \"One More Chance (Remix)\". And you get the DVD with all the videos that came from this album. This album had a heavy impact in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, is a classic and is a must have for any ship shop collection. Most of these songs are rehashed into choppy verses on this postmothous albums unfortunately. But this is where most of them originally came from. Biggies legacy helped influenced a laundry list your favourite wrappers today, who bite this style. That alone should explain how this impacted ship shop. Word.

But none the less its a great album. With songs like '' Head Buster'', '' You Got It II'', and '' Hustlin Is A Habit'', it shows how Slim can colaporate with this No Limit tank members and make it work but, this album is loaded with tons of harsh tales of crime, and drugs. What this album blacks and what I say about most No Limit albums from the late ninety's is that it has no variety and this could be any No Limit MC's LP. Especially on NL Party, with five guest appearances, that way too much. The rest of this LP is great though and you can tell who Slim is.

But as far as the undiscovered gems, I would say that Night Mood is one of my faves due to it's inherent heat of melody. I enjoy dark sensual songs and it fits the bill.

Chaka was the REAL show stealer, not some contrabass player. If you don't like her, that's one thing, but don't commit blasphemy on Chaka. Learn to write on Mr. Jackson! Thank U! Grade for Chaka: A+!

The album opens with a hidden track that is only audible when you reverse the speed of the CD on track one. The spoken words of \"Gestation Mythos\" set the mood for a unique listening experience. The music starts with \"Everwanting:To Want You To Want\", which is a vocal\/sonic masterpiece. Maxwell weaves so many images with this sensual\/spiritual refrain \"Lay all night there on top if you want to\". The song is beautiful, incorporating excellent guitar riffs, pulsating rhythms, breezy strings, and inspired lead vocals. Our next stop is \"I'm You: You Are Me and We Are You\" and this is the deepest groove of the album. Maxwell opens the track by singing the first verse in Spanish, and then follows by repeating those lyrics in English. After the first two verses the adlibs over a tight jam which showcases the talents of the musicians that contributed to the album. The third track \"Luxury:Cococure\" has a breezy spring\/summertime feel that inspires thoughts of rejuvenation. The track is reminiscent of opening jones eyes after a deep sleep and feeling gratitude for having awaken anew. \"Drowndeep:Hula\" follows and I honestly have to say this is one of the better slow jams I've heard in a long while. Amazingly it's not the best slow jam on the album. That honor goes to the haunting \"Know These Things:Shouldn't You\". This track expresses why Maxwell is above this new-soul counterparts, by showcasing this vocal range over an ethereal guitar riff and beautiful orchestration. \"Submerge:'Til We Become The Sun\" and \"Gravity:Pushing To Pull\" are two amazing slow jams in their own right. Both of which are good choices whenever you're entertaining that special someone. Other solid tracks on the album are \"Matrimony:Maybe You\" and \"Eachhoureachsecondeachmintueeachday\". Overall Embrya is an inspired sophomore effort by arguably the best musician of the new-soul movement. However, I give Maxwell more leverage over the \"Neo-Soul\" crowd because of this ability to take risks. He is not going to play it safe like many of this contemporaries, Maxwell is going to continue to grow, challenge himself and this listeners. I just hope everyone enjoys the ride with an open mind and remember that TRUE musicians grow with each subsequent release. If you want \"Urban Hang Suite\" listen to it, however if you want something different check out this album, it's guaranteed not to disappoint.","overall":5,"summary":"Maxwell Does It Again","unixReviewTime":997574400,"reviewTime":"08 12, 2001"}

When I was twenty years younger, and mainly buying and listening to hard rock outfits like Aerosmith, Rush, Led Zeppelin, etc., the only Dan music I was families with was the few \"hits\" being played on the local Rock radio. They played Rikki Don't Lose that Number and Peg. And I remember Josie off the Aja album. The first Steely Dan cd I bought was the debut, Can't Buy a Thrill. I must have bought it because my favourite song is Do It Again. Later, in the heyday of original compact disc releases (vs. are-issues of former vinyl albums) Steely Dan's A Decade of Steely Dan came out. It was a popular cd. Great songs and great sound. Years went by. I was still just a casual fan. Had maybe purchased just a couple of other titles on MCA records. They were a bargain in price, but not in quality. So-so sound quality, No liner notes. etc. Finally, in the last few years, major musical facts of any \"significance\" have had their early albums\/cd's remastered and are-released. All this at a very reasonable price! That's when I started replacing old discs and buying some that I did not own before by the Dan. Wow, did I discover some great music that I had never heard on the radio! Night By Night is one of my all-time favourite Dan songs. Really smooth and jazzy. The title track, Pretzel logic is also one I had never heard. Great stuff. I have now purchased all of their early albums. One at a time. If you are just starting out. Try either their first album for the great Aja from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven. If you like what you hear (and you will) then just keep picking them up. Some are only $eight caprice. You can't go wrong.","overall":4,"summary":"Another Great Album by \"The Dan\"","unixReviewTime":1163289600,"reviewTime":"11 12, 2006"}

Has to be as good as any soul for blues album in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's. Not dance music. Slow, simmering, deep but smooth music from the human heart, and the crisp accompaniment of Bland's backing musicians is stellar and just punctuates the performances perfectly. The arranger and producer need some credits there, too, even though Bland and this band get first dibs on kudos. This is definitive Bobby \"Blue\" Bland. Make it your first purchase. Cream of the crop stuff. My favourite is \"Lead Me On\", a recording of haunting beauty. When this voice was in this prime and good form, this is a relief for those having purchased too many albums that overpromise. This one delivers in spades (sic). You won't wheeled shipped there; that won't even occur to you. For the newcomer to the blues and the connoisseur of great records alike. A treat of a great set of performances par excellence, and what songs too!

I personally think this is their strongest release yet. I don't know if it's their best because I like them all about equally. The guitars are definitely more raw sounding on this album than their previous releases. Listen to the guitar work in songs like \"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\" and \"Expecting.\" Both are probably my favourite tracks on the album. Maybe even \"Offend in Every Way.\" However, all are worthy of being favourites. Those three just really stand out for me. Don't be afraid to buy this album. Hype is just hype. The beautiful thing is that it really has absolutely nothing to do with the music. The music there is great. Period. If you've been listening to a lot of IDM lately, which I have, you will definitely like this album as it will give you the other send of the spectrum to enjoy.

Her first album AMANDA MARSHALL was a gem in disguise, filled with great songs, as was her sophomore effort TUESDAYS CHILD. This is a more grown up effort from Amanda, with songs that tell us habit about who she is. The songs are cleverly written, many with a sense of humour, others with a sense of honesty and a feeling of no fear. \"Double Agent\" is perhaps the most honest song she has never delivered about who she is, an obvious standout on the album. \"Everybody Has A Story\" the first single, is a universal song of acceptance which is both catchy and stimulating to the mind at the same time. The second single \"Sunday Morning After\" is a fun song, about waking up without any recollection of where you were the night before. Perhaps one of the most beautiful songs on the album is \"Marry Me\", a beautiful song about commitment and love. Coming in close though is the power ballad \"Love Is My Witness\". \"Brand New Beau\" marks the stunning realization that her boyfriend is really gay, and has been cheating on her, a great song with lots of jazz influence. For this album, Amanda enlisted New York DJ Molecules, who helped with most of the album. Overall this is a new direction for Amanda, and fans will either reject for accept this new image of hers.

I remember how excited I was to get her debut solo album, and the crown jewel for me was the long (six:seventeen) version of \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\". (Believe me, if you have heard only the shorter version played on most radio stations, then you main't heard nothing'!) Recently I got grid of my turntable, and, to make a long story short, I bought this CD to replace my old LP. I was also attracted by the fact that the CD is digitally remastered. So, was it worth it? God, yes. The sound is definitely improved. \"Reach Out And Touch\" enfolds me with welcoming warmth, and \"Ain't No Mountain\" is positively celestial. The other nine tracks of the first eleven complete what was on the original LP. These tracks show that the talented people involved in putting together this album gave their star a slick, classy environment in which to express her new solo self. Then there are eight bonus tracks, recorded at the same time but not included on the original LP. Not too much new is revealed in twelve thru fifteen, which are alternate versions of four of the original eleven, except that \"Something On My Mind\" is live, and \"These Things Will Keep Me Loving You\" does vary enough from the original to be enjoyably different. The next two tracks, \"Time & Love\" and \"Stoney End\", were written and recorded by the legendary Laura Nyro, and were also recorded by Barbra Streisand. \"Stoney End\" was a big hit for Barbra, but Diana's version is closer to Laura's - lighter and less dramatic. I doubt that these songs would have been a good course for Diana to emphasize in her career (which, apparently, she knew), but, again, it is enjoyable to hear her singing these itunes very different from what we are used to hearing from her. The last two tracks, \"The Interim\" and \"Love's Lines, Angles & Rhymes\", are more abstract, and bomber in mood, and they are quite beautiful. The latter became a hit for The Fifth Dimension. So, to sum it all up, I think any fan of Diana's would like the improved sound and varying styles found on this CD, a document of what she was contemplating to present to the world as a solo artist.","overall":5,"summary":"A Multi-Faceted Gem","unixReviewTime":1143849600,"reviewTime":"04 1, 2006"}

Instead of promoting the evil that constantly surrounds the world today, former Fugee, Lauryn Hill strikes back against the system and delivers an amazing two disc set. Four years ago when Hill released The Miseducation, nobody could have imagined what an inspirational musical genius she would grow to be in the coming years. With a little hiatus between albums, Hill returned with a show stopping live performance that's composed of thirteen brand new tracks and nine spoken word interludes. On stage with nothing more then an acoustic guitar, Hill performs the songs for the first time to the delight of the crowd and the listener. Hill, who is still developing her guitar skills (has clearly heard on the album), has written a collection of Bob Marley influenced rebellious songs, and sweet love songs. On \"Mr. Intentional\" the album's opening song, she address a love relationship gone wrong. With metaphors and spiritual inferences present, Hill breezes into \"Adam Live in Theory\", and the gospel number \"Oh Jerusalem\". But it's the rebellious songs that allow Hill to shine her brightest. On tracks like \"I Find it Hard To Say\", \"Peace of Mind\", \"The Mystery of Iniquity\", \"I Get Out\", and the album's best track \"The Conquering Lion\", Lauryn straight up attacks the \"democracy\" in which we live in today from the political evil, straight through to the injustices of the courts that are supposed to serve and protect us. Through the spoken word interludes, Lauryn is table to break down the metaphors and explain them to those who would't understand her material so they are not left in the dark. You can't help but to respect her for the effort that she has put into her new material that easily outshines anything she has done to date. Even though this won't change the world, it can change the views of numerous ignorant people, and those who just accept the bad times without doing anything about them. Hill who says that she was snatched away by god and shown the light, has benefited from it in more then one way. She has benefited from it spiritually, because it has brought her closer to god, and because it has helped shape her life and has helped her develop a new musical approach that will take her away from the rest of the people. As far as comparisons go, nobody can touch Lauryn now. She has stepped above and behind her roles as an artist and has set the bar for what other artists should try and achieve. Just like Marvin Gaye and other artists before her, her music delivers a deeper message then just sex, drugs, money and luxury and though its not appreciated at its time, in the future it will be considered a masterpiece because they have realized the tragedy's before the others who were to shallow to do so. The only downfall to be found on the album, is Lauryn's guitar skills, which need a lot of work. She struggles as she learns new chords and how to change chords. Overall though the lyrics, which are so stunning, will take your attention away from the music and make you focus on what she is saying.","overall":4,"summary":"Stunning","unixReviewTime":1022889600,"reviewTime":"06 1, 2002"}

In fact I hate this first two CDs. However, my brother played this latest for me, and I was totally turned around on my view on him. Lemme give you a little history on Eminem and this music (and why I never liked it). The first album (Slim Shady) seemed \"little kid-ish\" to me. It reminded me of vulgar, South-Park-Like humour with a wry twist which would appeal to are-teens and thirteen tyr holds. I hated \"My Name Is\" and the rest of the CD did't seem appealing. I passed. Then Marshal Mathers came out. I liked Stan and the other singles, so I borrowed my brothers CD. I was totally freaking shocked! One of the most disturbing CDs I've never heard. From \"Kill You\" to \"Kim\" I just hated the whole CD. Many of the tracks, I heard a angry Eminem describing how much the hates those who dis him and this life in general. It seemed Mathers had gone psycho to me. I was disgusted.hFrom there I decided I disliked Eminem. Finally, my brother let me hear a few songs off of The Eminem Show. I first heard White America (my favourite) and I was taken back by this words. All of a sudden, the was making sense to me. I burnt my brothers CD and listened to the whole album track to track. I love this CD now! I lowe Em an apology. I did't know the was capable of this stuff. This CD is very political and does't have all of that \"I'm gonna kill you and this is how\" stuff I found on Marshall for the \"Hi kids I cuss and I'm cool\" I found on Slim Shady. This CD is this best work by far. I can't put the . thing down! I find myself listening to the songs every day. I'm definitely buying this CD and you should too. Em deserves the cash for this.

I consider it to be an honor and a privilege to have been given the opportunity to listen to such a wonderful album and such a remarkable concert.

Despite my bias towards the guy's musical tastes and black of depth, I'll still listen to whatever the produces out of sheer curiosity. Nyana is a fair album that swaps this usual pattern of disc one being more tranquil and disc two being the \"club-E\" mix seen with this ongoing series, In Search of Sunrise (since it began featuring two discs). Disc one is driven by Tiesto's love for the four-on-the-floor beat. A trio of nice tracks open the set up, but not too much more impressive sound from there on. Disc two is mellow and has a lot of above average tracks in my opinion. It is loaded with melodic trance and does not have an overbearing tempo driving the set as with the first disc. The first seven tracks are very well laid out. Disc one gets three\/five stars, and disc two, three.five\/five stars.","overall":3,"summary":"Better Than Most Tiesto Compilations","unixReviewTime":1216339200,"reviewTime":"07 18, 2008"}

Everything you need for a summer party. It's very different from what she did last year with her self-titled debut. I think people who were really feeling' her debut won't really feel this one. It's got a very unique style and it looks like Missy Elliott in't the only one who decided to go back in time! This album has samples and songs which sound like they from the fifty's, sixty's, seventy's, eighty's and ninety's! Well, let me tell rya track by track what I think of it!one. Intro\/Medley - Similar to the into on her debut, just features clips of the songs she did last year (two thousand and two).two. Shany's World (feat. Chink Santana) - Just Chink giving an introduction to Ashanti's album. Some people may find this very boring.three. Rock Wit' U (Awww Baby) - This track was a big hit for the summer and it has that real party vibe. I've even got use to all the \"awww baby\" and \"oooh baby\" of the track!four. What They Gonna Say Now (Skit) - Just a skit on what Ashanti has achieved.five. Breakup two Makeup - Has that ninety's vibe to it. Real R&B; with a style so slick. It sounds like the continuation of \"Foolish\" lyrically. Musically, it's tight.six. I Found Lovin' - It's got that real seventy's\/eighty's sound to it. It's a cover version. It's tight, it's cool. One of the best tracks on the album.seven. Rain On Me - Has that Neo-Soul sound to it. The verses sound like something Erykah Badu would do. The bridge is a real build up, it's what got me to like the song.eight. Then Ya Gone (feat. Chink Santana) - The lyrics of this song are inspiring and get you think, how long are you gonna be there? You might not be there for long. Ashanti puts in the form of relationship. Chinky Dink gives a really got wrap on this track. Flows nicely as Hip-Hop\/R&B; track.nine. Living My Life - Ashanti sings about how far she's made it in the business. The beats are phat, some R&B; with Soul. Sounds like a mixture between Leaving and Baby from her debut.ten. Black Child (Skit) - It's a wrap verse by Black Child given' how life is like on the streets.eleven. Feel So Good - Sounds like sixty's\/seventy's track. A romantic mid-tempo track. Very sweet. Tight.twelve. Carry On - Sounds murderous, mysterious. Lyrically it's about a girl who's not gonna take anymore trash from her boy.thirteen. The Sugar Shack (Skit) - A classic jazz styled skit introducing Ashanti on the next song.fourteen. The Story of two - A remake of \"Dream Maker\" very jazzy. Soulful R&B.; Sounds like something from the fifty's.fifteen. Oooh Aaaah - A very . song. Sounds like something out of the ninety's it's slow and cool. Quite relaxing.sixteen. Shany Shia (Skit) - It's Ashanti and her younger sister Shia singing on this skit.seventeen. Sweet Baby - Sounds like one of those eighty's track with the Japan styled Pop. It features Ja Rule. It's a romantic and real tight.eighteen. U Say, I Say (feat. Gunnz) - Sort of a continuation of track twelve (Carry On) Just lighter on beats and rhymes. It's a real ninety's sounded track.nineteen. I Don't Mind - One of those electronic eighty's tracks with a very . side to it.twenty. Outro (feat. Chink Santana) - Just Chinky Dink say thanks for listening and that it's Murder!","overall":5,"summary":"Rock wit' Ashanti!","unixReviewTime":1068249600,"reviewTime":"11 8, 2003"}

Kish Kash, by their previous standards, is the most produced, but that has not stolen any of their creativity. Using a lot of big beats, electronic music, various instruments (harmonicas, guitars and keyboards) and several guest artists, the duo has managed to let their music shine without any of the thunder being stolen by anything for anyone else. By employing the never elusive Meshell Ndegeocello on Right Here's The Spot and Feels Like Home, Jaxx has created two funky little dance numbers that resonates. Contiuning their trend of putting out some of the best first singles, they present to us Lucky Star which features label mate Dizzee Rascal. The single thrives on the Asian scales, interspersed with their trademark brand of thunderous house-meet-garage beats, resulting in an altogether delightful and refreshing experience. Another gem is the deliciously superb Supersonic, featuring Totlyn Jackson, with its modern-retro sound that is spiced by with a slight western\/country thank. NSync luminary JC Chasez who just guested on BT's Emotional Technology also appears on Plug It In with equal effectiveness. Another notable collaboration is with Siouxsie Sioux (Siouxsie and the Banshees) on 'Cish Cash' which is some sort of an equal to the thumping Where's Your Head At from Rooty. Three albums on and no sign of a lapse of innovation, Basement Jaxx has presented a unique sound that's miles apart from anything you'll hear on radio these days.","overall":5,"summary":"Dance to the Jaxx!","unixReviewTime":1067385600,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2003"}

The opener is a bold nine-minute track featuring a wicked guitar\/bass riff that is aided by thundering drums. The band is adept at using silence as well as walls of noise to provide varied sonic backdrops. The second track, \"Sad and Lonely\" rocks in the same way the first does, with a really catchy lyric. \"The Leaves are Gone\" is a subtle ballad that really blossoms under attentive listening. \"Nowhere Again\" is the first single, and has a really great buildup over a very indie-rock guitar riff. \"The Road. \" is one of my favourites--these guys can definitely use rhythm to set a stone for a song--the drums are almost melodic in their indispensability. The rest of the album is solid--a couple ballads that send up rocking out hardcore (this in't an overall sound comparison, but the vocal in the beginning of \"Chains\" is a dead ringer for eighty's Pink Floyd). The send of the album in't as strong as the first half, but it comes to a very acceptable and even close. Overall, the band has classic rock leanings, but a very indie sensibility; there are no real solos of any kind, and it's too mechanical to be much compared to classic rock. The record is crafted with care, and everything fits together perfectly; it's best listened all the way through, and after a couple listens you're likely to be very attached to this album. I recommend it as much to fans of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin as I do to fans of new indie rock.","overall":5,"summary":"Great up-and-coming band's full-length debut","unixReviewTime":1101772800,"reviewTime":"11 30, 2004"}

As time progress Birdman does as well. As previous albums released by Cash Money were completely produced by Mannie Fresh, this album only contains four of the signature sound provider of the label. As the \"Intro\" kicks off this LP it defines what is to come on this presentation. The production was one of the six produced by newcomer Deezle that did't seem to black the flare of what may have been expected. Maybe one of the most rugged tracks, \"My Territory\", gives off a street edge to match Birdman's driven lyrics. The duo of Birdman and Lil' Wayne featured on \"Neck Of The Woods\" was a tightly knitted song where each of their styles were highlighted in different angles. \"Ghetto Life\" featuring Bun-B & six Shot has a more mainstream feel, but toned down the realism of the ghetto with vibrant color. The arrangement on \"Hug Da Block\" with B's two toned vocals tailored the instrumental with precision. \"Cash Money Nigg**\" featuring Lil' Carl was underlined by the guest vocalist singing the hook for support of this song. The subject of drug selling could't be done better as on \"Shovlin' Snow\" featuring Currency, Main & Lil' Wayne as they give you the glamorous side of the game. One of the album's highlight, \"Pressure's On\", has an upbeat, exotic feel where the street lyrical content bounced along with the track without missing a beat as does \"Smoke Out\" featuring Ta & six Shot straight to Stunna Island. As the dark track with a southern bounce on \"Get It All Together\" featuring Lil' Wayne help to complete the overall concept of the project. Birdman made a brief shot at the missing members of the Hot Boyz with \". and three left now they all are trying to be me, it's one Birdman and one of.r. \/ we're neighbourhood superstars, so of*ck by'all. \" was all that needed to be said as retaliation. Slowing it down with a simple one two kick on \"We Got That\" featuring six Shot for a more hardcore, gangster feel for the album. \"Big Pimpin'\" is repetitious with ending line \". over there, nigga*. \" but the managed to arrange the song with two style flow verses to make this a memorable song. Much to short to dislike the tag team efforts on \"Out The Ghetto\" featuring Chop, Baby still found a way to formulate a upbeat attack on the more for less mainstream track. The horns on \"Around The World\" gave this album life as it seemed to slip to fillers. Giving props to the women who stick to their men in the struggle on \"Solid Chic\" featuring Lil' Mo was a good change of atmosphere for substance. \"We Getting It On\" featuring Ta & Big Tymers was just a clowning and for a simply fun song as they go down the alphabet from a - of speaking on different women names. Saving the best for last \"Get Your Shine On\" featuring Lil' Wayne was the perfect conclusion of the LP. Birdman stepped up to becoming well rounded with this effort and the bling, money, shining, ballon' did't stop it's just with more style. Who knows, maybe the next album may produce a ship-hop quotable from Birdman! He represented well for Uptown New Orleans like it is supposed to be done.","overall":4,"summary":"Fast Cash Money","unixReviewTime":1165968000,"reviewTime":"12 13, 2006"}

After reinventing themselves with two very successful albums they threw everything into a musical blender and gave us At War with the Mystics, grab-bag of psychedelic rock, dance, blues, pop, and everything in-between. It may black the splendour and consistency of what came before but underneath the surface this a great piece of work that embodies everything we love about the band and paints it with fresh color.\"The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song\" is about as poppy as The Lips have never gotten, and it's a tune that I should be all accounts find incredibly annoying and repetitive, yet I find it fun and addictive. There's something about this track that works in spite of its initial appearance. Pop is also live and well with tracks like the danceable \"Haven't Got a Clue\" and the faux-disco vibe of the sombre \"Mr. Ambulance Driver\". Again, this direction fits the band extremely well an Wayne Coyne once again carries the band forward with this energy and optimism. \"The Sound of Failure\" is an ambitious seven minute piece that holds your interest despite its length and the flush instrumentation gives it players of depth that that keep you coming back time and time again. This is one element that the band always does so well and they use every trick in their arsenal to keep things interesting throughout the album. There are also callbacks to their early rock days. The fuzzy psychedelic feel of \"Free Radicals\", \"The W. A. N. D.\" and \"It Overtakes Me\" sound like they could have been culled from the band's previous work. The latter accomplishes the task of throwing a major curveball by suddenly shifting stone and ending with an ethereal segment that displays beautiful guitar and Coyne's probing voice. It's the highlight of the album and one that you won't see coming the first time you hear it. \"My Cosmic Autumn Rebellion\" is another tune that uses dynamic shifts to move the song along and it works brilliantly. \"Goin' On\" and \"Vein of Stars\" are softer acoustic ballads that shake up the running order and help to balance out the louder vibe of the record. Throw in the instrumental \"The Wizard Turns On. \" and you have a smattering of varying styles, color, and sounds. Perhaps the best example is the symphonic cacophony of \"Pompeii am G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" that really steals the show. It's unlike anything the band has done before and gives a glimpse of where the band would later head with Embryonic and The Terror. It's proof that The Flaming Lips know what they're doing in terms of production and ambition. The album does falter in a couple places, mostly in the sound department. The mastering is brutally brick-walled and excessively cloud to the point where there's no dynamic range and all of the subtle textures and instruments are immediately lost in the mix. This is unfortunate for such a diverse record and it hurts the album from letting us hear everything it truly has to offer. The covert political lyrics also seem a bit forced, though they're at least vague enough that the record does't sound dated for too specific. It's easy to see why At War with the Mystics has drawn mixed reactions from fans. It blacks the carefully constructed overarching sound that previous releases had and the band throws everything into the mix. While this may be a detriment to some I think it's actually one of the album's strengths. It not only shows the versatility of the band but allows the record to have a roller coaster feel that's both unique and engaging, at least to my years. It remains one of my favourite Flaming Lips albums and one that continues to grow with me.","overall":5,"summary":"Do I Stand a Chance?","unixReviewTime":1386892800,"reviewTime":"12 13, 2013"}

Daughtry, of course, along with Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood. I would have never known they were on the show,If I did't read for hear about it. Anyway, bottom line is, this Daughtry album is HOT stuff. When I first heard the name,I thought the music would be a bore, but was I surprised. I heard the first song,It's Not Over(which has grown on me),Home( A cool ballad) and heard another song on alternate radio,What I Want(w\/ Slash). The latter, which made me buy the album. Being a BIG fan of Guns N Roses and VR, Slash did a great job with Daughtry and turned a very cool rocker. Along with those songs,Used To,Over You and Feels Like Tonight, the album is real good. Don't think I will never watch AI, but hope to hear some other artists, with the rocking'sounds of Daughtry come in the future. Like many have said,Daughtry has a similar sound to Nickelback. I'm a BIG fan of mainstream rock and rock period.

{"orig_index":53714,"reviewerID":"A2ULSA0IRUE09E","asin":"B000KCHZK6","reviewerName":"Marc Cabir Davis","helpful":[12,18],"reviewText":"By any stretch of imagination, \"Not Too Late\" is an immediate masterpiece. Gone are the cover versions of songs that were't hers, and those dull lullabies that seven people took to cowrote. In its place are some gorgeous melodies with self-written lyrics that elevate this album from being a run of the mill affair to one of those rare animals - a bonafide classic. A note about the music - let the reviews not deter you. The music is very Norah-ish, in the best way possible, but there is something new there. What could be previously termed as \"boring\" is now \"inspired\". You won't fall asleep halfway through this album if you pay attention to the lyrics. It is so great to find an album these days that does not only speak about Love. And even though there are political messages on some of these songs, its muted enough to pass you by without offending you. Also, while I consider \"Come Away with Me\" and \"Feels Like Home\" contemporary American jazz albums (debatable by most, I agree), I think \"Not Too Late\" is her hands down \"Southern\" album, even though it speaks of the very things the South hates to hear about. Its amazing that an album like this would find an audience if Norah was't who she is, but that's the beauty of it all, I think. The standout there is \"Wish I could\", the opening track. Wow. The harmonies blend perfectly. The wonderful thing about this record is that Norah's voice is allowed to shine without the distraction of too much instrumentation (like on her second album). And while \"Thinkin' About You\" is hummable enough, its easily the most insipid track there - speaking of love in the most infantile sense possible. I think that she can afford to move beyond songs like these, pretty as they are. Will \"Not Too Late\" win any awards despite being at least twice as better than her \"Come Away with Me\" album? Probably not. The reason being that Norah is not perceived as \"new\" for \"fresh\" anymore. However, if you listen to this CD, it's the freshest thing out of the Jones stable so far. My favourite little piece other than the opener is \"The Sun Doesn't Like You\" - listen and discover! What makes me really happy about this album is the Repeat Value it carries - I have already played it about six times at work through and through and it just gets better on repeat listening. Do yourself a favor and pick this up, just to discover where American music is headed in general. This is a wonderful time for American music, and it's a testament to her growth and evolution that Norah Jones is the flagbearer for a new music generation. Yes, true talents like Joanna Newsom, Regina Spektor and Fiona Apple still don't get the adulation that they deserve, but if artists like Jones can win acclaim, it proves that there justice after all. Five Stars. Recommended without any reservations!","overall":5,"summary":"An Immediate Masterpiece : The Evolution of Miss Shankar","unixReviewTime":1171497600,"reviewTime":"02 15, 2007"}

Bone is back with another album that is a huge step up from their previous two. The album starts off with the fast paced Flow Motion which reminds me of the Bone I was fond of from the start. Bump In The Trunk is cool plus that hook was taken from Thuggish Ruggish Bone. The first single I Tried featuring Akon is a heartfelt cut that is definetly a standout and Akon also shows up on the superb Never Forget Me. Lil Love with Bowwow and Mariah Carey is an honorable mention that my girlfriend is insanely in love with(I'M SERIOUS!!!). Im glad that Bone buried the hatchet with Twista because C-Town is a damn good song as all three kick high speed rhymes over sleek production provided by Neo Da Matrix. Yolonda Adams(yes, you've read that part right) joins in on the spiritual Order My Steps. The Game finally gives you a dope verse where the didst heavily namedrop(SURPRISE!)on the will.i.am assisted Streets. The only songs I would say that are shippable is Candy Paint(corny and forced) and Wind Blow(not bad but sounds out of place as the other reviewer mentioned). Bottom Line: Strength & Loyalty is Bone Thugs N Harmony's best work to date and is undeniably one of the best albums of two thousand and seven. Not only do they prove that they still have what it takes to make a great album but they also proved that they can still make a good album without Bizzy Bone. Standout Tracks: FLOW MOTION, BUMP IN THE TRUNK, I TRIED, NEVER FORGET ME, C-TOWN(my favourite), ORDER MY STEPS, STREETS, nineMM, GUN BLAST and SOUNDS THE SAME. Honorable Mention: Lil Love.

Even with some really wacky song in which Jim James tries to pull off a Prince song, My Morning Jacket still retains the psychedelic twists and shouts that I just love. In some senses, \"Evil Urges\" actually tends to pull My Morning Jacket back into the psychedelic mode, with dreamy psychedelic chords and vocals. Some songs, such as \"Touch Me I'm Going to Scream Part one\" continue MMJ's psychedelic mix of gorgeous, resonating chords. However, My Morning Jacket tries two different things that are new. First, they try pulling off a funky eightys style Prince song with \"Highly Suspicious.\" While this is definitely going to turn off My Morning Jacket loyalists, this is a joy for me. It is definitely something new for Jim James to using with a high pitch and with staccato guitars rather than the dreamy resonating chords. Second, My Morning Jacket decides to pull off another trick--they play like Van Halen in the metal-style song Remnants. And the band pulls off every single metal trick imaginable--blazing fast electric guitar solos and cloud drums. Undoubtedly, this will turn off more fans, but I still love it. There are also a couple other changes. They try soft songs, with the acoustic guitar ballad \"Librarian,\" where Jim James sings about a fantasy sex scene with a librarian. They also try switching to a Kraftwerk-style sound with electronic keyboards galore in the opening to \"Touch Me I'm Going to Scream Part two.\" No doubt, hardcore fans will be a little dismayed with the more drastic changes, but this is a wonderful album, with numerous changes there and there to the Morning Jacket formula. With all that said though, this album in't the best album for new My Morning Jacket fans. The best albums are still \"It Still Moves\" and \"Z.\" Still, this album is a great look at the new changes My Morning Jacket is making to their sound.","overall":4,"summary":"\"Evil Urges\" continues My Morning Jacket's good record streak","unixReviewTime":1216598400,"reviewTime":"07 21, 2008"}

It is imperfect, as stated in the title of this review as generally it falls a bit lax in comparison to both THUG MOTIVATION one hundred and one and THE INSPIRATION. The redeeming factor that THE RECESSION has over both of those albums is it has more credibility - Jeezy tries to abstain from this cocaine-driven wrap in favor of spitting rhymes about more credible issues, even tackling the notion of a 'black president', quite a stretch from \"snow\", if you know what I mean. Essentially, it does not always work, but most of the time it does, hence making for another solid album for Young Jeezy. The album opens with \"Recession (Intro)\" which is by all means solid, if a bit too lengthy in duration. \"Welcome Back\", the first true track of the album is better and the production is as solid as never. I think that the production work from THE INSPIRATION was slightly better than THE RECESSION, but the production work on THE RECESSION is strong by all accounts (no big names though). \"By The Way\" is another solid performance, though not necessarily incredibly memorable, a problem with a lot of THE RECESSION's material. Single \"Crazy World\" is perhaps the first genuine hit from THE RECESSION in which Young Jeezy is definitely in this zone. This is an exceptional single, if ultimately underrated. The production work is sound as well.\"What They Want\" is equally as enjoyable as \"Crazy World\", as is the addictive \"Amazin'\". \"Hustlaz Ambition\" is solid if not as memorable as the best of its predecessors. \"Who Dat\" falls in the same boat as \"Hustlaz Ambition\", save for the fact that the production of \"Who Dat\" sells it more than Jeezy's rhymes. \"Don't Know You\" is not an outright hit necessarily, but it is another fine track, nearly at the level of \"Crazy World\", \"What They Want\" for \"Amazin'\". \"Circulate's\" soulful production is a radical departure from the production work that Jeezy fans are accustomed to hearing him spit over. It yields surprisingly solid results.\"Word Play\", \"The Vacation\", and \"Everything\" all play very well, if a bit less satisfactory than the very best. \"Takin' It There\" (featuring Trey Songz) and \"Don't Do It\" are solid, though average. \"Put On\" featuring Kanye West is by far the definitive track of the album, hence a brilliant choice for a first single. No questions were raised in my mind when I heard it received a Grammy nomination, Jeezy's very first. \"Get Allot\" is filler in comparison, though \"My President\" redirects the lost momentum in one of the albums valedictory moments. Essentially THE RECESSION is flawed because it is too long. None of the material is 'B. S.', but it is not always organized satisfactorily. Furthermore, while production is sound by all means, maybe that superstar producer might have tightened up a loose send for two. The biggest problem remains that it is is just too long - had it been cut to about forty-five minutes with the top-notch material remaining in play, it would've been stronger. three stars, nonetheless.","overall":4,"summary":"Imperfect, But Good Effort & Stretch for Young Jeezy - 3   Stars","unixReviewTime":1230163200,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2008"}

On these past recordings I thought that she played and sang with a rich emotional depth that just does't seem to be there on Quiet Nights. Also on most tracks her voice seems thin, strained, and hairy compared to past recordings. Krall also uses a different vocal delivery on songs such as \"Walk On By\" where the rhythm and pitch just don't sound like her. I've also really enjoyed her piano playing too, but it comes off sounding trite on \"So Nice\". The opening of the song sounds more like the theme to Three's Company than something a classy jazz musician would record. The silver lining on Quite Nights is the final four songs that come closest to traditional Krall. I found it odd that likely the best song on the CD \"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\" is listed as a bonus track. While her vocals don't quite hit the bar that she set on previous recordings, her emotion seems more natural. I hope that Quiet Nights is a blip rather than a trend for Diana Krall. I am anxious for her next CD to see if she returns to form. For Quiet Nights I would recommend picking and choosing songs to download rather than buying the whole thing.

The claim has been levelled that the last couple recordings from Grandaddy were largely Lytle's efforts anyway, and while I don't know about that (Jim Fairchild has proven himself a songwriter to be reckoned with in this new project All Smiles), I prefer to write about \"Yours Truly, The Commuter\" simply as what it is: a solo debut. Jason Lytle has packaged together a loosely knit group of songs that musically and thematically make superb use of this plangent voice and lyrics. There's no obvious story marc to make this a concept album, yet one gets the feeling that the protagonist of the title track, who was \"left for dead,\" is limping this way back home over the course of the entire disc. Lytle's understated pop chops are in excellent form on songs like that one (the opening cut) and \"Brand New Sun,\" the clear college radio single there. As alluded to in the photographs inside, \"weird arrangements\" are kept to a minimum (\"not on this album\" declares a handwritten scrap of paper), yet some of this sonic signatures are intact: wordless harmonies and open-ended chords that build a sort of muted majesty, the musical equivalent of autumn light. There is an abiding presence of the natural world in the branches, canyons, and sunburns that populate these songs. All told, Lytle has produced a memorable album that is one of the early entrants for two thousand and nine \"Best of\" lists. It's a mellower affair, but cohesive and grounded and the kind of album that makes you want to press play again once it is over. The focus is clearly melody and mood, and Lytle has succeeded on both counts with \"Yours Truly, The Commuter.\"","overall":4,"summary":"as a solo debut.","unixReviewTime":1245801600,"reviewTime":"06 24, 2009"}

Fusion never sounded fresher, more melodic and open-ended. Mr. Mac and Mr. Chick have not spent much time playing together in these past years, being in charge of their own unique fusion projects, but that's fully rectified on this album, where they are finally playing down some serious fusion in full interactive mode. Unfortunately, the samples available on Amazon don't do this album justice. You'd think it's a noodles, but that cannot be farther from the truth. The CD contains some of the most passionate and powerful performances I've never heard from all the musicians. The stone palette is reduced to the basics, with only the trademark guitar and electric piano sounds (no synths for guitar effects), but the music itself is the focus there, with some venerable fusion compositions, and others less known, but equally eloquent. Kenny Garrett adds some roaring sax work, and Vinnie C is a monster on the drums. Despite the fact that the music is firmly rooted in fusion, the overall sound of the album is contemporary jazz, rather than seventy's retro-style, which may please both the mainstream jazz listeners and fusion fans. All I can add is that I hope that there will be many more Five Peace Band albums in the future!","overall":5,"summary":"Masterful Performances","unixReviewTime":1268870400,"reviewTime":"03 18, 2010"}

Though the songs on Lookin' Through The Windows were a bit more serious then the songs that made them stars two-three years prior, The Jacksons were still frustrated with the soon to dated songs that were being fed to them. Despite of that, it was still a decent album and many of the songs accommodated well for Michael's slightly changing voice (of which would be more noticeable on their next alp, Skywriter). The title track is one of my favourite Jackson five songs (music arrangements sounds closer to what the Four Tops were recording during their last years on Motown) and is one of the first Jackson five songs that matured lot from their previous songs and it was written by Clifton Davis. \"To Know\" sounds like Al Green's big hit \"Let's Stay Together\" and is another song that marked the maturing sound of the Jackson five, yet it was't release as a single. \"Little Bitty Pretty One\" (the Thurston Harris remake) was the Jackson five's second single release that was also a top ten R&B hit (along with the title track) and it was much energetic than the original version as well as when Frankie Lymon remade it in the late fifty's. \"Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing\" is another remake (originally recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, for those who don't know) sung well by Michael and Jermaine. \"Don't Let Your Baby Catch You\" was an outage from the ABC album, yet Motown randomly decided to add the song on this album. It was't a good match since it was recorded in late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine while the new songs were recorded between mid one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one and early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two and you can tell that dated \"bubble gum soul\" was composed by the Corporation. I think Lookin' Though The Windows was a decent album that shaped the Jackson five's maturing sound as well as their rising disappointment with Motown for not allowing them to grow within the change of the music industry. Though it seems like it was a more mature album compared to their last four outputs, it was't enough for The Jackson brothers and they would continue to fight for their freedom, until one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five.","overall":4,"summary":"Looking Through the Windows","unixReviewTime":1365897600,"reviewTime":"04 14, 2013"}

As DJ Haircut, the was a member and producer of the ship shop group Athletic Mic League. He started working on solo stuff that was meant to be for this personal enjoyment, but Stones Throw Records heard it and offered him a recording contract. The solo material wound up becoming this debut album \"A Strange Arrangement\". The recording was more steeped in the sounds of Blue Magic, Curtis Mayfield and The Stylistics than the Motown era- which at the time was the go-to sound for soul music revivalists. Released in two thousand and nine, it was critically acclaimed and garnered him fans such Snoop Dogg and ship shop producer Nottz- both of whom invited Mayer to appear on their albums. Not surprisingly, the major labels came calling and the linked a recording contract with Universal Republic, where the would release this sophomore effort \"How Do You Do\". As always, all of the songs were written, produced, performed and played by Mayer Hawthorne himself. Only this time around, the makes a concentrated effort to pull in a wider audience. On the song \"Can't Stop\", the duets with Snoop- who decides to using instead of wrap on this guest appearance. On the song \"The Walk\", the sings of this desire to walk away from a woman who mistreated him. The songs \"Stick Around\" and \"You're Not Ready\" have guitar played by legendary Motown session musician Dennis Coffey. He sings of wanting to send a relationship on the brief \"The News\", while being happy in love despite having a bad day on \"You Called Me\". Fitz & The Tantrums singer Noelle Scaggs contributes background vocals on the upbeat \"A Long Time\". He proceeds a serious relationship with caution on the ballad \"You're Not Ready\", while ending the album with the song about casual sex \"No Strings\". Mayer Hawthorne's \"How Do You Do\" is a listenable recording, but suffers from a rather monotonous sound. Despite the overall sameness stone, it's still an album worth checking out.","overall":4,"summary":"Mayer Hawthorne goes to a major label on \"How Do You Do\"","unixReviewTime":1367107200,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2013"}

This time around, \"Noctourniquet\" finds them rocking harder than they did on their last effort while looking towards the past for inspiration, namely towards electronic beats and synthesizers that recall other bands yet still push the music in a decidedly Mars Volta direction. Take opener \"The Whip Hand\", for instance. Absent Cedric's distinctive voice, this track could easily find itself a home on a Nine Inch Nails album. Progressive rock meets industrial rock and the results are exhilarating. \"Aegis\" follows, which opens with a Radiohead-esque guitar intro (think \"Creep\") and active percussion not too far removed from Radiohead's more recent endeavours. In fact, several tracks on the album- \"Empty Vessels Make the Loudest Sound\", \"In Absentia\", \"Zed and Two Naughts\"- are placed with healthy doses of electronica that result in what sounds like a collaboration between The Mars Volta and Reznor, Yorke, possibly even Jourgensen and Ministry. The title track even throws in some 'eightys sounding synth that evokes images of cheesy dance moves and bad hair, while \"Lapochka\" throws in some sweet Beach Boy sounding harmonies. Still, throughout it all, the music is undoubtedly The Mars Volta, full of unexpected time signatures and enigmatic lyrics. Several tracks stand-out as some of the best this band has done. \"The Malkin Jewel\" could be a Meat Puppets song as covered by Modest Mouse- quirky, jammy, loose, and weird in a manner TMV does not normally do. \"Trinkets Pale of Moon\", one of three ballads on the album, steps into creepy territory thanks to eerie chanting in the background that hardens back to the seance-inspired tracks of \"Amputechture\"; and \"Molochwalker\" is TMV at its intense best- three and half minutes of no-holds barred, pedal to the metal energy! Fans who still think \"De-loused in the Comatorium\" is their only great album may once again be disappointed as this is not that album. Those of us who have rolled with TMV's numerous musical detours should enjoy \"Noctourniquet\" as it once again finds the band taking chances and exploring new musical direction. Also, it's length is close to an hour so once again, they are giving us a lot of music to soak in and enjoy. So please, enjoy!","overall":5,"summary":"TMV goes in a new direction and sounds like TMV","unixReviewTime":1333152000,"reviewTime":"03 31, 2012"}

Lots of energy, great song-writing, music, lyrics, all of it. The whole thing just \"sang\" to me, it's really an amazing album, in my opinion. I think the song that really grabbed me on the first listen-through was \"You Ain't Alone\". It just sounds like something that could have been released decades ago, and was so good, that other artists picked it up to do cover itunes.
