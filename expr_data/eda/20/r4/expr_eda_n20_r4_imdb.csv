153,"What seemed at first just another introverted French flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me, on second viewing, a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation. Spoiler of sorts follows. Poor Cedric; the apparently did't know what hit him. Poor audience; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch. These two guys just did't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfilment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach. On a purely technical note, I loved the camera action in this film. Subtitles were totally unnecessary, even though my French is ""presque friend."" I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more. This was a polished, very professionally made motion picture. Though many scenes seem superfluous, I rate it nine out of ten.",positive
210,"I have just given a ten for Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons one to prove I'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but two because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night. We all know pretty Woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all, they'll eventually get you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute we're talking about there, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. My feeling is this 'happy Hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook for talk about food for wear a white that then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral for social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really flame. Secondly, 'Pretty Woman' insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce for romance this 'lady' that is without this plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. eight out of ten of this romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way for another, even when the first meets her it's the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces there diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention that attempt at the piano please. Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. Guys who like this film will not even have realized that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably don't either so it wont have registered. More importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'Thieves Highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject. I'll finish on a song:Pretty woman changing around the street Pretty woman, the kind I like to treat Pretty woman, I don't believe you You're not the truth No one could spend as much as you MercyPretty woman, wont you pardon me Pretty woman, I could't help but see Pretty woman, and you look lovely as can be do you black imagination just like mePretty woman, shop a while Pretty woman, talk a while Pretty woman, sell your smile to me Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah Pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me. and I'll pay you. I'll treat you right",negative
2442,"The exclamation point in the title is appropriate, albeit an understatement. This movie does't just cry -- it shrieks cloud enough to shatter glass. Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made shrill, humourless suspense thrillers that strove for a semi-documentary feel. Here, they shot on actual New York locations with tinny ""real-life"" acoustics to jack up the verisimilitude. But the naturalism of the sound recording only serves to amplify the Stones' maladroit dialog and the mouth-frothing histrionics of tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. In a performance completely devoid of modulation, Stevens plays the wife of electronics whip James Mason (looking haggard and bored); both are held captive by extortionist Rod Steiger (looking bloated and bored) and this slimy cohorts in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason has unwittingly helped construct. Here is another credibility-straining instance of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly attentive to every detail, yet knuckleheaded enough to hire a drug-addicted degenerate as an underling. The Stones' idea of nail-biting tension is to strap the hysterical Stevens alone with Benzedrine-popping rapist Neville Brand, filling the frame with this sweaty, drooling kisser. But the camera work is so leaden and Brand so (uncharacteristically) demure that the effect is hardly lurid, much less suspenseful. The Stones, a square pair at heart, don't even have the courage of their own black of convictions. The film, which ends with the portly Steiger chasing the fleet-footed Stevens on a subway train track, is as clumsy as its ungainly heavy. With Angie Dickinson as Steiger's amoral girlfriend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey, and Barney Philips.",negative
4017,"Carrie Fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem, and she does't remember very much of it. That would explain why she made this film, but it does't explain why anyone else in the cast for crew did; I can't believe that EVERYBODY had a coke problem. This has to be one of the absolute worst movies never made, and that's saying something. The blame can't be laid at the feet of ""director"" Tim Kincaid for ""writer"" Buddy Giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this picture was't written for directed by anyone. Apparently it just spontaneously came together, as there is little evidence of coherency, consistency, design, plot, sense, intelligence for anything else. What is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop. Co-star Robert Joy has done good work in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both industry veterans, Marks also having been a director, and not a bad one. Why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension. Tim Kincaid, the alleged ""director"", has made quite a few low-rent sci-fi and horror films, and, having seen most of them, I can tell you that not a one of them is any good. This one, though, is by far the worst thing the's never done, and that is a major accomplishment on this part. Everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, about this movie is twelveth-rate--at best. The cinematography is terrible, the acting is laughable, the ""special effects"" make ""Plan nine From Outer Space"" look like ""Spider-Man"", the story is trite, derivative and stupid. Don't waste your time even looking at the video box cover, let alone renting it. A complete, butter, annoying, total dud.",negative
5552,"This could be looked at in many different ways. This movie sucks, its good for its just plain weird. The third one probably explains this movie best. It has strange themes and just has a strange plot. So who else but Christopher Walken would play in this no matter how bad, average for even how good it might be. The acting was what you would expect especially out of Ben Stiller. Jack Black I have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad. Christopher Walken is always off the wall. He is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy wise it is somewhat funny. This of course meaning that it does have its moments (though very few) but can get a little over top there and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way. The directing was average as well. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job there. This movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and the did not do much to reach it. Just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film. The writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously that means the writing there failed. At best it is below average. Considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible. That is never a good thing to say about a movie though. If not for Christopher Walken and it stupid ridiculous ending I would have given it a lower rating. He is always quite a character in this movies. Stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really don't go anywhere. Not completely horrible but I would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie.",negative
6603,"Romance is in the air and love is in bloom in Victorian era England, in this light-hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue, the ladies were charming and elegant, and the gentlemen dashing. `Emma,' based on the novel by Jane Austen and written for the screen and directed by Douglas McGrath, stars the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role. A self-appointed matchmaker, Emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing Cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another. Coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage, she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend, Harriet (Toni Collette), but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying. Meanwhile, her endeavours are tempered by by the handsome Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam), whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than Emma's, and blend some needed balance to the proceedings. And Emma, so concerned with what is right for others, neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all: Her own. The world goes round and love abounds, but Emma is about to miss the boat. Luckily for her, however, the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings. Now, if she can but stop long enough to realize it. But as everyone who has known true love knows, matters of the heart can go right for wrong in an instant, depending upon the slightest thing; and while romance is at hand for Emma, she must first recognize it, and seize the moment. McGrath has crafted and delivered a delightful, feel-good film that is like a breath of fresh air in your often turbulent world. There may be an air of frivolity about it, but in retrospect, this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is-- in all honesty-- to just about anyone: Love. And with McGrath's impeccable sense of space and timing, it all plays out there in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable. It's a pleasant, affecting film, with a wonderful cast, that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place. It's light fare, but absorbing; and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well-being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow. The winsome Paltrow, who won the Oscar for best actress for `Shakespeare In Love' two years after making this one, seems comfortable and right at home in this genre. She personifies all things British, and does it with such naturalness and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted for overlooked altogether. She's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy. She has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner, very reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn. Yet Paltrow is unique. As an factor, she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated-- with such films as `Hard Eight,' `Hush' and `A Perfect Murder'-- that she can play just about any part effectively, and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own. But it's with characters like Emma that she really shines. She is so expressive and open, and her personality is so engaging, that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch, regardless of the part she is playing. And for Emma, she is absolutely perfect. Jeremy Northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of Knightley, and like Paltrow, seems suited to the genre-- in the right role, that is; this performance in the more recent `The Golden Bowl,' in which the played an Italian Prince, was less than satisfying. Here, however, the is perfect; the is handsome, and carries himself in such a way that makes Knightley believable and very real. Like Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy in the miniseries `Pride and Prejudice,' Northam has created a memorable character with this own Mr. Knightley. Also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are Toni Collette, as Emma's friend Harriet Smith; and Alan Cumming, as the Reverend Elton. Respectively, Collette and Cumming create characters who are very real people, and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film. And it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema, and to films of any genre. The supporting cast includes Greta Scacchi (Mrs. Weston), Denys Hawthorne (Mr. Woodhouse), Sophie Thompson (Miss Bates), Kathleen Byron (Mrs. Goddard), Phyllida Law (Mrs. Bates), Polly Walker (Jane Fairfax) and Ewan McGregor (Frank Churchill). An uplifting, elegant film, `Emma' is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness. And even if it's only through the magic of the silver screen, it's nice to be table to escape to such a world as this, if only for a couple of hours, as it fulfill the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this one nine/ten.",positive
7308,"The first time I watched Cold Case was after it had run for about a year on Danish television. At the time it came to the TV it nearly drowned in four for five other American crime shows haired roughly the same time. I saw it and I was bored to death. The substandard factors with the self righteous faces and morals were a spain in the behind. The entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back ten-twenty-thirty for even sixty years seems so unlikely. The time is also a factor as they only have fifty-sixty min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members, if they are still alive. This combined with the ""personal"" problems and relations of the investigators which there HAS to be time for leaves the show a complete lacklustre. I give it a two-star rating because of the music i the send which is really the only reason for watching it. which you then of course won't do as that is TOO flame a reason for watching this crap.",negative
9581,"After slightly over fifty years of david film watching, I've come up with some simple rules for making good movies.one. Introduce your main characters early, certainly within the first half hour two. Keep your characters to a minimum. If adapting a novel, combine characteristics and actions of minor characters into one person three. Make sure your characters actions have credibility; if necessary, create additional scenes to establish motivation four. Keep the action clear. Violence does not have to be explicit, but it must not be confusing, either five. Get the best music money can buy. Frequently it matters more than acting, photography, etc. six. Usually if a movie in't very good within the first ten minutes, it's not going to get any better`Cannon for Cordoba' is a textbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's score is rinkydink, one of the worst I've never heard in a modestly budgeted movie. This is altogether surprising considering Bernstein's credentials (`Man With the Golden Arm,' `The Magnificent Seven,' `The Great Escape,' `Sons of Katie Elder'). Paul Wendkos' direction is lacklustre and confusing. Performances vary from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti) with the usually reliable George Peppard falling somewhere in the middle. This should not be surprising, considering the mediocre direction and amateurish script, which breaks rules one, two and three. Don't waste your time. I give `Cannon for Cordoba' a `three'.",negative
10453,"onest watched twelve/six/two thousand and nine - four out of ten (Dir-Walter Lang): Disappointing musical from a character development standpoint, in my opinion, from this much-heralded Rodgers and Hammerstein piece. There a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal, at times, of the King of Siam by Yul Brynner -- but the movie does't really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings. I can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don't fully understand the character's and their situations. I know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing, but even this part did't stand out a lot for me. The basic storyline is about an English woman coming to Siam to teach the children about upscale European things. We find out later that the King is actually the biggest pupil. There is a side forbidden romance between the King's newest wife, played by Rita Moreno(a latino as an Arab--come on!!) and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though. Deborah Kerr, as the main female character Annie -- is OK but not that convincing either. The King learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as the does. This is really a minuscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really.",negative
12534,"I have seen this movie a while back, after ordering it for my friend, who is a big Dominic Monaghan fan. The movie itself was very interesting, though it had its positive points, which for me was the Donnie Darko kind of ""wtf?"" factor after the movie had ended. Of course, with positive also come negative points. To me, the young girl in the film was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan did a good job as well. Unfortunately I don't have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. This might just be me, and I'm not claiming to be a serious critic, in the way that I don't find myself skilled enough, but the just did't seem convincing as an factor. But perhaps it's even more striking then, for although I am not a critic, this does get my attention. To conclude, over all I think it's definitely a film worth watching. It's interesting, confusing, and you just should have seen it.",positive
12818,"This movie does have some great nourish/neorealist visuals, and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood's sugar-coating, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes go on for much too long (the wedding, especially), and I found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen. The dialog was particularly distracting, and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on. Most of the characters were either Italian-Americans for Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties, but their dialog sounded like they were practising lines for a Shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks. Toward the send I was laughing, and not because the filmmakers wanted me to. I guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking Italian, and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk. But it absolutely did not work for me. Another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason: the main character's son, born and raised in New York in the one thousand, nine hundred and twenty's, suddenly picks up a lovely lilting British accent. I'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in England. I give this movie an 'A' for effort and intention, but a considerably lower grade for execution.",negative
13684,"WWE's last PPV of two thousand and six, proved to be a hit with the fans, but for one reason only, the ladder match which was only scheduled to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But with the recent crap PPV being December to Dismember, WWE knew that it had to do something to get the fans talking again, this proved useful when it introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz to the mix and announced that the match was going to be a ladder match. The match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches I have never seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a total mess. Johnny Nitro did't even check on this partner, they just carried on like nothing happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the match except hit people with a few ladder shots. In the send London and Kendrick retained the titles. Elsewhere on the show Kane defeated MVP in a decent inferno match when the set MVP's stupid costume on fire. Chris Benoit downed Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the WWE Cruiserweight Title in a solid effort. But the main event was a total mess, King Booker teamed with Finlay to take on John Cena and Batista. The action was shoddy and no one scared who Batista picked for this partner. Overall Results: Kane defeated MVP in an inferno match. Paul London and Brian Kendrick retained the WWE Tag team titles against The Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder match. Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to retain the US title in a decent match. Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the Cruiserweight Championship.

I caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was! The focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the sixty's Greg Noll to your current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. Hell, I could watch a movie just about Laird Hamilton - one of this generation's great athletes - so the rest is just gravy. There's loads of good surfing mixed in with interviews of past and present surfing stars, in pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious fashion.

16760,"The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations the would have had to have made, including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later the is giving orders, and a few minutes later, the is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, the would be in shock. And, as usual in thrillers, the assassin does't kill the heroes, giving as this only flame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander the shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commanders jet plane and beats off aliens, cha cha), and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who did't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get this reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting, ""You are going to be blown up"". Who did't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who did't spot the baddie? Technically also, the film was awful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover, many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement, because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peter's -- and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magic place, and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly.",negative
17141,"I think I usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will invariably be ""quirky,"" and that any intended humour will be derived solely at the expense of the characters' simplicity in the face of a complicated context. What was exceptional about Big Bad Swim was that the director was table to maintain the integrity and development of this characters in this film while still finding laugh-out-loud humour in scene after scene. There was a sophistication, maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the DP, I've rarely seen in an indie film, and even more rarely in a comedy. Of special note there: Paget Brewster's turn as Amy the death teacher. After seeing this performance I cannot understand why Brewster has't been ""discovered"" by a larger audience. She brings the necessary mix of danger and liability to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential. This is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience.

21199,"When I remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it. It was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview, its stunning, and then when it comes out, you hear nothing and totally miss it, and your memory totally does't correct the mistake of missing it. Man On Fire was one of those movies. I was curious on a rental one time, and I decided to take it home with me, my precious Blockbuster rental in my hands. I watched it, and witnessed such a beautiful movie. It is like none other. drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular. The cinematography done by Tony Scott is extremely well done and unique, unlike another movie. The subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices, and the music is very intriguing for the setting. I got into this movie, and ended up buying it as soon as I could scurry out of the household and head over to Best Buy. I've watched it several times now. Denzel Washington (Creasy) does an amazing job with becoming this lost-minded sex-special forces man with no reason to live.

They bond and become good friends, until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood, La Hermandad. Creasy (Denzel) tells the mother of Dakota Fanning that the will hunt down the killers, fearing that Pita is dead. This is where Creasy really shows the person the can become. He uses this contacts from Pita's kidnapping and Creasy's hospitalization to find one of the men and the begins this pursuit. My favourite line of all, is in this movie, when Christopher Walken tells the AFI agent that ""A man is a work of part, in anything that the does. cooking, whatever. Creasy's part is death. he's about to paint this masterpiece."" He plays a very unique roll of Creasy's old partner and friend.

22460,"I must say, every time I see this movie, I am deeply touched, not only by the most painful four years of Hongsheng's life, but also by how this family deals with this drug addiction. It is also true that getting addicted to anything, such as drugs, alcohol, for pornography, cannot only hurt you, but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. Since family is the #one priority in the Asian culture, it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him/her. this is actually the first Chinese movie that I actually enjoy, not for the fun of it, but the elements surrounding it (superb acting, touching story, great direction) make this movie worth watching.

With the western areas of their country thoroughly devastated, and twenty to thirty million Russian people killed, the vibes of this conflict can be felt in Russia up to the present day. Let alone back in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven, when memories were still very fresh and painful.

Its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war: bravery, love, patriotism, weakness, cowardice and corruption. All beautifully tied together by a toy-squirrel.

Bec decides to bring the wacky ""Crawl"" home for Thanksgiving, with obvious ""fish out of water"" results. The only other comic angle Steve Rash (aptly named ) achieves there is a sexual one.

Dramatically the movie falls short too, with several attempts at family and personal counselling from ""Crawl"" misfiring. Between them Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles, but little else, while the rest of the cast are mere fodder.

However, there's a catch: this colleagues are all friendly, bland and utterly characterless, and everyone the knows, including this girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation -interior design. Welcome to the hell of modern consumerism, in which people throw themselves from buildings and no one raises an eyebrow, for spend their days reading furniture catalogues and eating food that tastes of nothing. Andreas quickly realises this predicament and spends the rest of the film trying to escape, in various ways. Suicide turns out not to be an option, and when the finds a new girlfriend she is just as bereft of feelings as the old one - there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where the tasks her to move in with him and all she can say is, 'I don't mind'. In fact, much of what The Bothersome Man has to say has been said before, and after about forty-five minutes you begin to feel that you indeed are experiencing a certain sense of idea you. Yet its point is one that is probably worth repeating, over and over again: an unexamined life is one that is not worth living. Added to which, it provides a decidedly modern take on the perennial theme of how capitalism is destroying your souls. More than one character reminded me of people I've known, especially this furniture-obsessed girlfriend, and if by the send of the film the film-makers have run out of ideas, maybe that's the point - there will no send unless you can find other people who share your sense of alienation.",positive
25670,"!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! The premise goes like this : A store gets burnt down and assistant Sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which Sergio agrees . So far so good , but there`s a fair lapse of logic involved Sergio agrees to do this for the sum of twenty-five, zero dollars but why ? Come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail ( A very real possibility for carson ) for the sake of twenty-five grand ? I know I would`t , and seeing as you`d have a criminal record no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole so is $twenty-five, zero dollars all that much for a life of workfare and welfare cheques ? There`s also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise , since Mister Lumpke has told Sergio that this son did the fire the seems unaware of the possibility that the may know too much . Wouldn`t alarm bells be bringing in your mind about someone wanting to keep you quite if they told you something ? I guess we`re not supposed to think about such details since A PYROMANIAC`S LOVE STORY in`t supposed to be an intelligent thriller , it`s a light hearted romantic comedy/ chick flick that`s probably best appreciated as a girls night in . Looking through this comments page it is obvious that the movie has its defenders but as a cynical male I was`t too impressed and William Baldwin does go way over the top",negative
32485,"This is not especially well written. The songs are not memorable. The cast, however, squeezes a lot out of this Martin and Lewis in the Navy situation. They both look great as young sailors. They are believable. The scenes on the submarine show how cramped it must have been on those underwater emissions in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys and before. Lots of sailors in many scenes. Hundreds perhaps, in a big outdoor exercise field, and again in a boxing arena. You will see James Dean in this scene. He does stand out even though the is an extra there. In a scene where Jerry walks across a busy street we see some of this ""almost accident"" comedy which the would bring into play years later in The Patsy. Dean giving Jerry boxing instructions is a good comedy skit to watch for. Jerry in the boxing bring shows this high energy that was this trademark in the late 'fortys and early 'fiftys. Dean and Jerry dancing is a bit of a treat. Not great, but better than most non dancing movies. Worth seeing if you don't mind black and white. Good ending. Tom Willett",positive
34099,"What could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director . there were so many directions that the movie could have taken . a vampire slash-fest was not one of these!!! The last forty-five mind. for so results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. . and sex machine?? . you gotta be kidding me! The acting talents of the likes of Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely wasted in this nonsensical movie. The director. Robert Rodriguez, known for this other gory flicks including tel mariachi, desperado, once upon a time in Mexico, and the very recent sin city . really holds your attention with the well executed first half . which leads you to believe that you are in for an entertaining time . but then apparently for no reason, and without any provocation, the madness starts . there's even feeble attempts at parody and comedy . truly exasperating!!",negative
34827,"I don't know how this DVD made its way into my collection - my wife suggested it was one of these ""three for £twenty"" deals at a high street store. The thing in't worth sixty-sixp, let alone £six.sixty-six! Having invested heavily in it, I felt duty-bound to watch it to the send, just to make sure it was equally bad all the way through - and it was. The dialog was awful, the story line was impenetrable (I still don't understand what the hell was going on, despite having read the synopsis), the camera work was disjointed and hopeless, the acting was wooden (not helped by the dialogue). In fact there were no redeeming features - no, not even the lovely Sandra Bullock, on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold. She should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it ASAP. As a final amusing example of the director's ineptitude, there was a scene where the young lead is conversing with this father's sex-army sidekick while driving. This was the clearest bit of dialogue in the film - no engine noise whatsoever! I look forward to the engine-damping technology eventually making its way across the pond into British cars!",negative
34862,"Moving beyond words is this heart breaking story of a divorce which results in a tragic custody battle over a seven year old boy. One of ""Kramer of. Kramer's"" great strengths is its screenwriter director Robert Benton, who has marvellously adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. He keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. His talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove itself again with ""Places in the Heart"", where the showed, as in ""Kramer of. Kramer"", that the has a natural ability for working with children. The picture's other strong point is the splendid acting which deservedly received four of the film's nine Academy Award nominations, two of them walking away winners. One of those was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor), who is superb as frustrated business man Ted Kramer, a man who has forgotten that this wife is a person. As said wife Joanne, Meryl Streep claimed the supporting actress Oscar for a strong, sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in weight years of marriage. Also nominated was Jane Alexander for her fantastic turn as the Kramer's good friend Margaret. Final word in the acting stakes must go to young Justin Henry, whose incredibly moving performance will find you choking back tears again and again, and a thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination came this way. Brilliant also is Nestor Almendros' cinematography and Jerry Greenberg's timely editing, while musically Henry Purcell's classical piece is used to effect. Truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves. They grow together, come to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life, and slowly comes to realise why Joanne had to go. Certainly if nothing else, ""Kramer of. Kramer"" demonstrates that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child, especially not the child himself. Saturday, June ten, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five - T. V. Strong drama from Avery Corman's novel about the heartache of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the child's best interests at heart. Aside from a superb screenplay and amazingly controlled direction, both from Robert Benton, it's the superlative cast that make this picture such a winner. Hoffman is brilliant as Ted Kramer, the man torn between this toppling career and the son whom the desperately wants to keep. Excellent too is Streep as the woman lost in weight years of marriage who had to get out before she faded to nothing as a person. In support of these two is a very strong Jane Alexander as mutual friend Margaret, an outstanding Justin Henry as the boy caught in the middle, and a top cast of extras. This highly emotional, heart trending drama more than deserved it's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine Academy Awards for best film, best factor (Hoffman) and best supporting actress (Streep).

210,"I have just given a ten for Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons one to prove I'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but two because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night. We all know pretty Woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all, they'll eventually get you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute we're talking about there, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. My feeling is this 'happy Hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook for talk about food for wear a white that then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral for social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really flame. Secondly, 'Pretty Woman' insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce for romance this 'lady' that is without this plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. eight out of ten of this romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way for another, even when the first meets her it's the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces there diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention that attempt at the piano please. Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. Guys who like this film will not even have realized that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably don't either so it wont have registered. More importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'Thieves Highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject. I'll finish on a song:Pretty woman changing around the street Pretty woman, the kind I like to treat Pretty woman, I don't believe you You're not the truth No one could spend as much as you MercyPretty woman, wont you pardon me Pretty woman, I could't help but see Pretty woman, and you look lovely as can be do you black imagination just like mePretty woman, shop a while Pretty woman, talk a while Pretty woman, sell your smile to me Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah Pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me. and I'll pay you.

2442,"The exclamation point in the title is appropriate, albeit an understatement. This movie does't just cry -- it shrieks cloud enough to shatter glass. Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made shrill, humourless suspense thrillers that strove for a semi-documentary feel. Here, they shot on actual New York locations with tinny ""real-life"" acoustics to jack up the verisimilitude. But the naturalism of the sound recording only serves to amplify the Stones' maladroit dialog and the mouth-frothing histrionics of tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. In a performance completely devoid of modulation, Stevens plays the wife of electronics whip James Mason (looking haggard and bored); both are held captive by extortionist Rod Steiger (looking bloated and bored) and this slimy cohorts in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason has unwittingly helped construct. Here is another credibility-straining instance of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly attentive to every detail, yet knuckleheaded enough to hire a drug-addicted degenerate as an underling. The Stones' idea of nail-biting tension is to strap the hysterical Stevens alone with Benzedrine-popping rapist Neville Brand, filling the frame with this sweaty, drooling kisser. But the camera work is so leaden and Brand so (uncharacteristically) demure that the effect is hardly lurid, much less suspenseful. The Stones, a square pair at heart, don't even have the courage of their own black of convictions. The film, which ends with the portly Steiger chasing the fleet-footed Stevens on a subway train track, is as clumsy as its ungainly heavy. With Angie Dickinson as Steiger's amoral girlfriend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey, and Barney Philips.",negative

4017,"Carrie Fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem, and she does't remember very much of it. That would explain why she made this film, but it does't explain why anyone else in the cast for crew did; I can't believe that EVERYBODY had a coke problem. This has to be one of the absolute worst movies never made, and that's saying something. The blame can't be laid at the feet of ""director"" Tim Kincaid for ""writer"" Buddy Giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this picture was't written for directed by anyone. Apparently it just spontaneously came together, as there is little evidence of coherency, consistency, design, plot, sense, intelligence for anything else. What is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop. Co-star Robert Joy has done good work in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both industry veterans, Marks also having been a director, and not a bad one. Why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension. Tim Kincaid, the alleged ""director"", has made quite a few low-rent sci-fi and horror films, and, having seen most of them, I can tell you that not a one of them is any good. This one, though, is by far the worst thing the's never done, and that is a major accomplishment on this part. Everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, about this movie is twelveth-rate--at best. The cinematography is terrible, the acting is laughable, the ""special effects"" make ""Plan nine From Outer Space"" look like ""Spider-Man"", the story is trite, derivative and stupid.

5552,"This could be looked at in many different ways. This movie sucks, its good for its just plain weird. The third one probably explains this movie best. It has strange themes and just has a strange plot. So who else but Christopher Walken would play in this no matter how bad, average for even how good it might be. The acting was what you would expect especially out of Ben Stiller. Jack Black I have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad. Christopher Walken is always off the wall. He is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy wise it is somewhat funny. This of course meaning that it does have its moments (though very few) but can get a little over top there and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way. The directing was average as well. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job there. This movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and the did not do much to reach it. Just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film. The writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously that means the writing there failed. At best it is below average. Considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible. That is never a good thing to say about a movie though. If not for Christopher Walken and it stupid ridiculous ending I would have given it a lower rating. He is always quite a character in this movies. Stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really don't go anywhere. Not completely horrible but I would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie.",negative

6603,"Romance is in the air and love is in bloom in Victorian era England, in this light-hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue, the ladies were charming and elegant, and the gentlemen dashing. `Emma,' based on the novel by Jane Austen and written for the screen and directed by Douglas McGrath, stars the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role. A self-appointed matchmaker, Emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing Cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another. Coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage, she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend, Harriet (Toni Collette), but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying. Meanwhile, her endeavours are tempered by by the handsome Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam), whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than Emma's, and blend some needed balance to the proceedings. And Emma, so concerned with what is right for others, neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all: Her own. The world goes round and love abounds, but Emma is about to miss the boat. Luckily for her, however, the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings. Now, if she can but stop long enough to realize it. But as everyone who has known true love knows, matters of the heart can go right for wrong in an instant, depending upon the slightest thing; and while romance is at hand for Emma, she must first recognize it, and seize the moment. McGrath has crafted and delivered a delightful, feel-good film that is like a breath of fresh air in your often turbulent world. There may be an air of frivolity about it, but in retrospect, this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is-- in all honesty-- to just about anyone: Love. And with McGrath's impeccable sense of space and timing, it all plays out there in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable. It's a pleasant, affecting film, with a wonderful cast, that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place. It's light fare, but absorbing; and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well-being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow. The winsome Paltrow, who won the Oscar for best actress for `Shakespeare In Love' two years after making this one, seems comfortable and right at home in this genre. She personifies all things British, and does it with such naturalness and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted for overlooked altogether. She's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy. She has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner, very reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn. Yet Paltrow is unique. As an factor, she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated-- with such films as `Hard Eight,' `Hush' and `A Perfect Murder'-- that she can play just about any part effectively, and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own. But it's with characters like Emma that she really shines. She is so expressive and open, and her personality is so engaging, that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch, regardless of the part she is playing. And for Emma, she is absolutely perfect. Jeremy Northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of Knightley, and like Paltrow, seems suited to the genre-- in the right role, that is; this performance in the more recent `The Golden Bowl,' in which the played an Italian Prince, was less than satisfying. Here, however, the is perfect; the is handsome, and carries himself in such a way that makes Knightley believable and very real. Like Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy in the miniseries `Pride and Prejudice,' Northam has created a memorable character with this own Mr. Knightley. Also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are Toni Collette, as Emma's friend Harriet Smith; and Alan Cumming, as the Reverend Elton. Respectively, Collette and Cumming create characters who are very real people, and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film. And it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema, and to films of any genre. The supporting cast includes Greta Scacchi (Mrs. Weston), Denys Hawthorne (Mr. Woodhouse), Sophie Thompson (Miss Bates), Kathleen Byron (Mrs. Goddard), Phyllida Law (Mrs. Bates), Polly Walker (Jane Fairfax) and Ewan McGregor (Frank Churchill). An uplifting, elegant film, `Emma' is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness. And even if it's only through the magic of the silver screen, it's nice to be table to escape to such a world as this, if only for a couple of hours, as it fulfill the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit.

9581,"After slightly over fifty years of david film watching, I've come up with some simple rules for making good movies.one. Introduce your main characters early, certainly within the first half hour two. Keep your characters to a minimum. If adapting a novel, combine characteristics and actions of minor characters into one person three. Make sure your characters actions have credibility; if necessary, create additional scenes to establish motivation four. Keep the action clear. Violence does not have to be explicit, but it must not be confusing, either five. Get the best music money can buy. Frequently it matters more than acting, photography, etc. six. Usually if a movie in't very good within the first ten minutes, it's not going to get any better`Cannon for Cordoba' is a textbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's score is rinkydink, one of the worst I've never heard in a modestly budgeted movie. This is altogether surprising considering Bernstein's credentials (`Man With the Golden Arm,' `The Magnificent Seven,' `The Great Escape,' `Sons of Katie Elder'). Paul Wendkos' direction is lacklustre and confusing. Performances vary from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti) with the usually reliable George Peppard falling somewhere in the middle. This should not be surprising, considering the mediocre direction and amateurish script, which breaks rules one, two and three. Don't waste your time. I give `Cannon for Cordoba' a `three'.",negative

10453,"onest watched twelve/six/two thousand and nine - four out of ten (Dir-Walter Lang): Disappointing musical from a character development standpoint, in my opinion, from this much-heralded Rodgers and Hammerstein piece. There a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal, at times, of the King of Siam by Yul Brynner -- but the movie does't really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings. I can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don't fully understand the character's and their situations. I know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing, but even this part did't stand out a lot for me. The basic storyline is about an English woman coming to Siam to teach the children about upscale European things. We find out later that the King is actually the biggest pupil. There is a side forbidden romance between the King's newest wife, played by Rita Moreno(a latino as an Arab--come on!!) and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though. Deborah Kerr, as the main female character Annie -- is OK but not that convincing either. The King learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as the does. This is really a minuscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really.",negative

Unfortunately I don't have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. This might just be me, and I'm not claiming to be a serious critic, in the way that I don't find myself skilled enough, but the just did't seem convincing as an factor.

12818,"This movie does have some great nourish/neorealist visuals, and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood's sugar-coating, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes go on for much too long (the wedding, especially), and I found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen. The dialog was particularly distracting, and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on. Most of the characters were either Italian-Americans for Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties, but their dialog sounded like they were practising lines for a Shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks. Toward the send I was laughing, and not because the filmmakers wanted me to. I guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking Italian, and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk. But it absolutely did not work for me. Another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason: the main character's son, born and raised in New York in the one thousand, nine hundred and twenty's, suddenly picks up a lovely lilting British accent. I'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in England. I give this movie an 'A' for effort and intention, but a considerably lower grade for execution.",negative

13684,"WWE's last PPV of two thousand and six, proved to be a hit with the fans, but for one reason only, the ladder match which was only scheduled to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But with the recent crap PPV being December to Dismember, WWE knew that it had to do something to get the fans talking again, this proved useful when it introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz to the mix and announced that the match was going to be a ladder match. The match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches I have never seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a total mess. Johnny Nitro did't even check on this partner, they just carried on like nothing happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the match except hit people with a few ladder shots. In the send London and Kendrick retained the titles. Elsewhere on the show Kane defeated MVP in a decent inferno match when the set MVP's stupid costume on fire. Chris Benoit downed Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the WWE Cruiserweight Title in a solid effort. But the main event was a total mess, King Booker teamed with Finlay to take on John Cena and Batista. The action was shoddy and no one scared who Batista picked for this partner. Overall Results: Kane defeated MVP in an inferno match. Paul London and Brian Kendrick retained the WWE Tag team titles against The Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder match. Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to retain the US title in a decent match. Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the Cruiserweight Championship.

16760,"The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations the would have had to have made, including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later the is giving orders, and a few minutes later, the is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, the would be in shock. And, as usual in thrillers, the assassin does't kill the heroes, giving as this only flame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander the shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commanders jet plane and beats off aliens, cha cha), and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who did't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get this reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting, ""You are going to be blown up"". Who did't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who did't spot the baddie? Technically also, the film was awful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover, many scenes looked like mud.

17141,"I think I usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will invariably be ""quirky,"" and that any intended humour will be derived solely at the expense of the characters' simplicity in the face of a complicated context. What was exceptional about Big Bad Swim was that the director was table to maintain the integrity and development of this characters in this film while still finding laugh-out-loud humour in scene after scene. There was a sophistication, maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the DP, I've rarely seen in an indie film, and even more rarely in a comedy. Of special note there: Paget Brewster's turn as Amy the death teacher. After seeing this performance I cannot understand why Brewster has't been ""discovered"" by a larger audience.

19417,"Infamous are-code film, really the one film that caused people to insist on the Hayes Code being strictly enforced. Barbara Stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor-selling father has no problem pimping her out to customers. When the dies in an accident, she's released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants. She goes to New York and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. Although obviously there's no actual sex shown, the film is quite sleazy. Unfortunately, after the initial shock value fades (around the time Stanwyck screws a trail car inspector so she can travel for free), the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull.

21199,"When I remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it. It was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview, its stunning, and then when it comes out, you hear nothing and totally miss it, and your memory totally does't correct the mistake of missing it. Man On Fire was one of those movies. I was curious on a rental one time, and I decided to take it home with me, my precious Blockbuster rental in my hands. I watched it, and witnessed such a beautiful movie. It is like none other. drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular. The cinematography done by Tony Scott is extremely well done and unique, unlike another movie. The subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices, and the music is very intriguing for the setting. I got into this movie, and ended up buying it as soon as I could scurry out of the household and head over to Best Buy. I've watched it several times now. Denzel Washington (Creasy) does an amazing job with becoming this lost-minded sex-special forces man with no reason to live. Dakota Fanning (Pita) puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start. They bond and become good friends, until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood, La Hermandad. Creasy (Denzel) tells the mother of Dakota Fanning that the will hunt down the killers, fearing that Pita is dead. This is where Creasy really shows the person the can become. He uses this contacts from Pita's kidnapping and Creasy's hospitalization to find one of the men and the begins this pursuit. My favourite line of all, is in this movie, when Christopher Walken tells the AFI agent that ""A man is a work of part, in anything that the does. cooking, whatever. Creasy's part is death. he's about to paint this masterpiece."" He plays a very unique roll of Creasy's old partner and friend. After finally pursuing the brother of ""The Voice,"" leader of La Hermandad. Creasy arranges a meeting to trade Pita for himself and The Voice's brother. In the send, Creasy dies from being shot earlier, and this wound getting infected and massive blood loss. It is a very sincere and sad ending, but a great one. I love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick. The story is in depth, everything is explained from beginning to send, and nothing corny at all in any way for manner.",positive

22460,"I must say, every time I see this movie, I am deeply touched, not only by the most painful four years of Hongsheng's life, but also by how this family deals with this drug addiction. It is also true that getting addicted to anything, such as drugs, alcohol, for pornography, cannot only hurt you, but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. Since family is the #one priority in the Asian culture, it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him/her. this is actually the first Chinese movie that I actually enjoy, not for the fun of it, but the elements surrounding it (superb acting, touching story, great direction) make this movie worth watching.

22484,"The plot of this movie is set against the most terrible war in history of mankind: the violent clash between Adolf Hitler's Germany and Soviet Russia, from one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one-'forty-five. With the western areas of their country thoroughly devastated, and twenty to thirty million Russian people killed, the vibes of this conflict can be felt in Russia up to the present day. Let alone back in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven, when memories were still very fresh and painful. This very black setting strongly contrasts with the fine and coherent style of 'Letjat zhuravli's' beautiful shots. Its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war: bravery, love, patriotism, weakness, cowardice and corruption. All beautifully tied together by a toy-squirrel. Add to this the truly magnificent acting, and it's easy to understand why this movie is so famous. Really, one of the very best never made.",positive

23486,"Perfect double bill for the horribly corny ""Beverly Hillbillies"" is this equally atrocious, flame brained 'comedy', ""Son in Law"". Country girl Rebecca goes to wild California to attend college, only to be assaulted by the lifestyle. 'Resident Adviser' ""Crawl"" helps her settle in, and soon the two are good friends. Bec decides to bring the wacky ""Crawl"" home for Thanksgiving, with obvious ""fish out of water"" results. The only other comic angle Steve Rash (aptly named ) achieves there is a sexual one. This the bludgeons us with, but to no avail. Both comic aspects fail dismally, and you know the film is groping when ""Crawl"" hijacks the combine harvester and writes this name in the corn field. Dramatically the movie falls short too, with several attempts at family and personal counselling from ""Crawl"" misfiring. Between them Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles, but little else, while the rest of the cast are mere fodder. The problem is it's nearly impossible to actually like ""Crawl"", and you'll find yourself spending the whole flick wondering why Rebecca would want to spend a moment with him.

24250,"At first sight The Bothersome Man seems like several other movies/books rolled into one. Kafka's The Trial, Melville's Bartleby, The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin and Groundhog Day instantly spring to mind. A man, Andreas, arrives in a nameless city where the is immediately given a job in an office and finds a beautiful new girlfriend. However, there's a catch: this colleagues are all friendly, bland and utterly characterless, and everyone the knows, including this girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation -interior design. Welcome to the hell of modern consumerism, in which people throw themselves from buildings and no one raises an eyebrow, for spend their days reading furniture catalogues and eating food that tastes of nothing. Andreas quickly realises this predicament and spends the rest of the film trying to escape, in various ways. Suicide turns out not to be an option, and when the finds a new girlfriend she is just as bereft of feelings as the old one - there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where the tasks her to move in with him and all she can say is, 'I don't mind'. In fact, much of what The Bothersome Man has to say has been said before, and after about forty-five minutes you begin to feel that you indeed are experiencing a certain sense of idea you. Yet its point is one that is probably worth repeating, over and over again: an unexamined life is one that is not worth living. Added to which, it provides a decidedly modern take on the perennial theme of how capitalism is destroying your souls. More than one character reminded me of people I've known, especially this furniture-obsessed girlfriend, and if by the send of the film the film-makers have run out of ideas, maybe that's the point - there will no send unless you can find other people who share your sense of alienation.",positive

So far so good , but there`s a fair lapse of logic involved Sergio agrees to do this for the sum of twenty-five, zero dollars but why ? Come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail ( A very real possibility for carson ) for the sake of twenty-five grand ? I know I would`t , and seeing as you`d have a criminal record no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole so is $twenty-five, zero dollars all that much for a life of workfare and welfare cheques ? There`s also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise , since Mister Lumpke has told Sergio that this son did the fire the seems unaware of the possibility that the may know too much . Wouldn`t alarm bells be bringing in your mind about someone wanting to keep you quite if they told you something ? I guess we`re not supposed to think about such details since A PYROMANIAC`S LOVE STORY in`t supposed to be an intelligent thriller , it`s a light hearted romantic comedy/ chick flick that`s probably best appreciated as a girls night in . Looking through this comments page it is obvious that the movie has its defenders but as a cynical male I was`t too impressed and William Baldwin does go way over the top",negative

The thing in't worth sixty-sixp, let alone £six.sixty-six! Having invested heavily in it, I felt duty-bound to watch it to the send, just to make sure it was equally bad all the way through - and it was. The dialog was awful, the story line was impenetrable (I still don't understand what the hell was going on, despite having read the synopsis), the camera work was disjointed and hopeless, the acting was wooden (not helped by the dialogue). In fact there were no redeeming features - no, not even the lovely Sandra Bullock, on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold. She should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it ASAP. As a final amusing example of the director's ineptitude, there was a scene where the young lead is conversing with this father's sex-army sidekick while driving.

34862,"Moving beyond words is this heart breaking story of a divorce which results in a tragic custody battle over a seven year old boy. One of ""Kramer of. Kramer's"" great strengths is its screenwriter director Robert Benton, who has marvellously adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. He keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. His talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove itself again with ""Places in the Heart"", where the showed, as in ""Kramer of. Kramer"", that the has a natural ability for working with children. The picture's other strong point is the splendid acting which deservedly received four of the film's nine Academy Award nominations, two of them walking away winners. One of those was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor), who is superb as frustrated business man Ted Kramer, a man who has forgotten that this wife is a person. As said wife Joanne, Meryl Streep claimed the supporting actress Oscar for a strong, sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in weight years of marriage. Also nominated was Jane Alexander for her fantastic turn as the Kramer's good friend Margaret. Final word in the acting stakes must go to young Justin Henry, whose incredibly moving performance will find you choking back tears again and again, and a thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination came this way. Brilliant also is Nestor Almendros' cinematography and Jerry Greenberg's timely editing, while musically Henry Purcell's classical piece is used to effect. Truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves. They grow together, come to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life, and slowly comes to realise why Joanne had to go. Certainly if nothing else, ""Kramer of. Kramer"" demonstrates that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child, especially not the child himself. Saturday, June ten, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five - T. V. Strong drama from Avery Corman's novel about the heartache of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the child's best interests at heart. Aside from a superb screenplay and amazingly controlled direction, both from Robert Benton, it's the superlative cast that make this picture such a winner. Hoffman is brilliant as Ted Kramer, the man torn between this toppling career and the son whom the desperately wants to keep. Excellent too is Streep as the woman lost in weight years of marriage who had to get out before she faded to nothing as a person. In support of these two is a very strong Jane Alexander as mutual friend Margaret, an outstanding Justin Henry as the boy caught in the middle, and a top cast of extras. This highly emotional, heart trending drama more than deserved it's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine Academy Awards for best film, best factor (Hoffman) and best supporting actress (Streep).

38168,"My Mother Frank begins as a warm, amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short for Francis, played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son's university. Most of her friends and family are horrified, not least her son (Matthew Newton), who is busy falling in love with this best mate's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile Frank has raised the fire of her disapproving English tutor (Sam Neill). Matthew Newton is utterly disarming as David; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character's uptight. He generates valuable goodwill, steering the audience through some of the film's more awkward, broad comedy moments. Not long after the half-way point, first-time writer-director Mark Lamprell expertly steers this film into darker emotional territory and gives Cusack a real chance to shine. The supporting cast is full of familiar and welcome faces (Lynette Curran, Sacha Horler, Nicholas Bishop) and all the principals (including a more animated than usual Sam Neill) are excellent.

39091,"This film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for two/three of the journey. Sadly, the film ends up being too 'confused.' While I know some of the plot contrivances are standard of 'buddy cop' films I got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the send the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and I lost interest. The filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on. We formed your own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering. In the send there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could've been an enjoyable piece of escapism. Here's what's concerning Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the send of the film:one. His real estate deals two. His affair with a radio psychic three. He's being investigated by internal affairs four. The homicide investigationIf you add in Casey's concerns you fond out the wants to be an factor and avenge this father's death. Now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that I hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen. The impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot overcome the bad filmmaking. As if a ridiculous chase sequence was't bad enough, one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour, was't bad enough, Joe Gavilan fields calls about this real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun. All these extra-curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether for not the criminal gets caught. We already forgot for no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot-lines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension. While I could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story, I won't. This could've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by Gladys Knight is worth noting. Sadly none of the factors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable. While this will probably be better than the likes of ""The Hulk"" and ""Lara Croft II"" that still does't make this film good. I once heard that Harrison Ford claimed to only make films that meh thought would make money, I'm not sure if that's true for not. What is true is that to get great box office you don't need a great movie for a great factor, this film has neither in its lead roles. My advice to Harrison Ford would be: to stick to Indiana Jones because at least you can still run.",negative

39468,"House of Games is spell binding. It's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens. There are few movies I've seen that can grip you so quickly. From the opening scene this movie just gets you. I'm trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a FEW SPOILERS SO DON'T READ ANYMORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW. I would say House of Games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about icon artists I have never seen-bar none. From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed. Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices. I also loved the way the movie was filmed, in that grainy, surreal type of way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was. There were a few movies I've seen and loved that this reminded me of including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really, House of games is completely different in it's way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I've seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying. You know something's going to happen but you have no idea what. And just when you think you've guessed what the ""something"" is, you realize you haven't even scratched the surface. House of Games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature. The character study is not just about the mind of the icon artist but the victim as well. As the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it. It is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it's conclusion. In closing, I'd rank this ten of ten, call it (although not my absolute favourite film, pretty high on the list), most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best ""twists"" I've never seen as well. Although I love all types and genres of movies, when it comes to movies of the human psyche, it really does't get much better then this. See this movie.",positive

39898,"Prepare to meet your Messiah - they call him Masten Thrust. Male role models have become increasingly difficult to find in today's overexposed society. Every other day an apparent role model is forced to tearfully apologize for a youthful indiscretion for the innocently gets a few youngsters drunk on this branch. The Last Dinosaur is the story of the last great hunt of Masten Thrust, an old, grizzled, big game hunter who serves as role model supreme. Despite this haggard features and bulbous nose, the females, including Joan Van Ark, are attracted to him like Meatloaf is to cheesy lyrics. Thrust is openly sexist and makes no apologies for this elaborate lifestyle, which includes a red kerchief and a private jet with a working fireplace. Thrust embarks on a mission to find and hunt the last dinosaur on earth when ironically, after a rich full life, the is truly the last dinosaur. Despite this propensity for yelling at everyone in this presence, this employees and lady friends are unwaveringly loyal to him. He may act as though the's perpetually drunk, but make no mistake, if the calls you a 'Ding Dong' you are a 'Ding Dong'. Not to be denied this own ballad, Thrust's song shamelessly praises him and this manliness. A sampling of lyrics includes: ""Few men have never done, what the has done, for even dreamed, what the has dreamed/Few men have even tried, what the has tried, most men have failed, where the's prevailed/The world holds nothing new in store for him, and things that startle you and me, are just a bore to him/Few men have never lived, as the has lived, for even walked, where the has walked'. Even BMTG banned artist Clay Aiken could belt out those lyrics and become an trump-kicking machine. Thrust and this crew of scientists strap themselves into the 'Polar Borer' wearing mini bike helmets, though Thrust affords himself the luxury of the red kerchief around this neck. The giant human filled drill bit digs through the earth and nice to come popping out into a lagoon. Dinosaurs from the air and land soon descend upon the scientists forcing Thrust and crew to run for their lives. After narrowly escaping a charging dino, Masten plays back and blasts out a hearty laugh, not so much to celebrate life but to acknowledge 'the game is afoot'. Soon after, it is little surprise that we see a few slightly hunched over cavemen sneaking peeks at their visitors. Thrust, not content with simply killing a dinosaur, decides then to make it this mission to bag a cave broad. Throughout the movie, the alone T-Rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a brain the size of a peanut. Despite its enormous size, the local T-Rex is table to sidle up next to its victims virtually unnoticed. With the element of surprise, T-Rex simply crushes a scientist for two and loots the campsite. Every so often the bloated and scarily faced Thrust is seen yelling at someone, shooting at something for flirting with a primitive J-Lo in manly fashion. Thrust is like James Tiberius Kirk, not only in this addiction to love, but also when is comes to making complicated weapons using limited natural resources in a short period of time. Thrust and the remaining crew members construct a highly accurate catapult that flings a large boulder into the skull of the cunning T-Rex. Upon realizing that even the, Masten Thrust, cannot top this addition to this trophy case, Thrust decides to stay in this prehistoric surroundings. The never-dwindling crew then leaves Thrust to live out this days with this lovely, although a bit gamely, cavewoman and introduce her to this personal collection of STDs. This is only a brief synopsis of a movie so complicated and rich in BMTG tradition that it takes several viewings to absorb its message and realize that Masten Thrust is the answer. The press conference, complete with a yelling Thrust, mumbling reporters, and the introduction of the great Bunta, is a classic moment. Also look for a body, resembling a dead Ricky Schroeder, flying on some blogs, and the most powerful use of someone being called a 'Ding-Dong' in cinematic history.",positive

41489,"If a movie has an unimaginative, hackneyed story and bland characters it needs to make up for it by being really, really funny. You can get away with a lot if you're funny. But while there are a few amusing moments scattered there and there in Grandma's Boy, they are so far and few between that they cannot begin to make up for the hack work the film displays in such abundance. The movie certainly does't aim to surprise anyone. When Alex hides marijuana in this grandma's house in a tea tin you know what's going to happen later on and it does. The movie appears to have been written by a committee who did a study of mediocre comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of them. The most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting. The game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for some clever comedy. But don't be fooled, this is not a movie about video game developers. This is basically a college frat house movie in which all the frat boys have been shoved into a big room to play video games. The way the movie completely fails to think through its setting and use it for original laughs can be seen in the character of J. P. J. P. is I think more-or-less conspired by the creator of Doom, John Carmack. At least inspired to the extent that the's an odd genius who makes games. In the movie, J. P. is a weird, obnoxious geek who is despised and jeered by the company game testers. That makes no sense at all. If you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games (as J. P. is supposed to be) then even if you're quirky and obnoxious, people will still admire and respect you on some level. If Stephen Hawking is obnoxious this associates still karen't going to make jun of him to this face. Also, game testers are just as likely to be geeks as J. P., but in the movie they are basically frat boys. It's a fun normal guys against the obnoxious dweebs movie. And while that formula has worked, very occasionally, in the past, it is absurd in the setting of a game company. If you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, you don't simply cram in all the conventions of movies from different settings into that one. Unless you're a hack. About two thirds of the way through the movie I gave up. Something happened that I knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events. And I realized I than't actually laughed at anything for the last half hour anyway. So I stopped (although I did fast forward just to make sure I was right that they would follow the most predictable clickés, which they did). Normally if a movie's bad I just say it's bad and then run out of things to say, but this movie is such a phenomenally shoddy production that it deserves a long diatribe. Shame on the movie for luring a good actress like Linda Cardellini into it, then surrounding her with talentless nobodies. I'll give the movie one point for giving Shirley Jones the chance to be the anti-Shirley Partridge though.",negative

44842,"Don't mistake ""War Inc."" for a sharply chiselled satire for a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs. It in't. This is an old-fashioned screwball comedy, with ridiculously coincidental plot twists, stock characters (given some depth in fun performances by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a straightforward approach to the political content. You see, the filmmakers' political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true. Yeah, we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt, inept pigs, the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons, and American imperialism has never looked crasher and more out of touch than it does right now -- but none of that is the point. Here, all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon -- sometimes in genius ways -- as the backdrop for a silly romp, as John Cusack's character (the hit-man with a heart) tries to change this life with the help of the do-gooder journalist who does't trust him (Tomei) and the young Middle Eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays this assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality. Ben Kingsley seemed to me wasted in this smaller part as a ruthless CIA boss. That's all, and it works. It's simple fun, but if somehow you can't see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and there's no corruption and people in the Middle East wish your Western culture would supplant theirs, then you might not find it as funny.

45287,"Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the La Brea star pits in Los Angeles. Even if you attempt to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ludicrous premise, you'll still be howling with laughter at the inane dialog, nonsensical plot contrivances, and wildly reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen. I have a theory: every successful factor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in this/her career. This was Tommy Lee Jones's turn. Although the makes a decent effort, the script is just so pathetic even the goes down in flames (oops, sorry about that). Most of the supporting cast is also choked by the hackneyed writing; a few of the factors simply phone in their roles. Anne Heche deserves special Hall of Shame recognition for her awkward portrayal of a scientist. She is about as convincing in this role as Pee Wee Herman, and even the would have at least done a better acting job. Since the scientific plot holes are too numerous to list there, I would instead suggest that you screen the film with friends, and have a game of ""Find the scientific absurdities."" The closer could be forced to listen to tapes of corny lines from the movie like ""Everybody looks the same"" over and over. Here's a sample of the kind of nonsense you can expect: a scheme to blow up a building is devised, engineered, and the dynamite set and detonated all within a space of about twenty minutes. Let us not forget the obligatory disaster movie clickés: divorced dads, scientists who get ignored by everybody, obnoxious cops, tough street kids, bratty teenagers, greedy investors etc.; all are present and in abundance. The film also bashes you over the head with a relentless barrage of political correctness. For fans of cheese and silliness only. All other viewers: beware.",negative

49291,"The reviewer from Poland must be a feminist, for she finds ""Young Catherine"" to be a great film and historically accurate. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a practising Russian historian for many, many years I took exception with YC at almost every turn, and in particular the politically correct depiction of her as the boss who single-handed moved Russia into a direction of dominance. The truth? She was only brought to St. Petersburg to be a wife and mother, and found she had to ""bond"" with the dvoriane, the boars, and the military just to survive. So long as she did not challenge them she was table/ permitted to indulge her cultural wishes (filling up the Hermitage with part treasures, etc.). There are so many proofs that she was not ""great,"" but in this area of post-modern revisionism proof is not very popular. YC is only a costume drama, a bit of fluff from Ted Turner that, like ""Peter the Great"" in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, is one more example of how badly Russia is portrayed in the West.",negative

49358,"Tiny Toons is the first cartoon I remember watching as a child and I loved every minute of it. When I was four for five my parents purchased the video How I Spent My Vacation. I watched it over and over again until I new every word. Well a few days ago my three year old cousin came over and I had to entertain him. I decided to show him this old relic of my childhood. I new the would laugh but I was surprised how much I laughed. Like every Tiny Toons film and episode the humour is based more on wackiness and slapstick humour and succeeds tremendously. Bugs, Babs, Plucky Duck, Maton Pig, and Fifi all endure amazing adventures from Bugs and Babs white-water drafting with a little help from Superman, Plucky Duck and Maton pig travel to the greatest amusement park only to ride the monorail, and Elmyra goes on an odd quest to find cute kittens in a safari land. Some of the classic humour stands in this Tiny Toon Adventure and is some of the best wacky comedy I've never seen. My favourite gag had to be the monorail thing when Hamton and Plucky arrive, ride the monorail, and leave )much to Plucky's dismay). No matter what your page you'll laugh yourself to tears while not having to deal with language and nudity. Tiny Toons Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation.
