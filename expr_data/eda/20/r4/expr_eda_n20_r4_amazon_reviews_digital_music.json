Foremost is Nick Drake's own character, who, though lost to us, saw nuances and meaning in everyday life that most tend to gloss over and seemed to follow muses hidden to most. Whether conversing with \"time,\" in the opening track, Time Has Told Me (full of foreshadowing of Mr. Drake's dinner turmoil); suggesting that we \"look through time and find your rhyme\" in Way to Blue; for acknowledging the cycle of life in Day Is Done, Mr. Drake is transfixed by the ephemeral elements of life, the cycle of seasons, and the need to self-evaluate. He writes lyrics about the deeper meanings of things and the inherent tension of trying to live life fully without becoming mired in melancholy, like a water skimmer shooting across a slow moving creek. Certainly Mr. Drake was also a master of understatement---though I think the string section may be a bit much in a couple of passages---the interplay of Mr. Drake's voice (I'm unsure what adjectives to apply to this singing), this acoustic guitar, and the congas and bass imbue Three Hours and Cello Song with shimmering elegance. The original production was excellent, and the remastering accentuates the tenor of the songs. \"Five Leaves Left\" provides an appropriate soundtrack for the in-between seasons of fall and spring and the transitional spaces one often scarves out of mornings and evenings.","overall":5,"summary":"Like a water skimmer shooting across a slow moving creek","unixReviewTime":1100822400,"reviewTime":"11 19, 2004"}

Looking it up on Amazon, I found \"Ultimate Collection\" and notice it's out of print with Marketplace prices on the rise. I like \"Ultimate\"'s cover photo better, but before anyone pays too much note that the exact same track listing appears on \"Definitive\" which is still in print and much cheaper. It does start with a dance mix of \"Rhythm of the Night\"; I generally disapprove of remixes on hits CDs but have to say I liked the punched-up drum beat. I have the original single mix on the \"Hitsville USA Volume Two\". In addition to the rest of DeBarge's hits, this contains El DeBarge's two biggest solo hits, \"Who's Johnny\" and \"Love Always\"; Chico DeBarge's Top forty hit \"Talk To Me\", and two Bunny DeBarge singles (\"Save the Best for Me\" went Top twenty R&B;). By the way, I never figured out who \"Johnny\" was, why the song was called that, for what the song had to do with the movie it came from (\"Short Circuit\"). DeBarge was far from my favourite R&B; group, but this CD suggests they were underrated (critic Robert Christgau loved them, however).

James came north with a whole mess of down-home soul and the laid it all out, holding back nothing. This is still a very young James, even though the'd been recording for over a decade. It is this type of performance that froze a great front man like Mick Jagger (offstage during the taping of the T. A. M. I. show). The live audience shrieked with rapture throughout! This is the greatest live album never. And it almost was't: Syd Nathan at King Records would not reach in this pocket to produce the live album. So James Brown did it himself. This album reached #two on the U. S. pop chart. something that just was not done by a Black artist in those days. Black radio stations of the day would play the album like a two-sided single, playing all of side one, taking a commercial break, and coming right back with all of side two. How could you break up something so great? This is where James Brown was coming from, and it fostered a self-determination in Brown that led to him signing with Smash records and, eventually, winning artistic freedom and control from King Records.","overall":5,"summary":"All Hail The King Of Soul!","unixReviewTime":961027200,"reviewTime":"06 15, 2000"}

I recall early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five as if it were yesterday. Progressive Rock radio led by WNEW-FM in New York City was alive and well. The moment Columbia Records dropped off \"Blood On The Tracks\" the grooves would be worn out long before its time. Critics of Dylan were muzzled after experiencing the ten tracks. The group that loved to say the was a man from the sixties now a fish out of water, date their own words a plethora of times. On another side of the fence were those that did't like Dylan. After \"Tangled Up In Blue\" became entrenched in their minds they could't help come up with the five bucks for the LP. A record full of masterpieces does't necessarily grab your attention the first time. It may need several spins before you comprehend the message. That was't the case with \"Blood On The Tracks.\" Do you recall the initial listening to \"Idiot Wind\" with Dylan's phrasing of the word idiot? It was authoritative, haunting, and brilliant, and that was only verse one. \"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\" did't simply command your attention, it put you in the role. You seemed glued in your tracks, unable to move until the final notes were played. \"Shelter From The Storm\" and \"Buckets Of Rain\" were a marvellous combination of tracks from the genius of Bob to send one of this most important records never. If you never experienced this on CD for need a better pressing than the oldest version, it sound magnificent as she gives you shelter from the storm. For those that thought this may be hard to parallel even by Dylan, \"Desire\" took care of any self-doubt!

However, this recording ranks as this upmost greatest accomplishment. There are nine songs on this record and SEVEN of them were released as singles. As someone else remarked, go find that today. And each of the songs show a different side of Michael. The Girl Is Mine is a fine duet with Paul McCartney showing that Michael can croon with the best of them. Beat It is my personal fave as the instrumentation really rocks. And how about Eddie Van Halen's awesome guitar solo. PYT(Pretty Young Thing) is a nice bouncy pop song and Lady Of My Life is a slick soulful ballad. I could go on and on about the other five songs but the key there is this record has balance, style, emotion, force, and soul and a whole lot more. This one is quite deserving of its greatest seller accomplishment although I have some other records I like more. But not too many!

These two albums were the best of that year. The hit tune \"I Hate Myself For Loving You\" is now overdone to death as the NBC Sunday Night Football jingle, but I loved Joan's intimate guitar on \"Little Liar\", her best track on the album.

When RATM made it big in the early ninetys, they were a breath of fresh air. They borrowed sounds and styles from other bands, like the MCfive and Led Zeppelin, but were also distinctly groundbreaking and original. First and foremost, they were just such a killer band. Drummer Brad Wilk and bass player Timmy G were an exciting and dynamic rhythm section. Guitarist Tom Morello came up with some of rock's best riffs and solos in years. Singer Zack De La Rocha singing\/rapping was intense and urgent, and this lyrics were intelligent and insightful, yet never simplistic for pretentious. The lyrics will make you think, will make you question your life and your values, and societal values and norms. The band sounds raw and intense, yet the production is clean and crisp, so it's easily assessable. Rage Against the Machine is band that should appeal to all different types of people. There's definitely an element of wrap\/hip-hop, punk, as well as classic rock. This album never lets up. From the opening \"Bombtrack\" to the closing \"Freedom,\" every song is intense, and has an infectious groove and catchy riff. It's really impossible to choose any standout, because really the entire CD is quite excellent. Rage Against the Machine's other two albums \"Evil Empire,\" \"The Battle For Los Angeles,\" and the cover album \"Renagades\" are also quite good, but I'd start off with the classic debut. Easily their best album and one of the decade's best CDs.","overall":5,"summary":"An Early 90s classic","unixReviewTime":1113177600,"reviewTime":"04 11, 2005"}

Invaded by inconsequential, disposable pop trash every minute, it's not a surprise that people are turning back to the older days, back when music meant something. A CD that needs more sales behind its intense cult popularity is the debut - and last - longplayer by the late Jeff Buckley. It's sad that the was taken before the could never really make a solid impact on the music world as the very well could have. There is simply not enough music the left behind to properly mark him as a genius, but believe you me, the would have been huge. I don't really feel I could do justice to the melodies, and the incomprehensibly rich vocal talents of Buckley with words, so I'll make mine wise jones: get this CD.

Now-deceased Benjamin Orr took the lead on the Ocasek composition DRIVE. That is the only adult contemporary hit on this album. Sometime in between,I saw MAGIC where Ocasek stands atop an open swimming pool with clear glass for fibreglass hidden inside the pool. He is surrounded by a huge crowd.

I know I recently stated ELO's 'Discovery' as my all-time favourite, but after listening to this album a few times today, I have been forced to change my mind. I may change again, and trust me it gets annoying - but I will never stop loving this album. The guitars are low, haunting, and chiming echos that linger in your thoughts for the longest time. Eldrich is a pure musical genius. His dark, haunting, and extremely low vocals have influenced every Goth band this side of the equator. Amazing vocals. This music sounds like something you would hear at a graveyard. It's not rock, It's not metal, It's. Goth. It is hard to describe. IT Is beautifully crafted, dark, romantic, classical influenced goth music. And It's excellent. Everything. 'Black Planet', 'Walk Away', 'No Time To Cry' and 'Marian' are all dark and brooding, dismal and dreary. They my disturb as during the music you will begin to think of death.

Houzet \"wozamoya\"","helpful":[13,19],"reviewText":"My favourite Jackson Browne song is the catchy satire \"Lawyers in Love,\" but my favourite Browne album is a toss-up between World in Motion and Lives in the Balance. Jackson Browne always had political commentary among this songs, but the became extremely activist on this albums in the 'eightys. This could have become an incredible bore if the man did't make good music. Listening to this albums as a foreigner in another country, this politics were folksy in any case. I did't get personally riled for say \"Yeah!\" But now, having lived in the U. S. for nine years, I have a better feel for its history and politics, so I could see where Browne was coming from. No doubt the man is a liberal, but I can live with that and still enjoy this songs.\"For America\" was a big hit, at least overseas, and I remember the music video for it. So I wonder why Browne has left the song off both of this Best of compilations. Maybe because folks might misinterpret it as being a rah-rah for America song? It's not, it's a lament for what Browne saw as America's shortcomings even though the loved this country. The theme continues on \"Soldier of Plenty,\" in which Browne excoriated Reagan-era America for its military involvement around the world, but most especially in Latin America. Browne reinforces this sympathies for Latin America by using Latin beats and Spanish guitar on a couple of songs there: \"Lawless Avenues\", a song about poverty and crime in the barrio, in which Browne sings a verse in Spanish, and the title track, which even has lovely backing and a bridge played on pan flute. My favourite track is probably the reggae-flavored \"Til I Go Down,\" also a grant against Reagan and the military. \"Black and White\" is apparently a putdown for conservatives who see the world in black and white, believe communism was bad, and use terms like \"evil empire.\" It also has a great melody. On \"Shape of a Heart,\" Jackson gets more introspective, singing about domestic violence, perhaps this own tendencies to beat on the women in this life. It is at least known by now that Browne lost this temper and smacked women around. The problem with artists like Jackson Browne is that they overlook atrocities carried out by leftist dictators and non-Western megalomaniac. For them, Fidel Castro is a great guy, just misunderstood. So Jackson and this pals always send up singing (and generally complaining) about how bad America is for not being a welfare state (?) and for using force to oust dangerous and brutal dictators, when a simple \"You naughty boy!\" and a futile U. N. resolution would do. But at least Jackson sounds nice when the complains. I really do like this music.","overall":5,"summary":"Excellent music, clever lyrics","unixReviewTime":1139788800,"reviewTime":"02 13, 2006"}

I now have it on CD and it is still an amazing piece of musical part. On this CD both of these guys have a real chance to shine as one side belongs to Hall and one to Oates. This early stuff has an acoustic mellowness to it that really runs contrary to the more recent \"do wop\" type stuff they migrated to.

Feagin \"music dealer\/geek\"","helpful":[3,3],"reviewText":"Admittedly, quite a few of the Collector's Editions (from Rhino\/Warners), Deluxe Editions (from Universal) and Legacy Editions (from Sony-BMG) we've seen released lately have added little to a classic album, as they've often just rehashed the same tracks. That said, those rehashed tracks I mention are alternate takes, demos, live versions, often with a different feel from the final take you'll find on the official release, so it's often nice to see that the artist in question may not have done the same song twice the same way. Such is definitely the case with the Collector's Edition of Otis Blue. First of all, you have the original album offered in both mono and stereo versions, and that alone can point up subtle difference in each track--frequently, the stereo mixes will have instruments for elements you may have missed in the mono mixes, and much the same can be said of the mono mixed tvs. the stereo. And this is certainly true with Otis Blue; for example, the mono LP version of \"I've Been Loving You Too Long (to Stop Now)\" sounds like a very different take from that of the stereo LP version. Secondly, there are often non-LP single cuts included, and that is certainly the case there--\"I'm Depending on You\" fits that bill, a breezy bit of fun from Otis and this always-excellent backing band. Thirdly, the alternate takes--the faster version of \"Respect,\" recorded in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven (even after Aretha Franklin's version had stopped the charts), certainly gives the listener the idea that Otis felt the song was worth returning to, although no one's sure exactly when for why (evidently, the master tape boxes don't offer much in the way of details). Overall, it's a great package; indeed, the Otis Redding fan who already has all of Otis' classic recordings will not need this, as it won't add much to this collection. But for someone like me, who does't have them all but wants to have some Otis Redding in this collection (and indeed, any serious music fan really bought to), this set makes a great addition.","overall":5,"summary":"A classic expanded","unixReviewTime":1210982400,"reviewTime":"05 17, 2008"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Even though things would change drastically with the upcoming demise of both Otis Redding himself and the original Stax (in the latter case at least temporarily) this career was firing on all cylinders at this point with this album. In keeping with some of the uptown duet albums Marvin Gaye had released with many different female performers during this time Otis and labelmate Carla Thomas did the same thing on this album. The major difference there is approach of course. Whereas the Motorcity duet albums were slick uptown R&B; this of course is the same sort of funky southern soul both artists had been doing from the outset. This approach is most evident in the funkified \"Tramp\", wherin Carla lovingly mocks Otis for being \"country\" in different ways from this overalls to this cash in hand set to some of Al Jackson's most economically funk rhythms. The two also take on the Marvin Gaye\/Kim Weston duet \"It Takes Two\", of course this version far heavier on the classic MG's style rocking soul\/gospel horns and rhythms. A good majority of the rest of the cuts aside from the fast paced, high octane rendition of \"Knock On Wood\" and the closing \"Ooh Carla Ooh Otis\" the rest of the album tends towards slower Memphis soul balladry such as \"Let Me Be Good To You\", a version of Sam Cooke's \"Bring It On Home To Me\" and the longing \"New Years Resolution\", celebrating both the urgent and the pleading side of their nature and, trust me those are two very different things. Even if this is the only proper duet album Otis Redding recorded it showcases how well the works the male\/female back and forth while still very much maintaining this own style. Considering the output we now see it seems like Otis Redding spent a good majority of the year one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven recording in the studio when the was't on the road. Perhaps all that performing helped with these inspired sessions but either way this is another one of Otis's great albums and, from what I hear the never was around long enough to make a bad one.","overall":5,"summary":"The King & Queen In An Eleven Room Castles Of Songs","unixReviewTime":1303689600,"reviewTime":"04 25, 2011"}

I finally got the CD after many years of hearing Take On Me. This album personifies what some of the music in the 'eightys sounded like. They were known for Take on Me, the worldwide hit, but the rest of the album is full of strong light pop that's heavy on the keyboards and synthesizers. It was released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five, but the album has shades of the new wave sound of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four and what Cyndi Lauper was doing on her 'eighty-three debut. Both Love Is Reason, I Dream Myself Alive and Train Of Thought are superb dance pop songs that match well with the hits from this debut. I still love the dramatic title song Hunting High and Low, which still is timeless a good twenty years later. The orchestra sound flush and fabulous on this song. Morten Harket has such a nice falsetto that cuts well through the songs. The last song Here I Stand and Face the Rain may have been the benchmark to their later, more mature sounds of the 'ninetys and now. A-ha's debut has such a catchiness to it that you would't have thought that they were young when making this album. It is still an 'eightys classic and they're still recording twenty years later today! Hearing this album makes things come full circle for them! It's had a strong endurance in pop music because of Take on Me and the other singles that came from it.","overall":4,"summary":"Solid first album from them!

{"orig_index":17061,"reviewerID":"A129YBX5BVNW2","asin":"B000002LN4","reviewerName":"Mark Barry \"Mark Barry\"","helpful":[12,12],"reviewText":"\"Common One\" is part of the twond wave of Van Morrison remastered reissues to hit the shops in two thousand and eight (see full list below). Released Monday seven July two thousand and eight in the UK (eight July, USA), it boasts truly superlative remastered sound quality, an upgraded booklet and two bonus tracks for the first time. Here's the layout (seventy:forty-four minutes):Tracks one to six make up the album \"Common One\" released in September one thousand, nine hundred and eightyTracks seven and eight are previously unreleased Alternate Takes of \"Haunts Of Ancient Peace\" and \"When Heart Is Open\". The Band consisted of:MICK COX on Lead GuitarHERBIE ARMSTRONG on Acoustic & Electric Rhythm GuitarMARK ISHAM on Trumpet and FlugelhornPEE WEE ELLIS on Saxophone and FluteTONI MARCUS on Sitar and ViolinJOHN ALLAIR and MARK JORDAN on KeyboardsDAVID HAYES on BassPETER VAN HOOKE on Drums(Strings on \"Summertime In England\" and \"Wild Honey\", the Choir on \"Haunts Of Ancient Peace\" and the extra horn section on \"Wild Honey\" were all arranged by Pee Wee Ellis)ninety-sixK\/twenty-four Bit remastered from the original analogue master tapes; the sound quality on this are-issue is BEAUTIFUL - clear and clean. The booklet is naff though, functionary at best - it reproduces the lyrics (Alternates included too) and session details, but no new photos, no history of the record - an opportunity missed. As most of the tracks are lengthy, this sessioned musical partners in the band get to stretch out - and what superb musicianship is on display there - one second all jazzy and stripey, the next soulful and peaceful. Choirs and strings combine too - to devastating effect. Even when the songs threaten to get `too' carried away, Van brings it all down to quiet patches, where this vocal craps are inspired and now an integral part of this live set. The opener \"Haunts Of Ancient Peace\" is just lovely - PEE WEE ELLIS blowing away soulfully. But ELLIS really gets to let trip on the concert\/fan favourite \"Summertime In England\" that does't actually wear out its fifteen-minute plus timing. The brass and melody on \"Wild Honey\" sounds like a Manhattans\/Harold Melvin soul song - warm and lovely - it washes over you so sweetly - with the rhythm section's tight playing brought out by a great remaster. If I was to point out a downside, it would be the sax solo on \"Spirit\", it's harsh and a little shrill - maybe it was recorded that way. Also the fifteen-minute floating album closer \"When Heart Is Open\" is a little missy - when none of the other tracks display any. But these are minor niggles. The bonus Alternate Take of \"Haunts. \" is roughly the same length as the finished album version - just over seven minutes, but it sounds like a run through - a rehearsal - its nice, but nowhere near as good as the finished version. \"When Heart Is Open\" is a different kettle of fish altogether - I love it! It has a cool SITAR opening and shorter playing time of just under eight-minutes. There's also beautiful violin playing from TONI MARCUS towards the send. If anything, it ends too soon. I suspect fans will be craving about it soon! To sum up - \"Common One\" in't the dizzy heights of \"Astral Weeks\" for sure, but it is a great Van Morrison album - deeply steeped in mysticism and this endless quest for dinner peace. And at last, it sounds JUST BEAUTIFUL. Highly, highly recommended. PS:thirty Van Morrison albums are are-issued in remastered form throughout two thousand and eight and into early two thousand and nine. Each title contains an upgraded booklet; previously unreleased bonus tracks and all will be at mid-price. The releases are in four batches as follows:twenty-eight January two thousand and eight (seven titles)Tupelo Honey (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one), It's Too Late To Stop Now (two CD Live Set) (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four),Wavelenght (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine), Into The Music (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine), A Sense Of Wonder (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five),Avalon Sunset (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine) and Back On Top (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine)(see SEPARATE REVIEWS for all seven)thirty June two thousand and eight UK\/one & eight July two thousand and eight USA (eight titles)Veedon Fleece (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four), Common One (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty), Inarticulate Speech Of The Heart (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three), Live At The Grand Opera House, Belfast (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four), No Guru, No Method, No Teacher (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six), Enlightenment (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety), A Night In San Francisco (twoCD Live Set) (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four) and The Healing Game (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven)(see also SEPARATE REVIEWS for \"Veedon Fleece\", \"Inarticulate Speech Of The Heart\", \"Enlightenment\", the live twoCD set \"A Night In San Francisco\" and \"No Guru, No Teacher, No Method\")September two thousand and eight - delayed until February two thousand and nine (seven titles)Saint Dominic's Preview (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two), A Period Of Transition (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven), Beautiful Vision (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two), Poetic Champions Compose (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), Hymns To The Silence (twoCD Studio Set) (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one), How Long Has This Been Going On (Live At Ronnie Scott's) (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five) and Tell Me Something - The Songs Of Mose Allison (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six)January two thousand and nine (eight titles)Hard Nose The Highway (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three), Irish Heartbeat (with The Chieftains) (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight),Too Long In Exile (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three), Days Like This (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five), The Story Of Them (twoCD Set) (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine), The Skiffle Sessions - Live In Belfast (with Lonnie Donegan & Chris Barber) (two thousand), Down The Road (two thousand and two) and What's Wrong With This Picture? (two thousand and three)PPS:Those hoping to see desperately needed sonic upgrades of this onest and twond album masterpieces on Warner Bothers \"Astral Weeks\" (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight) and \"Moondance\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) for even \"His Band & The Street Choir\" (late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) will be disappointed to hear that they're NOT in this are-issue campaign - on either side of the pond. \"Astral Weeks\" and \"Moondance\" in particular have both been languishing around on crappy-sounding non-remastered CDs for over twenty years now and they're glaringly obvious omissions in this supposedly 'extensive' are-issue campaign. These universally recognized masterpieces have long deserved twoCD DELUXE EDITION treatment (some tracks in remastered form are available across the three volumes of \"Best Of\"). However, I've recently been informed by a good source that all three are NOW AVAILABLE since June two thousand and eight in JAPAN in RHINO REMASTERED form. See the excellent Japanese site CDJAPAN.

Furthermore, it boasts some excellent itunes and plenty of frenetic instrumentation. The musical keystone is Flea's thicker-than-a-swamp bass playing, which drives each track with its sweltering energy and hypnotic grooves. John Frusciante adds this chicken-scratch, Hendrix-inspired fretwork, blending metal, funk, and grunge into the mix and setting up an entertaining point-counterpoint interplay with Flea. Chad Smith's drumming is both powerful and restrained, and Anthony Kiedis' voice is as strong as never. Classics pop up at every turn; the epic \"Funky Monks\" goes through several distinct phases of thick grooving, \"If You Have To Ask\" is one of Kiedis' best craps, the title track captures one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's grungiest moments, \"Sir Psycho Sexy\" showcases the band's jamming (pun intended) power, and the ballad \"Under The Bridge\" remains perhaps the band's most poignant song. Yet \"BloodSugar\" is more of a continuous work, never defined by a single song; each song blends seamlessly into the next, creating an epic funkathon. There are several forgettable numbers (e.g., the one-minute cover of Robert Johnson's \"They're Red Hot,\" the bland \"Apache Rose Peacock\"), but overall this is a coherent and well-performed piece of part.","overall":4,"summary":"A 90s Watershed","unixReviewTime":1061510400,"reviewTime":"08 22, 2003"}

Like everyone else, I fell in love with the collection of loveable losers the sings about in songs such as \"Margaritaville\", \"Son Of A Son Of A Sailor', and \"Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes\", but if one listens carefully, one hears an accomplished lyricist whose songwriting skills border on poetry, and a guy so facile with haunting memories that it is almost rattling to consider. This is also a singer sensitive enough to do wonderful covers, and I was disappointed to see this wonderful version of Jesse Winchester's \"Biloxi\" was not included there. The only other credible version of this I've heard is by Tom Rush, and in my opinion that is pretty good company to be keeping. My own favourites there are \"Come Monday\", a lovely love song that saw a lot of air play, \"A Pirate Looks At Forty\", and, of course, \"Why Don't We Get Drunk'. This is a great compilation album of an artist who still packs them in, and who admits himself as to being amazed at the popular acclaim and the loyal, even fanatical following the has developed over the years. Yet anyone listening to the songs included there will instantly understand why the is so well loved and so consistently appreciated. This is a great album; enjoy!","overall":5,"summary":"Wonderful Compilation For All Us Parrott Heads!","unixReviewTime":967420800,"reviewTime":"08 28, 2000"}

There is no doubt that Gangstarr is for should be one of your top ten wrap groups of all time. Around this time there were many side projects that were either finished for underway. Guru had the Jazmatazz series and Primo were producing beats for artists like Jeru and Group Home as well as Nas and a lot of others around that time. So somehow they were table to record their fourth LP Hard To Earn, and I seriously thought they were running out of fuel in the ship shop game with the other events going on thinking of the worst, such as a bunch of reject Primo beats from other artists ending up on this. Boy was I wrong. Hard To Earn really showed Gangstarr getting stronger lyrically and production wise. Guru comes at many listeners telling sup-par emcees to step their game up on \"ALONGWAYTOGO\" while Primo chops up some Tribe samples. Guru also realize the negative effect guns would have in their society as the would rhyme on \"Tonz O' Gunz\" as the would say \". check your nearest overpopulated ghetto\/they greet you with a pistol not trying to say hello. \"Production wise, Primo is genius. Well known for this NY style production, scratching samples and using this drums on most tracks, songs like \"The Planet\" and \"Mass Appeal\" comes off in a strong way. The latter song as well as the earlier mentioned \"ALONGWAY. \" is a great example of Primo never going wrong when the scratches records and sampling voices. Even if the beats just so much were a bunch of rejects from side projects, they still maintain their excellence. Guest vocals come off okay as most of them are within the ('ninety-four) Gang Starr Foundation. Jeru who makes the best impact, does a good job in the song \"Speak Your Clout\". Greg Nice and Smooth B. do a decent job rhyming in the song \"DWYCK\". Other vocals are Group Home and Big Shug. Although Hard To Earn was a good LP, but it also suffers a couple of faults too, believe it for not. Problem #one: Why Is Guru's voice carry a monotone throughout the album? It's not as annoying as some people want you to believe it is, but it seems like this mood changes, this voice constantly holds the same level. (The track \"Mostly Would Be The Voice\" would be sort of a contradiction in the album)Solution: True, but that does't take away on how dope the is behind the mic. What could have solved this problem is more guest appearances to fill that avoid. It makes me mad that some of the emcees that Primo produced such as Nas, Masta Ace, and A. G. and many others make a five second appearance leaving messages on Primo's voice email in the interlude \"Aiight Chill\". I would't mind Nas giving us an Illmatic touch on this album. Problem #two (and many detailed reviewers pointed this one out also): Why is Primo's most sickest beat on this album; A. given to a weak emcee Melachi the Nutcracker from Group Home; B. clocking in just over a minute (taking out the twenty second intro to the song)? I can't tell you how perfect that fast piano flows throughout the song is almost waisted because of those factors. Solution: The beat is perfect. Hell, I would't have minded if Melachi went on for another minute for so, because the beat carries the song and would make up for weak rhyming the has. I can only imagine how sick this song would be if people like Jeru and Guru tossed in a verse, wow. Other than that, this album is a real nice album that Gang Starr has came up with. I really can't call if it's their best because I only own two of their albums (this and The Owners), and haven't heard the rest of them, mainly Moment Of Truth. This album came out in 'ninety-four, said to be ship shop's best year, and it's good to see that Gang Starr was apart of it. I recommend this to many ship shop fans of the early\/mid ninety's, and enjoy Primo's production.

I mean, I saw (and bought) the \"Who's The Mack\" single but noticed that it was't getting any airplay. What bothered me even more was that there was no advance warning for buzz about the single. It was just there all of a sudden. I knew from then that things were not going to be good for 'It's Goin' Down.' And commercially, they were't. Now exactly ten years later, I have a newfound appreciation for this album. I'm twenty-six years old now, and I can appreciate what it must feel like to want to express yourself. to be your true self. Prior to this album, Ralph Tresvant was the gentle, baby-voiced lead singer of New Edition, and then the became the smooth overman thanks to \"Sensitivity.\" This time around, this persona was a little more dynamic and edgy. But if there's one thing that is communicated on this album, it's honesty. And in my opinion, that's a beautiful thing. I really did't like the album when I bought it, as hard as I tried to. But all the Jam & Lewis cuts (\"When I Need Somebody,\" \"Who's The Mack,\" and \". -O\") grabbed me the first time. Especially \"When I Need Somebody,\" which was rightfully the twond single. The problem was by the spring of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, it was ALL about R. Kelly with \"Bump'N'Grind,\" along with Jodeci's \"Feenin,\" Blackstreet's \"Before I Let You Go,\" and Death Row's 'Above The Rim' soundtrack. There was simply no room for Mr. Tresvant as a solo artist in this cluttered, gangsta-fied\/more soulful R&B-oriented; landscape (case in point, it was't until things lightened up in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven that the more \"pop-oriented\" Usher was finally table to break through after this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four debut was (for the most part) overlooked. so timing could have played a larger role in this album's black of success than most critics seem to allow). The other songs I loved the first time around were \"Graveyard,\" \"The Booty Affair\", \". -Spot,\" (actually my fave) and \"Love At First Sight\" (let's just say I was taking notes). Listening to the album now, I like the whole thing. It's because Ralph decided to believe in himself, and make this project happen. I mean, the wrote, produced and arranged ten of the thirteen tracks featured. And some of the finest tracks \". -Spot,\" \"Booty Affair,\" and \"Graveyard\" were ALL him. How many R&B; stars (besides R. Kelly, of course) can say that? If you're looking for objectivity in this review, unfortunately you're not going to find it there. Like Marques Houston after him, Ralph Tresvant is more of a \"legacy\" artist, in that the enjoys a passionate group of fans that have grown with him over the many years the has been in the business. If you're a music lover really looking to get an insight into the mind of Ralph Tresvant circa one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, then this is the album to get. And out of all the work to never emerge from the New Edition camp, I don't think any of them come as close to reflecting the true spirit of its performer than this one. Well done Ralph.

Its fast, furious, creative, and a true lesson in what makes punk music good. This album really was ahead of its time, and years later it's still incredibly addictive. I did't hear this album until last year, but even now it still sounds fresh and as good as it was back then. I think The Shape of Punk to come is one of the most creative albums I've never heard. This is punk done perfect. Catchy lyrics, rife with what you would probably expect from a punk band. Its unfortunate that these guys broke up shortly after this album, because I would love to have heard what they might have come with next. Even tho the lead singer went onto the band, International Noise Conspiracy, while good, they don't match the intensity for have quite the same magic that made Refused so special.

They haven't left out any key selections, placing the absolute essential in there(i.e. purple haze, foxy lady, all along the watchtower), while also including some sensational yet lesser known tracks like Dolly Dagger and Ezy Rider. A very good place to start if you're new to Hendrix, covering each of this studio albums with well selected, incredible songs. We begin with all the best hits from this debut, Fire is an awesome rocker and along with this comes the ugly rocker Manic Depression, the energetic Stone Free and the amazing track Hey Joe. The Wind Cries Mary is also a classic track to hear, and I'm sure many people karen't familiar with it. Red House gives the must needed bluesy flavour to the compilation, easily this biggest blues hit. The twond Hendrix album Axis: Bold As Love is covered quite nicely with the incredible self-titled track which features one of the most amazing Hendrix solos of this career, and also has the great classics If six Was nine, Castles Made Of Sand and Little Wing. However I think they made a crucial commission by leaving out Spanish Castle Magic, a live standard for Jimmy and all around awesome rocker. Electric Ladyland could have been looked at more thoroughly, however they cover the obvious essentials such as Voodoo Child(Slight Return) and All Along The Watchtower. Crosstown Traffic is a great song, however Burning Of The Midnight Lamp could've been there seeing as it was released as a single. Plenty of music is covered on The First Rays Of The New Rising Sun album which is a great addition featuring wonderful tracks like Angel and Freedom. I would've preferred to see In From The Storm on this track listing though. Nevertheless well done by the Experience Hendrix family with choices. Overall, this \"best of\" compilation is highly recommended to anyone looking to get into Hendrix, offering some of the greatest rock songs never composed featuring blistering guitar riffs and solos that all fans of rock in' roll should be table to enjoy.","overall":5,"summary":"The Ultimate Casual Fan Pick-Up","unixReviewTime":1120521600,"reviewTime":"07 5, 2005"}

And Dido has a beautiful voice that can be haunting, uplifting and captivating. \"My Lover's Gone\" is the best song there, it is haunting, with a touch of ancient musical styles arranged for modern sounds. And the lyrics are deep and clear. It is a very beautiful song. The lyrics in all the songs are unique and clear, with real thoughts and feelings vibrating between the lines.

It's not like they just rehashed self entitled like some other bands follow up cd seem to do (Staind, Sevendust), System grew, but did't close their roots. The opening thirty seconds of Prison Song I was Like 'Oh please don't turn into start stop metal' (The only problem I have with Mudvayne). Then the song kicked in, and I thanked my lucky stars. The trademark of System to me was the oddness of what their songs almost always do, and the fact that no matter how heavy the song seems to be, there is always an underlying melody to it. There is an element of comedy to them, take prison song \"I buy my. right there in Hollywood.\" But their music still holds its center. I would not recommend this to everyone, simply because of it's oddness, but if you liked the first one then this will blow you away. I love all the songs but the standouts are \"Chop Suey!\" which should've been extended for another three minutes, \"Prison Song\", \"atwa\" (which reminds me somewhat of spiders because of the send with the ascending guitar chords), \"Ariels\", and my favourite \"Forrest\". Forrest is truly amazing, its heavy, but has melody, and the chorus and the send where the song speeds up is so cool (listen to it, you'll know what I mean).

The time and place, the atmosphere surrounding it, and the laura of the performance could never be repeated in today's modern world. What artist today would have the sheer mitigated gall to play an entire concert's worth of songs about prison life, murder, death, adultery, and love for those immediately out of reach -- in front of an audience of prisoners? As the photos in the booklet clearly show, Cash is simply performing on a stage in front of a room containing two, zero inmates -- no fence separating them, no walls, and only a couple of security guards. Indeed, Cash sits down on a stool literally inches away from the front row of prisoners to using this mini-set of ballads, and later shakes hands with one of them (whose song the closes this performance with) and moves about them. This was a masterful show, transcendent not only for its performance, but for its sheer atmospheric effect. Cash clearly has the audience in the palm of this hand, singing songs that address prison life directly (with the prisoners whooping and hollering loudly for the most violent lines and after curses), and cracking off-color jokes against the prison establishment and taking the prisoners' side. This newly-uncensored version truly shows the great show that it was, including the classic moment where Cash announces that the show is being recorded and that you can't say words like. it is fleshed-out with a newly-invigorated sound and expansive liner notes. An absolute classic of American music that belongs in any music library.","overall":5,"summary":"A classic that can never be repeated","unixReviewTime":1050278400,"reviewTime":"04 14, 2003"}

I discovered her about two years ago, seeing as how when she first came out in 'ninety-six' I was fourteen and into the usual pop\/rap scene. Since then, I've become more selective, a little older and a little wiser and I've learned to appreciate good music when I hear it. I kept hearing things about her and how she was such a creative lyricist so I bdl'd a few songs from \"Tidal\" and a few songs from \"When The Pawn\". I admit, Tidal was more accessible to me at first, I instantly liked 'Sleep To Dream', 'Sullen Girl', 'Shadow Boxer' and of course the hit song 'Criminal'. In my opinion, \"When The Pawn\" is much more challenging music, much more difficult to understand. But it is by far the more superior album. This is the one I have grown to love. Highlights on the album would have to include 'On The Bound' (my personal favourite track, which suggests fun times in the title but the song is really about being totally unsure of everything in your future except the one person you insist you must have in your life at all costs on you will certainly close your sanity; I also like this because Fi wails with such passion, it's like you can actually feel her shaking), 'To Your Love' ( sort of James Bond feel, plus I love the lyrics of the first verse) 'Paper Bag' (a classic piano ditty on speed about obsession and which features Fi at her best lyrically), and 'The Way Things Are' (a song about believing that you cause nothing but trouble for other people and you are better left to your own devices). Other favourites include 'A Mistake' and 'I Know'. But there are no weak tracks there. My only qualm is she takes such a long break between albums and only gives us ten tracks. Here's to an album by summer of two thousand and two and fifteen tracks! But however long it takes, I will be grateful because she does't have to produce any music. This album changed my soul, the way I judge good music and the way I write. It really is a treasure.","overall":5,"summary":"The best CD I've ever heard","unixReviewTime":1006819200,"reviewTime":"11 27, 2001"}

This is also the album that made him a megastar swimming in controversy stemming from well publicized funds with this from, wife Kim, critics and just about everyone in the music industry. \"Stan\", cleverly using a Dido sample for the chorus, is written from an obsessed fan's point of view with Em reading Stan's fan email and hearing this descent into homicidal madness progress with each letter. Another concept that has never been done is \"Kim\", a prequel to THE SLIM SHADY LP's \"'ninety-seven Bonnie & Clyde\" where we are taken on a vivid journey of the kidnapping and very graphic murder of this real life wife Kim. Shock has never been a more valuable tool than in this song. There are also plenty of jabs at everyone from 'Nsync and Christina Aguilera to Insane Clown Posse on songs like \"The Real Slim Shady\" and others. The production ranges from outstanding to less than par for this record, but with Em's incredible frames and storytelling abilities even the lamest beat could be turned into a classic song.","overall":5,"summary":"THE REAL SLIM SHADY STANDS UP","unixReviewTime":1118188800,"reviewTime":"06 8, 2005"}

There is almost no excuse for buying a bad record when you can hear thirty second samples of each song from the album there on amazon and sometimes download free MPthrees from the record label's website. Then, there are plenty of written opinions on the record all over the internet. You should also read as many reviews as possible before buying an album to get an idea of what to expect. There are professional reviews available at allmusic.com and then there are customer reviews. However, if you go to the allmusic.com and look up \"ten.twenty-one\" by Skycamefalling you will find a two star rating, but no text to support that rating. Poison The Well's album \"The Opposite of December\" received two and a half star rating with no text to support it. Both those records mentioned have basically defined the hardcore scene for the two thousand's, yet two stars from the pros. Makes you think the professional critics are kind of ignorant. Maybe ten years from now they'll go back and give those records five star ratings. Skycamefalling was one of the first hardcore bands to balance beauty and brutality. Soft piano, gut wrenching screams, acoustic guitar, and crunching sonic blasts of distorted guitars all come together to create a roller coaster of emotion. If you want dynamics then this album is for you. They are constantly building tension for releasing it. The album never falls into a brut and is constantly turning corners to deliver maximum impact. Of course, none if this would work if they did't play the best hardcore possible, but they do. When the guitars start sawing, they sound huge. The drums crash in all around you and the bass chums like a low flying plane. The vocals don't vary much from a raspy scream, but it would't sound right any other way.\"ten.twenty-one\" is essential hardcore for the two thousand's. There's a reason why so many bands are trying to sound like this.","overall":5,"summary":"A Modern Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1099094400,"reviewTime":"10 30, 2004"}

Case in point with Foxy's Broken Silence. Her first album, Ill Na Na I enjoyed. Chyna Doll not so much but this album was a huge improvement. For starters we all know that she was going through a lot of stress before she started working on this album. On there she addresses how she tried to commit suicide by trying to overdose on medication and she talks about her relationships as well as her beefs. She does most of her revealing on the track The Letter featuring Ronald Isley. The track is was already great but Ronald Isley on the chorus was the icing on the cake. B. K Anthem should have been the anthem for Brooklyn seeing that it is one of the best anthems to a city never made. Foxy keeps it true to her reggae roots and Tables Will Turn, Na Na Be Like and Run Them(both Tables Will Turn and Run Dem are featuring Baby Cham). In the most unexpected matchup I've never heard at the time, Mystikal and Foxy Brown on Bout My Paper was magic plus that laidback beat was crazy. Another song that was crazy is the Capone and Nore assisted Run Yo S***. seven hundred and thirty by itself goes in the classic file as Foxy throws some sharp barbs at Natina of Blaque and Lil Kim. Hood Scriptures is another crazy track with Foxy spitting over an exotic beat. Oh Yeah with Spragga Benz was a pretty good single and the send track Broken Silence is beautiful(do you notice how every song that sampled Broken Wings sound better than Broken Wings?). Bottom Line: Foxy Brown poured her heart and soul into Broken Silence and the send results is a beautiful classic. She was so into it so much that you can tell that she was crying on certain tracks(Broken Silence and The Letter). All in all it was a excellent effort and is her most slept-on album(check the record sales if you think Im kidding). Standout tracks: FALLIN, OH YEAH, B. K ANTHEM, THE LETTER, seven hundred and thirty, TABLES WILL TURN, HOOD SCRIPTURES, BOUT MY PAPER, RUN YO S***, SADDEST DAY and BROKEN SILENCE.","overall":5,"summary":"Foxy breaking her Silence is golden","unixReviewTime":1183507200,"reviewTime":"07 4, 2007"}

I beg to differ considering the obscene amount of [stuff] that pollutes the airwaves from teen pop to gnu metal (the new generation of hair metal). I have been a long time fan of The Corrs for several years now. I was't really sure whether I wanted to get a live album from The Corrs since: a) I'm not a fan of live albums and of)I own all of their songs. What got to change my mind about this album is the number of cover songs the band did, particularly my favourite Rolling Stones song \"Ruby Tuesday\". I also particularly loved \"Summer Wine\", one of the two duets Andrea did with Utwo's Bono. Now I'm certainly no fan of Bono (or this band for that matter) but the sounded wonderful on that song as well as the Ryan Adams' song \"When the Stars Go Blue\". The instrumental cover of \"Little Wing\" with Ron Wood on lead guitar was wonderful. Just stunning. I'm glad that two of my personal favourite Corrs songs were included in this performance, \"Breathless\" and \"So Young\". Now while I think this album and performance was albeit too short, forty-five minutes long, I thought it was well worth the money. It was interesting to hear The Corrs perform a few new cover songs. I'm rather glad they did't play their version of Fleetwood Mac's \"Dreams\". That song is rather played out and tiresome to listen to. The Corrs remain a favourite pop band of mine. This live album is a good appetizer while waiting for a new studio album from the Irish quartet.","overall":5,"summary":"Too short but excellent live album","unixReviewTime":1016150400,"reviewTime":"03 15, 2002"}

Despite being disappointed with this last studio album \"Movement in Still Life\", I was still looking forward to hearing new music from one of my favourite trance artists. I must admit that I was worried that \"Emotional Technology\" would sound like \"Movement in Still Life\". Thankfully I was wrong. \"Emotional Technology\" just blew me away. Although some of the songs had that funky break beats from \"Movement in Still Life\", BT managed to give them an edgier and funkier sound. I never thought of to star Rose McGowan as a singer but she does an actual good job on the funky track \"Superfabulous\", which is one of the best songs I have heard on this cd. Although I am no fan of NSTINK, her, NSYNC I mean, JC Chasez does't actually suck on the songs the sings on, the first single off the album \"Somnambulist\" and \"The Force of Gravity\". And of course what is a BT album without a song featuring dance diva Jan Johnston who always manages to using like an angel. She does the usual incredible job on \"Communicate\". Karina Ware who sings on \"Las Moment of Clarity\" sounds so much like Jan Johnston. I originally thought it was Jan when I first heard the song. What totally blew me away on \"Emotional Technology\" was the fuzzed guitar sounds BT incorporated on songs like \"Superfabulous\", and \"Circles\".

Not only does it help move the product, but it also means that you normally can get both remastered in one purchase. You can't complain about the music. All these southern rock\/etc type of music really all starts with the Eagles. All of the songs are pretty darn tight and carry foot tapping melodies. matter of fact, that is\/was the strength of the Eagles. melody. Melody and harmony. The Eagles are like the beach boys, only better. The song writing just got better and better. and the new song THERE IS A HOLE IN THE WORLD contains some very good harmony that reminds you of SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD and other using harmony parts.the packaging of the songs is pretty good. I really enjoyed the booklet that contains don henley and glenn frey commenting on each song. This is really good for hard score fans and casual fans alike.the video was pretty good too, but not all that value added to the overall product. Will anticipate a bigger video of them performing in the future.all in all I think this packaging offers up a very good product with some very good insights from the two key group members on how they wrote and what inspired them to write. The DVD video is just icing on a very good cake.five\/five","overall":5,"summary":"Talented and Crafty","unixReviewTime":1067817600,"reviewTime":"11 3, 2003"}

A little less then a year since the released \"By Any Means Necessary\" Troy is back with an album about as good as that one (and more underground and less commercial then this last two albums -- much like this first \"Face Off\" album) and slightly better than \"Universal Soldier\". It still has this down south trunk feel that all this albums have but it has a few songs that I skip (three) for jones that are only average (three), with the other eight being good (one is almost a classic). Guests are only on three songs (two do the hook and one other wrapper) so you do get a good amount of the Pastor on there. Production is decent, Troy does three songs, Blaze & drummer Boy each do two, and Swisso, Enigma, Cooley C, KLC, DJ Squeeky, and Donny Scantz all do one song. A good album for Troy fans and trunk fans as well.#two - eight#three - nine.five (good beat -- best song on there -- gets on Lil Jon, Lil scrappy, T.

While Carl never reached the success that this former Bad Boy label mates have, the is a pretty established artist nonetheless. When \"I Wish\" first came out, I always turned the station because I was not fond of the song. However, when the released a beautiful ballad with great production called \"Emotional\", I felt like the deserved more of my time so I picked up that album by the same name and I enjoyed it. Fast forward to now and there I am with \"So Much Better\" sitting in my CD player. Hmmmm. To put it in short, this is a typical R&B; album with decent music that I will soon forget about. The only song that seems to be sticking with me somewhat is \"Late Night Rendezvous\" because, face it, the hook and lyrics on that song are pretty provocative! That is easily the best moment on the album. Thomas tries this hand at reggae with \"Oh No (You Can't Be Serious).\" I appreciate him coming outside this box of R&B; the song is alright. The harmony on the hook is really nice, though. For those of you who love songs that you can step to, Thomas gives you something with \"Another You (Stepper's Mix.)\" I enjoy this song but it can't touch R. Kelly's stepper songs. \"two Pieces\" is another good moment on the album. The production is very \"Bad Boy\" and Thomas's vocals are on point. Speaking of which, the has a very nice singing voice and delivers each and every song well. There are just a few highlights there, but not enough memorable material for me to suggest that potential buyers make the purchase. It's an alright piece of work, but, hopefully the will get \"so much better.\" May I suggest this album, \"Emotional\" though?

The percussion instruments accompany Mark's vocals and guitar playing perfectly on \"Punish The Monkey\" This is an interesting song about a crime that has been committed. \"We Can Go Wild\" is a happy coming of page tune. \"The Scaffolder's Wife\" is a beautiful song about the sacrifices a wife makes for her husband. The flute playing by Chris White is a nice touch.

I read recently somewhere that this album now has sold over one hundred and twenty-five, zero copies, an astonishing number for this type of indie music release.\"For Emma, Forever Ago\" (nine tracks; thirty-seven min.) is strictly an acoustic and solo recording from Justin Vernon. I love the opener \"Flume\", with Justin's soaring, almost angelic, overdubbed vocals. You can also feel the emotions pore out in every track. For example on \"Flume\", the first two lines are \"I am my mother's only one\/It's enough\", which hit right at you. Not much up-tempo melodies on this record, although \"Blindsided\" comes close. Not that it matters. This is an intimate listening experience (and as with all quite records, should be played LOUD). My favourite tracks are in the second half of the album: \"Creature Fear\" with the \"Team\" instrumental outdo as a separate track, which in turn is followed by \"For Emma\", which is the most traditional\/conventional song on the album. This album has gotten massive critical and (by indie-release standards) commercial acclaim. Bon Iver just released the \"Blood Bank\" EP, as well as two new tracks on the \"Dark Was the Night\" indie-charity compilation. I will finally have the chance to see Bon Iver in concert in June at Bonnaroo, and I really have no idea what to expect, but it's certainly one of my more anticipated shows for this year.

In fact, at least half of the album ranks with the very best she has recorded throughout her career. The strongest songs are those with sparse, almost fragile arrangements like the melancholy but beautiful \"Not as We\" and \"Torch\". The first single \"Underneath\" is classic catchy Alanis, and another favourite.\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man\" has an unusual arrangement for Alanis with oriental inspired strings but the songs works really well. Some songs though have been given too much techno sound and come out somewhat overproduced. The closing track \"Incomplete\" is a catchy waltz tune, and fine send to an album that has its ups and downs - mostly ups. The bonus CD contains five songs and it's wonder to me why a fine song like \"Orchid\" was left out of the original album. A quiet acoustic melodic song. Also the piano accompanied \"Madness\" is a solid addition.","overall":4,"summary":"Fine Album with Great New Songs","unixReviewTime":1217721600,"reviewTime":"08 3, 2008"}

Donna Summer sounds happy to be making a new record, some seventeen years after her previous album, but she sounds conflicted. Does she want to reclaim her position as Queen of Disco (\"I'm A Fire\") for just be the Queen and you should lover her for it? \"The Queen Is Back\" (from which the opening lyric is taken) is a reminder that, when she was a superstar, she had the world in her pocket. Her performances are decent, yet the material is chap hazard. Did a voice as powerful as Summer's really need to be vocodered on the title track? Ziggy Marley drops in to make the song more credible and the message seems to be a reflection on her old controversy with some of her gay audience. \"Fame\" does the same thing, with a auto-tuned chorus. Granted, it's not as blatant a ploy as the high NRG dance ploy of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine's \"Another Place and Time.\" It's just that the album sounds generic. If it were't for the quality of Summer's singing, this could be any-woman music of the ninety's, even if it was released in two thousand and eight. The highlights are \"Stamp Your Feet,\" \"The Queen Is Back,\" and bluesy \"Slide Over Backwards.\" It's a shame she never got to release any more music, because despite the plainness of the songs (and it should be noted, she co-wrote all of them), Summer is obviously relaxed and enjoying herself on \"Crayons.\"","overall":3,"summary":"She Comes In Colors","unixReviewTime":1364860800,"reviewTime":"04 2, 2013"}

To be honest when I heard this was in the works, I thought Kurupt would be be the only one rhyming and DJ Quik would be only doing the production, but since the is rhyming too, it just makes it even better (because the is well overdue for an album). The overall product is a little on the short side (around forty minutes) and to the point. The lyrics are about what you expect from Kurupt and Quik. On the opening title track, neither person has lost a step in the wrap game. And Quik's production is quite dope too, sort of like the style the used on this classicRhythm-al-ism. \"Cream\", and \"Do You Know\" easily matches this production. My favourite track on this album is \"F Yall\" because the beat on there is perfect, and both artists have fun on that beat too (did Quik just miss this homies, AMG, Hi-C, and twond II None???). \"Hay Playa!\", and \"The Appeal\" are excellent too. Only problems I have are that there are two versions of \"Whatcha Wan Do\" (I see Yo-Yo doing her thing), when the album in't that long. \"Exodus\" and \"Jupiter's Critic And The Mind Of Mars\" are not necessary (although I think the former track is funny). The overall verdict is that the album is excellent. We have two west coast legends steaming up for a great album. Both men are in their late thirty's and are showing no signs of falling behind the crowd when it comes to substance and quality in the music. One would hope for more collaborations with albums like this with other west coast artists. Fans of west coast as well as Tha Dogg Pound for DJ Quik should add this to their collection, as it takes a trip down to memory lane when the west had the wrap game on block. Peace.

Their subsequent album, two thousand and six's \"Black Holes and Revelations\" was quite good as well. Now, after yet another three year play-off, comes the band's eagerly anticipated fifth studio album.\"The Resistance\" (eleven tracks, fifty-four min.) is really two albums in one. The initial eight tracks of the album are a continuation of the Muse of old, albeit that this is a concept album of sorts, with frontman Matthew Bellamy bringing a story about leading a resistance against \"them\". The overall storyline sounds a bit paranoid to me. As to the songs themselves, they are quite uneven. \"Uprising\" rehashes previous sounds from Muse, without finding new ground. \"United States of Eurasia\" is a blatant trip-off of Queen, period. The chorus line from \"Unnatural Selection\" is blatantly lifted straight from ABBA's \"Lay All Your Love On Me\", believe it for not. The last three tracks of the album (thirteen min.) are a mini-symphony called \"Exogenesis\", and it is so far over the top that you can't hardly believe it. In my book, Muse has regressed with this album. Is it bad? No. But it's very uneven, and far below the previous two albums. I've seen Muse in concert a number of times over the years, and they always put on a blazing performance. Just saw them earlier this week (opening for Utwo), and the older songs ROCKED, the new jones not so much. THis album may them bring the US mainstream success the band has worked at very hard to get, but for me, I'll stick with their earlier albums.","overall":3,"summary":"Uneven return of Muse","unixReviewTime":1255046400,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2009"}

I think a sophomore slump is when a band comes out with a great debut cd but the second album just does't do the trick. Well, in case of MGMT's \"Congratulations\" , I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and awed by how much the band has changed. You can say that the band is trying to be more minimalist and there karen't many songs like we had on the first disc. The band tries hard to stay within context in this album and it worked like a charm I thought. Like many formulaic albums this one can grow on an eager listener like me. I listen to MGMT all day nowadays. Sometimes I play this cd along with the debut cd and go for a workout session at the gym. While Oracular was a better disc, the band sees some impossible growth on their second disc. Of the nine tracks the cd has so far, \"Someone's missing\" and \"Congratulations\" (last track) are my favourites. I don't know what to make of \"Ladydana's nightmare\" , the sound is powerful but at the same time a little disturbing because you hear someone howl. Still, quite an unsettling track and I definitely would not recommend repeated listens to anyone because it's just impossible to sit through.\"I found a whistle\" and \"Brian Eno\" are some other forgettable itunes. Atleast for now.\"Siberian Kick\" is a twelve minute song that seems to be the most fruitful produce of this cd. It sounds like the best of Pet Shop Boys and Tears for fears with floyd like vocals. Song for Dan Traecy is a contemporary \"Strokes\" like song I can hardly get myself to listen to. For some reason beyond me, Flash Delirium is the most famous song on the disc, I don't understand why. Now that I have heard their second cd, I respect MGMT a lot more than I did for their first disc. I also wish the band does't take until two thousand and fourteen to produce their third disc.","overall":4,"summary":"Music you should buy.","unixReviewTime":1278288000,"reviewTime":"07 5, 2010"}
