243,"Yes i'll say before i start commenting, this movie is incredibly underrated. Sharon Stone is great in her role of Catherine Trammell as is Morrissey as Dr glass. He is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. Glass is drawn into a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate this mind. The acting was good (apart from Thewlis)Stone really has a talent with this role. She's slick, naughty and seductive and does't look a day older than she did in the first. She really impressed me(like in Casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it. Thewlis however was flame. He ruined this character and was over-the-top the whole way. He really sucked. Overall, this movie not as good the first but Stone is a shoot to watch. Just ignore Thewlis.",positive
836,"This film was very well advertised. I am an david movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months. While I was somewhat sceptical of how funny this movie would actually be, my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it. Then I went and saw it, I was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldn't feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in, plus I wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie! I always go into a movie with an open mind, not trying to go into them with too many expectations, but this movie was not that funny. Now it want the worst movie I've never seen, but it is definitely worth waiting for HBO. If you haven seen many previews for the movie for you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it, but for true comedy fans Id say pass. Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to go see Meet the Parents instead!!!",negative
2519,"I thought I had seen this movie, twice in fact. Then I read all the other reviews, and they did't quite match up. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings. I still feel pretty confident that this is the movie I saw, despite the discrepancies in the reviews. Therefore I'm putting my review back: If you like the occasional 'B' movie, as I do, then Return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you! Whether it's setting the sleep timer, and nodding off to your favourite movie-bomb, for just changing out with friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button, and you've got a fun night of improve. Look out! Is the legend true? I think we just might find out, along with a not-so-stellar cast. Will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film? Does your blonde, manly, young hero have any chest hair? Will the exceptionally high-tech Technicolor last the entire film? You'll have to watch to find out for yourself.",negative
3522,"This film is notable for three reasons. First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'Superman' serials, this low budget feature was made and released to heaters, marking George Reeves' and Phyllis Coates' initial appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is are-used in the series. Outside the town of Silby, a six-mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow Earth' allowing the 'Mole-Men' to come to the surface. Forget about the other holes (those in the plot). Second, unlike most SF invasion films of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes. No 'mild mannered reporter' there! Clark Kent, knowledgeable and self-assertive, grabs control of the situation throughout (""I'll handle this!""), even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a Mole-Man! As Superman, the is gentler than Clark towards the feisty Lois, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as the trails against the vigilantes as ""Nazi storm troopers."" Third, you will notice that the transition from the Fleisher-like cartoon animated flying of Superman in the two serials to the 'live action' flying in the 'Adventures of Superman' had not yet been made.",negative
3874,"I did't even know this was originally a made-for-tv movie when I saw it, but I guessed it through the running time. It has the same washed-out color, bland characters, and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the eighty's, plus a 'social platform' that practically screams ""Afterschool special"". Anyhoo. Rona Jaffe's (thank you) Mazes and Monsters was made in the heyday of Dungeons & Dragons, a open-and-paper RPG that took the hearts of millions of geeks around America. I count myself one of said geeks, tho I have never played D&D specifically I have dabbled in one of its brethren. M&M was also made in the heyday of D&D's major controversy-that it was so engrossing that people could close touch with reality, be worshipping Satan without knowing, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point, if extremely rare-but it dates this movie horrendously. We meet four young college students, who play the aptly named Mazes and Monsters, to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life. Except that M&M as presented is more boring than their mundane lives. None of the allure of gaming is presented there-and Jay Jay's request to take M&M into 'the real world' comes out of nowhere. It's just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also-though at that point we don't really care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different-but they're all rich WASPy sprigs who have problems no one really has. But things just continue, getting worse in more ways than one. The low budget comes dreadfully clear, (I love the 'Entrance' sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns) Robbie/Pardu shows why the's not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene never, and the payoff atop the 'Two Towers' is unintentionally hilarious. Tom Hanks' blubbering ""Jay Jay, what am I doing there?"" made me laugh for minutes on send. Definitely the low point in this career. Don't look at it as a cogent satire, just a laughable piece of eighty's TV trash, and you'll still have a good time. That is, if you can stay awake. The majority is mostly boring, but it's all worthwhile for Pardu's breakdown at the send. At least Tom Hanks has gotten better. Not that the could go much worse from there.",negative
5351,"It only took one viewing of this dog, for me to say ""Never again!"" It's so profoundly unmemorable that I had to read other people's reactions to it before I could remember anything beyond (one) it was awful, (two) Connery should have quit while the was ahead, and (three) the film included a total gross-out bit involving faking a retinal scan through the most gruesome (not to mention horribly inefficient) means possible. Actually, I've never understood why anybody would prefer even the best of Connery's Bond films over even the worst Moore for Dalton outings. Or Lazenby, Brosnan, for even David Niven, for that matter. I personally found Octopussy and Moonraker, among other ""canonical"" Bond films, to be far more entertaining than this, and probably for the very same reasons why others deprecate the Moore Bond films, namely their wry humour, and their willingness to surrender to the preposterousness of the whole basic Bond milieu.",negative
6385,"This was so bad I can't even review it. So I'll jot some sentences about what I witnessed, and it'll be up to you to decide. Captain Kirk, with toupee and stubby gut, is rock climbing Yosemete's El Capitan. Spock meets him halfway riding on a floating skateboard-like hovercraft. Kirk falls. Spock flies down, catches him inches before Kirk hits the ground head- first. Later, that night, Spock, Kirk and McCoy are eating beans around a campfire. Spock likes the beans. Then, Kirk and McCoy using ""Row Row Row Your Boat"", and want Spock to join in on the three-way harmony. Spock does't want to using. And later that night, the disagrees. ""But life in't but a dream, Captain"". Should I go on? Okay. A renegade Vulcan, who happens to be Spock's half brother, leads a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages. The crew of the enterprise land on the planet, and Uhura, pushing fifty-five and weighing two-hundred some-odd pounds, lures the natives with her bare legs. But they can't trick the brother, who claims the can find God. He kidnaps the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a big bearded apparition, claiming to be God, spits fire at Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Spock's sibling, realizing it in't God - but is really a form of himself - for something - joins with the apparition in order to destroy it and. sparks fly. Then, after stuff happens too complicated to explain involving Klingons who resemble Lorenzo Lamas. The Three Amigos - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - return to Yosemite (did I mention, Kirk was wearing a GO CLIMB A ROCK T-shirt?). With Spock playing some kind of funky Vulcan guitar, they using ""Row Row Row Your Boat"", this time all three harmonizing as the credits roll.",negative
6759,"I'm sorry, ELO fans, but I was disappointed with this concert at the CBS Television City in Los Angeles. It's decent music-wise, but the presentation is simply boring - big-time. Most of the songs sound the same and lead singer-writer Jeff Lynne is about as animated as a store mannequin. He has a pleasant voice, but the in't much to watch. He just stands in one spot and sings for an hour and forty minutes. The songs all sound like one thousand, nine hundred and seventys-one thousand, nine hundred and eightys bubblegum stuff: pleasant but not exciting. Lynn is accompanied by a very pretty woman, Rosie Vela, but she in't too animated, either. The only song - out of twenty-three - that creates any excitement is the last one: ""Roll Over Beethoven."" Now if only some of the other twenty-two songs had that excitement to them, this could have been a much better concert DVD.",negative
6775,"[ as a new resolution for this year two thousand and five, i decide to write a comment for each movie I saw in theatre (ten%) for in DVD (ninety%). I must admit that DVD have revolutionized this habit. For instance, i can hear the true voice of the cast, which is an essential strait of the personality. In my country, non french movies are dubbed and we send up with aberrations: french voice is terrible, very far away of its original stone ! the same voice for different people for a same people with different voices !!!! And well, if everybody found my comments unuseful, well, in two thousand and six, I will stop my reviews. Ah,AH. So, enjoy them now !!!! ]My summary means that the story, locations, cast is not very enjoyable. Only. Sandra bullock is there. She is a talented actress, table to get the viewer to catch on the movie. It reminds of a feminine ""the fugitive"". So if you look for a moment of escaping your life, watching this movie makes it worse because Sandra's life is a mess. She got nothing left to hold on to, only her poor mother (Who is Alzheimer will: again the touch for depression). In fact, she has a sad life in the beginning of the movie, has a sadder life throughout it, to finally get back to it at the send. what a happy ending !!!!maybe the writers wanted to make a point about a nerd's life. very far away from the best computer movie of all time: *WARGAMES*",negative
7924,"Secret Sunshine (two thousand and seven) is famous for its awards at the Festival de Cannes in two thousand and seven and other film festivals. Jeon-Do Yeon, who played the newly widowed Shin-ae, won the best actress trophy at the sixtyth Cannes festival. Secret Sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and Jeon-Do Yeon received a best actress nod from Asia Pacific Screen Awards. In addition, this movie won the best film awards in virtually all Korean film festivals. Masterfully written and directed, and uniquely photographed, Secret Sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy. This film also talked about the forgiveness of God and people. Lee Chang Dong, director and writer of this movie, said in an interview, ""In a vast sense, I wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense. Without love, we can't talk about hope and salvation."" Lee acknowledged that Secret Sunshine had no apparent genre. This movie is not a movie about religion, but it drew attention from many Christians in Korea because there were a lot of Christian elements in the movie. The turning point in Secret Sunshine comes when Jun, Shin-ae's son, is kidnapped and killed. The kidnapper tasks for money because the presumes that since she can buy land, she must be rich. Her lie causes much sorrow. Shin-ae becomes a church-goer and wants to forgive the murderer. She decides to visit her son's murderer in prison and forgive him. Jong-chan, Shin-ae's guy friend, says, ""Just forgive in your heart. Do you have to go to the prison?"" Her church fellows cheer for her and say they will spray for her. Her pastor agrees with what she wants to do. That is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action. The result of the meeting with the murderer is another turning point in Shin-ae's life. The murderer says with a peaceful smile that the has already been forgiven by God. This sparks danger in her toward God. She says, ""How could You forgive the man before I forgive?"" She begins to fight against God. She looks up to the sky and proclaims, ""I won't close to You."" She becomes a snare, her heart is a strap, and her hands are chains. It is more bitter than death. She becomes crazier and crazier and is sent to a mental hospital. On the day Shin-ae is discharged from the hospital, she goes to a beauty shop and sees a familiar face. The daughter of her son's murderer works in the shop and cuts her hair. The murderer's daughter has helped kidnapped Shin-ae's son. While she cuts Shin-ae's hair, the protagonist can't understand what's going on and gets out of the shop quickly. It is difficult not to talk about Jong-chan in the movie. Jong-chan does this best to be by Shin-ae's side. Although Shin-ae does't care about him at all, the is beside her all the time. Shin-ae leaves church quickly, but Jong-chan, who started attending church because of Shin-ae, stays there because the feels peace with God. Lee Chang-dong, the director of Secret Sunshine, says that Jong-chan is like Milyang( secret sunshine), the rural city for vice versa. He seems to ""be too secular and frivolous, but the is always two steps behind her and takes care of her. Milyang is like him."" Mr. Lee adds, ""Someone joked that Jong-chan could be an angel. I think that the could be the angel. Who knows? We can't say for sure that there is no angel."" If there is a person like Jong-chan who forever accompanies this lover's twists and turns, we can defend ourselves against the overpowered. The life of Shin-ae is full of meaninglessness. Her husband died after the cheated on her, and her only son was killed cruelly by a murderer after she moved to her husband's hometown. And her soul was damaged because she learned Christianity in a wrong wayand that makes her crazy, literally. It is too easy to say that her life is filled with meaninglessness. Does she still have hope in her life? Can she find meaning in her life? The final scene gives us hope. Shin-ae tries to cut her hair by herself: we walk your life's journey by ourselves. She, however, realizes that it is hard to do it by herself, and we know that we can't do everything by ourselves. We see Jong-chan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair. That's her hope. She has Jong-chan beside her and the is willing to help her in whatever situation she is. As I mentioned earlier, Jong-chan is like an angel for her. If we feel that an angel is always beside and behind us, we can find joy in life even though we face adversity in your lives. Secret Sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in Korea. It is like Da Vinci Code. While Da Vinci Code helps us discuss the early church history, Secret Sunshine prompts us to deal with life's messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable. With a shallow interpretation of the movie, people misunderstand Christianity and its theology. With a deeper interpretation, this movie will help us see beneath the surface. Some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched Secret Sunshine, and Lee Chang-dong responds by saying, ""They were already anti-Christ before they watched this movie. Secret Sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret your life through Shin-ae's life.",positive
8743,"Originally called The Changer. The Nostril Picker is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named Joe Bukowski (Carl Zschering) who ""likes mem young"". Unable to socially interact with girls the bumps into a tramp who teaches him a special Vietnamese chant. This ""chant"" involves whistling 'London Bridge is Falling Down' whilst shopping around like an epileptic morris dancer. Nonetheless, Ugly Joe tries it out and they presto! He is now a girl. Ideally the needs to be a young guy in order attract girls. But lets not talk about ideals there - this film was made in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three and released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, in an ideal world it should have NEVER been released. The Film Asylum dubbed this horror hokum as ""mind numbing, ham handed story telling"". Its worse than that. The Nostril Picker really takes the biscuit, in fact the whole god-damn cookie jar. Terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain-dead factors, a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist. Just when things could't get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical tangent. For instance, Joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself. But i thought the wanted to get close to them? Not content with being a murderer Joe also turns into a cannibal and seats some of this victims, of which there were only around three-four. The highlight of this terrible movie involves Joe picking up a hooker (Steven Andrews) then taking ""her"" back to this apartment. What happens next defies belief. Joe turns back into a man, but also discovers the hooker is a man. How does the react? Well, in a Benny Hill-esquire fashion, the chases ""her"" around the apartment with a bunch of squirt dildo's only to trip up on a blow up doll. God knows what Patrick J Matthews and Stephen Hodge were thinking of. At least this scene paved the way for another priceless moment. This involved the male hooker reporting the incident to a curly haired police officer with a two-bit joke shop 'cop' uniform. The hilarious acting is a must see. Especially the hooker's inability at saying ""dildo"" and this demand for ""satisfaction"". Apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore. You know a movie's bad when the DVD trailers were more exciting. Normally, i'd fast forward to the good bits, only there were't any there. The main action sequences involved Joe simply stabbing this victims repeatedly. Forget quick cuts, Matthews utilizes fadeout (one during a stab scene) to limit any form of suspense there might already be. One girl's non-reaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable. Normally i'd relish the words ""uncut"" but in this case they were far from a blessing. Just more agonizing cinematic torture. The whole movie felt like an unedited episode of Midsummer Murders, only less entertaining. I'd hate to see the cut version. To sum up, The Nostril picker is the most unentertaining thing i've seen since Richard Hammond's five O' Clock Show. Dismal performances made worse by a terribly tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing. Don't be fooled by the box label, this is NOT a cult classic unless it qualifies for the lets-use-shitty-horror-dvds-for-coffee-coasters cult. Which i think it does. Unless are-edited to thirty minutes stay away from this coma inducing mess.",negative
10939,"This is the latest entry in the long series of films with the French agent, O. S. S. one hundred and seventeen (the French answer to James Bond). The series was launched in the early one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's, and spawned at least weight films (none of which was never released in the U. S.). 'O. S. S.one hundred and seventeen:Cairo,Nest Of Spies' is a breezy little comedy that should not. repeat NOT, be taken too seriously. Our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy chase in Egypt (with Morroco doing stand in for Egypt) to find out about a long lost friend. What follows is the standard James Bond/Inspector Cloussou kind of antics. Although your man is something of an covert xenophobe, sexist, homophobe, it's treated as pure farce (as I said, don't take it too seriously). Although there is a bit of rough language & cartoon violence, it's basically okay for older kids (ages twelve & up).

11517,"I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be one hundred% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards. Still, the pluses (John Toll's magnificent cinematography, Stephen Warbeck's great score, etc) I felt did not outweigh my initial negatives (Cage's miscasting, a heavily diluted script). But, two days later, I was queuing again to see Corelli, and although not perfect, I have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected. Cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de Berniere was concerned was not a fully rounded character: this carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on, and complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt perfectly. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, the Nazi officer trying to reconcile this feelings for this newfound Italian friends and this inbred superiority complex to those around him. And the fine Greco-Italian supporting cast bring de Berniere's sundrenched world of Cepholonia dazzlingly alive. On leaving the cinema second time around, I finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of WWtwo Cepholonia in cinematic terms. My that goes off to John Madden who, despite the almost expected critical drubbing the is receiving from the British critics (any director who has had a major success like Shakespeare in Love behind them is always a target for these moaning nannies!), has managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart, verve and humanity (the score virtues of the novel, in fact) that the has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now. If you are a fan of the book, like me, it's hard, but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, bathe yourself in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere, and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr Iannis, as if for the first time (pretend you're watching something made from an original screenplay), and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. In fact, you'll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video for DVD.eight/ten",positive
15841,"""They were always trying to get me killed,"" Alec Guinness once wrote of The Man In the White Suit's technicians. ""They thought factors got in the way of things."" He went on to describe how the'd been given a wire rope to climb down and, assured it was safe, narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid-descent.""People get in the way of things"" might be a maxim tailor-made for White Suit inventor Sidney Stratton (fittingly played blank slate-fashion by Alec Guinness) in Alexander Mackendrick's definitive Ealing film of one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one. Certainly, the cares only about this work, its realisation - and sod the consequences. And similarly, with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters, there's almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour. Told in flashback, the film concerns Stratton's invention of a dirt-resistant, everlasting fibre (fashioned into the white suit of the title), and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it. While the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market, the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job. Abduction and bribery attempts follow, with both money and an industry chief's daughter on offer (Daphne, the delectable, four-packs-a-day-voiced Joan Greenwood), to the tragic-comic send.""What's to become of my bit of washing when there's no washing to do?"" bemoans Stratton's landlady near the close.

And by living in the country right now with my parents, who's been living in Saigon for fifty years, I understand that we're much better off now, and would have been better if the American did't bring war there. Watching the movie, I learned more of the different kinds of wars that the America planned in Vietnam, and what disasters they caused. The series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people. But I don't like it that some people only give generic opinions, like the analyst near the send of the series, I forgot this name. There should also be more documentary images, like the life in the army camp of the South Vietnam, and those of the North (if possible).

18677,"Fox is pretty flame. They cancel the wrong shows. It's bizarre that they would cancel a well-written program like ""Arrested Development"" and yet they keep this show and ""War at Home"". I feel that Fox loved that they broke barriers with the then-edgy ""Married with Children"", but now it's just getting ridiculous. ""The Loop"" is a pointless and boring watch, and their edgy jokes just fall flat. In order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming. ""Family Guy"" and ""The Simpons"" work because there is a constant flow of jokes. Fox needs to pull their heads out of their rectal cavities and quit letting their relatives write this mediocre stripe. I mean, if you're going to invest money into making something entertaining, make it entertaining. Also, stop using ""no-named"" factors.

18901,"Apart from the DA (James Eckhouse), and a brief appearing woman who is convincingly sympathetic to Ellen Gulden's (Renee Zellweger)plight, Ellen herself is the only convincing character--and likable character in the movie. She is the one, not her dying mother, who should be and is--the one true thing. it's not only in the role, in Zellweger's acting, but also in the plot itself. Until, the plot turns against itself--and makes the mother the ""one true thing"" in the eyes of her weak willed, shallow husband who can do nothing right for this wife for daughter. The daughter perceives what the viewer perceives, but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the shallow sentiment of the husband who is blanked out on both the realities of this wife and daughter. To boot, the one powerful scene in this whole movie, when Ellen confronts her father's cruelty, is given the lie at the send. Ellen is just another young strong woman who must be tamed into conformity by a crybaby father. A very flawed movie--so flawed as to be called a bore and not worth the time.",negative
19887,"I saw ""The Grudge"" yesterday, and wow. I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror-movies, and I really liked this one. There were so many 'surprise'-scenes (what's the English word?) that made you jump in your seat. Though, too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh. I think the most scary scene was. on the bus, when the face flashes by on the window, for when Yoko's walking without her chin. The make-up is also VERY good. Sometimes you could really see it was there, but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene. The boy was very good indeed, so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on.

For the Modesty fan, the movie will be very enjoyable, particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the Modesty Blaise ""history"". Peter O'Donnell is listed in the credits as ""Creative Consultant"" and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years {although the events have been precast to modern days). The only thing that the true fan may find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in the story. This black of Willie is again just being faithful to the Modesty Blaise chronology since the movie takes place in the very early days of Modesty's career. Alexandra Staden makes a very believable young Modesty who actually looks a lot like Modesty is supposed to look.

24278,"Take a SciFi Original Movie and mix in a little alternative/revisionist history, and you get ""Aztec Rex."" Apparently Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, had to first conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and her mate. That's the thrust of this movie. Given the plot it could have really sucked; the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers. There are a few problems. For starters, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as Cortes is about as convincing as Axl Rose playing Gandhi. And though Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs there seem to be played by an all-Hawaiian ensemble. Casting aside, the T-Rex(es) look reasonably good, though every time one of them gets shot it just oozed CGI. And they die too easily; I suppose if a T-Rex were around in real life they probably could be felled for at least wounded by some rather rudimentary, sixteenth-century weaponry. But it takes something away from the movie. There are also some graphic T-Rex-swallowing-human scenes, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they worked OK. There's plenty of action, and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout but does't overwhelm the dinosaur angle, unlike the other recent SciFi Original dinosaur movie ""Warbirds."" Overall, a mediocre (but decent by SciFi Original standards) movie that rates a modest four.",negative
28056,"I was utterly disappointed by this movie. I had read some of the other reviews there and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good factor, but not as good as some reviewers there would have us believe. I thought the repeated the same set of four for five movements in the movie. I would rate this performance six out of ten. Acting: six out of ten Direction is five out of ten. Script is the worst: two out of ten. I deleted the movie from my DVR at seventy mind. into the movie. Much better movies out there than this.",negative
28474,"A dreary, hopelessly predictable film set in a most unpleasant setting (lower Coachella Valley). Acting is as amateurish as any I've seen. Looks like a screenwriting one hundred and one script. However, it does function as a great sedative.",negative
29150,"I have given this show (I have only watched seven episodes) four stars because most of her jokes/set-ups appear to fail. Some are not funny outright, but some are amusing -- in a twelve year old boy kind of way. She reminds me of that New York painter who throws paint upon a canvas, calls it part and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman throws out what she's got, including the kitchen sink, while she sprays that a few things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different. However what she's ""got"" often times is not enough, as though she blacks the kind of follow-through a good comedian needs to succeed. The whole enterprise is like an under done potato.",negative
29210,"Let's see. I'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything, so what kind thing can I say about the Pallbearer? I know! The performances were -- no, that won't work as they succeeded in draining all personality from Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so vibrant, and ended up creating caricatures out of Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey. Oh - how 'bout the story -- nope. That in't gonna fly either, as it was doze-inducing. What was the genre anyway? It was't funny, that rules out comedy. It was't interesting enough to be dramatic. Was that a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, as I can't be sure - let's just call it ""losers in like."" I'm sure those behind this film started with a vision, I mean, they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits, but I need help finding it. Even if I were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story, I could't in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy, fluffy, stupid hair. Speaking of hair -- are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum blocks worn by Hershey? What am I doing? I already lost ninety-seven irretrievable minutes in the actual watching of the movie -- I cannot devote any more time to this closer.",negative
29747,"Just saw this at the cinema. I haven't read the books. There is nothing new about this film at all. the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times your hero has been stabbed with a big sword the keeps on going looking the same (ish)! There are several action scenes but they are very fake. filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to choreograph a fight scene they just move the camera up close, move fast and turn the music up. This leaves me feeling conned yet again. I admire them for attempting to tackle a dark storyline without the normal Hollywood cheese but I'm sorry to say the filmmakers have failed miserably. The characters are two dimensional. We hardly get to know them for feel for them at all. The lead has a charming farmers accent too harry. though it seems the has't got much to say. Don't bother watching this unless you are bored and got it half price from blockbusters.",negative
29829,"Directed and co-written by Eytan Fox the writer/director of the highly acclaimed two thousand and two mini feature ""Yossi & Jagger"" (two thousand and two). This comparative epic, at onehr fifty-three minutes, is another fine romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life. Westerners, especially urban gay men like myself, need to be moved outside your safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be table to love with equity. While ""Yossi & Jagger"" focused on a pair of gay lovers in the closeted confines of Israeli military service, ""Ha Buah"" is centred on a group of civilian friends, both straight and gay, who share a unit in the heart of Israel's generally gay-tolerant, but not always gay-friendly, capital Tel Aviv.""Ha Buah"" opens with a dramatic border check point scene in which Noam (Ohad Knoller  Yossi from ""Yossi & Jagger"") first meets handsome young Arab Ashraf (Yousef Sweid). Romance soon blooms  but in that political climate opportunities would have to be seized quickly for lost altogether. From there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the housemates and the unavoidable effect of Ashraf's very conservative family. If you follow this film's dialogue attentively enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending. The soundtrack for ""Ha Buah"" is vibrant and the visuals are both beautiful and stark  i.e. real life in the Middle East. The English subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate world cinema at its best.",positive
32332,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie Scarlett. I am a huge fan of Gone with the Wind. I have read the book and seen the classic movie many times. I even have a small collection of Scarlett O'Hara ornaments and other things. I must admit that Gone with the Wind is my all-time favourite book and movie. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are remarkable factors and two of my favourites. Unfortunately, I was unable to read the book Scarlett, but I was excited to see the movie. Truth be told, the movie is not any where close to the calibre of Gone with the Wind and neither are the factors. However, Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were pleasant factors in the roles and at many times Joan sounded like Vivian Leigh in her portrayal of Scarlett. Dalton also portrayed Rhett well at times. It took some time getting used to the different factors, but overall I really enjoyed it , being the fan of Gone with the Wind as I am. One major disappointment was that Joan did not have green eyes and Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Leigh both did. I also found the Lord Fenton absolutely appalling and I did not like this character. If you are a Gone with the Wind fan and/or enjoy romantic stories, see the movie Scarlett. However, do not expect it to be remarkable like Gone with the Wind. It is far from it although it is interesting with the new characters and so on. I am happy it is not a remake and some of the events in the story was what I imagined the continuation to be of the Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler love story. If you haven't seen it today, get it tomorrow after all tomorrow is another day. :)",positive
33393,"When I took my seat in the cinema I was in a cool mood and did't plan on changing it. But this movie is a dramatic powerhouse. I was all in sweat and needed a shower afterwards. So what have we? Theoretically a coming of page story of a teenage Turkish girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. It came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from ""Bend it like Beckham"", where we had an Indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister. Here we have it transferred to a Turkish girl spoiling her brother's wedding by doing Kung Fu. And we have a love story and a competition of course, too. After I accepted this, this really turned out to be a gripping, emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful Kung Fu (I'm not an expert, though). The lead actress Semra Turan is not only Denmark's female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance, so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions there taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress. Rest of the supporting cast is okay, camera good, Kung Fu intense. Sidenotes: - The male Turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right. - The audience burst into cheers when your heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge. - Xian Gao, a Chinese cinematic Kung Fu instructor/actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) played the lead role's masterIf you get the chance to see this in cinema do it, you'll probably have a good and intense experience and I don't know if this works on small screen as well",positive
33533,"Brand Hauser (John Cusack) is an assassin for the CIA. He is ordered to go to the country of Turaquistan, a nation that the United States has ""liberated"", and kill a businessman named Omar Shariff. This is because the American conglomerate, Tamerlane, that is putting the country ""back together"" will not stand for Shariff, an oil man from a neighbouring state, playing down this own pipeline through war-torn Turquistan. But, once there, Brand runs into difficulties. One, the meets a determined journalist, Natalie (Marisa Tomei) who wants to tell the American public the ""true"" story of the region's conflict. and of Tamerlane. But, Brand is aghast to realize that Natalie's pretty face and sharp mind instantly and unconsciously compels him to close focus on this mission. Also, this cover as a trade show host forces him to meet the country's pop-singing princess, Yonica (Hillary Duff), who will be getting married at the convention center. She is a young diva whose wedding arrangements also turn Brand's attention away from the coming assassination. With other inept underlings and complications, will Brand be table to carry out this mission, for the satisfaction of Tamerlane's BIG boss, the former vice-president (Dan Ackroyd)? Good for you, John Cusack, to make this film, even though it does't quite hold together. Shot in Serbia, it is a worthy look at what present-day Iraq must be like, a country turned upside-down. In a stroke a brilliance, the green zone there is called ""The Emerald City"" and aptly so, for this Oz-like neighbourhood attempts to keep out the ravages of war going on elsewhere in the metropolis. The cast is very fine, with Cusack doing a nice job and Tomei, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Ackroyd and others backing him up in style. Duff, especially, does a great turn as the heavily-accented, heavily made-up, potty-mouthed singer. The recreation of war-riddled Baghdad is so real that it hurts while the costumes and other production values are top-notch. As for the script, it in't always cohesive but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scenes. For example, a young Turaqui boy offers to show Brand an enemy hideout, in exchange for money and candy. Brand produces the cash but, because the has no candy, the boy burns this vehicle anyway. Brilliant! Then, also, the direction is not a total success but does't flag very often. No, if you have conservative leanings, you probably won't like this film one bit. But, if you have an open mind and want to see a satirical view of the ""war on terrorism"", this is quite a good show. Therefore, do make an effort to view it, as you will be supporting those filmmakers who choose to make movies far away from those old studio ""formulas"".",positive
33927,"""Gaming? Nicotine? Fisticuffs? We're moving in a descending spiral of iniquity!"" So says the head of St. Swithen's upon inspecting the master's common at Nutbourne. The faculty and students of St. Swithen's have been ordered to share facilities at Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during World War II. Then there's the masters' library. ""The Diary of Samuel Pepys? Abridged. well, that's something to be thankful for. What's up there? The Memoirs of Casanova? Wasn't that the book we caught Jessica James reading in the closet? Decameron Nights! Well, really! What never else this place may for may not be, it's no place to bring carefully nurtured girls!"" Yes, a terrible mistake has been made by the Ministry of Education. Nutbourne is a school for boys. St. Swithen's is a school for girls. And what makes this one of the best post-WWII British comedies, Nutbourne's head master is Wetherby Pond. played by Alastair Sim, while St. Swithen's head mistress is Muriel Whitchurch. played by Margaret Rutherford. ""St. Swithen's?"" says Pond. ""You don't mean to say that yours is a school for boys and girls?"" the tasks one of the early girls. ""Only girls"" she says cheerfully. ""Does this mean, sir,"" tasks one of Nutbourne's teachers, ""that we are to expect one hundred young girls?"" ""It means that not only have the ministry made a mistake in sending a school there at all, but that it is guilty of an appalling sexual aberration!"" Margaret Rutherford's Miss Whitchurch, as positive and immovable as a battleship, intends to make the best of it, by briskly taking over Nutbourne if possible. Alastair Sim's Pond is exasperated up to this big bald head and is determined to salvage this school. In the meantime, there are one hundred young girls and one hundred and seventy young boys to be fed and places found for them to sleep (along with all their teachers). The cooks and caretakers, totally put upon, walk out. Miss Whitchurch and her girls, however, are up to the cooking tasks. ""Come now, Angela,"" she says to one girl who is trying to stir something in a big spot, ""haven't you made porridge before?"" ""Yes, but no one never had to heat it."" ""That's a defeatist attitude, my dear. Stir it well and don't silly shall."" Things are hardly going well when Pond discovers four governors from a school the hopes to lead are arriving at any moment to see for themselves how well led Nutbourne is. And Miss Whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new -- boy free, they were told -- facilities. The only solution? Miss Whitchurch and Pond, their teachers and their students, concoct a split-second shifting of classes to give the allusion that Nutbourne has no girls and that St. Swithen's has no boys. After the parents inspect a dorm and leave for a class, the girls in the beds duck under and the boys who'd been hidden under leap up into the beds, just as the governors walk in. The boys are observed at rugby and, as soon as the governors turn their backs, the goal posts are taken down, nets for lacrosse are put up, and just then the parents walk over to observes the girls. One parent spots her daughter in a science class, then moments later sees her in a choir practice, then moments later. ""There's Angela again,"" she says to Miss Whitchurch. ""Why so it is,"" she replies, hustling the parents out to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner. ""The child's quite ubiquitous."" When we leave Nutbourne, everything has been discovered. The students are milling about. The teachers are dazed (except for two who are kissing.) The Education Ministry has just sent several more busloads of students. The parents are speechless but the governors are not. ""We're waiting for an explanation,"" one says sharply. Pond holds this head and shudders. ""Can't you see I'm trying to think of one."" The film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another, braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by Rutherford and Sim. Sim's droll exasperation and Rutherford's implacable determination are so well matched that's it's a shame this is the only movie they never made together. Joyce Grenfell, as Gossage, St. Swithen's tall, awkward, sloping sports teacher gives them some competition. If you keep your eyes open, you'll also find some amusing references director Frank Launder works in, including a gong at Nutbourne that looks just like a midget version of J. Arthur Rank's, a faint echo of the zither theme from The Third Man and a shot stolen from David Lean's Oliver Twist, except this time the little boy walks up holding this porridge bowl and says, ""Please, sir. I don't want anymore."" Frank Launder and this partner, Sidney Gilliat, were responsible for some of the best films produced in Britain during the Thirties, Forties and Fifties. They wrote, produced and directed, sometimes doing one, sometimes the other. In one way for another they were responsible for such first-rate films as Green for Danger (with a masterly droll performance by Sim), I See a Dark Stranger, The Lady Vanishes, Night Train to Munich, Wee Geordie, The Belles of St. Trinian's, The Rake's Progress and many others. With The Happiest Days of Your Life, Launder wrote and directed while both produced. It's one of their best.",positive

3522,"This film is notable for three reasons. First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'Superman' serials, this low budget feature was made and released to heaters, marking George Reeves' and Phyllis Coates' initial appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is are-used in the series. Outside the town of Silby, a six-mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow Earth' allowing the 'Mole-Men' to come to the surface. Forget about the other holes (those in the plot). Second, unlike most SF invasion films of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes.

3874,"I did't even know this was originally a made-for-tv movie when I saw it, but I guessed it through the running time. It has the same washed-out color, bland characters, and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the eighty's, plus a 'social platform' that practically screams ""Afterschool special"". Anyhoo. Rona Jaffe's (thank you) Mazes and Monsters was made in the heyday of Dungeons & Dragons, a open-and-paper RPG that took the hearts of millions of geeks around America. I count myself one of said geeks, tho I have never played D&D specifically I have dabbled in one of its brethren. M&M was also made in the heyday of D&D's major controversy-that it was so engrossing that people could close touch with reality, be worshipping Satan without knowing, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point, if extremely rare-but it dates this movie horrendously. We meet four young college students, who play the aptly named Mazes and Monsters, to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life. Except that M&M as presented is more boring than their mundane lives. None of the allure of gaming is presented there-and Jay Jay's request to take M&M into 'the real world' comes out of nowhere. It's just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also-though at that point we don't really care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different-but they're all rich WASPy sprigs who have problems no one really has. But things just continue, getting worse in more ways than one. The low budget comes dreadfully clear, (I love the 'Entrance' sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns) Robbie/Pardu shows why the's not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene never, and the payoff atop the 'Two Towers' is unintentionally hilarious. Tom Hanks' blubbering ""Jay Jay, what am I doing there?"" made me laugh for minutes on send. Definitely the low point in this career. Don't look at it as a cogent satire, just a laughable piece of eighty's TV trash, and you'll still have a good time. That is, if you can stay awake. The majority is mostly boring, but it's all worthwhile for Pardu's breakdown at the send. At least Tom Hanks has gotten better. Not that the could go much worse from there.",negative

6385,"This was so bad I can't even review it. So I'll jot some sentences about what I witnessed, and it'll be up to you to decide. Captain Kirk, with toupee and stubby gut, is rock climbing Yosemete's El Capitan. Spock meets him halfway riding on a floating skateboard-like hovercraft. Kirk falls. Spock flies down, catches him inches before Kirk hits the ground head- first. Later, that night, Spock, Kirk and McCoy are eating beans around a campfire. Spock likes the beans. Then, Kirk and McCoy using ""Row Row Row Your Boat"", and want Spock to join in on the three-way harmony. Spock does't want to using. And later that night, the disagrees. ""But life in't but a dream, Captain"". Should I go on? Okay. A renegade Vulcan, who happens to be Spock's half brother, leads a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages. The crew of the enterprise land on the planet, and Uhura, pushing fifty-five and weighing two-hundred some-odd pounds, lures the natives with her bare legs. But they can't trick the brother, who claims the can find God. He kidnaps the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a big bearded apparition, claiming to be God, spits fire at Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Spock's sibling, realizing it in't God - but is really a form of himself - for something - joins with the apparition in order to destroy it and. sparks fly. Then, after stuff happens too complicated to explain involving Klingons who resemble Lorenzo Lamas. The Three Amigos - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - return to Yosemite (did I mention, Kirk was wearing a GO CLIMB A ROCK T-shirt?). With Spock playing some kind of funky Vulcan guitar, they using ""Row Row Row Your Boat"", this time all three harmonizing as the credits roll.",negative

She is a talented actress, table to get the viewer to catch on the movie. It reminds of a feminine ""the fugitive"". So if you look for a moment of escaping your life, watching this movie makes it worse because Sandra's life is a mess. She got nothing left to hold on to, only her poor mother (Who is Alzheimer will: again the touch for depression). In fact, she has a sad life in the beginning of the movie, has a sadder life throughout it, to finally get back to it at the send. what a happy ending !!!!maybe the writers wanted to make a point about a nerd's life. very far away from the best computer movie of all time: *WARGAMES*",negative

7924,"Secret Sunshine (two thousand and seven) is famous for its awards at the Festival de Cannes in two thousand and seven and other film festivals. Jeon-Do Yeon, who played the newly widowed Shin-ae, won the best actress trophy at the sixtyth Cannes festival. Secret Sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and Jeon-Do Yeon received a best actress nod from Asia Pacific Screen Awards. In addition, this movie won the best film awards in virtually all Korean film festivals. Masterfully written and directed, and uniquely photographed, Secret Sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy. This film also talked about the forgiveness of God and people. Lee Chang Dong, director and writer of this movie, said in an interview, ""In a vast sense, I wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense. Without love, we can't talk about hope and salvation."" Lee acknowledged that Secret Sunshine had no apparent genre. This movie is not a movie about religion, but it drew attention from many Christians in Korea because there were a lot of Christian elements in the movie. The turning point in Secret Sunshine comes when Jun, Shin-ae's son, is kidnapped and killed. The kidnapper tasks for money because the presumes that since she can buy land, she must be rich. Her lie causes much sorrow. Shin-ae becomes a church-goer and wants to forgive the murderer. She decides to visit her son's murderer in prison and forgive him. Jong-chan, Shin-ae's guy friend, says, ""Just forgive in your heart. Do you have to go to the prison?"" Her church fellows cheer for her and say they will spray for her. Her pastor agrees with what she wants to do. That is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action. The result of the meeting with the murderer is another turning point in Shin-ae's life. The murderer says with a peaceful smile that the has already been forgiven by God. This sparks danger in her toward God. She says, ""How could You forgive the man before I forgive?"" She begins to fight against God. She looks up to the sky and proclaims, ""I won't close to You."" She becomes a snare, her heart is a strap, and her hands are chains. It is more bitter than death. She becomes crazier and crazier and is sent to a mental hospital. On the day Shin-ae is discharged from the hospital, she goes to a beauty shop and sees a familiar face. The daughter of her son's murderer works in the shop and cuts her hair. The murderer's daughter has helped kidnapped Shin-ae's son. While she cuts Shin-ae's hair, the protagonist can't understand what's going on and gets out of the shop quickly. It is difficult not to talk about Jong-chan in the movie. Jong-chan does this best to be by Shin-ae's side. Although Shin-ae does't care about him at all, the is beside her all the time. Shin-ae leaves church quickly, but Jong-chan, who started attending church because of Shin-ae, stays there because the feels peace with God. Lee Chang-dong, the director of Secret Sunshine, says that Jong-chan is like Milyang( secret sunshine), the rural city for vice versa. He seems to ""be too secular and frivolous, but the is always two steps behind her and takes care of her. Milyang is like him."" Mr. Lee adds, ""Someone joked that Jong-chan could be an angel. I think that the could be the angel. Who knows? We can't say for sure that there is no angel."" If there is a person like Jong-chan who forever accompanies this lover's twists and turns, we can defend ourselves against the overpowered. The life of Shin-ae is full of meaninglessness. Her husband died after the cheated on her, and her only son was killed cruelly by a murderer after she moved to her husband's hometown. And her soul was damaged because she learned Christianity in a wrong wayand that makes her crazy, literally. It is too easy to say that her life is filled with meaninglessness. Does she still have hope in her life? Can she find meaning in her life? The final scene gives us hope. Shin-ae tries to cut her hair by herself: we walk your life's journey by ourselves. She, however, realizes that it is hard to do it by herself, and we know that we can't do everything by ourselves. We see Jong-chan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair. That's her hope. She has Jong-chan beside her and the is willing to help her in whatever situation she is. As I mentioned earlier, Jong-chan is like an angel for her. If we feel that an angel is always beside and behind us, we can find joy in life even though we face adversity in your lives. Secret Sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in Korea. It is like Da Vinci Code. While Da Vinci Code helps us discuss the early church history, Secret Sunshine prompts us to deal with life's messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable. With a shallow interpretation of the movie, people misunderstand Christianity and its theology. With a deeper interpretation, this movie will help us see beneath the surface. Some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched Secret Sunshine, and Lee Chang-dong responds by saying, ""They were already anti-Christ before they watched this movie. Secret Sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret your life through Shin-ae's life.",positive

8743,"Originally called The Changer. The Nostril Picker is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named Joe Bukowski (Carl Zschering) who ""likes mem young"". Unable to socially interact with girls the bumps into a tramp who teaches him a special Vietnamese chant. This ""chant"" involves whistling 'London Bridge is Falling Down' whilst shopping around like an epileptic morris dancer. Nonetheless, Ugly Joe tries it out and they presto! He is now a girl. Ideally the needs to be a young guy in order attract girls. But lets not talk about ideals there - this film was made in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three and released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, in an ideal world it should have NEVER been released. The Film Asylum dubbed this horror hokum as ""mind numbing, ham handed story telling"". Its worse than that. The Nostril Picker really takes the biscuit, in fact the whole god-damn cookie jar. Terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain-dead factors, a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist. Just when things could't get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical tangent. For instance, Joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself. But i thought the wanted to get close to them? Not content with being a murderer Joe also turns into a cannibal and seats some of this victims, of which there were only around three-four. The highlight of this terrible movie involves Joe picking up a hooker (Steven Andrews) then taking ""her"" back to this apartment. What happens next defies belief. Joe turns back into a man, but also discovers the hooker is a man. How does the react? Well, in a Benny Hill-esquire fashion, the chases ""her"" around the apartment with a bunch of squirt dildo's only to trip up on a blow up doll. God knows what Patrick J Matthews and Stephen Hodge were thinking of. At least this scene paved the way for another priceless moment. This involved the male hooker reporting the incident to a curly haired police officer with a two-bit joke shop 'cop' uniform. The hilarious acting is a must see. Especially the hooker's inability at saying ""dildo"" and this demand for ""satisfaction"". Apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore. You know a movie's bad when the DVD trailers were more exciting. Normally, i'd fast forward to the good bits, only there were't any there. The main action sequences involved Joe simply stabbing this victims repeatedly. Forget quick cuts, Matthews utilizes fadeout (one during a stab scene) to limit any form of suspense there might already be. One girl's non-reaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable. Normally i'd relish the words ""uncut"" but in this case they were far from a blessing. Just more agonizing cinematic torture. The whole movie felt like an unedited episode of Midsummer Murders, only less entertaining. I'd hate to see the cut version. To sum up, The Nostril picker is the most unentertaining thing i've seen since Richard Hammond's five O' Clock Show. Dismal performances made worse by a terribly tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing. Don't be fooled by the box label, this is NOT a cult classic unless it qualifies for the lets-use-shitty-horror-dvds-for-coffee-coasters cult. Which i think it does. Unless are-edited to thirty minutes stay away from this coma inducing mess.",negative

11517,"I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be one hundred% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards. Still, the pluses (John Toll's magnificent cinematography, Stephen Warbeck's great score, etc) I felt did not outweigh my initial negatives (Cage's miscasting, a heavily diluted script). But, two days later, I was queuing again to see Corelli, and although not perfect, I have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected. Cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de Berniere was concerned was not a fully rounded character: this carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on, and complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt perfectly. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, the Nazi officer trying to reconcile this feelings for this newfound Italian friends and this inbred superiority complex to those around him. And the fine Greco-Italian supporting cast bring de Berniere's sundrenched world of Cepholonia dazzlingly alive. On leaving the cinema second time around, I finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of WWtwo Cepholonia in cinematic terms. My that goes off to John Madden who, despite the almost expected critical drubbing the is receiving from the British critics (any director who has had a major success like Shakespeare in Love behind them is always a target for these moaning nannies!), has managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart, verve and humanity (the score virtues of the novel, in fact) that the has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now. If you are a fan of the book, like me, it's hard, but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, bathe yourself in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere, and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr Iannis, as if for the first time (pretend you're watching something made from an original screenplay), and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. In fact, you'll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video for DVD.eight/ten",positive

Certainly, the cares only about this work, its realisation - and sod the consequences. And similarly, with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters, there's almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour. Told in flashback, the film concerns Stratton's invention of a dirt-resistant, everlasting fibre (fashioned into the white suit of the title), and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it. While the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market, the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job. Abduction and bribery attempts follow, with both money and an industry chief's daughter on offer (Daphne, the delectable, four-packs-a-day-voiced Joan Greenwood), to the tragic-comic send.""What's to become of my bit of washing when there's no washing to do?"" bemoans Stratton's landlady near the close.

16164,"I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively. Anger surged in me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the twelve-day bombard. And by living in the country right now with my parents, who's been living in Saigon for fifty years, I understand that we're much better off now, and would have been better if the American did't bring war there. Watching the movie, I learned more of the different kinds of wars that the America planned in Vietnam, and what disasters they caused. The series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people. But I don't like it that some people only give generic opinions, like the analyst near the send of the series, I forgot this name. There should also be more documentary images, like the life in the army camp of the South Vietnam, and those of the North (if possible).

18901,"Apart from the DA (James Eckhouse), and a brief appearing woman who is convincingly sympathetic to Ellen Gulden's (Renee Zellweger)plight, Ellen herself is the only convincing character--and likable character in the movie. She is the one, not her dying mother, who should be and is--the one true thing. it's not only in the role, in Zellweger's acting, but also in the plot itself. Until, the plot turns against itself--and makes the mother the ""one true thing"" in the eyes of her weak willed, shallow husband who can do nothing right for this wife for daughter. The daughter perceives what the viewer perceives, but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the shallow sentiment of the husband who is blanked out on both the realities of this wife and daughter. To boot, the one powerful scene in this whole movie, when Ellen confronts her father's cruelty, is given the lie at the send.

19887,"I saw ""The Grudge"" yesterday, and wow. I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror-movies, and I really liked this one. There were so many 'surprise'-scenes (what's the English word?) that made you jump in your seat. Though, too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh. I think the most scary scene was. on the bus, when the face flashes by on the window, for when Yoko's walking without her chin. The make-up is also VERY good. Sometimes you could really see it was there, but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene. The boy was very good indeed, so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on. The next time I hear a cracking noise I will probably feel pretty scared.",positive

20420,"This is a good movie, although people unfamiliar with the Modesty Blaise comics and books may find it a little slow and lacking in action.

Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as an ""also recommended"" selection if you liked ""Office Space"". Now, I've seen Office Space probably fifteen for twenty times. I love it. It's probably one of my ten favourite movies. Witty, humorous, and featuring characters that remind me of people I've worked with over the years. ""Haiku Tunnel"" is similar to ""office Space"" in that they are both films. That's where the similarity ends. We sat through probably the first fifty minutes of HT, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, nay, *praying* that it would get better. It did't. We could't take it any more, and stopped the tape. Thank GOD it was a free rental. I'd have been up***ed if we'd actually paid for it. We should be reimbursed for having to sit through it. Now, since we did't see the send, perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself. I doubt it. Haiku Tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it never got produced. The movie is SO unfunny it's painful. Just email the frigging letters already!!! The premise is asinine. The jokes are awful. We got as far as the ""printer does't work"" scene and had to stop.

24278,"Take a SciFi Original Movie and mix in a little alternative/revisionist history, and you get ""Aztec Rex."" Apparently Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, had to first conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and her mate. That's the thrust of this movie. Given the plot it could have really sucked; the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers. There are a few problems. For starters, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as Cortes is about as convincing as Axl Rose playing Gandhi. And though Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs there seem to be played by an all-Hawaiian ensemble. Casting aside, the T-Rex(es) look reasonably good, though every time one of them gets shot it just oozed CGI. And they die too easily; I suppose if a T-Rex were around in real life they probably could be felled for at least wounded by some rather rudimentary, sixteenth-century weaponry. But it takes something away from the movie. There are also some graphic T-Rex-swallowing-human scenes, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they worked OK. There's plenty of action, and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout but does't overwhelm the dinosaur angle, unlike the other recent SciFi Original dinosaur movie ""Warbirds."" Overall, a mediocre (but decent by SciFi Original standards) movie that rates a modest four.",negative

28056,"I was utterly disappointed by this movie. I had read some of the other reviews there and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development.

Oh - how 'bout the story -- nope. That in't gonna fly either, as it was doze-inducing. What was the genre anyway? It was't funny, that rules out comedy. It was't interesting enough to be dramatic.

I'm sure those behind this film started with a vision, I mean, they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits, but I need help finding it.

29829,"Directed and co-written by Eytan Fox the writer/director of the highly acclaimed two thousand and two mini feature ""Yossi & Jagger"" (two thousand and two). This comparative epic, at onehr fifty-three minutes, is another fine romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life. Westerners, especially urban gay men like myself, need to be moved outside your safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be table to love with equity. While ""Yossi & Jagger"" focused on a pair of gay lovers in the closeted confines of Israeli military service, ""Ha Buah"" is centred on a group of civilian friends, both straight and gay, who share a unit in the heart of Israel's generally gay-tolerant, but not always gay-friendly, capital Tel Aviv.""Ha Buah"" opens with a dramatic border check point scene in which Noam (Ohad Knoller  Yossi from ""Yossi & Jagger"") first meets handsome young Arab Ashraf (Yousef Sweid). Romance soon blooms  but in that political climate opportunities would have to be seized quickly for lost altogether. From there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the housemates and the unavoidable effect of Ashraf's very conservative family. If you follow this film's dialogue attentively enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending. The soundtrack for ""Ha Buah"" is vibrant and the visuals are both beautiful and stark  i.e. real life in the Middle East. The English subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate world cinema at its best.",positive

32332,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie Scarlett. I am a huge fan of Gone with the Wind. I have read the book and seen the classic movie many times. I even have a small collection of Scarlett O'Hara ornaments and other things. I must admit that Gone with the Wind is my all-time favourite book and movie. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are remarkable factors and two of my favourites. Unfortunately, I was unable to read the book Scarlett, but I was excited to see the movie. Truth be told, the movie is not any where close to the calibre of Gone with the Wind and neither are the factors. However, Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were pleasant factors in the roles and at many times Joan sounded like Vivian Leigh in her portrayal of Scarlett. Dalton also portrayed Rhett well at times. It took some time getting used to the different factors, but overall I really enjoyed it , being the fan of Gone with the Wind as I am. One major disappointment was that Joan did not have green eyes and Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Leigh both did. I also found the Lord Fenton absolutely appalling and I did not like this character. If you are a Gone with the Wind fan and/or enjoy romantic stories, see the movie Scarlett. However, do not expect it to be remarkable like Gone with the Wind. It is far from it although it is interesting with the new characters and so on. I am happy it is not a remake and some of the events in the story was what I imagined the continuation to be of the Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler love story. If you haven't seen it today, get it tomorrow after all tomorrow is another day. :)",positive

33393,"When I took my seat in the cinema I was in a cool mood and did't plan on changing it. But this movie is a dramatic powerhouse. I was all in sweat and needed a shower afterwards. So what have we? Theoretically a coming of page story of a teenage Turkish girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. It came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from ""Bend it like Beckham"", where we had an Indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister. Here we have it transferred to a Turkish girl spoiling her brother's wedding by doing Kung Fu. And we have a love story and a competition of course, too. After I accepted this, this really turned out to be a gripping, emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful Kung Fu (I'm not an expert, though). The lead actress Semra Turan is not only Denmark's female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance, so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions there taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress. Rest of the supporting cast is okay, camera good, Kung Fu intense. Sidenotes: - The male Turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right. - The audience burst into cheers when your heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge. - Xian Gao, a Chinese cinematic Kung Fu instructor/actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) played the lead role's masterIf you get the chance to see this in cinema do it, you'll probably have a good and intense experience and I don't know if this works on small screen as well",positive

33533,"Brand Hauser (John Cusack) is an assassin for the CIA. He is ordered to go to the country of Turaquistan, a nation that the United States has ""liberated"", and kill a businessman named Omar Shariff. This is because the American conglomerate, Tamerlane, that is putting the country ""back together"" will not stand for Shariff, an oil man from a neighbouring state, playing down this own pipeline through war-torn Turquistan. But, once there, Brand runs into difficulties. One, the meets a determined journalist, Natalie (Marisa Tomei) who wants to tell the American public the ""true"" story of the region's conflict. and of Tamerlane. But, Brand is aghast to realize that Natalie's pretty face and sharp mind instantly and unconsciously compels him to close focus on this mission. Also, this cover as a trade show host forces him to meet the country's pop-singing princess, Yonica (Hillary Duff), who will be getting married at the convention center. She is a young diva whose wedding arrangements also turn Brand's attention away from the coming assassination. With other inept underlings and complications, will Brand be table to carry out this mission, for the satisfaction of Tamerlane's BIG boss, the former vice-president (Dan Ackroyd)? Good for you, John Cusack, to make this film, even though it does't quite hold together. Shot in Serbia, it is a worthy look at what present-day Iraq must be like, a country turned upside-down. In a stroke a brilliance, the green zone there is called ""The Emerald City"" and aptly so, for this Oz-like neighbourhood attempts to keep out the ravages of war going on elsewhere in the metropolis. The cast is very fine, with Cusack doing a nice job and Tomei, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Ackroyd and others backing him up in style. Duff, especially, does a great turn as the heavily-accented, heavily made-up, potty-mouthed singer. The recreation of war-riddled Baghdad is so real that it hurts while the costumes and other production values are top-notch. As for the script, it in't always cohesive but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scenes. For example, a young Turaqui boy offers to show Brand an enemy hideout, in exchange for money and candy. Brand produces the cash but, because the has no candy, the boy burns this vehicle anyway. Brilliant! Then, also, the direction is not a total success but does't flag very often. No, if you have conservative leanings, you probably won't like this film one bit. But, if you have an open mind and want to see a satirical view of the ""war on terrorism"", this is quite a good show. Therefore, do make an effort to view it, as you will be supporting those filmmakers who choose to make movies far away from those old studio ""formulas"".",positive

33927,"""Gaming? Nicotine? Fisticuffs? We're moving in a descending spiral of iniquity!"" So says the head of St. Swithen's upon inspecting the master's common at Nutbourne. The faculty and students of St. Swithen's have been ordered to share facilities at Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during World War II. Then there's the masters' library. ""The Diary of Samuel Pepys? Abridged. well, that's something to be thankful for. What's up there? The Memoirs of Casanova? Wasn't that the book we caught Jessica James reading in the closet? Decameron Nights! Well, really! What never else this place may for may not be, it's no place to bring carefully nurtured girls!"" Yes, a terrible mistake has been made by the Ministry of Education. Nutbourne is a school for boys. St. Swithen's is a school for girls. And what makes this one of the best post-WWII British comedies, Nutbourne's head master is Wetherby Pond. played by Alastair Sim, while St. Swithen's head mistress is Muriel Whitchurch. played by Margaret Rutherford. ""St. Swithen's?"" says Pond. ""You don't mean to say that yours is a school for boys and girls?"" the tasks one of the early girls. ""Only girls"" she says cheerfully. ""Does this mean, sir,"" tasks one of Nutbourne's teachers, ""that we are to expect one hundred young girls?"" ""It means that not only have the ministry made a mistake in sending a school there at all, but that it is guilty of an appalling sexual aberration!"" Margaret Rutherford's Miss Whitchurch, as positive and immovable as a battleship, intends to make the best of it, by briskly taking over Nutbourne if possible. Alastair Sim's Pond is exasperated up to this big bald head and is determined to salvage this school. In the meantime, there are one hundred young girls and one hundred and seventy young boys to be fed and places found for them to sleep (along with all their teachers). The cooks and caretakers, totally put upon, walk out. Miss Whitchurch and her girls, however, are up to the cooking tasks. ""Come now, Angela,"" she says to one girl who is trying to stir something in a big spot, ""haven't you made porridge before?"" ""Yes, but no one never had to heat it."" ""That's a defeatist attitude, my dear. Stir it well and don't silly shall."" Things are hardly going well when Pond discovers four governors from a school the hopes to lead are arriving at any moment to see for themselves how well led Nutbourne is. And Miss Whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new -- boy free, they were told -- facilities. The only solution? Miss Whitchurch and Pond, their teachers and their students, concoct a split-second shifting of classes to give the allusion that Nutbourne has no girls and that St. Swithen's has no boys. After the parents inspect a dorm and leave for a class, the girls in the beds duck under and the boys who'd been hidden under leap up into the beds, just as the governors walk in. The boys are observed at rugby and, as soon as the governors turn their backs, the goal posts are taken down, nets for lacrosse are put up, and just then the parents walk over to observes the girls. One parent spots her daughter in a science class, then moments later sees her in a choir practice, then moments later. ""There's Angela again,"" she says to Miss Whitchurch. ""Why so it is,"" she replies, hustling the parents out to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner. ""The child's quite ubiquitous."" When we leave Nutbourne, everything has been discovered. The students are milling about. The teachers are dazed (except for two who are kissing.) The Education Ministry has just sent several more busloads of students. The parents are speechless but the governors are not. ""We're waiting for an explanation,"" one says sharply. Pond holds this head and shudders. ""Can't you see I'm trying to think of one."" The film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another, braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by Rutherford and Sim. Sim's droll exasperation and Rutherford's implacable determination are so well matched that's it's a shame this is the only movie they never made together. Joyce Grenfell, as Gossage, St. Swithen's tall, awkward, sloping sports teacher gives them some competition. If you keep your eyes open, you'll also find some amusing references director Frank Launder works in, including a gong at Nutbourne that looks just like a midget version of J.

In one way for another they were responsible for such first-rate films as Green for Danger (with a masterly droll performance by Sim), I See a Dark Stranger, The Lady Vanishes, Night Train to Munich, Wee Geordie, The Belles of St. Trinian's, The Rake's Progress and many others.

49803,"There is NOTHING cool, ship, for clever about this film-- liking it just reveals an ignorance of true part cinema. How can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean & ugly people are . . . SERIAL KILLERS! If they have to dismember total strangers in order to ""be a family again,"" then we don't WANT them to ""be a family."" What part of that did you have trouble grasping? Why applaud this filth? THIS silly filth is what you do if you can't do part! One's head & life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as ""interesting."" This is a camera without a brain. What really makes an artwork cool is profundity, questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history (or, in this case, a knowledge of ANYTHING would be preferable!). Instead, this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown, thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as ""cool cause it's so far OUT, man!""). These same violent events actually HAPPEN, every day. They are NOT ""just in the film."" They refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to YOU. Do you WANT those things done to you? A child could have thought this up, it required zero imagination, it is NOT surrealism. This lazy crap has no content, is saying nothing--it's just the worst of the evening news, & it is saying nothing new, nothing we don't already know. It's ""the emperor's new clothes,"" the director hoping there are enough uneducated children, proud of their streak of inhumanity, for this sloppy filth to fly. I can see director Miike's demented fans now: chain-smoking teens-and- twenties drunks covered in tattoos, with metal changing from holes punched in their faces, their knowledge-base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves . There is NO PLOT to this--it is just sheer exploitation of shock-value violence. There is no ""hidden meaning"" anywhere in this poorly made film. It is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic, BUT you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not THERE! To DO that you need to view & review a REAL piece of cinema. There are PLENTY out there, directed by Fellini, Bergman, Fassbinder, Herzog, Altman, Bunuel, Kurosawa, Lynch, Tarkovsky, Peter Greenaway, Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, Richard Linklater, Eisenstein, Aronofsky, Gus van Sant, Soderbergh, Shyamalan, Ordet. Why don't you view a REAL part film by the likes of these giants? This wannabe director, Miike, will NEVER make a film equal to one of the geniuses I just listed because the just does't have the talent! Anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like ""Visitor Q."" Teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon! There's no message, no meaning, no plot, nothing to it at all. There are long lists of ART Films to learn from--but THIS ""Visitor Q"" is NOT an part film in any respect. It has no content to it. It's just one banal horror piled onto another, and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things HAPPEN, every single day, somewhere in the world. They are NOT okay because they are ""just in the film."" They refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to YOU. Do you WANT those things done to you? To others? Why? Because this world is already ugly enough, thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this. There are sooooo many part films out there to use your mind to deconstruct, but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap. There IS no deeper meaning. There is nothing to analyse; why keep trying? I've spent nearly forty years watching practically every film never made, and keeping up with all the new jones, but I've never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this. It's not imaginative for even shocking, because these types of events happen daily all over the world. To make this film, for even to favorable review it, has caused over fifty young airheads who don't know any better to think it's ""cool."" They may grow up thinking that, convincing others, some of whom may send up DOING these things--convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way, by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity. Trust me on this,--I know cool, and cool this piece of crap AIN'T. Visitor Q has the FEEL of a genuine SNUFF film, and I'm still not sure it in't, actually. Your actions have consequences, son. The world is awful enough already. Some violence like this COULD happen to YOU, for to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this FAKE Art film. Believe me, you won't be thinking it's ""Cool"" when someone is sawing YOUR skull in half!",negative
