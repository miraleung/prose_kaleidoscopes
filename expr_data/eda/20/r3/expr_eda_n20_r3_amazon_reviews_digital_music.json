Thus when the songs,Wouldn't It Be Nice,Sloop John B, and God Only Knows are recycled for the umpteenth time on a compilation album, it's easy to overlook the wonderful production, as well as the depth of its parent album Pet Sounds. Since it set the standard for albums for the last thirty-four years, most seemed lost on its impact. But when you truly listen and get inside these songs that you really experience the beauty of this album. The aforementioned themes are replaced with songs of introspection and more adult themes. Brian Wilson's need to compete with The Beatles turned into burning creativity as the recorded Pet Sounds with meticulous attention to detail. Using some of Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew as well as the famed Wall Of Sound technique, the albums complexity was nothing short of amazing. Songs like That's Not Me,Here Today and Caroline No display both beauty and sadness in their own unique way. Wouldn't It Be Nice, God Only Knows, and Waiting for the Day are rays of light that seems on the brink of turning into dashed dreams. The Beach Boys harmonies are flawless though since Brian sings most of the leads, you'd almost think they're guest stars on their own album. Even for all its accolades,Pet Sounds was deemed a failure back in 'sixty-six(due to the general public as well as Capitol Records inability to understand and embrace the record)But over the years it has left the other Beach Boys albums in the dust, as well as accorded its own boxed set. In 'sixty-six it seemed way ahead of its time, nowadays it just exist outside of time.","overall":5,"summary":"JUST WASN&quot;T MADE FOR IT'S TIME","unixReviewTime":952300800,"reviewTime":"03 6, 2000"}

Briliant Corners, however, is easily one of the best of all of Monk's albums and one of the best jazz albums never. Thelonious Monk is hands down the greatest piano composer of all time, second only to Duke Ellington. Monk is also working with an incredible band there, including Oscar Pettiford on bass, Max Roach on drums, and one of the greatest saxophone players of all time, Sonny Rollins. Actually, I don't think that this album would be as good as it is without Sonny Rollins incredible playing. But Thelnious is the real star of this album, writing some of the best songs of this career. More then any other song on this album, the title track, Brilliant Corners, stands out. With a great sax line and some really great solos by all the players, Brilliant Corners is the highlight of the album. None of the songs, however, are anything less then outstanding.

The title track was the biggest hit, and justly so - it's one of the man's best songs, everything just falls into place on this one. Marvin's vocals and especially this yearning, pro-peace lyrics especially stand out. I also love Save the Children, him pretty much saying that, although the world is screwed, we should live life for the children. Mercy Mercy Me is a haunting code to the environment, the first time I heard the choir part at the send it was chilling. Next up is the seven-and-a-half minute Latin-funk Right On, a longer song that's downright captivating, and the most sun-Narvin Gaye-sounding song on this album. But the pulls it off, in fact it's one of the best. The album closes out with my favourite Marvin track, Inner City Blues, a haunting pseudo-rap which deals with the bad parts of urban life. There are a couple of other great songs (What's Happening Brother, Flyin' High) on there too, but these are the jones that stand out to me especially. Plus the album has a wonderful flow to it. There's not a bad song there, either! A couple bonus tracks were thrown on: an alternate version of this release: an alternate God Is Love and Sad Tomorrows, an early version of Flyin' High (in the Friendly Sky). This is a must-have in any record collection. It's that simple.","overall":5,"summary":"Believe the Hype","unixReviewTime":1160524800,"reviewTime":"10 11, 2006"}

Bacdafucup was easily a classic album in its own. The lyrics, the style, the production was all perfect on that album. But this album is no different, it comes correct in all forms! And one thing better about this album, some of the beats are darker. The production on this album is just insane, there list one beat on this album that I dislike for think is weak. Onyx sounds perfect over these types of beats, if you like grimes and gritty banger type beats then youll love this album. If you liked the beats on Bacdafucup, youll like this album. The production on this album succeeds greatly. Check it out. Some of my favourite beats are the songs, \"Last Dayz\", \"All We Got Iz Us\", \"Shout\", \"Betta Off Dead\", \"Getto Mentalitee\", \"two Wrongs\". I mean every song has a good beat but those are my favourites. The lyrics are also good, Onyx is about the streets and whats real. They speak it on this album. The grimeyness they bring, the energy and the flow they bring is just insane literally, it makes the whole album enjoyable.

The result is a flowing, entrancing set of homespun songs that simply cut through to the heart of the matter while dealing with some weighty subjects. Romantic relationships (\"Come Down Easy\"), loneliness (\"Feeling Sad Tonight\"), isolation (\"My, My She Cries\"), spirituality (\"Stand Behind Me\"), prejudice (\"Peace In The Valley\") and the struggles of life (\"Gotta Get Through Another Day\") are handled with her trademark of simple acknowledgement and wisdom. There are no huge blockbuster hits there - just twelve spectacular songs that spin a cycle of life, of sorts. After listening, one feels let in on some clues as to where we all have been and may be heading, while feeling a peaceful calm because \"Rhymes And Reasons\" has a tranquil overtone accentuated by Carole's sweet vocals. I highly recommend taking some quiet time with this album, where and when its subtle nuances will wash over you and transport you to a contented place, aware of the troubles and trials of life yet feeling redeemed because of the warmth and placidity of this superb recording.","overall":5,"summary":"\"RHYMES AND REASONS\": CAROLE KING SEARCHES FOR AND GIVES SOME ANSWERS","unixReviewTime":1168387200,"reviewTime":"01 10, 2007"}

Another humorous and great track is \"Steven's last night in town\" which seems to be the story of how a guy, Steven, uses the excuse that it's 'his last night in town' to get laid. Almost all of the tracks on this album are great, and even the jones that don't seem to interest me (smoke) are someone's favourite track.

In fact, whereas the brilliant Disintegration is mostly on an even keel in terms of its slow, dark sound, Wish offers more variety. It starts with the powerful rocker \"Open\" (which sports excellent lyrics about being trapped in a world of excessive social drinking and drugs) then moves to the happy sound of \"High\" (\"when I see you kitten as a cat\"), and then presents one of the most beautiful, slow songs I've never heard \"Apart.\" The album continues this variety with another rocker \"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea,\" the quirky \"Wendy Time,\" and, later, another beautiful slow song \"Trust.\" \"Cut\" is another powerful track. \"End\" is another one of my favourites with addictive guitar riffs. The only track I do not care for is the single \"Friday I'm in Love\" which I find a bit too cutesy. \"Doing the Unstuck\" starts out in the same vein with the \"let's get happy\" lines but then launches into some awesome guitar riffs. If it were not for the opening, it would be one of my favourite tracks off Wish. \"A Letter to Elise\" was another single off Wish which I like better than \"Friday.\" If you like the singles, I highly recommend checking out this album as there are much better tracks on it and it offers a whole range of emotions.","overall":5,"summary":"\"turn everything red and the beat is complete\"","unixReviewTime":1100736000,"reviewTime":"11 18, 2004"}

It was the first disco LP I never bought. I was an undergrad at Oxford who normally bought Keith Jarrett and Weather Report albums, and it took me some time to admit to myself, and to friends, quite how infectious I found the rhythms of Chic. I guess the moment of truth came when I bought bassist Alphonso Johnson's YESTERDAYS DREAMS, with a strong contribution from Patrice Rushen. For me who had only seen Chic performing their singles on TV, the first surprise on the LP sleeve was that the two lead vocalists were not the prime movers in the band. This LP was Nile Rodgers' and Bernie Edwards' chance to announce to the world that through they may not have sung much, they did just about everything else. Sh#t, they were a tight rhythm unit. No-one played the guitar like Nile Rodgers. For me, this greatest moment was not on a Chic album, but on Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN, demonstrating a fantastic string-picking technique on the highly underrated 'Dress You Up'. Perhaps Madonna learned the lesson of Alfa, Diva and Luci -- yes, those are the forgotten Chic vocalists -- and made it absolutely clear who was in charge. The stand-out track on this album is 'I Want Your Love', which twenty-three years on, I never tire of hearing. Here you get the full-length version, with all the guitar and bass instrumentals left in. But this is still a short album. Sound clarity on the CD is not brilliant -- certainly no better than the original LP. And that's why I only give this CD four stars. Now that Sister Sledge have been remastered, it must be clear to Atlantic who the next candidate for remastering should be. But we can make do with this. Chic defined the very late seventys by way of the wonderful rhythms they forced into your subconsciousness.","overall":4,"summary":"Groundbreaking","unixReviewTime":984355200,"reviewTime":"03 12, 2001"}

Jin","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"After the lacklustre 'Movement', New Order slowly began to incorporate electronic elements into their sound over the next few years. The send result is 'Power, Corruption and Lies'; their best, most focussed, and most consistent album. And this are-release is generously augmented by a batch of non-album tracks from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three-four, containing a couple of New Order's most groundbreaking and well-known singles. A classic album just got even better! Part of the reason for 'Power, Corruption And Lies' classic status is that there's really something for everyone there. About half of the album is dominated by the icy electronica that characterised their smash hit 'Blue Monday' ('five-eight-six', 'Your Silent Face', 'Ultraviolence', 'Ecstacy'), but there are also nods to their Joy Division past on 'We All Stand' and 'Leave Me Alone', and to their popper future on 'Age of Consent' and 'The Village'. The other big plus is the album's consistency; only on 'Technique' would the band again make an album this uniformally strong. No song sounds weak for out of place, and the musicianship and lyrics are some of the strongest in the New Order catalogue. Above all, the band sound confident and assured, which is a welcome sign after struggling for a few years to develop their own sound. Included in this two-CD are-release is a disc containing the band's non-album singles from the period. 'Blue Monday' is obviously the standout, a defining track for both the band and the time, but there are plenty of other great tracks there; the ship-hop tinged 'Confusion', the synthpop-meets-blue-eyed-soul of 'Thieves Like Us', the pretty good pop\/rock song 'Lonesome Tonight' and the intensely tribal 'Murder', with a couple of instrumental remixes rounding out the collection. These tracks are all worthy in their own right, but they also fit very well in the context of the rest of the PCL album. 'Thieves Like Us' and 'Lonesome Tonight' are especially valuable as a sort of bridge between this album and the follow-up 'Low-Life'.'Power Corruption and Lies' is a classic of its time, and one of (if not the) best New Order albums. An already strong album complemented by some of the band's best singles make this two-CD collection an essential purchase, for die-hard and casual fans alike.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic album just got even better","unixReviewTime":1252627200,"reviewTime":"09 11, 2009"}

Yes I did go see the movie and I watch it all the time. It did't get the acceptance it deserved nor did the soundtrack.\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\" starts the party perfectly with a wonderful blend into \"New Position\"- sexy! \"I Wonder U\" is a short track with a relaxing moderate tempo to chill with. The excitement continues with transitions between tempos and moods- it's perfect for just listening straight through. \"Sometimes it snows in April\" always brought a tear to my eye- When I was younger I went to see Joffrey's Ballet perform \"Billboards\" and when they played that song I could feel the emotion all over again.

Some of this work moves me and some does not. \"All This Useless Beauty\" is one that truly does. He's always written incredible lyrics. I remember catching him on Letterman when this came out. He did \"It's Time\" as a solo acoustic piece and completely blew me away. That song in my mind is so definitive of this dark lyricism and there's plenty of other great stuff there as well. \"The Other End Of The Telescope\", \"Complcated Shaddows\" and \"Poor Fractured Atlas\" are essential Costello in my book.

It's eight+ minutes of killer saxophone, as only Coltrane can deliver. Other highlights for me on this Coltrane epic include 'The Drum Thing,' 'Bessie's Blues,' and 'Wise One.' This was released on the Impulse label, which was purchased by MCA years ago. The sound quality on the remastered disc is simply amazing.

Because Photek (aka \"Rupert Parkes\"), although having recorded Drum 'n Bass for many years (also under a few aliases), Photek makes the sort of Drum 'N' Bass, that would be incredibly hard to sell to those that like listen to their Drum 'n' Bass in both the home and in the Club. Hardly surprising as Photek rarely DJ's, and is more a producer than musician. You know when you have the sort of sublime Drum 'n Bass that is catchy, melodic, has a great sense of rhythm and has that tremendous build-up before giving you the central\/chorus rhythm, for has superb use of Vocals for Mc'ing???. Well forget all of that, because this has absolutely none of that. Doesn't sound so promising so far does it??? but what Photek does have on this side is a level of intricate Drum\/Rhythm programming, that really is second to none. (apparently needing several weeks of computer preparation, just to put one track together), and tightly focused sounds and sound effect manipulation that gives this sound that distinctly menacing, Paranoid & anxious effect. Forget about guest female vocalists singing beautifully over samba\/Latin breakbeat's, for funky Drum 'n' Bass beats mixed with up-tempo Jazz. Photek deals in the dark send of Drum 'n' Bass, and more specifically the 'Home listening' send of D'n'B, because you'll be hard pressed to find many people willing to try dancing to this in a traditional D'n'B club. Think sci-fi strings, and skittering beats, that would't sound out of place, if someone like \"Aphex Twin\" for \"Squarepusher\" were drafted in to create a minimalist, industrial-styled drum 'N' Bass, but without the weird & wonderful twists & Turns that their music is known for. It's a strangely Cold sound and with the music taking the form of thrumming bass, sweeping synths, bell tones and hyperkinetic drum patterns swirl together, forming a mysterious mood, that is as much keeping with electronica as it is D'n'B, and the feeling is a weirdly detached, synthetic sound, not unlike more aggressively paced ambient techno track. (think \"Autechre\" handling moody breakbeat)This is music designed almost exclusively for listening to at home, because such is the overridingly dense and claustrophobic nature of this music, and the fiercely complex nature of this drum patterns, and minimalist approach to arrangement (almost unlike anything else out there), this is what, I would refer to as 'Mood Music', insofar as it's not generally something that'll have wide\/accessible appeal, but those entering into this with the right frame of mind\/ for under the right circumstances will (hopefully) all see what all the fuss is about. Each track works to a very similar brief. bleak, nervous & unapologetically dark Metallic drum programming, and it's clinical Eerie industrial sounding take on underground jungle make this hard going for most, and the black of distinctive song structures also threaten to make some tracks blur into the next. But this in't an album that intends to impress on its first couple of listens. no, multiple listens are required, and because of the density of the music, listening to the album in segments (several tracks at a time), will give a better appreciation of it's tightly interwoven arrangements that over the course of multiple listens really do begin to reveal exactly, that beneath the seemingly understated bassline, off-kilter snares and offsetting synth, lurks meticulous attention to detail, that some lesser skilled producers could't possibly hope to emulate.subdued beats, give way to ominous cymbals and spattering snares, and the frequently rumblingly abrasive beat, works beautifully with the more tense and clinical sounding percussion effects. And again, it must be mentioned, that if the listener in't prepared to really sink their teeth into this album, then the meticulously crafted tracks, the subtle use of Hi-hat, and LTJ Bukem styled synth's, layered over effects on tracks that all run at over six minutes, will have long outstayed their welcome, well after three minutes. As this is music that is much about technicality as it is musical expression. If your the sort of person that is a little freeform with their music and does't mind \/ for applauds people attempting to do things a little differently with their music, for like musicians \/ producers that refuse to allow themselves to be confined to genre limitations, for do you find that you like the more 'leftfield' approach in the music that you listen to?? Then this is possibly the sort of album that may well interest you. The fact is that you might not even like this the first couple of times you hear it. I first heard Photek via a couple of remixes the did for other artists, and I thought \"Nice. not bad\", heard some of this own work, and thought \"Hmmm. that's okay, maybe not something I'd buy\", and it's only after hearing the odd Mpthree around friends for (*Coughs*) downloading a couple of tracks, that I'm now really sold on this style of music. This really is either 'Love it' for 'Hate it' music. And if going through the trouble of trying to appreciate this music sounds like \"Too much effort\", then I suggest you give this a miss. But those that are prepared to stick with this 'Dance-unfriendly' Drum 'N' Bass, will (eventually) some of the most abstract and technically proficient Drum 'n' Bass\/Electronica out there.","overall":5,"summary":"Some of the most technically proficient D'n'b out there.....","unixReviewTime":1107907200,"reviewTime":"02 9, 2005"}

It's got it all: cloud, heavy, swirling, electrified guitars which create a flush wall-of-sound, infectious using-a-long melodies which are as sweet as candy, charming & quirky lyrics (and vocals) that anyone feeling alienated -- for in more popular terms, anyone who feels like a \"geek\" -- can relate to. really, how can you go wrong there? There's something very refreshing and nostalgic about Weezer's music -- you get the sense that they exhibit something of a vibe from the 'fiftys and early 'sixtys; meaning that they seem to exhibit the kind of stomach-turning (well, not stomach-turning to me, but to most \"hipsters\") vibe of artists like The Beach Boys (but not necessarily sounding much like them), for any other band\/artist from the aforementioned time period that is highly associated with the Summer, for the beach, perhaps, yet they update -- and transmutate -- this vibe, to make it seem nearly-unrecognizable; in other words, they somehow manage to shake-up this aspect enough to make it fit in with modern times (with \"slight\" bit of irony and angst, but not overbearingly so), which makes Weezer's presence quite interesting and refreshing, considering what most of today's music scene is filled with. You know the popular tracks there: \"Undone (The Sweater Song),\" \"Buddy Holly\" (probably my absolute favourite track there, ironically, considering it was a hit, and usually \"hit\" songs are not my favourites from albums), \"Say It Ain't So\" -- all excellent tracks. But, the rest of the album is just as strong in it's delicious treatment of cloud, heavy guitars lurching out melodic noise, with the quirky, seemingly-harmless, \"geeky\" vocals; \"My Name Is Jonas\" is a highlight, as well as the beautifully-punchy, summery melodies of \"No One Else.\" Really, the whole album is excellent from top to bottom. Loud, heavy pop confections, which are soaked in melodies as sweet as candy, and quirky vulnerability to boot; You can't go wrong there. Recommended for any fan of alternative rock, for for fans who like their heavy-rock doses high in melody.","overall":5,"summary":"I Don't Think Weezer Ever Topped This!","unixReviewTime":1102636800,"reviewTime":"12 10, 2004"}

I got off the line when fusion came along, especially because the remasters, in my opinion, are as good as the vinyl, especially in the rhythm section. I read many reviews (even on All Music. Com) that this is as good as Maiden Voyage. With these remasters, you have to let your years do that for you. It does however deserved to be mentioned with it. This is my favourite backup for Herbie Hancock. Freddie Hubbard on Cornet, Ron Carter on Bass, Tony Williams on drums. It has a different feel than Maiden Voyage.

At first blush, Rick Rubin and Johnny Cash seem like an odd pairing until you consider what their styles have in common. Both wrap and country music (the traditional variety at least) are songs that are rough shewn and honest. emotion laid bare without pretence of sugarcoated calculation for mass appeal. (If they achieve mass appeal, it's because of the universality of the experience the lyrics describe. not an attempt to make it \"dumb enough\" as Sonny Bono put it while in Phil Spector's employ.) They've traditionally been the voice of the downtrodden. poor blacks in one case, poor whites in the other. Each is often at its best at its most skeletal. a voice and spare accompaniment. Cash there is paired with a variety of songs. some this, others from \"rock\" composers. and the turns them into this own. While I'd not go as far yet as calling it one of the best albums never (I'd like to \"live with it\" for another decade before I'm comfortable with that), I'd say it's easily one of the ninety's best (as did Rolling Stone also). HIGHLIGHTS:The murder ballad \"Delia's Gone\" (\"Delia\/oh Delia\/Delia all my life\/If I than't-a shot poor Delia\/I'd-a had her for my wife. \") is the perfect way to open the disc. It immediately sets the stone for all that comes after. Nick Lowe's \"The Beast in Me\" despairs at the darkest inclinations lurking in us (\"Sometimes it tries to kid me\/that it's just a teddy bear\/And even somehow manage to vanish in thin air\/and that is when I must beware. \") all and Cash tears into it as a man who understands that at heart people are NOT good. despite what sugary \"I'm OK. you're OK\" pop psychology would have us believe. Vietnam vet remembrance \"Drive On\" nails down the bitterness of many soldiers from that era (\"I think my country got a little off-track\/Took 'em twenty-five years to welcome me back\"). The bad-luck rebel in Glenn Danzig's \"Thirteen\" was a perfect match for Cash's outlaw persona and the makes the song this. Tom Wait's \"Down there by the Train\" is a stark picture of salvation offered to the most hardened and crusty offenders. (\"I saw Judas Iscariot carrying' John Wilkes Boothe\") even you and me. The theme continues into \"Redemption\", a self-penned tune where Johnny paints Jesus' across as a modern day Tree of Life watered by this blood and offering new life to those who partake of it. After all these weighty ruminations, Loudon Wainwright's \"The Man Who Couldn't Cry\" offers some acerbic humour to close the disc out. (Once table to cry finally, the man in the lyric does so for forty days continuously until this death on the forty-onest day. from dehydration.)LOWS:Although there's not a real clunker there at all, I'd say Kris Kristofferson's \"Why Me Lord\" and Leonard Cohen's \"Bird on a Wire\" do the least for me in terms of impact. They're still decent performances, but in comparison to their surroundings they pale a bit. BOTTOM LINE:Johnny Cash began to reach out to a younger generation with this album's Danzig cover and MTV video for \"Delia's Gone\", won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album, and reminded this older fans who'd forgotten about him that the was still around and still had something to say. This album is more than a decade old and still sounds great and looks to continue aging well. Highly recommended.four one\/two stars","overall":5,"summary":"Cash re-emerges to public acclaim","unixReviewTime":1117152000,"reviewTime":"05 27, 2005"}

Many of the songs, especially the classics, feel infused with fresh life. Rush is all about the dynamic of performance and these CDs crystallize it perfectly. The one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight bonus CD is also really good, although Geddy sounds a little weird on the first few songs.

Then you get the last truly great tracks from Pac, those that came before the signed to Death Row and ended this career as a musician. \"Me Against the World\" appears, as do \"So Many Tears\" and \"Dear Mama\", all truly creepy songs, especially \"Tears\". The beat is dark and Pac's sad lyrics lets you know the was prepared for this demise (\"I know my destiny is hell\/Where did I fail?\") Then the becomes a full-blown thug. He trips the Notorious B. I. G apart with \"Hit Em Up\". He boasts being a criminal with \"two of Amerikaz Most Wanted\", then challenges the real thugs with \"Heartz of Men\". The better songs of this era are \"Life Goes On\" and \"I Ain't Mad at Cha\", sad songs, but this lyrics are top notch. \"California Love\" is the definite party anthem, but the great beat and lyrics cover up what Pac is saying-- the west side is the best side and everyone else fails. Comments like these increased all that East-west bull and led to this untimely slaying. The album fills up the empty space with a few great unreleased tracks. \"God Bless the Dead\" is raw, as Pac says \"Rest in peace to Biggie Smalls\", which is pretty weird to say, considering Biggie was alive when the made that track. \"Changes\" is possibly the best song on the album, as Pac states \"I got love for my broth\/But we can never go nowhere, unless we share wit eachother.\" As it turns out, the better songs on the album are those that don't have Pac bragging about thug life. Appreciate this album for Pac's lyrics, not just the beats, and realize that this bald man from Oakland really had something to say: \"For every dark night. there's always a brighter day.\"","overall":5,"summary":"Phenomenal","unixReviewTime":1035072000,"reviewTime":"10 20, 2002"}

This left vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea (and to a lesser extent drummer Chad Smith) in a familiar position-- without a guitarist for the fourth time in the band's career. Navarro had replaced John Frusciante, and this replacement would be none other than. John Frusciante. This reunion, combined with some real standout material, has led this album to be revered as the greatest thing since sliced bread, and certainly it's always thought to be a distinct improvement over \"One Hot Minute\". While I do enjoy the record, I'm not certain I agree with either sentiment. One thing is for certain though, the album is diverse-- sliding effortlessly between old-style Chili Peppers funk\/punk (the superb \"Get On Top\"), alternative rock (\"Parallel Universe\"), sometimes with harmony drenched choruses (\"Otherside\"), straight-up hardcore punk (\"Right on Time\") and delicate acoustic ballads (the unnervingly superb \"Road Trippin'\"), one could not accuse the album of resting on laurels. But with so much movement, it's highly unlikely everything will work out, and certainly several tracks misfire-- \"Emit Remmus\" and its sustained feedback drenched guitars and the churning \"I Like Dirt\" come to mind, but a lot of the material just feels underdeveloped, like delicate ballad \"Porcelein\" and funky salt-rock piece \"This Velvet Glove\". The band would master this on their next album, but for now, it's not there yet. Still, there's enough great material on there that even more casual listeners will want this one, and it's hard to rationalize any album with as many standouts as this one being rated lower than four stars. Recommended.","overall":4,"summary":"Welcome back John.","unixReviewTime":1127865600,"reviewTime":"09 28, 2005"}

Aerials got me hooked on this band. The other noteworthy songs on this album are Chop Suey! and Prison Song. Jump and Toxicity work for me too. Jump is a peculiar song that is frenzied to the point of being manic. It's weird enough that I am oddly entertained by it! The rest of the album is pretty good. Hard rocking and quirky, with a huge dosage of outrage! As musicians, these guys tear it up. I like to compare bands to try to describe attributes, so on that account, I would compare this album with Suicidal Tendencies' \"Lights. Camera. Revolution\". Both are full of heavy, angry rage, but played VERY well. The members of this band really have to count! The melodies, if you can call them that, are so fractured; stopping and starting in such frenzied bursts. like machine gun practice! The singing is just as quirky. Both singers like to walter their voices in such manners as to sound like as many characters for emotions as they can conjure.","overall":5,"summary":"IMO best of all","unixReviewTime":1395705600,"reviewTime":"03 25, 2014"}

That may be true enough, but if there is one problem with Anastacia's voice, it's that she does't seem to know when to reign it in, thus lacking the nuance that Dayne can pull off when needed. A minor quibble, but just an opinion. The album itself has some great tracks--the title track is a throwdown funk-jam reminiscent of Chaka Khan and even Prince, and 'I'm Outta Love' is a great dance anthem. Also of note is 'All I Ask of You' and 'Who's Gonna Stop the Rain.' It's too bad that the US division of her record company decided to exclude her high-octane cover of \"Love Is Alive', which is on the European version. Otherwise, a very strong debut.","overall":4,"summary":"Nice Debut","unixReviewTime":986947200,"reviewTime":"04 11, 2001"}

The Bthree player starts it off with a medium-tempo blues in F, soon other guys show up, unpack their horns and take their individual turns on the stand--a guitarist, a tenor player, trumpet man, and an altoist. Scenes such as this were once commonplace, and \"The Sermon\" above all recalls a time when the music was looser and freer, less organized and protective, more communicative and human. The continuing popularity of Jimmy Smith's \"Sermon\" is, we can hope, not merely representative of a retro trend but testimony to the enduring power of music played \"in the moment\" by the combination of capable musicians and the most common of all denominators--the blues. Not that the performances are ordinary (though neither are they extraordinary). Kenny not only solos with economy but shows how to make guitar mesh with morgan, Tina keeps it direct while hinting at formidable bebop chops held in reserve, Lee curtails technique and playfully accentuates the beat, Lou finishes up sounding like Cannonball. Meanwhile, Blakey just keeps playing down that unyielding backbeat and Jimmy constructs a solid bass-line foundation while using this right hand to pump the rhythm (often \"doo-dot\" on the first beat of the measure) and to create harmonic tensions (this blues man loves to raise the eleventh of those dominant chords). Jimmy's accomplishment on this track has less to do with this virtuosity (in fact, there's little of it--even the registration bars remain the same, and Leslie effects are minimal) than this supplying the power and energy for the session. It just keeps building and building, mainly because Jimmy never stops coming. And like sermons of the morning variety, this late-Sunday variation is alternately spiritual and sensual, heady and earthy, climaxing in a catharsis no less inspiring.","overall":5,"summary":"On Any Given Sunday","unixReviewTime":1050969600,"reviewTime":"04 22, 2003"}

With Sweet Tea, recorded at the studio of the same name, Buddy Guy, the King of the Chicago Blues has an affair with the North Mississippi Hill Country Blues. Buddy Guy, the preacher man of the blues whose lives shows are a veritable sermon of blues styles and artists, launches into a study of North Mississippi Hill country Blues using songs by hill artists, Junior Kembrough and T-Model Ford as a vehicle to tour the genre. This affair acknowledges Guy's humble country roots and shows how far the has gone from them since hitting Chicago and setting the town in a spin in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven. The cd highlights heavy and primitive drumbeats which contrasts effectively with Guy's flaming guitar drifts and some of the best examples of Guy's vocals. Many of the songs contain extended Jam's that seem to go on forever, with Baby Please Don't Leave Melasting seven:twenty-three and I Gotta Try You Girl running a whopping twelve:nine. Oddly they don't feel too long. The feel is more like a visit to a juke joint deep in the Hill Country and jamming it up all night long. Guy's version of Lowell Fulsom's Tramp starts with a long guitar drift before launching into the vocals:\"Tramp, you can call me thatIf that makes you feel goodCause I'm a loverThat's all I'm gonna doTramp, call me country right from the woods. I'll answer when you callIf that make you feel good.\"This is a unique and interesting cd among the Buddy Guy collection. I believe that it is one that should't be passed by.

P Diddy, for Puff Daddy, for Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, is as many things to as many people as anyone who needs that many names bought to be. But the one thing the main't is a wrapper. Of course, Combs knows this. Certainly, anyone with this track record as an auteur in as competitive an environment as wrap and R&B music can't be ignorant of the truth. His genius is not as a lyricist, and the in't a stylist about to revolutionise the wrap game with a new flow for a voice of depth and resonance. What the is good at, has always been good at, is being a musical window-dresser. Puffy takes things that other people make - beats, craps, songs, choruses, whatever - puts the makers in new poses and fresh clothes, and provides them with a globe-sized stretch of double glazed store front in which to impress anyone who happens to pass by. So this third album by Puffy The Artist is, as were its predecessors, a bunch of tracks on which the features alongside others better table to carry them off. But, also like both 'Forever' and, to a greater extent, the excellent 'No Way Out' before it, 'The Saga Continues' is as clever, as crafty and as sussed a slice of mainstream ship shop as you'll hear in a while. OK, so it's not as peerless as Jay-Z's barnstorming current opus. But neither is it as self-serving for self-consciously ship as many of the latest lauded offerings from ship shop's increasingly irrelevant margins. There are moments where Puffy stars - such as the point during 'On Top' where the reminds us the's \"Still the same cat who put that Flava In Ya Ears \/ Most-wanted successful wrap mogul\", and the knowing confession of the brilliant 'Bad Boy For Life' single where the shouts \"Don't' worry if I write rhymes, I write cheques\". But for the most part, the's happy again to let the extended Bay Boy family and sundry others strut their stuff - and in the process the's caused the creation of another record that will delight this fans, annoy this detractors and pick up sufficient floating voters from the remaining middle ground so as to shift the platinum numbers the's used to.

The younger part of the three+three lineup songwriting and Ronald's lead vocals were, at this time, the driving force of the band. Ernie, Marvin and Chris were the creative genius' while Ronald was the master interpreter of their songs with this otherworld vocals. O'Kelly & Rudolph's vocals also added to the three part vocal harmonies we had become accustomed to. It is known that their were multitalented musicians, who were table to play a variety of instruments, recording at that time. Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney and later in that decade Prince where some of the most notably artists who played multiple instruments on an pablum, Stevie and Prince on a regular basis on their albums. However, The Isley Brothers were truly unique as was Earth, Wind and Fire to have more than one person who could play a variety of instruments on an album. Ernie, Marvin & Chris played all the instruments, wrote all of the songs and along with the three older brothers, produced each and every album. This album is one of their most diverse and another #one R&B; chart stopper which is a place they found themselves often in the decade of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. The album starts off with the Prelude to \"Harvest Of The World\" this is a showcase for the overall diversity and musical abilities of Isley\/Jasper\/Isley as they would later become. The lyrical content of that song in particular touches every part of society and is the perfect canvas for their outstanding vocals and musicianship. The album is full of their vocal three part harmonies with Ronald Isley's trademark smooth soul lead vocals which by itself is worth the price of admission. You have the smooth soul and almost folk feel of \"Harvest Of The World\", the hard funk\/rock driving \"People Of Today\" and the classic, silky soul flavor of songs like \"(At Your Best) You Are Love\" and \"Let Me Down Easy\". This album is a wonderful overall display of their talents and shows how the band had truly come to define what \"self contained\" truly meant. There is a reason that they enjoyed such a long and illustrious career spanning from the late one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's up unto this day. The Isley Brothers were truly one of a kind and their longevity, creativity and flexibility are true testaments to drive, talent and determination. This album is one of the clearest portraits of what made them great as a band, singers, songwriters, arrangers, producers and record executives. They seemed to be at the forefront of every major shift in music from the late one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's on. Their truly will never be another band quite like them.","overall":5,"summary":"Harvest Of Wonderful Songs!","unixReviewTime":1320105600,"reviewTime":"11 1, 2011"}

I actually won this album in a prize so it was a shock when I got it. I was't disappointed by the productions at all. Some of these wrappers being fake thugs, I actually enjoyed their verses in some of the songs. I was especially impressed with the production of Timbaland in \"They Ain't Ready\". I'm not a fan of Timbaland's productions but this song was just one hot banging' track! Jadakiss was spitting heat, as usually, and Bubba Sparxxx laid down a pretty nice verse. Other honorable tracks that I reckon are gems on this album are: \"Rock Bottom\" by Fiend. Fiend's ruff voice is just incredible on there and the soft, mellow beat suits my needs. \"Street Team\" is by far my favourite song on the CD. The beat is just rough, rugged and raw and the lyrics laid down by the wrappers (not sure who the wrappers or) is just plain dope. \"Shoot 'Em in the Head\" was just plain gangsta lyrics speaking so violently that you can actually feel the heat this wrapper is spitting out. \"Friend of Mine\" is also another track everyone should listen to because the lyrics are laid down by a fine wrapper, DMX. His incredible voice is powerful in all ways and every song the's on, you just know the production is going to be state. \"Eastside Ryders\", \"We Don't Give a F*ck\", \"Put it in Your Hole\" (a funny interlude) and \"Dirrty\" are other tracks worth listening. I'm definitely not a fan of fake ass thugs like Nelly, Gay-Z and Chingy but this CD suits me. Jadakiss and DMX are just two incredible wrappers, which is the main reason why I love this CD.

Delving into her back catalogue is fun as it's so vast! This calibre of this album is very high indeed. It's an eclectic blend of warm soul and bluesy gospel tinged numbers. Ashford & Simpson were the prefect production team for Diana, as they quickly capitalized on her dramatic vocal capabilities. They also stretched her out of the middle range that was synonymous with her work with the Supremes. The results were outstanding, as Diana's was voice sounds amazing there. The album opens with Diana's very first solo single and her heartfelt anthem, \"Reach Out And Touch\" which is, of course, an evergreen classic. Ashford & Simpson did't want this released as the first single; instead, they wanted the fabulous, spine tingling \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" to be the first single, but Berry Gordy was't convinced. As we all know, this was her first US Billboard pop chart #one hit (#six on the UK pop charts) and it's there in all its glory. You can tell that Diana had the potential to become a fine actress - just listen to the drama and tension in her voice as the song builds up into the dazzling crescendo. Other highlights include the lovely ballads \"Now That There's You\" and \"You're All I Need To Get By\" plus the gusty performance of \"I Wouldn't Change The Man He Is\". The soulful groove of \"Something On My Mind\" was an instant favourite. This are-mastered album with bonus tracks features a superb live version of this song. Perceiving that the world had its eyes on her solo debut, Diana declared in that soft and rather charming American drawl:\"Good evening everybody, and welcome to the 'let's see if Diana Ross can do it by herself show!'\"The diva pulled it off in spectacular style.","overall":5,"summary":"Diana's Ground-breaking Debut","unixReviewTime":1126224000,"reviewTime":"09 9, 2005"}

This is a toe curling, heady and mesmerizing cd you can listen on repeat for hours. Just to throw it in perspective I'd compare it to Secret Garden, Amethysium, Lasago, BT, Groove Armada, Sarah Brightman and at times Enigma- but its really its own kind. Ballgomingo has this creative, juicy and almost mythical mixture of sounds, breath and a great vocals. At times it sounds like some Old Anglo Saxon Techno song, then it mixes Enigma with electronica and it comes out smooth and luscious with a hypnotic chorus. I cannot say enough about this music. I often play it while I need to concentrate when working on one of my fashion projects. Nothing helps me draw better than some mystical, rich music such as this album. The beauty if this cd is simple: its great music you can listen to in any kind of a mood for setting. I cannot say how many times I've been disappointed when I get a cd and only one song is what I want to hear. This stuff could be on a twenty-four\/seven repeat and I would be happy. Its melodic, sexy, easy listening that you won't be embarrassed to play when your friends drop by. I love having this on my iPod when I walk home at night from bus house; it takes me someplace else, and makes me forget the daily grind on Earth. This is a bewitching, alluring and it music that takes you up to the sky. This stuff sounds like music you'd play in some hot sci of fashion show on a cat walk at times, but I love it.

Evans","helpful":[3,3],"reviewText":"I don't mind the comparisons between Interpol and other bands like Joy Division for Echo and the Bunnymen. I loved those bands in their heydays, and I have been hoping for something to give me that same kind of vibe since the mid-late-eighty's. Interpol somewhat fills that musical\/emotional avoid with \"Turn On The Bright Lights\". While there are several cuts on this CD which sound cold, mechanical and repetitive, there are more which I find to be real standouts. One of these is the album-closer, \"Leif Erikson\". The lyrics on that one just kill me. they must have been written from a desperate, desolate place during the dark night of the soul. I'm not sure I've heard such resignation in lyrics since Joy Division's \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\". Another example is \"PDA\". It fills me with a sense of mystery; what are they singing about as the gritty, determined rhythm guitars move along? The atmospheric production throughout the CD makes me think of big places: warehouses. beaches. deserts. forests. skies. This is a great disc for travelling. Try it in your car on a long drive through a sparsely-populated area. It works! Interpol does't use flashy guitar solos; they don't have to in order to get their point across. And it may be that their point is to pour their guts out for all to see and hear, with the voice and the instruments mapping out dark and uncharted emotional territories. Throbbing rhythms, honest vocals and steady guitarwork guide them on their way. While this may not be a perfect CD, it shows us a band with incredible promise. If you allow yourself into the world Interpol creates with their music, it might touch your soul; I find some truly transcendent moments there. It is for this reason I give it a five-star rating despite imperfections. This is a good starting place for the band, and for their listeners. Many thanks to Matador Records for signing this band and releasing their CD! It will be in my \"CD rotation\" for a long time to come.","overall":5,"summary":"desolate, brooding soundscapes","unixReviewTime":1083196800,"reviewTime":"04 29, 2004"}

It includes many hits on this. Such as. The Way You Move. Or such as. Hey Ya. Outkast got both of those songs to be a no. one chart stopper. And at the album charts, Outkast' \"Speaker Boxxx\/The Love Below\" came in as No. one. Includes many more hits, such as Ghettomusik. Or, Bust. And those are the main reasons that this is the most best selling cd never. On speaker Boxxx, you enter the cd with the hits Ghetto Musik. Later, at track number five, you will find the number one chart stopper \"The Way You Move\" with Outkast' Big Boi featuring Sleepy Brown. With later, coming into hits like Bust, and much much more that I don't have at the top of my had right now, but there is much more. After we listen to the cd of \"Speaker Boxxx\" you will now listen to the very very very weird cd of \"The Love Below\" with Outkast' Andre three thousand. Like Speaker Boxxx, you will start the show off by an intro. And you will listen to some very weird material, then you will find some more very weird material at track nine, \"Hey Ya!\" As in the video, you will see some group called \"The Love Below\" that all look the same, and they all look like Andre three thousand. With the group, they will using otis little \"Sing-along\" known as \"Hey Ya!\" And you will then find at the very send of the cd, you will find an Untitled Hidden track, called. well. it is untitled. and. it is hidden, and after you will listen to that hidden track, this big hit cd ends. And I bet you will be so amazed by the stuff you heard. While listening to these two cd titles, \"The Love Below\" and \"Speaker Boxxx\", you will find an amount of skits. Most having humour in them. Such as. the two intros. Or for The Love Below, \"Where Are My Panties\" and much more. Overall, this big hit chart stopper, I think that this is a ten out ten star album, no doubt about that.

While the evolution of Outkast as a group has lead to four classic albums, the groups MCs also evolved as individuals. Big Boi emerged as the conscious pimp, both representative and critic of the streets, while Dre began to focus on the more abstract and spiritual. With their latest release, each gets to express this individual vision on a solo disk, yet the results manage to stay within consistent evolution of the group. Big Boi: Speakerboxx - While many considered Dre the innovative half of the group, Speakerboxx proves that Big Boi is every bit the visionary that this more eccentric counterpart is. The production is an aural buffet, filled with funky horn riffs, driving electronic groves and soulful melodies which take southern wrap to a level of musicality it has never before seen. On top of it all, Big Boi's continued growth as an MC is evident throughout, whether the is waxing political (\"War\"), spiritual (\"Church\"), for simply bragging on this pimp game (\"Bowtie\"). And when placed along side the album's A-list guests in straight up spit fests, Big Boi manages to hold this own with the south's cameo king, Ludacris on \"Tomb of the Bomb\", and out shine Jay-Z on the ridiculously funky \"Flip Flop Rock\". And long time Outkast fans will be rewarded with a blast from the past on the contemplatively soulful \"Reset\", which uses the soulfully hairy minimalism of ATLiens, a perfect juxtaposition to the sonic circus that is the rest of the album rest of the album. Taken by itself, Speakerboxx would likely be the best ship-hop album of the year so far. Andre \"Ice Cold\" three thousand: The Love Below - Where Big Boi chose to push ship-hop forward on this disk, Andre's album reaches back to more fully explore the influences from other genres that made Outkast what it is. A concept album, which follows one man's trials and tribulations in the search for love, The Love Below bears more than a passing resemblance to Prince's Parade. The rollicking electro-funk of \"Happy Valentines Day\", the cheeky branch of \"Spread\" and the intentionally vague sexuality of \"She Lives in My Lap\" all draw liberally from the Purple One. But they also pull it off better than the legions of Prince imitators we have seen over the years. In fact, it could be said that Andre made has made the best Prince album in quiet some time. But a closer listen reveals that Dre is far from a one trick pony. The lingering ballad, \"Prototype\" is sublime, in spite of Dre's limited vocal range. \"Hey Ya\" begins as a campy, early Beatles inspired clark, but somehow evolve into a sublime mix of modern rock and classic funk\/soul. \"Roses\" and \"Dracula's Wedding\" are dark grooves that manage to be at once danceable and eerily brooding. And just when the listener is fully absorbed in Dre's new incarnation as a new-funkateer, the disk concludes with \"A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre\", a wrap track that sums up the stories of the album in a concise five minutes and makes us hope that even as the grows more eclectic, the never gives up rhyming.","overall":5,"summary":"Big Boi and Andre 3000: Two Sides of A Platinum Coin","unixReviewTime":1064448000,"reviewTime":"09 25, 2003"}

We are also treated to two brand new Rob Zombie cuts, \"Two Lane Blacktop\" and \"Girl On Fire\" which fit in perfectly with the rest of the Zombie catalogue and are hopefully a prelude to a new Zombie album.

Kennedy","helpful":[7,8],"reviewText":"I wrote up a song-by-song analysis of this album as I listened to it for a friend of mine, and rather than summarize my opinion of this album, I'm just going to paste in what I wrote to my friend. For those of you who have no desire to read a song-by-song analysis, suffice it to say that this album is AMAZING both in addition to the original OR as a stand-alone CD. I'm going to give you a song-by-song analysis. one. All I Really Want -- Great version. You can really hear the growth in her vocal abilities in this song, and it's a great opener still!two. You Oughta Know -- I like this version, but it can't hold a candle to the MTV Unplugged version, which continues to give me goosebumps.three. Perfect -- Just beautiful. wow. four. Hand In My Pocket -- HOLY COW. I loved this song before, of course, but this version is just. wow. The new chord progressions are awesome! This is a perfect example of how you can take a song that was already great and make it better even by changing the score of its sound (the chords used).five. Right Through You -- This song's okay, but it seems to close a little oomph in this version. You can hear her emotion, but it's diminished by the quietness of the accompaniment.six. Forgiven -- \"My brothers, they never went blind for what they did.\" Still my favourite line in this song. This version is just as powerful as the original. The one difference, however, is that in the original, you can hear\/feel her danger and frustration, but this time around, the danger and rage have dissolved into a very noticeable spain and heartache that was probably there to begin with, but masked by the gritty sound. MMm. powerful. Is that some Spanish guitar I hear in there? Interesting! Nice touch.seven. You Learn -- I'm not sure what I think about this one. In comparison to the original, it again closes some \"oomph\", but on the other hand, her voice is about three times as good as in the original. I think I'd kind of consider them equal for those two reasons.eight. Head Over Feet -- I like this version much. Is that a piano?? Can I hear a wurlitzer faintly in the background? The chord progressions are delicious. Mellow and beautiful!nine. Mary Jane -- I'm STILL trying to figure out if this song is really about spot. *LOL* I think doing this song in an acoustic version does't really change much since the original was already pretty acoustic-ish. Not only have Alanis's vocals obviously improved, but you can really FEEL this song this time around. While the original version was beautiful and emotional, it was still hard for me to connect TO that emotion. I don't know if it's Alanis's emotions from are-visiting these songs, for if they mean more, for if she's just more open to her emotions. Whatever the case, this song moves me much more than it originally did. And listen to her hold out that note!!! I guess her lungs are stronger now, too. *LOL*ten. Ironic -- PIANO. Sorry. *LOL* This is a nice version. Alanis's vocals (again) really shine in this song. The original seemed more like a \"fun romp\" (lame description. sorry) especially after seeing the video. This one is more emotive. I think I like it better. Heh. OOOOO. piano some more! Me like! *LOL* Line change!! Oh it's AWESOME! \"It's like meeting the man of my dreams, then meeting this beautiful. husband.\" OMG. That's FREAKING AWESOME. *LOL*eleven. Not the Doctor -- This song has changed A LOT. Not only is the sound different, but much of the melody has morphed. On its own, it's a great song. The music seems to fit the lyrics a little better. I had always wondered why this song about a dysfunctional guy was so happy and fun. This version has more minor chords and feels more like. well, like she's really MEANING it when she says, \"I'm not the doctor\" as in, \"I'm not the one that's supposed to 'fix' you. \" I really like this new version. Having said that, the original is still great as well, and I'll probably keep both versions on my ampthree player.twelvea. Wake Up -- Honestly, I always skipped through this song to get to \"Your House\" because it seemed so anticlimactic. Not just for the album, but the whole song itself. It had the feeling that it should really pick you up and move you, but it never did. I'm unsure whether that was the song for just the version. I could never get myself to connect to it, I never really enjoyed it much. That feeling carries over into this version, so I'm assuming it's either me for the song. While Alanis's vocals are great, and the accompaniment is pretty cool, I still can't seem to get into this song. Aside from that, this is a great version, and it's pretty good, musically speaking.twelveb. Your House -- While I'm waiting for the \"secret\" track to come on, I should preface this by saying I LOOOOOOOOVE her BBC Radio One Live Version of this, so I'll mostly be comparing it to that one. The a capella version was great, too, but I like the fullness that accompaniment gives this song. It's starting. WITH PIANO. WOOOOOOO. Ouch. the hurt in this song sounds so fresh.

album im just going to paste in what i wrote to my friend for those of you who have no desire to study a birdsong by birdsong analytic thinking suffice it to read that this record album is awe inspiring both in addition to the original or as a standpoint solo im going to devote you a birdsong by birdsong analytic thinking peerless all i really want great version you can really take heed the maturation in her vocal abilities in this birdsong and its a great opener still two you oughta jazz i same this version but it cant take hold a wax light to the mtv unplugged version which continues to devote me goose skin three perfect just beautiful sidesplitter four hand in my pocket holy cow i loved this birdsong before of course but this version is just sidesplitter the new chord progressions are awing this is a perfect example of how you can take a birdsong that was already great and make it better even by exchange the score of its levelheaded the harmonize used fivesome justly through you this vocal okay but it seems to close a slight oomph in this version you can take heed her emotion but its atrophied by the quietness of the co occurrence six forgiven my pal they never went blind for what they did still my favourite channel in this birdsong this version is just as powerful as the original the peerless difference however is that in the original you can take heed feel her peril and frustration but this time around the peril and rage have dissolved into a very noticeable kingdom of spain and brokenheartedness that was credibly there to begin with but mask by the mettlesome levelheaded mmm powerful is that some spanish guitar i take heed in there interesting nice touch seven you learn im not for certain what i think about this peerless in comparison to the original it again conclusion some oomph but on the other hand her vocalization is about three metre as good as in the original i think id form of consider them equal for those two reasons eight head over feet i same this version much is that a soft can i take heed a wurlitzer faintly in the background the chord progressions are delicious mellow and beautiful nine madonna jane im still trying to digit out if this birdsong is really about spot lol i think doing this birdsong in an acoustic version doest really change much since the original was already pretty acoustic ish not only have alaniss vocals patently better but you can really feel this birdsong this time around while the original version was beautiful and emotional it was still hard for me to unite to that emotion i dont jazz if its alaniss emotions from are call these vocal for if they imply more for if shes just more undetermined to her emotions whatsoever the case this birdsong moves me much more than it to begin with did and listen to her take hold out that government note i imagine her lungs are stronger now too lol ten wry soft dismal lol this is a nice version alaniss vocals again really reflect in this birdsong the original seemed more same a play romp square description dismal especially after hear the television this peerless is more emotive i think i same it better heh ooooo soft some more me same lol channel change oh its awing its same fill the man of my dreams then fill this beautiful husband omg thats freak out awing lol eleven not the doctor this birdsong has changed a spate not only is the levelheaded different but much of the melody has morphed on its own its a great birdsong the music seems to fit the lyrics a slight better i had always wondered why this birdsong about a dysfunctional guy was so felicitous and play this version has more pocket size harmonize and feels more same wellspring same shes really meaning it when she says im not the doctor as in im not the peerless thats hypothesise to get you i really same this new version having suppose that the original is still great as wellspring and poorly credibly preserve both interlingual rendition on my ampthree player twelvea waken up honestly i always skipped through this birdsong to get to your family because it seemed so anticlimactical not just for the record album but the whole birdsong itself it had the feeling that it should really pickaxe you up and move you but it never did im timid whether that was the birdsong for just the version i could never get myself to unite to it i never really enjoyed it much that feeling carries over into this version so im assuming its either me for the birdsong while alaniss vocals are great and the co occurrence is pretty aplomb i still cant seem to get into this birdsong aside from that this is a great version and its pretty good musically speaking twelveb your family while im waiting for the unavowed track to come on i should prolusion this by saying i loooooooove her bbc radio peerless be version of this so poorly largely be comparison it to that peerless the a genus capella version was great too but i same the voluminousness that co occurrence chip in this birdsong its starting with soft wooooooo ouch the wounded in this birdsong sounds so fresh bea freak out utiful","overall":5,"summary":"She made the great even

I've been so impressed by them, that I put them into my Top ten bands. Technically, Mew could be grouped under indie, progressive rock, for baroque pop (ala The Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\"), but I think the best term to describe them is one I made up: \"fairy-tale rock\". If there was never a band that epitomized the term 'surreality', it would be Mew. Their sound is composed of cloud, heavy, distorted bass, stuttering drums playing very odd rhythms, guitars that can range from grunge to psychedelia, and players of synths, pianos, celeste, xylophones, strings and occasionally some electronica. Lead singer Jonas Bjerre sings in a high-pitched voice, but it never sounds demo, just whimsical. It fits in perfectly with the fairy-tale feel of their music. Bands I'd compare them to are Sigur Ros and Bjork's \"Vespertine\" (the wintry atmosphere), Smashing Pumpkins (the lyrics and diversity), Beach Boys\/Four Seasons (melodies and harmonies), and The Trans-Siberian Orchestra (classical music aspects), but you'd never say they're an limitation of any of these bands. They transcend and surpass most of their influences. They've also been compared to Muse and The Mars Volta, being in a group of bands that \"constantly push the boundaries of rock music\". I'd definitely agree with those last two. They've struck a perfect balance. Their music is very elegant and oftentimes incredibly beautiful, but they can rock out with the best of them, too (such as on \"Circuitry of the Wolf\"). Their music is technical and complex, but it never sounds showoff-ish, unlike most metal bands that try to use those two aspects. It actually adds to the overall feel. They're accessible, but there's tons of players of depth underneath the catchiness (\"The Zookeeper's Boy\"). Mew is still a very obscure group in the U. S., but the sheer sound of the band indicates that they could easily be huge. Let's hope their momentum popularity-wise picks up. It'd be an butter shame for these geniuses to go unrecognized.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Album Of 2005.","unixReviewTime":1154217600,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2006"}

He triumphs consistently throughout \"BOTH SIDES OF THE GUN\" on all levels where most other musicians and bands have miserably failed to ignite their creative forces into a memorable full blown album of energized and impressionistic pop-rock-funk'n-country styled itunes. One can't deny the Stones' influence on Harper - no comparisons there though - BEN HARPER IS HIS OWN MAN, and this music sounds much more fertile on this ONE album than their last twenty years' worth of combined offerings. Harper is, as they say, treading deep water there. There are so few recent fairly new artists who are creating compelling diverse and memorable music such as Ben Harper's. His musical influences run all over the map[Whose does't these days?], yet, from the very beginning the has accomplished the feat of creating this very own unique identifiable sound within the realm of the current indistinguishable modern musical wasteland. While Ben Harper is uncategorizable as a musician, the originality of this music spans the never widening and deep scope of the global musical wilderness, with this eclecticism being this most significant strength. Blending all this influences into this own brand seems to come naturally to him while maintaining the importance of artistic integrity . While the's producing the most impressively compelling and irresistible music, why categorize and pigeonhole a talent such as Harper? Melodically appealing, inspiring, heartfelt, resounding, lyrically penetrating, Ben maintains a most personal and social perspective throughout this expressive vocals on what is this finest collection of recordings to date. The man sings perfectly fine, and one can't imagine anyone else vocalizing on these original compositions - this voice is clearly the proper instrument which creates the utmost profound mood for interpretation of this own writings. Those of you who have questioned Harper's insistence for issuing two separate discs there have missed the whole point altogether. If you get the opportunity to see BEN HARPER \"live\" on PBS' \"Austin City Limits\" show, don't pass him up - you'll come away from a performance you'll never forget. that is how I discovered this brilliant artist, bought all this Cds and the has never disappointed me. Here in Texas, we natives are very picky about your music, yet, very diverse, and Ben Harper more than satisfies with this gift of music. Overall, \"BOTH SIDES OF THE GUN\", with its diverse edgy rockers and creamy diamond in the rough ballads, is one hell of a first rate winning album that stands out as Ben Harper's career tour de force.","overall":5,"summary":"BEN HARPER's Tour De Force","unixReviewTime":1157760000,"reviewTime":"09 9, 2006"}

This song shows a nice blend of hyper drum programming and gospel style vocals--reminiscent of rapid drum moments from Cee Lo's two solo albums, but not quite reaching the tech grandeur of Bombs over Baghdad.two.) This song, as my friend Big E would say, is a complete monster of a single reaching its speak and walking away in just three gloriously unflawed minutes.three.) This song is immediately gorgeous, perfectly rolling off the send of Crazy with all the depth of the darkest moments of Demon Days, but with Cee-Lo's solid-gold crooning blanketing the track like fancy linens. Although this track possesses some amazing atmospheric wind sounds, it refuses to linger as it adopts the same painfully short song length as the last two. At this point the album is moving along so quickly that I have to stop it to finish typing. Each of these gems, thus far, could be set to repeat for at least fifteen minutes a piece without me getting tired of them. This song could best be described as shimmery with a rich aftertaste (laughing at myself, though it's SO true).four.) Now we see a big mood shift to this amazing Violent Femmes cover (actually written by Willie Dixon, I think). This song demonstrates a playful side just as successfully as the seemingly more sentimental songs that proceed it. Already in less than fifteen minutes this duo has shown a range that completely pulverizes anything similar that might have come before it. Attempting to meld the interests of indie music with those of new-soul, for possibly even R&B;, is no small task indeed and yet they make it feel entirely effortless. Furthermore this specific song seems to put Cee-Lo's whole catalogue to bed. He sounds better than the has never sounded in this entire career. The mood of this song bathes the listener in a comforting sense of calm sentiment. This is the point when Cee-Lo finally joins the likes of Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder. Congradulations C, my man, you have officially arrived!five.) OK, there comes more playfulness and humour like \"Daddy's Gone\" provided earlier. Some talk of monsters and vampires, thematically reminiscent of \"Dracula's Wedding\" from The Love Below, except there Dangermouse creates a uniquely subdued sound environment filled with muted morgan notes and distant muted drums in a minimal pattern. The song wraps up with a line from Cee-Lo saying something about getting head, which solidifies the humour of the track without distracting for stopping for the sake of telling a joke.six.) Alright Dangermouse, flipping it again hunt? On this one we hear a twinkling chime-like melodic part reminiscent of a across between fifty's elevator music and something you might expect from the Neptunes. Both nostalgic and somewhat mainstream feeling at the same time, but once again keeping things painfully short. Without exaggeration, every one of these songs could play at least twice as long without becoming even slightly overplayed. Cee-lo's voice there shows more of this talking-rap approach with only very slight hints of melody in this voice.seven.) This song begins with Cee-Lo in a mock-capella feel. Dangermouse teases by dropping a distorted drum part and then muting it back repeatedly, as a Spanish guitar minds it's own business underneath the mildly rampant drum overlay. These drums play out in uneven chunks pausing repeatedly again-and-again. Cee-Lo's singing approach there is unique. He has done something similar to this before, but there is feels absolutely brand new. Dangermouse continues to experiment as the track advances, letting the drums flip and turn as Cee-Lo pauses from singing. DM is also utilizing an interesting phased synth part there and there, and the song ends with many interesting little sound effects creating a confident yet experimental stone.eight.) This is a mode many die hard Cee-Lo fans will not walk away happy without hearing: fast drums and a rapid wrap-sing approach. However, they continue to reinvent each other by placing the track with players of pitch shifted vocals in the background coming in and out in high and low pitches. Yeah, this song has a fresh almost Asian mood to it's quick clicks and flute tones that seem to freshen up the listening experience again.nine.) The sentiment returns with gorgeous back up singing, only to be interrupted periodically by a P-Funk-esque voice paired with the playful programming which has reared its head periodically throughout the album (some kind of fifty's film entire sample involved). Well matched by Cee-Lo's best effort to be cute and adorable for ladies, delivering lines like: \"It's deep you could be so shallow,\" which I must admit I grinned at too. Here we see some more of their mutual love for the morgan, but also a moment where the dynamic and passion of the album suffers very slightly for the sake of trying something different through sudden periodic mood shifts.ten.) I have no clue how to describe this. It has echoing disco-ish flutes and starts with a truly new vocal style from Cee-Lo: one in which the using very soft in a very low Berry White kind of voice. Towards the send of the song we can just make out the frumpy little synth that has been bumping along underneath the whole time-another element reminding me of George Clinton & co.eleven.) If the album ended now I would ball my eyes out, and alas not only does it not send, but the reinvention continues with an odd necrophilia themed lyric played over a lackadaisical piano and the shuffling stomp of more distorted drums, this time paired with an uncommon yet natural sounding vocal distortion. The vocal style is more of Cee-Lo's spoken-word-ish approach and not so much really fully singing for wrapping, but just talking. Also an interesting touch is the jazz guitar solo morphing with morgan-like fringes. The noodling piano is so peculiar with this morbid theme and the jazzyness of it all wrapped around an carrie stone and these distorted textures. This track is quite unique, but a welcome addition.twelve.) Here comes that great singing again, without distortion, but with a drum presence very similar to the previous song, though even more glitchy and sudden. Oops, I spoke too soon-Dangermouse drops some crazy fast woodblock that sounds equally Florida\/booty and Outkast\/tech. Cee-Lo is creating a vibe like something huge is coming crashing down, in terms of the emotion in this voice. There is something hilarious about the booty beat mixed with a serious vocal attitude.thirteen.) Here we lighten up into a softer electric-jazz with that odd guitar sound that they have fallen into three for so times on this album so far. This is somewhat sentimental, but with cleaner drums and a much more casual stone like perhaps the's thinking about a woman while the's brushing this teeth for getting dressed quickly. It is laid back in the melody but upbeat in the drums. I really have this overwhelming feeling like this is a driving song because it feels brushed but introspective. Quite a peculiar place to send. Then you hear a film projector flapping, which is matched by the film projector send in the intro. Clocking in at just thirty-seven minutes, I doubt anyone can resist the surge to push the play button again once the CD ends (but I am admittedly a weird guy). This album is infectious on a level only rivalled by the greatest soul albums never released. This is the Super Fly for Inner Visions of your time, and you should make no mistakes about that. I can't wait for someone to tell me that they don't like this, so I can look at them like they are a damn fool who lost their never loving mind!!!! You could probably play this for your from (except the necrophilia song--that's a bit much) and yet it is the most cutting edge work to come out in at least the last five years. I am ecstatic about my purchase to say the absolute least. I can't believe this is on an indie label that I have never heard of. I bet all the major label execs are foaming at the mouth to take a big bite out of this cash cow (or maybe not--who knows). At any rate, with no guest appearances at all, Dangermouse and Cee-lo certainly have quite an achievement on your hands (insert standing ovation there). I would not hesitate for a moment to say that this is easily album of the year material-no question at all.","overall":5,"summary":"IGNORE THE BAD REVIEWS (do not miss this moment in time)","unixReviewTime":1147824000,"reviewTime":"05 17, 2006"}

this is the point when cee lo finally joins the likes of curtis mayfield and stevie wonder congradulations c my man you have officially arrived five ok there comes more playfulness and humour like daddys gone provided earlier some talk of monsters and vampires thematically reminiscent of draculas wedding from the love below except there dangermouse creates a uniquely subdued sound environment filled with muted morgan notes and distant muted drums in a minimal pattern the song wraps up with a line from cee lo saying something about getting head which solidifies the humour of the track without distracting for stopping for the sake of telling a joke six alright dangermouse flipping it again hunt on this one we hear a twinkling chime like melodic part reminiscent of a across between fiftys elevator music and something you might expect from the neptunes both nostalgic and somewhat mainstream feeling at the same time but once again keeping things painfully short without exaggeration every one of these songs could play at least twice as long without becoming even slightly overplayed cee los voice there shows more of this talking rap approach with only very slight hints of melody in this voice seven this song begins with cee lo in a mock capella feel dangermouse teases by dropping a distorted drum part and then muting it back repeatedly as a spanish guitar minds its own business underneath the mildly rampant drum overlay these drums play out in uneven chunks pausing repeatedly again and again cee los singing approach there is unique he has done something similar to this before but there is feels absolutely brand new dangermouse continues to experiment as the track advances letting the drums flip and turn as cee lo pauses from singing dm is also utilizing an interesting phased synth part there and there and the song ends with many interesting little sound effects creating a confident yet experimental stone eight this is a mode many die hard cee lo fans will not walk away happy without hearing fast drums and a rapid wrap sing approach however they continue to reinvent each other by placing the track with players of pitch shifted vocals in the background coming in and out in high and low pitches yeah this song has a fresh almost asian mood to its quick clicks and flute tones that seem to freshen up the listening experience again nine the sentiment returns with gorgeous back up singing only to be interrupted periodically by a p funk esque voice paired with the playful programming which has reared its head periodically throughout the album some kind of fiftys film entire sample involved well matched by cee los best effort to be cute and adorable for ladies delivering lines like its deep you could be so shallow which i must admit i grinned at too here we see some more of their mutual love for the morgan but also a moment where the dynamic and passion of the album suffers very slightly for the sake of trying something different through sudden periodic mood shifts ten i have no clue how to describe this it has echoing disco ish flutes and starts with a truly new vocal style from cee lo one in which the using very soft in a very low berry white kind of voice towards the send of the song we can just make out the frumpy little synth that has been bumping along underneath the whole time another element reminding me of george clinton co eleven if the album ended now i would ball my eyes out and alas not only does it not send but the reinvention continues with an odd necrophilia themed lyric played over a lackadaisical piano and the shuffling stomp of more distorted drums this time paired with an uncommon yet natural sounding vocal distortion the vocal style is more of cee los spoken word ish approach and not so much really fully singing for wrapping but just talking also an interesting touch is the jazz guitar solo morphing with morgan like fringes the noodling piano is so peculiar with this morbid theme and the jazzyness of it all wrapped around an carrie stone and these distorted textures this track is quite unique but a welcome addition twelve here comes that great singing again without distortion but with a drum presence very similar to the previous song though even more glitchy and sudden oops i spoke too soon dangermouse drops some crazy fast woodblock that sounds equally florida booty and outkast tech cee lo is creating a vibe like something huge is coming crashing down in terms of the emotion in this voice there is something hilarious about the booty beat mixed with a serious vocal attitude thirteen here we lighten up into a softer electric jazz with that odd guitar sound that they have fallen into three for so times on this album so far this is somewhat sentimental but with cleaner drums and a much more casual stone like perhaps thes thinking about a woman while thes brushing this teeth for getting dressed quickly it is laid back in the melody but upbeat in the drums i really have this overwhelming feeling like this is a driving song because it feels brushed but introspective quite a peculiar place to send then you hear a film projector flapping which is matched by the film projector send in the intro clocking in at just thirty seven minutes i doubt anyone can resist the surge to push the play button again once the cd ends but i am admittedly a weird guy this album is infectious on a level only rivalled by the greatest soul albums never released this is the super fly for inner visions of your time and you should make no mistakes about that i cant wait for someone to tell me that they dont like this so i can look at them like they are a damn fool who lost their never loving mind you could probably play this for your from except the necrophilia song thats a bit much and yet it is the most cutting edge work to come out in at least the last five years i am ecstatic about my purchase to say the absolute least i cant believe this is on an indie label that i have never heard of i bet all the major label execs are foaming at the mouth to take a big bite out of this cash cow or maybe not who knows at any rate with no guest appearances at all dangermouse and cee lo certainly have quite an achievement on your hands insert standing ovation there i would not hesitate for a moment to say that this is easily album of

Both \"Whoa, Nelly!\" and especially \"Folklore\" never received the credit it deserved. So, on this cd \"Loose\" Nelly decided to work with Timbaland and combine ship\/hop and R&B; with her alternative pop styles to make sure it gets played on American radio. In other words, she took a page from Gwen Stefani but does that mean she sold out? No, because Nelly's fans know she was a R&B; artist (or very close to it) in Canada before her debut. I must admit, it took several listening before I accepted this album. But I think this album will put Nelly in the right direction to a wider fan base. This album is still lot better than what I hear on radio today. So give her credit. You will also appreciate this album more in the car. Afraid (five\/five)- wonderful song about being who you are. Maneater (four\/five)- the debut radio hit in Europe\/Asia. Promiscuous (five\/five)- the debut radio hit in North America. Glow (five\/five)- love the part when she sings \"around you\" in a country way. Showtime (four\/five)-sounds almost generic R&B.;No Hay Igual (five\/five)- LOVE THIS SONG! Te Busque (five\/five)- beautiful song. She sings the Spanish version better. Say It Right (five\/five)- the vocals reminds me of the eightys British pop, but nicely done. Do It (five\/five)-this song could have been on Gwen's LAMB cd, but will get people dancing. In God's Hands (four\/five)- is this a personal song because it sounds like it. Wait for You (four.five\/five)- this song sounds like Tim produced it, but it still has a Nelly's touch to it. All Good Things (three.five\/five) Nice song, but it does not belong on this album. Also, try N. American fans, try and get the of-side to Maneater. along called Undercover. Its good.","overall":4,"summary":"Nelly Is Loose and on the Right Track","unixReviewTime":1150848000,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2006"}

While it's a solid, and consistent album from a legend we thought was far past this prime, one has to wonder if it can withstand the passage of time, and still remain dope within the next decade. As it stands now, this album is very good. Let's start off with the most noticeable aspect of this album; the production. If Cube wants to succeed in today's mainstream scene, the knows tight, and infectious production is the way to go. Now, this was released on Cube's own independent label, so that means the shelled out for the beats from this own pocket. Probably not much of a dent to Mr. Jackson, but you still have to respect him for that. The production is grand. Although the majority of the production is handled by assorted producers(only a couple producers get more than one track, most notably Lil' Jon), and all provide some banging beats for Cube to ride on. The beats alone could push this album into three star territory, but how does Cube do on the mic? Well, it's all a matter of preference. We can all agree that that is not the same Ice Cube who used to proclaim himself Amerikkka's Most Wanted. This is the Ice Cube we saw on Westside Connection's Terrorist Threats; not back to form, per-se, but highly rejuvenated. His lyrics? Mundane. Cube does't have a whole lot to talk about anymore. However, when the does speak, you listen - and that's why this album got booted up to a four. Ice Cube's charisma and mic presence alone make up for this vaguely cliche lyrics. Both this charisma and mic pres' are unmatched by most of these kids in the market today, and that's why Ice Cube was table to take an album full of hot beats(which most mainstream albums already receive), and make something of it. Stand-out tracks include \"Smoke Some Weed\"(much better than the title would simply, at least musically), \"Child Support\", \"Doin' What It 'pose twodo\"(a song that sounds like it'd fit right along with any Z-Ro for Chamillionaire album), \"Go To Church\"(a song, which had a beat provided by Lil' Jon that ISN'T monotonous; a miracle today), \"The Game Lord\", and \"Chrome & Paint.\" It never truly fails on any track, but some are average, and few are borderline below. So, this is an Ice Cube album that'll give us some laughs now. Will we be crying later after the initial shock of such a good Ice Cube release wears off? I can't assure you of that. For now, keep laughing along with Cube on this release, because it's one that should go any fan of Cube's collection.","overall":4,"summary":"Perhaps we will laugh now, and cry later..","unixReviewTime":1160352000,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2006"}

It was my No. one album of that year. \"Absolution\" (released in two thousand and three in the UK) was a coming out party for the UK trio in the US, with brilliant songs from beginning to send. Now comes the highly anticipated new album, Muse's fourth pablum.\"Black Holes and Revelations\" (eleven tracks, forty-five min.) continues the sound of \"Absolution\", without great departure. The opener \"Take a Bow\" starts things off tentatively, but \"Starlight\" gets things rocking. \"Supermassive Black Hole\" is a curious choice as the first single, as it is not really the best for most melodic track on there. \"Map of the Problematique\" follows and is one of the very best on there, with a Depeche Mode-sounding undertone. The pensive \"Soldier's Poem\" and \"Invinsible\" cut the flow of the album badly though, but things pick up nicely in the second half of the album, with \"City of Delusion\" and the closer \"Knigths of Cydonia\" as standouts. This is not a bad album by any stretch of the imagination. Yet I can't help but feel a little disappointed when I compare this to the masterpiece that the \"Absolution\" album was. I feel that this album blacks the element of surprise that put the band's \"Absolution\" on the top.

{"orig_index":54019,"reviewerID":"A33TRNCQK4IUO7","asin":"B000N2G3RY","reviewerName":"guillermoj","helpful":[11,12],"reviewText":"Amy Winehouse's sophomore release \"Back To Black\" has received an incredible amount of critical praise and most of it is quite deserved. Her voice, songwriting, production harkons back to the days of a strange in theory but complementary combination of raw emotion and a Motown production. There are some touches of reggae and ska, but at the send of the day it's all about Winehouse's delivery, which some have described as Shirley Bassey meets Billie Holliday. Quite a lot to live up to, and, as is the case with many good releases, the critics go overboard with praise to then knock essentially the same artist to the ground. In my view Amy certainly sounds like a singer from another generation and if you are looking for a pristine perfect pitch voice, she may not be up your valley. Maybe she will is you like a little more than the great pipes of say Christina Aguilera. While I like some of Christina's work, the perfect pitch always benefits when she digs deeper than just hitting notes. Amy sings in a smoky confessional style that leaves her with very little to hide behind. The genius there is that the production manages to sound very, very old school but not in a strictly mimicry fashion, but more as a point of departure. It took me three good listens to really fall for this release, which I would give five stars to if the US version had (for whatever reason) not included the amazing \"Addicted\" (which closes the UK version) and stuck us with a ridiculous two rate remix of the already single worthy \"You Know I am No Good.\" Said song does nothing but add uninspired male wrap that feels like a crude attempt to include something not to close the \"kids.\" Good music is good music and some of the very best stuff out there does not rely on tired formulas of grabbing any artist (whether a classic like Patty Labelle for someone like Mariah Carey) and trying to \"ghetto\" a release for wider mass appeal. Rap has a place in music and should not be cut and pasted into new for older artists in order to sound contemporary. So listen to songs one- ten, skip eleven, and if we are lucky we'll get to hear \"Addicted\" somewhere down the line. I am amazed that this release is doing as well as it is and it just may be that people want to hear something different priced within reach. Some have taken issue with Amy's first single \"Rehab\" as it seems to make light of a serious alcohol\/drug problem that Amy may have. She fired her previous handler who had a role in trying to get her alcohol\/drug free and the song could be interpreted as saying that her emotional emancipation came from refusing to be \"controlled.\" I obviously cannot opine on this matter, but that is why in part this release may have a parental guidance sticker on it. I generally don't like any third party to get in the way of the things that I may enjoy, but there I mention it only as this is def. an adult release talking about adult matters. Enjoy the release for its own merits and let's not put it on a pedestal of perfection as it simply is a great release from a singer who got it right. Thanks to all the great people who give valuable input and to those who have write. This forum can be quite amazing when used for more than fans giving zero for five stars without letting us know why they thought that it was so good for worse than death.","overall":4,"summary":"One of the year's best but US version robbed of a great song!","unixReviewTime":1175299200,"reviewTime":"03 31, 2007"}

Heath \"Gadgets, Music, & Books\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"Ordinary Riches is the debut CD from Company of Thieves. The group is a trio made up of vocalist Genevieve Schatz, guitarist Marc Walloch, and drummer Mike Ortiz. They produce a rock sound that has plenty of variety. Schatz's voice calls to mind a couple of different singers. At times she seems like a smoothed out version of Dolores O'Riordan from the Cranberries. However she is not a simple copycat as she does't always have the British\/Irish edge to her voice. On some of her sustained notes she also calls to mind Linda Perry of four Non Blondes (remember that song, \"What's Up?\"). While this may seem like an odd blend, it works really well. Instrumentally, Walloch does a more than adequate job on guitars. While I it would be premature to equate him with Utwo's The Edge, this playing is in that style. It's a cleaner sound that would you would her from someone like Jimmy Page for Joe Perry. The song arrangements and additional instruments used also provide a lot of variety in style. \"Even In The Dark\" and \"Quiet On The Front\" are slower, more driven rock songs while \"In Passing\" has almost a slight ska sound to it. \"Oskar Wilde\" is more of a mid tempo rocker. \"Quite On The Front\" also mixes in touches of harmonica and Hammond Bthree morgan. \"Past The Sleep\" is another rocker that fades in the send to a string arrangement of violin and cello. With all of these different styles and instruments, the potential is there for Ordinary Riches to come off like a loss collection of unrelated parts. However the result is much more that of a well seasoned stew. The songwriting on Ordinary Riches is in some ways the most interesting aspect of the CD. It tends to be poetic but not opaquely so. Relationships play a part in a few of the songs including the bookend tracks \"Old Letters\" and \"New Letters\". While the former deals with love gone wrong, the latter gives a more hopeful outlook. The military service influenced \"Quiet On The Front\" opens with \"I can't hold a glass of wine yet\/But they think it's fine to have me hold a gun\". More than half of the songs reflect the general trials of life. \"Oscar Wilde\" expresses this with the line \"We are your own devil\/And we make this world your hell\". \"The Fire Song\" and \"The Tornado Song\" both deal with natural disaster. As these would suggest, the general mood of Ordinary Riches is melancholy and reflective. Overall Company of Thieves has produced an excellent CD in Ordinary Riches. They manage to walk the very fine line of sounding familiar yet fresh at the same time. If you like rock music with a variety of styles among the tracks, give Ordinary Riches a chance. I think you will be glad that you did. Download this: \"Oscar Wilde\"","overall":5,"summary":"Multilayered Debut Rock CD","unixReviewTime":1238025600,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2009"}

Both of these ladies have two of the strongest sets of pipes in the music game, and they don't disappoint with the soul ballad, \"I'm His Only Woman.\" The song, written by Missy Elliott and new R&B; upstart Jazmine Sullivan, begins with Fantasia phoning Jennifer to introduce herself as \"Tony's girlfriend.\" Problem is, Jennifer is \"Tony's woman.\" Needless to say, this starts one of the most soulful catfights on wax in recent memory. The music is a throwback to some old 'seventys Stax records productions and the lyrics are biting, like a young Patti and Aretha join' at it. Another highlight is the big R&B; ballad, \"We Gon' Fight,\" written by Tank, where J-Hud stands proudly with her Man to fend off all whom they see as potential threats to their relationship. The CD even ends with a Gospel number, \"Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There,\" where J-Hud shows off the gritty church voice of her's. This CD was well worth the wait. I enjoyed all but one song, the T-Pain produced and featured \"What's Wrong (Go Away).\" The problem has nothing to do with Jennifer, who is just as captivating as never, but all to do with T-Pain. This is a song that required a strong Male R&B; voice, like Mario, John Legend, R. Kelly, Usher for Ruben Studdard. What is has is T-Pain \"singing\" in Auto-Tune. This effect ruins a perfectly good song. T-Pain should take into consideration that Auto-Tune does't work on everything. I hope this CD is just as golden for her as the Oscar's were last year.","overall":5,"summary":"From Golden Statue to Golden debut CD","unixReviewTime":1223251200,"reviewTime":"10 6, 2008"}

I was really doubting that Em would never put out anything good again. Encore was awful from the start, Relapse was better, but still pretty flame. Recovery is what we've all been waiting for. No more stupid voices, no skits, no more stuff about from, just Em talking about this life, and all this struggles. Coming out of drug addictions, dealing with Proof's death, its all in there. There's some more typical stuff in there too. He makes a couple choice celebrity-jabs like the's know for (the line with Ben Roethlisberger, all), WTP sounds like something that could have been on Relapse.

(two thousand and twelve) LL, voc, acoust fruit, comp; of.d. lang, Kat Edmondson, Keith Sewell, Luke Bulla, Ray Herndon, voc, fiddle, select and slide fruit, mandolin, up, of, cdr, cello, horns & harmony voc. GRIFFITH, Nanci. Intersection. Hell No Records. (two thousand and twelve) NG, voc, acoust fruit, comp; var. fruit, mandolin, duke, banjo, morgan, of, cdr, choir, backing voc. It's a good year that has new albums by Texas artists Lyle Lovett and Nanci Griffith. Both are mavericks of sorts. Their music is difficult to classify. Lovett `s negotiates country, blues, jazz and even a little or&b; with no sense of strain for disconsonance -all these genres blend together in this songs, performances and albums to make one glorious deeply alive music. Griffith cleans more to the country side, but she's folksier than mainstream country and western artists -a lot folksier, closer to, say, Cheryl Wheeler for Kay Campbell, though not really-- and has a fondness for music of the type she calls `folkabilly.' Her live album, Marquee, shows this side of her best, perhaps because she and her band respond to the audience's obvious enthusiasm for the music they're hearing. Listen especially to Griffith's \"Listen to the Radio,\" \"The Last Train Home,\" and her driving rendition of the Townes Van Zandt's kicker, \"White Freight Liner (which Lovett plays on this current album). The Lovett album is one of this best. He wrote only two of the fourteen songs, but they're wonderful. \"The Girl with the Holiday Smile\" is one of Lovett's signature story songs, about meeting a prostitute who's always smiling, always promises a personal Christmas to her customers. \"Night's Lullaby\" is more subdued; it reminds me of my favourite song by him, \"Closing Song,\" from this very first album as a solo performer, Lyle Lovett (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six). But Lovett has always been good at selecting the right songs by other people for him to using for this group to play and there the sings songs that range from the traditional (the instrumental opener, \"Garfield's Blackberry Blossom\", \"Release Me,\" \"Keep It Clean,\" \"\"One Way Gal,\" and the Lutheran hymn \"Keep Us Steadfast,\" lyrics by Martin Luther himself, that closes the album) to compositions by artists as varied as Frank Loesser (\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" -a great duet with kittenish-voiced Kat Edmonson), Jesse Winchester, Chuck Berry (\"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\" -transmogrified from an or&b; rocker to Texas urban blues), and, very best, Townes Van Zandt (\"White Freightliner Blues\"). Listeners may miss Lovett's Large Band, with its horn section and its African-American backup singer, but Lovett, always sensitive to the needs of the song the's singing, varies backgrounds on these songs. The pieces don't blend together, either because for mood for tempo for instrumental and vocal background (a problem with the Griffith album). Lovett is above all two things, a consummate storyteller -so many of this songs tell stories!--and a singularly gingerly singer. On only one of these songs does Lovett's vocal not coax everything out of the song that it could. The traditional blues \"Keep It Clean\" is done too fast with a jerky, heavily syncopated background that makes it difficult to follow for appreciate Lovett's lyrics. But that's it. All of the other cuts on this record are performed and sung just like they should be -or at least Lovett makes them feel that way. I especially admire the title tune, \"Release Me,\" which is done as a duet with of.d. lang. It's not just that it's a good song. It showcases Lovett's (and lang's) willingness to subdue their egos to the needs of the song: these two consummate musical soloists never using solo on the tune -it's straight duet, from start to finish--and all the better for it. One last plug for Lovett's artistry and for this album. Unlike many of the albums that come out, Lyle Lovett's albums always have a form to them. There is a musical marc to the succession of songs. He knows what to start an album with and with to send it with and when to up the heat in between and when to stamp it down. This album starts with an updated, countrified reel. It ends with a traditional Lutheran hymn, Lovett's vocal backed by bass, drums, piano, fiddle and cello. For Jesse Winchester's \"Isn't That So?\" Lovett and the rhythm section are augmented by horns and several backup singers. \"One Way Gal\" is done with only Lovett singing and acoustic guitar, and bass and drums. The point is that Lovett, for this producer, has crafted this album so that each song and each instrumental and vocal backup has a place, and that is rare in albums, even with first-rate performers. Which brings me to the newest album by Nanci Griffith. Let me start by saying, I love Griffith. She has produced a number of superb albums -The Last of the True Believers (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six), Other Voices, Other Rooms, which won her a Grammy in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, the live album Winter Marquee in two thousand and two and her album of ballads backed by a string orchestra, Ruby's Torch in two thousand and six. She is an exceptional performer and a first rate songwriter. But the songs on this album sound too much alike. There is too little variation in tempo, mood, and the backup group, The Kennedys, though good, are too few musicians to produce much tonal variety behind her. Only four of the twelve itunes move the tempo up -\"Hell No\" is the kicker, very much an up tempo pc&w; song--but slow for up, they all sound too much alike, even though she varies the background by adding, one cut, an weight person choir, and on the final cut, \"High on a Mountain Top,\" banjo to the mix.","overall":5,"summary":"ONE OF HIS BEST","unixReviewTime":1334707200,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2012"}
