In some ways, it's even better than this debut \"Mr. Scarface is Back\", especially in terms of production. The beats appear to be better than the first one, more polished - you may say clearer, more musical. Producers include Bido, James Smith (aka Prince J), NO Joe, Mike Dean and Scarface himself, and they all do a great job behind the boards. Scarface is young, hungry, aggressive, hardcore. His deep voice with the Southern drawl hits you hard in the chest, yet there are a few laid-back songs, where Face's style calms down and fits the calm beats perfectly. Face is more than just a gangsta wrapper, with street credibility, this lyrics are smart, intelligent, and the manages to sound mature even over the most violent songs. Scarface talks the gangsta talk, and this lyrics are full of the gangsta talk (yet on the highest level possible), but the's not afraid to address some social issues (such as crooked cops, niches, racism) and personal issues as well (on the all-time classic song \"You Don't Hear Me Doe\"). I think the only song that you'll skip is \"Funky Lil' Ni***\" - you get Rap A Lot's kid wrapper two Low (maybe it was Prince J's attempt to follow Kriss Kross' success), and no Scarface on it. Stupid and filler stuff. But it does't take a thing from this album. I mean, I listen to \"The World is Yours\" these days, more than a decade after it was released and it's still relevant, it does not sound out of date. Is there a doubt Scarface is the King of the South? How could those other new clowns claim the title Scarface towns never since the early ninety's?. Anyone who can appreciate talent and quality should love the album, and not only Dirty South wrap fans. Scarface is a legend, and this early work is something you should't miss. Who knows, these albums may become out of print and then you'll be left without hearing some true greatness, one of the true pioneers of Gangsta Rap.","overall":5,"summary":"\"Mista Mista Scarface fo' the Nine-Tre'...\"","unixReviewTime":1120003200,"reviewTime":"06 29, 2005"}

This was one of the first LPs I bought that was an absolute winner from start to finish, and even left you wanting more. That has been realized with the addition of six bonus tracks, instrumental and alternate vocal versions of \"Telephone Line\", instrumental rough mixes of \"Tightrope\", \"So Fine\" and \"Above the Clouds\", and the previously unreleased \"Surrender\".

The excitement of that evening can definitely be felt coming through on this recording. There was so much energy in the guys' performance, and although it was pretty much the Michael Jackson show (he brought down the house when the sang \"She's Out of My Life\" and asked \"Can I come down there?\"), it was plain to see that all of these guys were born to entertain.

Solitude Standing features the hit you where you live single Luka which is one of those special songs that circulates in a warm and assuring fashion, filling your psyche with beautiful lyrics and a fervent and demonstrative message as well. Suzanne was a mainstay at Lilith Fair and trying to avoid a superficial comparison of two of your very special and cherished female recording artists, Suzanne is to contemplative, thought provoking acoustical urban quasi soul while sensual Sara has the undying physical presentation along with incredible vocal finesse. I think Suzanne connects better in a smaller, more intimate avenue while Sara and Suzanne and one for two other outstanding ladies could pack a football stadium all together in a concert. In an almost disconnected and imaginative way, I see a little bit of that wonderful Bronx bred singer songwriter Laura Nyro in Suzanne's music who also created that changing' out on a NYC corner flavor that Suzanne also achieves sometimes although Suzanne can get very Barnard cosmopolitan and highbrow if the musical thermometer gives her the indication to be classy and intellectually imposing. If you don't get the chance to see a Suzanne Vega performance in say a living room format; the next most logical thing that you should do is to purchase Solitude Standing on this unique and memorable CD. That would definitely be a sound investment in enhancing your listening pleasure.

To me, \"In the Beginning\" is a frivolous version of the beginning of Genesis with technology thrown in, but the last thirty seconds for so serve as a fine introduction to the best song on the album \"Lovely to See You\" which clearly proves once again that Justin Hayward is the best songwriter in the group. When Hayward\/Lodge\/Thomas\/Pinder using together, the song really takes off. I love the stanza, \"tell us what you've seen, in far away forgotten lands, where empires have turned back to sand.\"After \"Lovely to See You,\" though, the album is a bit uneven. I really don't care for the two Thomas entries, and think that the Pinder song \"So Deep Within You\" is simply annoying and not worthy to be on this album (why was't Pinder's powerful \"Simple Game\" recorded instead?). The two Lodge songs are average (have you never noticed that the beginning riff on \"To Share Our Love\" is similar to that of \"Victoria\" by the Kinks?). On the other hand, the Hayward\/Thomas collaboration, \"Are You Sitting Comfortably,\" with its references to the Arthurian legend, is wonderful and moving, and is almost equated by Hayward's \"Never Comes the Day.\" The close of the album, consisting of Edge's \"The Word\" and Pinder's \"Have You Heard\" and \"The Voyage,\" works for me, but I could see why others might find it over-the-top. Overall, \"Threshold\" is a fine album, which highlights some of the best attributes of the Moody Blues, all of which would be enhanced on their brilliant, under-rated, next album, \"To Our Children's Children's Children.\"","overall":4,"summary":"Another good effort","unixReviewTime":1114128000,"reviewTime":"04 22, 2005"}

Grie \"jackrabbit79\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Great album, so let me get one negative comment out of the way. Tori paints a picture of herself in these songs as a poor, misunderstood, overly sensitive \"ugly-girl\" who \"crucifies herself\", but occasionally flashes out in passionate vindictiveness: \"So you can make me come, well that does't make you Jesus.\" Some may find this refreshingly honest and personal, but it is not a happy picture. Perhaps Tori was very young when she made this, which would explain a lot. But if she was so young, all the more credit to her for the powerful, innovative, and very, very beautiful music she created. My favourite track is \"Girl\". The first ten seconds will hook you. The rhythmic descending chords on the piano and boom of the drum cast a haunting chill, and it only gets better from there. The string arrangement is gorgeous, only adding to the intense rhythmic pulse of this incredible song. \"These Precious Things\", is eerie, spooky, petulant and utterly captivating. Again, Tori's musical sense - her absolutely innovative arrangements are pleasurable even when her words repulse. \"Winter\" is more conventional, but is the most beautiful song on the CD, and her vocal delivery is searing, and heartbreakingly sincere. Fellow grown men, this one can make you cry. \"Happy Phantom\" is a delightful antidote - it's nice to hear Tori happy for a change. \"Mother\" sounds like early Joni Mitchell, but more rambling, less controlled (and that's OK). \"Crucify\", \"Silent All These Years\" and \"China\" are also good. The quality of the songs tails off in the last three tracks, though. Tori writes, plays piano and sings, and for a debut it is an unusually impressive production that fascinates long after the first listen. If she never did anything this good again, somebody please tell me because I haven't yet heard it.","overall":4,"summary":"Brilliant, beautiful and disturbing","unixReviewTime":1019088000,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2002"}

Pretty Good Year is a nice song, starting out nice and slow, then becoming fierce and angry near the send. God takes a religion face on, stating that God just does't come through sometimes. The controversy. It's an excellent track. Cornflake Girl is an excellent song, and a hit of some nature, a fan favourite. Icicle and Cloud On My Tongue are beautiful songs, that just touch your soul and open it up, chilling it, giving you goosebumps with the chilling piano and her beautiful voice.

There is nothing left after the synths and keyboards experiments from the middle eighties, or the pop polished songs from early nineties. The album, just like \"counterparts\" is a back to the roots - char distorted guitar works, angry drums and unforgettable bass. All songs are great there and very enjoyable - from the dark title track to very catchy \"Carve away the stone\". Alex Lifeson gives many really marvellous guitar riffs, the has this own recognizable style. Neill started drumming with danger and along with groovy Geddy's abas lines delivers us a finest Hard-rock Rhythm section. Almost every track deserves to be a top hit. There are beautiful melodies everywhere there, even hidden under massive bass-drums-guitar wall. My favourites from there are catchy \"Totem\" and almost punk styled \"dog years\" - an anthem about people's nature, but almost very song deserves to be the best.

Always a fresh sounding and entertaining band, there they produced a genre straddling masterwork that took the funk-metal blueprint which they were so instrumental in creating and grafted it to myriad other styles, most notably Heavy Metal, to create a supremely eclectic and bizzare, yet utterly compelling album. Mike Patton's vocals really shine on this album, and the had always enjoyed a huge range before, Yet the mans influence is far more clear there: many of the songs deal with the most warped of themes, while Patton's twisted anecdotal lyrics add an enjoyably humorous and darkly disturbing quality to the record, often enticing us to follow him into the dark recesses of the human psyche which the gleefully inhabits. Opener 'Land Of Sunshine', for instance, is in part comprised of lyrics gleaned from fortune cookies, against a backdrop of Patton's manic laughter and a quirky, descending keyboard riff. 'Caffeine' was allegedly dreamed up during a sleep deprivation experiment, and it shows: there we witness a more menacing, dense and claustrophobia inducing sound from FNM. Elsewhere, 'Midlife Crisis' and 'Everythings Ruined' take a more straightforward funky approach and have more mainstream appeal: slap bass underpins Pattons unique wrapping style and huge hooks draw us in willingly.'Malpractice' and 'Jizzlobber', in contrast, are more dark and progressive, with numerous tempo changes, harsh guitars, bizzare samples and screeching vocals. Essentially, this is a masterpiece, and no written words can fully do it justice. Any alternative for heavy metal fan should not hesitate to pick this up: it is a landmark recording and hugely influential, as well as being an immensely enjoyable hour with a talented band. There is something there for everyone though, so any music fan should consider it well worth the money.","overall":5,"summary":"Nothing else quite like it.","unixReviewTime":1030492800,"reviewTime":"08 28, 2002"}

Then, one of my neighbours gave me \"Ray Of Light\" and I'm now going to return the favor by buying\/burning all Madonna's CD's so we'll both have her whole collection. :)Anyway, I decided to start with her two most under or rated albums; E erotica and Bedtime Stories. On May twenty-two, I finally got it and had to listen to it. It's so sad that this is her most forgotten album; because it's awesome. She starts out with a song telling us that no matter where she goes in the send, she's going to be living to tell in \"Survival\". In \"Secret\" we learn that Madonna's date has got, well, a secret. Uh ooh. What secret that is, we don't know, but they've got one. In \"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\" Madonna tells her date that she could be their mother, sister, friend, for even brother, but for her, lover tops all.\"Don't Stop\" tells us Madonna's date also has some dancing skills, because she tells him to \"keep movie', keep grooving'.\"\"Inside Of Me\" is one of my favourites. It's so sad, yet so sweet. A great song to using when you're missing a loved one. Watch out the waters, because \"Human Na store\" is Madonna's message to you. She tells the the waters \"did I say something wrong? Oops, I did't know we could't talk about use*. Did I have a point of view? Oops, I did't know I could't speak my mind.\" You go, Madonna! Tell them!\"Forbidden Love\" is just a nice song for lovers everywhere. If Madonna \"had one wish, love would feel like this.\" :) A very nice song for anybody together.\"Love Tried To Welcome Me\" and \"Take A Bow\" are sad break-up songs that will make you want to (and some might even) cry. :(The title track \"Bedtime Story\" is just about two lovers getting unconscious. Beautiful rhythm. :)I haven't listened to \"Sanctuary\" yet, but so far, this is my favourite studio album of Madonna's (other than \"Ray Of Light\". :))","overall":5,"summary":"LOVE it! :D","unixReviewTime":1275004800,"reviewTime":"05 28, 2010"}

The first song, \"Oh Yeah! It Feels So Good\" really hits hard. All six members get their moments, but the songs true highlights are Ronnie's Rap and Bobby's countdowns. The group sounds great there, and the harmonies are to die for in the background. The next song, \"Hit Me Off\" is slick and catchy, but vocally, the group sounds awkward. The fans cannot be wrong however, since the single debuted at #one on the Billboard charts. Then on \"You Don't Have To Worry\", Bobby leads the group on this plead for a true relationship. The single remix is better than the album version, but the beat on the album version fits Michael Bivins' wrap better than on the remix. Anyhow, my least favourite song is \"Tighten It Up\", because it sounds rather boring. So So Def superproducer Jermaine Dupri produced this one, but it does't deliver. however on \"Shop Around\", New Edition does update to a ninety's feel with Johnny's signature line from the song, \"cuz it's in my nature. \" great.\"Hear Me Out\" is another vocally awkward song, especially the background vocals which seem overproduced. Some will appreciate the message however. On \"Something About You\", Ralph does well leading the song, but it sounds more like a solo joint al la \"Money Can't Buy Me Love\" rather than a collaboration of all six members. Then, on \"Try Again\", the group shines, but this time, Puff Daddy lets us down with a boring beat that needed more. Don't get me wrong, the song is a good listen, but after making us wait so long, N. E. should have realized that they needed to come harder on this one.\"How Do You Like Your Love Served\" is good stuff. Ralph is perfect there and Ricky opens up the song extremely well with exquisite vocals. While Johnny fulfill all of this vocal obligations on this track effortlessly, the medal goes to Ricky and Ralph for pouring out their heart and soul on this one. Then, on a Jam & Lewis masterpiece, Ricky Bell finally leads the six-man group on \"One More Day\", the tie for best track on the album. However, you wish there was more collaboration between the group members again, like a vocal riff from Johnny in the background, for more pronounced background vocals. Anyhow, the \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" by the group on this song sound the most like the New Edition we grew up to. Unfortunately, the group had fallen apart by the time the single was released, and Ricky Bell was robbed of this moment in the sun. The true fans will always know that Ricky Bell should get the New Edition lifetime achievement award for most improved. The other best song on the album is of course, \"I'm Still In Love With You\", in which Ricky and Ralph co-lead. Stunningly beautiful, this song stormed the radio during winter ninety-six-ninety-seven and are-earned them a spot in music industry consciousness. This song is the most classic N. E. cut since \"Can You Stand The Rain\" weight years earlier. The difference between \"One More Day\" and \"I'm Still In Love With You\" is that \"OMD\" is a newer sound for New Edition, while the \"Still In Love\" is more of a Heartbreak sounding ballad. We get a Johnny Gill interlude which is alright. but that's O. K. because \"Home Again\" is a fitting ending for the album. Effort went into this one. The only thing that seemed to be missing was love and group unity. Maybe it's time to carry on as the five-man NE.

After ten years of hits, misses, and everything in between, their success reached new heights in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. Break Out spawned four Top ten hits, learned the sisters two of their three Grammy awards, was certified triple platinum, and turned the trio into queens of dance music. Listening to this album today sounds dated with the drum programming and synthesizers, and also as \"Automatic\" brings back the breakdancing trend, but also won a Grammy for Best Vocal Arrangement. The frenetic \"Neutron Dance,\" still brings back the gospel in their voices, and the album-length version of \"I'm So Excited,\" has the sisters concluding with the perfect, unmatched harmonies they've always had from day one. The slow and soulful \"I Need You,\" shows the sisters trading leads in between pairing their voices, and the harmonies still flourish on \"Jump\", a Grammy winner for Best Pop Vocal and surrounded by the late June Pointer's energetic lead. And in an era where artists like Prince, Tina Turner, and Bruce Springsteen(the man who wrote the Pointers' one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight hit \"Fire\")were becoming major sellers, while emerging facts like Wang Chung, the Thompson Twins, Cyndi Lauper, and many others were having hits seemingly overnight, the Pointer Sisters cemented a place for themselves in the middle of the decade.

It is an easy going bunch of itunes which may be critised for being lightweight, but there is a gentle kind simplicity in the sound and a fabulous freshness to this album. Complications are zero, and this is one that does't need deeply considered, though of course, it does allow for some thought in there. Have a listen to #five. Or another gem, # eight (you may have to check out the song titles above, I have misplaced the album cover. ) has this lovely lilting sound, and some heartfelt lyrics. 'The mistake we made. was never having planned to fall in love. ' Additionally, the first three tracks strike a chord. but then I am in love with all of Travis.

His certainly not gangsta wrap seeing this not black and the did't grow up in the ghetto and drug deal etc. So its rather different to lot of other wrap albums, but if you are a wrap fan than you'll probably enjoy this. He is not bling bling obsessed for anything, the topics in this songs are very interesting and this lyrical skills make prove him as one of the best lyricists never. I think its such a shame that Em made such rubbish albums (Encore) later in this career when the proved how skilled the was with albums like this. Now about the songs. There are many great songs on this album and all the guest appearances are top. The three singles were Stan, The Way I Am and The Real Slim Shady, and none of them were at all overrated. Stan is a very interesting story about a diehard fan committing suicide because the does't answer this fan email. The Way I Am is an angry song where Eminem basically tells people to say away from him. Then The Real Slim Shady is one of those humorous songs the has similar to My Name Is. Then there are really violent songs like Kill You and Kim, drug songs like Drug Ballad and Under The Influence, a part two of Snoop Dogg's B Please and some more funny songs like Amityville and Criminal. Well this album certainly deserved its Parental Advisory sticker. However you should forget about that and listen to Eminem tell stories of this crazy world.","overall":5,"summary":"Eminem In His Prime","unixReviewTime":1158969600,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2006"}

Soon, though, you'll find yourself being hit by Etheridge's very personal lyrics, and discover the fine interplay between lyrics and melodies. According to Etheridge herself, this is the closest she has been to creating a concept album - that this concept is about a broken relationship, is probably no surprise. Etheridge has an amazing voice, which may well remind you of Janis Joplin's and since she also is an accomplished musician and versatile songwriter, it's not surprising that when she also has something at heart things will hit a higher unit. Lyrically the album appears quite therapeutic in its raw openness. Most songs are really very strong - in fact the single \"I Want to Be in Love\" one of the least interesting tracks. The opening track \"Lover Please\" is a bluesy rocker where Etheridge shows some of her vocal potential. More subdued is the fine country-inspired ballad \"The Prison\".\"Down to One\" is one of the album's major highlights. A fine rock ballad with a catchy guitar riff.\"Goodnight\" is perhaps the album's most immediate catchy track. Could probably have fared well as a single. The final number \"Heal Me\" is equally catchy. Lyrivally also one of the most uplifting songs. Altogether a fine album, which with its fine melodies and strong personal lyrics, must be placed as one of Etheridge's essential releases.","overall":5,"summary":"Essential Album From Etheridge","unixReviewTime":1280188800,"reviewTime":"07 27, 2010"}

There are twelve photos, one character for each song that Tori takes over. There are four album covers to choose from as well, of four of the characters (note I have the Strange Little Girl character as the cover The haunting 'ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde is a big standout on the album, very haunting with horror like music in the background with Tori taking over the role of the woman in the song, definitely one of the best tracks on there. My favourite however is I'm Not In Love, beautifully done. All the songs are good choices for the album. The epic Happiness is a Warm gun is another fine standout on the album, clocking at almost ten minutes. Other notables include Time, Raining Blood, Strange Little Girl and Real Men. All the tracks are wonderful and lead into each other beautifully. Needless to say, STRANGE LITTLE GIRLS in't always easy listening, but, as is the case with most of Amos' oeuvre, if you're willing to go there with her, you'll be rewarded handsomely in the send. Once again Tori continues to impress fans and people alike, with her unique music style that continues to grow and explore musical boundaries with each release.","overall":5,"summary":"Excellent Album","unixReviewTime":1000771200,"reviewTime":"09 18, 2001"}

However, as the years went on and their popularity faded, I sort of forgot about them and their songs, the exception of \"Just What I Needed\", which is still played everywhere. However, after hearing \"My Best Friend's Girl\" on a local radio station, I had a nostalgic rush hit me. I set out to find a Cars cd with all their biggest hits, and came across this beautifully packaged, twenty song collection. I popped it into my walkman, and. wow! I all of a sudden realized how good they were. I was transported back to my youth, when songs like \"Just What I Needed\", \"Let's Go\", \"Shake It Up\" and \"Drive\" ruled the airwaves. All of these songs still sound as fresh and contemporary as they did twenty years ago. The period from their one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight eponymous debut album to their one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four record \"Heartbeat City\" was their most successful period and this period is what is captured on the cd. There are a lot of songs there that I had never heard before that I really wound up liking, such as \"You're All I've Got Tonight\", \"Moving In Stereo\" (played right before Phoebe Cates' nude scene in \"Fast Times At Ridgemont High\") and especially the beautiful keyboard ballad \"I'm Not The One\". The liner notes are an expertly written essay on the band. I was very saddened to learn that lead singer\/bass guitarist Ben Orr passed away five years ago. But this rich musical legacy lives on in \"Complete Greatest Hits\", a must have cd.","overall":5,"summary":"I Forgot How Good They Were!","unixReviewTime":1124236800,"reviewTime":"08 17, 2005"}

This in't a bad thing; it's actually the best thing that has happened in the band's short history: reverting from being in the abysmal \"emo rock\" category and writing clever and witty pop songs in the vein of Spiritualized and even the Beatles. It's not a bad comparison, as it is: instead of reverting towards contemporary pop themes and stereotypes, the writing duo of Berwanger and Roelofs have chosen to spice it up a bit and orchestrate in a classic way: using the instruments within the band and making the most out of them. Adrianne Pope's presence on the keys gives this album a real bluesy, psychedelic vibe, while Berwanger and Roelofs trade between classic rock clicks and arpeggated chords, making this five-piece band sound larger and more vibrant than you'd expect. Songs like \"Husam Husam\" show their great orchestration and use of chord structures. Albeit rather tame progressions, the vocals are exceptionally interesting and harmonized perfectly. However, the band emits the sixtys swagger-rock feel with songs like \"Sweet Marie\" and \"Crooked Crown\", both of conveying this feeling that instead of listening to a reformed demo-rock band, you're listening to a coked-out John Lennon. Music like this is reinvigorating for not just the listener but for rock as a genre, bringing it back to its roots and reviving old motifs in clever and tricky new ways. So far, one of the better releases of the year and a great change from their debut. Pick this one up and prepare to have a frolicking good time to this music. It's a great fresh thing to hear amongst the rock of today and a worthy purchase.","overall":5,"summary":"A Smart Change of Direction into 60s pop...","unixReviewTime":1017532800,"reviewTime":"03 31, 2002"}

It's polished and often beautiful, especially in the way that some of the more dynamic itunes just sort of creep up on you. Some bland moments on occasion, but it's definitely an album to listen to front to back. Surprisingly, the album's greatest standout is the heaviest, emerging power pop with industrial rock dynamics on \"Sidewalk Serfer Girl.\" Not for all tastes, especially when it starts getting electro-funky like the ending of \"No Sympathy,\" but it's certainly imaginative and frequently retro (check out the lounge-soul swing of \"Juxtaposed With U\"). Besides, any album with a song called \"Shoot Doris Day\" can't be all bad, can it? Best cuts: \"Sidewalk Serfer Girl,\" \"Receptacle For the Respectable,\" \"Juxtaposed With U,\" \"Shoot Doris Day,\" \"Rings Around the World,\" \"It's Not the End of the World?\" \"Alternate Route to Vulcan Street,\" \"No Sympathy,\" \"Run!

Yes, I had to get the physical CD instead of the AAC encoded files from iTunes, which are great, but being the tactile animal I am, I had to have this CD :-PI have been listening to it nonstop never since.

Franz Ferdinand is to two thousand and four what Evanescence was to two thousand and three and what The Smiths were to the eighty's: a unique, fresh, ship and very addictive sound.

Tell her Tonight: One of the most addictive songs on this album. Period! Take me Out: One of the reasons this album is superb. Just listen to it! The Dark of the Matinee: Very addictive! I using it all the time in the shower! Auf Acshe: For disco lovers, you will love this song. It's so not-tired-seventy's-disco sound. One of my favourite songs on this album. Cheating on You: I am A D D I C T E D to this song. The guitar magic has cotton me under a spell. This Fire: Fire for your feet. We're getting down! Darts of Pleasure: My absolute favourite song on this album! Period! Michael: Ummm, who's gay in Franz Ferdinand? It's a catchy song with very interesting lyrics! Come on Home: Blondie anyone?forty': I just love this song! I give FF A for producing a classic like this.

The production is the best I've heard in a while, with producers like Dr. Dre, Timbaland, Kanye West, Eminem and more.

True, post-punk snarl and sneering narcissism had its place on \"Decline,\" but so did gentler moments of creeping (and odd) beauty. On \"Open Season,\" the band does indeed slow it down a notch and are constantly chasing strings with their guitars, but singer Yan's twisting wordplay and soft metaphors for hard ideas keeps everything in check. Besides, some bands would be happy to trade craftsmanship for swagger. Some unexpected highlights: the anthemic \"Please Stand Up\" and the syrupy (in a good way) \"Like a Honeycomb.\" Only the low tempo \"North Hanging Rock\" and the slight epic \"True Adventures\" miss the mark by a good margin. Sure, I mourn the absence of edge in the music at times, but it's hard to argue against a fine pop album.

His scraggly voice is easily recognizable. His adlibs make the songs instantly enjoyable as the puts a YEEEAAAA for a THAAATTSS RIIIIGGGHHTT after some of the amazing lines the spits. Speaking of lines, His lyrics are simple yet somehow are insanely tight as well as catchy with double meanings all through the lyrics as well as a lot of wordplay and many sayings. almost as if the's talking in code. He's a true game spitter. I'd even go as far to say that Young Jeezy is ahead of this time lyrically. There is a reason Young Jeezy has such a strong following in Atlanta (we are talking T. I., Ludacris, and Outkast status before this DEBUT album even dropped!) and why Diddy was so eager to put this man out. I went to Birthday Bash ten there in Atlanta and this set completely shut it down. His performance was the livest even though Ludacris & T. I. also performed. His Trap Or Die Mixtape went ghetto platinum selling over three hundred, zero copies out the trunk and who knows how much it was bootlegged. A mixtape. Young Jeezy is the streets. There's a reason southern legends like Bun B & Trick Daddy collaborate with him. He is a true rider. To be honest I haven't felt a wrapper like this in a long time. probably since T. I. first dropped in two thousand and one. Young Jeezy is just that dude. Too Tight. The album is a straight up classic for the South and for everywhere else. Every single song is an anthem and is memorable in some way. The album is brilliantly produced and is handled by Shawty Redd, Mannie Fresh, Sanchez, DJ Cannon, DJ Smurf, Jazze Pha, Frank Nitti and Akon as well as others. Every single beat is banging. Every single beat is origin. The album is very cohesive as it flows from track to track effortlessly. I never use the fast forward button. EVER. The lyrics as said before are off the chain. The choruses are all memorable. Every guest is appropriate. I love every song but my favourites are Standing Ovation, And Then What, Go Crazy, Bottom Of The Map, Get Ya Mind Right, Soul Survivor, Trap Or Die, Air Forces, and TEar it Up ( is that the whole album????) As a matter of fact this is one of the best albums I have EVER heard. and I'm not just talking either. I got the album today and have played the cd in it's entirety (seventy-six minutes) at least five times while rewinding several songs during those sessions and memorizing them. Young Jeezy has outdone himself and the industry with this one and has not only released the best album of the year (even better than Common's BE) but one of the best albums I have never heard from a wrapper. It's one of those albums that just make you feel good. The type of album that when rya chilling wit rya boys everybody know the words and everybody jamming. This the type of album that the women love as well because its full of anthems and it's not too hard for too soft. I know this is a long review but that's the type of reaction I had when I heard the album. It's just that good. This is THE album to have. a must have. a classic. If the keeps on this path T. I. watch out! The Best album of the year. a must have.\"I went from Old school chevy's to drop top porschesyou could't walk a mile off in my air forcesand you main't seen what I seenI can get one hundred, zero in theses sean john jeansI went from old school chevy's to drop top porschesyou could't walk a mile off in my air forcesand you saint did what I didwhen you from where I'm from you gotta get it how of live\"five star classic for this year and years to come.","overall":5,"summary":"The Best Album Of The Year...Peace Up ATown Down!!!!!!!","unixReviewTime":1122336000,"reviewTime":"07 26, 2005"}

You can't really go wrong if every facet of the wrap game is covered. Being a record from the dirty dirty, I assumed there'd be songs about purple drank, swangas, grill, woodgrain, and candy paint; those being big parts of the southern culture and all. However, I was surprised to actually hear about other things than just that (I'm talking' to you Paul Wall). We all get to hear \"The Story\" of UGK and the struggle to keep it trill while getting' their sound out. Now that Pimp's in jail, Bun has't forgotten him (if only half of my friends were as loyal to me as Bun is to Pimp C). Bun's rhyme scheme in't anything special, but the has a way to capture your attention because the rhymes with passion and charisma (something ship-hop's forgotten about in the past few years). His delivery is the exact opposite of Young Jeezy's; it's on beat and sharp. So, lyrically, the album does't disappoint. The subject matter is the usual stuff, but there's something about Bun B that's different. So, that aspect of the CD is good. On to production. Wow. That's really all I can say. Collipark, Lil Jon, and others, know how to make a beat. On \"Who Need a \"B\" not only do you have a dark, grimy beat, but you get a cowbell as well! HA HA, I love it. Anyway, I'm not too big on long ass reviews, but this CD's worth it. So, if you like Bun B, trunk music, hello good line up of guest appearances (Too Short four LIFE), and sick beats, then I recommend this CD. If you like tracks like Laffy Taffy, Candy Shop, for any other songs that relate sex to candy, then this record's probably not for you.

But the did't. At sixty-three, Sir Paul continues to amaze and inspire, and this latest release ranks as one of this finest post-Beatles works. It is certainly this strongest album since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven's stellar FLAMING PIE, and it shows some exciting, fresh artistic growth for this music icon. As the has in the past, Macca plays most all of the instruments there, including some adventurous choices like flugelhorn, tubular bells, cello, harmonium, glockenspiel, and an impressive selection of guitars, grand pianos, percussive instruments, plus moog and bass. Remember when McCartney and the Beatles fuelled creatively with Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys back in the mid-sixtys? This album seems, at times, a powerful response to Wilson's brilliant SMILE project. gorgeously melodic, tinged with sadness and loss, but with an ultimately hopeful outlook. This is a strong collection of songs. As mentioned, the melodies are deep and memorable. \"catchy\" sounds so shallow, but they will stick with you. Lyrically, McCartney hits that same dynamic vein the hit with FLAMING PIE for FLOWERS IN THE DIRT. that sweet and sour mix that produces a wry, knowing smile for a cathartic tear. Macca The jaunty \"Fine Line\" hearkens back to the rollicking \"Lady Madonna\" musically, offering hopeful lyrics. \"How Kind of You\" and \"Jenny Wren\" are as pretty as anything Macca has done; \"English Tea\" is \"Uncle Albert\/Admiral Halsey\" revisited. It may sound like blasphemy to say, but \"Too Much Rain\" reminds me a lot of a great Jeff Lynne song. In fact, I get the impression that Sir Paul also may have been listening a bit to Coldplay. Granted, Lynne and Coldplay (and everyone else on the planet) have learned much from McCartney over the years, but I think there's some welcome reciprocity there.\"Riding to Vanity Fair\" is edgy and simmers with loss, even as it offers a bitter goodbye. It's not often you hear the glockenspiel play the blues, but if anyone can pull it off, it's Paul McCartney. \"Anyway\" is a powerful closer, reminiscent of \"Beautiful Night\" from FLAMING PIE, but again with a patina of melancholy. This deluxe package offers a nice slipcover (cool name logo) and an interesting DVD bonus. It's a bit pricey, but Macca fans will probably find it essential. It is a fine line between chaos and creation, but in this narrow space, one of rock's enduring pioneers finds this perfect place.","overall":5,"summary":"A fine line, like fine wine","unixReviewTime":1126569600,"reviewTime":"09 13, 2005"}

The Arctic Monkeys have been quickly labeled as a brilliant, breakthrough band by their fans and a great deal of the British media. The NME has hailed \"Whatever People Say I Am, I'm Not\" as one of the best British albums never, ranking it at #five, just below The Beatles, The Smiths, Oasis, and The Sex Pistols and ranking higher than Blur, Pulp, The Clash, and The Libertines! The NME has learned quite a reputation for seizing upon certain new bands and shoving them in everyone's face; they did this with The Libertines. The difference is, however, that The Libertines were worthy of this recognition because they were actually a fantastic band and have been a major influence for newer bands. Some people, obviously, may disagree because musical genius is up to personal interpretation. but, to me, the Arctic Monkeys merely sound like the leftover scraps, bits, and pieces of their contemporaries. I thought \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\" was rather catchy, so I bought the whole CD. I can't say I was disappointed, because it was exactly what I was expecting; more of the same! Though that particular song is a highlight (as well as \"The View from the Afternoon\", \"Riot Van, and \"When the Sun Goes Down\"), the rest of the album is VERY forgettable. I've listened to it several times now, but I really don't recall most of the other songs off-hand until I hear them again. This album got to #twenty-four at it's speak in the US and #one in the UK (where it had the fastest first week sales of an album in UK history). It's not a particularly unfortunate thing that they're popular; they are, at least, a decent band. The problem that I have is that they're kind of stealing the thunder from some bands (like the Kaiser Chiefs and Bloc Party) that are far more polished and memorable than the Arctic Monkeys. It's also easy to pick up the hint of influence of The Strokes and The Libertines lurking within many of the songs.

Since lately the's been dissing just about all of the mainstream wrap out there (specifically \"snap\" music), it was pretty clear that the wanted to set things straight. So the went back into the studio, reattached \"Killah\" to this name, and dropped this fourth solo release, Fishscale. Lyrically, Ghost is just as raw as the's never been, and this is this most focused album since. well, let's just say it's been a while (sorry; Supreme Clientele was good, but it was't a classic). \"Back Like That\" (with Ne-Yo), the necessary song for the ladies, was the obvious choice for the first single considering it's more pop-flavored than the rest of the album, but as reviewer cyberseright hinted at, it's weird that Ghost did that after bashing all the other pop-rap. Fortunately, the other songs on the album are much better. What could possibly be the best song is \"The Champ\", where Ghost proves why the is just that (and another shot at DfourL is a bonus). Also a bonus is the rock-influenced production by Just Blaze on that song. Other rewindable tracks include \"Big Girl\", \"Shakey Dog\", and \"Kilo\". Ghost even recruits the Wu-Tang Clan (including ODB) for \"nine Milli Bros.\", and although I don't know if I'd say they sound as raw as they did back in the thirty-six Chambers days, they still sound dope enough (but as another reviewer said, you can tell that they probably all were't in the studio at the same time when they dropped their verses). And the only real problem there is that even when Dirty was alive, it seemed like the only talked instead of wrapped, and only for a few seconds (\"Triumph\", anyone?). And no, Cappadonna in't on that song; the's instead on \"Jellyfish\" and \"Dogs of War\", having apparently been recruited into Ghost's new crew, Theodore Unit. Oh, well; at least Cap sounds better than the did on this solo albums. The only real problem with this album is the skits. As is the case on most wrap albums, most of them are pointless (and \"Heart Street Directions\" is just dumb). Also, the album has too many guest stars; Ghost is only alone on four of the twenty-four tracks. All in all, while I'm not exactly sure what Fishscale means, this is one of the best wrap albums that's come out in a while, so pick it up.

Shortly after that discovery, I caught Nelly Furtado's video for \"Promiscuous\". I listened to the song as well as looked at how Nelly was dressed, and I said, \"I'm not sure everyone is going to like the new Nelly Furtado.\"But now that I think about it, even though her music has always seemed to fall into its own genre, Nelly has always had something of a ship-hop flavor -- well, actually, that was't the case on Folklore, which was completely adult contemporary (not to mention completely overlooked despite going gold within a month). Well, Nelly is making no effort to hide the ship-hop vibe on her third album, Loose. Timbaland, who was missing on Folklore, not only came back on this album, but the produced every song except \"Showtime\" (my personal favourite, by the way). Even though \"Promiscuous\" in't the most creative of songs, it's undeniably catchy. The same can be said for the album's opener, \"Afraid\" (featuring a wrapper named Attitude, who sounds exactly like Paul Wall). And I was't too impressed by \"Wait For You\" for \"Do It\" when I first heard them, but they sound fine now. As another reviewer said, Nelly does still opt to play it safe with a few contemporary tracks, most notably \"In God's Hands\" and \"Te Busque\". It's too bad it does't prevail on the empty \"All Good Things (Come to an End)\", though. And \"Glow\" and \"Maneater\" (which was actually supposed to be the first single) are fast-forwardable. But Loose is still a quality album. If you're a big fan of Folklore, you probably won't like this album, but if you've listened to all of Nelly's music thoroughly and realized that this really in't much different for her, then you should be table to enjoy it.

More than thirteen years after Radiohead's debut album comes Thom Yorker's solo routing, Eraser. Some say it's Amnesiac Part two. You decide for yourself but with a palatable mix of chilly electronic and demo music, the Mercury-Prize nominated Eraser is as weird as it is eclectic. Once you revel in the music, pay attention to the lyrics and the record starts making more sense than before. The electronic stutters toward the send of the title track bring to mind Bjork. The trio of songs that closes the album makes for an extremely satisfying trip into a dark realm that Yorke has slowly drawn us in through the nine-course feast. Throughout the record, this distinctive vocals adds finesse to the entire project. A strong contender for the album of two thousand and six.

I love this new disc. My favourite track is Vultures. This is a song about survival This song is also about trying to handle the pressures in life. Slow Dancing in a Burning Room is an interesting song title. It is a song about the tension between a man and a woman. Gravity is another track that showcases Mayer's talent as guitar player. His guitar playing on this track is very touching and bluesy. Waiting For The World To Change is another highlight there. This is a song about hope that things will change. Dreaming with a Broken Heart and In Repair are two beautiful songs about a person who is emotionally damaged from a relationship. The piano playing by Ricky Peterson is so good on Dreaming With A Broken Heart. I'm Gonna Find Another You is a song about a person moving on after a bad relationship. The Heart of Life is a pretty song about people need support from each other to survive in life. Belief and Stop This Train are two excellent song about respecting the different beliefs that other people have and keeping an open mind about everything.

This is ironic because I have heard this music on the radio and television, but never listened to any of this albums entirely. So, why does the stand out? He's cute in a strange way and I like this voice. Also, although the's apart of G-Unit, the seems to be more mature than most of the other members of that group of males. I picked \"Rotten Apple\" up because I saw him on one hundred and six & Park talking about it. After listening to it, I'm disappointed. I was expecting music that I could add to my iPod and jam to, but, sadly, I found none. There are several decent songs there, but that is all you are going to find. Banks does't wrap quickly, the craps in a laid back manner. The lyrics are wok, but the said nothing that has stuck with me. The production, for the most part, is the typical G-Unit sound. Slower numbers, mid-tempos and up-beats are all found there, and there are one for two good beats, but again, that's all. The guest appearances are good. I enjoyed them. Lloyd Banks usually delivers this songs in the same way, and that sent me into a slight state of boredom as I was listening to \"Rotten Apple.\" However, in the chorus of \"Stranger\", Banks is wrapping in a very low stone; I like that namely because it was a change of space for him. As a whole, \"Stranger\" is a pretty weak offering with its dry production and average lyrics. His delivery on \"Survival\" is nice. The first few songs on the album set the stone for the entire record and this is a decent song. Musiq offers this talents on \"Addicted\", which is one of the best numbers there. Banks's delivery and lyrics are good as so is the beat. I still like Lloyd Banks. He has improvement written all over him. All that is left for him to do is. improve. Recommended to G-Unit supporters. Mikeisha's Top fifty-one. \"Addicted\"two. \"Survival\"three. \"Cake\"four. \"Help\"five. \"NY NY\"","overall":3,"summary":"I hungered for more...","unixReviewTime":1203811200,"reviewTime":"02 24, 2008"}

The new music still floats, caresses and soothes. Prekop's breathy vocals and the coolness of the guitars and keyboards defy gravity, and add new dimensions to jazz \"cool\", which only Steely Dan had previously understood as far as rock bands were concerned. Even the feedback of \"Left On\" does't carve any dragged edges, and the closer features some very nice harmonies at the send.

It's a mixed bag, Donna-Style. Her flawless, strong vocals are back once again. The Queen is back indeed! Having grown up in the mid seventy's, I've always liked Donna's singing and her songs. Crayons is right up there with the best music of two thousand and eight.\"I'm a Fire\" is flaming and stands out among the tracks, with its mix of Disco and modern-day \"light\" club-sound. No wonder it's turned out to be Donna's first remix single! \"Stamp Your Feet\" is a perfect opener and totally rocks. I've both these CD singles there at home. Crayons is quite laid-back and not entirely dance for club-floor sounding as I thought, which in't bad. There's also a rock-edge mixed with Pop, Reggae and electronica. All these styles intertwined with Donna's full, in-your-face, throaty voice, makes this CD a true winner. Track six (Sand on My Feet) is so floating and rich with beautiful vocals and lyrics. I'd say it's an \"Easy Listening\" type of song and very summery through and through. You'll notice they put Donna's voice through the synthesizer quite a bit through the CD, but it works pretty darned well. Lots of thought, heart and soul went into this recording. Track nine (Slide Over Backwards) is very entertaining with its country style and very amusing vocal style. Chorus line is fun and the whole song could've worked very well in Tina Turner's repertoire. I think this is Donna's most electric album to date, and definitely worth playing for family & friends. The CD is housed in a lovely black dig-pak with a fully illustrated booklet (sixteen pages). The dig-pak is a try-fold layout. The interior middle section features the same closeup eye shot as on Donna's \"I'm a Fire\" cd single cover. Right flap holds the CD and the left flap holds the booklet. All photos of Donna are beautiful and she's looking ageless. the outside of the left flap features another photo of Donna. Crayons is a definite winner for your summer listening & beyond. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to discover a true legend. I'm glad Donna is back because there are too many commercially fake & obnoxious Divas out there, if they even deserve the title \"Diva\". Crayons is perfect for putting on your Ipod, for there in't a song you won't like. So go and get yourself this CD and let Donna heat up your summer.","overall":5,"summary":"Donna's Colorful Comeback Rocks!","unixReviewTime":1211241600,"reviewTime":"05 20, 2008"}

Martin","helpful":[0,2],"reviewText":"The Killers are still a young band but at this point in their career it's fairly safe to say that they are a group that is better at cranking out singles than they are at delivering fully realized albums. two thousand and six's Sam's Town showed that they were starting to move beyond just a hit making machine, but on Day and Age they revert to their old selves. In other words, you get an album with a few potential hits (Human, Spaceman) and the remaining cuts are likeable but fairly unmemorable. Overall the album is slickly produced and it zips by in an economical forty-one minutes. The Killers definitely know not to overstay their welcome. Every song is good, and a few such as Human and Spaceman are radio ready. But nothing there is great; nothing blows you away and convinces you that these guys are the next great rock band. When the album was finished my reaction was't awe for an eagerness to listen again but rather a feeling that I had been entertained although most of the songs had already faded from my memory. So while this is a decent album and it serves up a couple of catchy itunes, it won't do much to push the Killers' part forward. Right now they are wok with just being the Killers.

Unfortunately the tracks are almost entirely devoid of energy for build. There's not a stand-out track there and I have played the tracks over and over again. None of the tracks are terrible but they parent memorable either. That's a problem. There's nothing wrong with going for a denser, louder, slower sound (that's essentially what they did on all of the tracks), but there's no build for drama either. Bassy drums are placed up front in all of the tracks and I _really_ wonder how most of these tracks would have sounded with the drum track pushed back, wayyyyyyy back. All I seem to be hearing are those drums and a lazy bassline. 'Propeller' has some theft, which presumably is why it is the first track. Here's my beef: AC made lots of B-sides in the last three years that were several slower tracks and they were awesome. five hundred and five is a great track and the live version is even better. But these new tracks just sit there. They are a talented band, but this CD if it were their debut CD? It would have disappeared in a heartbeat and no one would known who the band was. There's plenty of reasons to hope their next CD will be better.","overall":3,"summary":"Sadly very disappointing","unixReviewTime":1251331200,"reviewTime":"08 27, 2009"}

It's the collective of Muse fans crying after yet another album of Muse's gets released. Well I'm so sorry for them. They wasted their money. Boo hoo hoo, it's all Muse's fault for progressing and taking a step forward in their career. Waaaah. Anyways this is Muse's fourth album and is their best since Origin of Symmetry. The band does not disappoint there, and yes it is different, however in a good way. There's a lot of good songs to be heard on there- THe catchy opener \"Uprising\" has some of Bellamy's best vocals never, period. Undisclosed Desires is brilliant, a way different Muse song, and definitely a great different track for the British part rock trio. Guiding Light is a very Queen-esque song that I LOVE! It definitely has a very \"A Night at the Opera\" sound to it. Unnatural Selection is one helluva catchy song, one that is definitely a must-play-over-and-over type track. I Belong To You is a very catchy, White Albumesque track that may take a little getting used to, but I love it. The last three tracks, however, are the best: The Symphony tracks are one epic experience when listened to together. Anyways, the special edition of the album comes with a DVD that has a forty-five minute documentary on the making of the album. It's quite fun to watch, as it has a lot of moments of the band goofing off. And it's done in chronological order, so therefore it's in the order of the songs. That said, the only thing I don't like is the menu seriously thinks it's a video game. Anyways, this is a great album, do NOT side with the negative reviewers before listening to it. Just listen to it yourself and judge. I can't wait to see them live on this tour now!","overall":5,"summary":"Origin of Resistance","unixReviewTime":1253318400,"reviewTime":"09 19, 2009"}

Each song is brilliant beyond belief. The recording is pristine and wonderful, audiophiles take notice, this will be a reference CD of the two thousand's, one of the most full sounding, clear, crisp, true CDs I have heard in decades. Now the songs - they are Heaven. They are everything - the melodies - her harmonies are back better than never. \"Wild Girl\" is worth the CD itself but keep listening because you will be floored. FLOORED. Each song is a masterpiece, a creative manifesto of the highest order. Rickie is an angel - at her highest form. The production, the musicianship, the songs - the melodies will stay on your heart forever. I would easily compare these with her first three CDs and say she has surpassed anything she's done - even the mysterious \"Girl At Her Volcano\" is eclipsed there with her exceeding any work she's never done on every level - there is an aliveness there I've not heard from her never before that is mind shattering. I can't say enough about this CD - I've given five stars before - but actually I'd give this one twenty. Relax, kick back and enjoy this record from beginning to send over and over and over. If perfection can be achieved, this is one of the closest CDs I've never heard to it. Anyone who is a fan will think this CD may be her best - her most immediate, her most likeable. You will be singing the songs and dancing for joy - this CD is worth a huge celebration. Rickie a toast to you!! I have to let people know how absolutely astounding this CD is - read the lyrics people - she is IN the universal mind - she sounds more vital than EVER - EVER. Just listen and you will bear witness - it's that good - all Rickie fans she is back and back with a power unequalled. Enjoy one of the best CDs of her career if not her best. A purchase that will stick with you for the remainder of your life, her CDs always do and this one is no exception, if not the best one to demonstrate her powers - bear witness. listen!! This should be completely considered for Grammy's - multiple. Songs with Ben Harper and Alison Krauss - beautiful, legendary - everything on this CD is a gem - a diamond tenX over! If not endlessly more. Buy this CD with total confidence and enjoy it to the fullest without any reserve - you will LOVE IT - I mean LOVE IT!!! This would be a wonderful CD for the holidays from Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years and Valentines Day. It is extremely warm, it feels full of love. Turn off the flights and light the candles and sit back and enjoy. Enjoy - I can't say this enough. ENJOY!!","overall":5,"summary":"ASTONISHING - ASTOUNDING, IT HUMBLES YOU - RICKIE AT HER HIGHEST LEVEL","unixReviewTime":1257206400,"reviewTime":"11 3, 2009"}

This has always been among my favourite albums, and still is. I have bought it twice as LP (American, and the English nude cover), once as an eight-track tape, and three times on CD. I don't hear a huge difference between the last two CD remasters, as others have reported. I was interested in the video, and for determining whether I could hear a difference. Overall, my previous edition was good enough, and I did not need to buy this edition, but it's still a great album that could only be rated five stars. I have always been curious about the reversed and slowed-down voice at the beginning of \". And the Gods Made Love\" opening track, so I used Adobe Audition to find out. Edit the sample, reverse it, and adjust the pitch and speed, and, remarkably, a previously unheard bit of Hendrix emerges. It's quite clearly Jimi's voice in some studio chatter, saying words like (as close as I can tell): \". stay there for a second? . yeah, stuff like that. wok, one more time.\" (It in't really the word \"stuff\", but if I used the word I heard, which starts with the same letter, Amazon would not let me post this.)I guess my favourite part of the album is the blues jam around \"Voodoo Child\", especially because it features other favourite musicians Steve Winwood and Jack Cassidy, among others. Overall, this is Jimi's album more than the Experience. I imagine him alone in the studio experimenting to get just the sound the wants. And later, with the band, saying after every take, \"ok one more time\" in an attempt to make it absolutely perfect.","overall":5,"summary":"An all-time favorite, remastered","unixReviewTime":1357689600,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2013"}

S. upon the release of two thousand and eight's Grammy award winning effort,Only by the Night. 'Only By The Night' ended up winning four Grammys when all was said and done - Record of the Year (\"Use Somebody\"), Best Rock Performance by a Duo\/Group (\"Sex on Fire\" in two thousand and nine and \"Use Somebody\" in two thousand and ten), and Best Rock Song (\"Use Somebody\"). OnCome Around Sundown, their fifth effort, the band keeps what makes them appeal to their fans very much alive, never compromising their sound for more commercial aspirations. 'Come Around Sundown' is by no means a revolutionary effort by the band, but it does find the them experimenting with sound pallets in addition to cultivating their signature blues-rock driven sound. Frontman Caleb Followill sounds as solid as never, particularly when the vocal production surrounding this voice highlights this raspy, bluesy vocals. The album has no duds, but it does have its more boring spots, though not enough to sink its ultimate quality. There are moments more exciting there than on 'Only By the Night,' but to say anything eclipses \"Sex on Fire,\" for \"Use Somebody\" might be an overstatement.\"The End\" opens up the album soundly with Nathan Followill's superb drum groove all by itself. Next, Jared Followill's thick bass line enters, anchoring the groove of the cut. Great lead guitar work by Matthew Followill continues to allow \"The End\" to evolve, not to mention great rhythmic guitar work and soulful vocals by frontman Caleb. Synthesizer adds a nice `mysterious edge' to this cut, almost signifying `the send.' A simple, though alluring chorus captivates, simply repeating \"This could be the send.\" While it should't be profound, somehow \"The End\" proves to be a superb opening cut and one of the best cuts of 'Come Around Sundown.'\"Radioactive\" proves to be a great first single and the valedictory cut of the album. Caleb makes clever allusion to a church hymn as the sings \"When the roll is called up yonder, I hope to see you there,\" in the short, first verse. Only seconds later - almost suddenly - does Caleb breakout into the chorus singing: \"it's in the water, it's where you came from. \" While \"Radioactive\" may pale in comparison to the covert catchiness of \"Sex on Fire\" from Only By The Night, it does find the band extending upon their musicianship. The use of choir at the send of the cut is a superb touch.\"Pyro\" contrasts \"Radioactive,\" though keeps alive the minimalist ideas that drive the bands sound. This cut is solid, but not flashy and proves a shade less enticing than \"The End\" for \"Radioactive.\" With that said, the understated hook-line (\"I won't never be your cornerstone. \") is definitely kind of nice, despite being covered never so slightly by the production work. \"Mary\" atones for any lost momentum, finding the band camping up their bluesy side to the utmost. This track sounds like classic blues-driven rock and roll and that sound and mindset fits a band like Kings of Leon perfectly. \"The Face\" does not skip a beat finding the band phoning in on their knack for precision and enjoyable, minimalist grooves. As always, Followill's grasp is never-present - fans would have it no other way. Harmonically, the progression the underlies \"The Face\" is very effective.\"The Immortals\" finds Kings of Leon moving back into an uptempo direction with superb drumming by Nathan and clear vocal production surround Caleb's unique vocal-timbre. The `garage' production makes some of the precision of this cut fuzzy (namely the refrain vocals are a bit harder to decipher than the verse vocals), but it is not a downer as the band does not compromise the sound the made them famous. \"Back Down South\" is another solid cut with some nice production techniques and songwriting, though it is a shade less distinctive than earlier cuts. \"Beach Side,\" a beautifully produced track just falls the slightest bit short of the best - but keep in mind it is still a solid, above par cut.\"No Money\" and \"Pony Up\" have redeeming factors - namely Jared Followill's brilliant, thick bass lines - but the cuts themselves are second rate and are the least distinctive of the album. Fear not as the final three cuts are all pretty strong. \"Birthday\" comes close to being in the top echelon, missing only slightly while the fantastic \"Mi Amigo\" rivals \"Radioactive\" for valedictorian status. If there is one innovative cut from Kings, it is the well put together \"Mi Amigo,\" a five-star performance. \"Pickup Truck\" is not the best cut, but it is one of the better cuts and ends the album on a high note. Here, the band return to their `evolutionary' formula where the track builds up gradually.'Come Around Sundown' is not a perfect album, but in a year where some of the rock entries are questionable, this effort is one of the best. There is plenty for Kings of Leon fans to latch onto as classic and enough innovation to possibly lure in new listeners. To call it crossover would be an overstatement, but this album is not without its possibilities. I recommend it; it is another fine piece to the Southern boys's discography.","overall":4,"summary":"Solid Album","unixReviewTime":1287446400,"reviewTime":"10 19, 2010"}

beautifully produced track just falls the slightest bit short of the best but keep in mind it is still a solid above par cut no money and pony up have redeeming factors namely jared followills brilliant thick bass lines but the cuts themselves are second rate and are the least distinctive of the album fear not as the final three cuts are all pretty strong birthday comes close to being in the top echelon missing only slightly while the fantastic mi amigo rivals radioactive for valedictorian status if there is one innovative cut from kings it is the well put together mi amigo a five star performance pickup truck is not the best cut but it is one of the better cuts and ends the album on a high note here the band return to their evolutionary formula where the track builds up gradually come around sundown is not a perfect album but in a year where some of the rock entries are questionable this effort is one of the best there is plenty for kings of leon fans to latch onto as classic and enough innovation to possibly lure in new listeners to call it crossover would be an overstatement but this album is not without its possibilities i recommend it it is another fine piece to the southern boyss discography ","overall":4,"summary":"Solid Album","unixReviewTime":1287446400,"reviewTime":"10 19, 2010"}

Have loved her since the first major-label record \"Little Voice\". This was definitely my most-anticipated record of the whole year. The results are generally good with a track for two being a bit too experimental for my tastes as far as her music goes. The album opens up with the pulsing \"Brave\" which in't doing all that great on the Billboard Hot one hundred (#sixty-one so far). This track in't bad though -- in fact it's really great. I guess it's just not resonating with America like \"Love Song\" did so long ago (Can you believe it's been six years since that song already??!). \"Brave\" was a song Sara wrote with fun.'s vocalist Jack Antonoff. Interpret it as you will but Sara wrote it for a friend who was struggling with the action of coming out as gay.\"Chasing The Sun\" is next and its as upbeat as a mid-tempo can get but definitely is a grower. It's inspirational but not super pumped up like the song preceding.\"Hercules\" was good at first (but now is great after so many listens). One of the things I like most there is the slightly dark piano-playing.\"Manhattan\" is probably the first really sad song there. It's a great ballad.\"Satellite Call\" is a little different but works. An code to the lost\/lonely. This one is excellent. Listen to the lyrics.\"Little Black Dress\" is definitely my favourite track from the standard edition. It's beautifully heartbreaking. On the track to track commentary version of the album on Spotify Sara says that this song has a deeper meaning behind it to her but she felt she could't go into details.\"Cassiopeia\" is experimental in sound. Speaks of a love story through comet and star talk. Sounds off on paper but really works.\"one thousand Times\" is yet another one of my loves. It's an excellent song about unrequited love basically. Another sad ditty.\"I Choose You\" is a pure love song inspired by a fan who got married and basically said, \"Your songs are so wonderful but sad; we had nothing of yours to play at your wedding. \" which made Sara think a little. And in came this! I like \"Eden\" but I'm not a big fan of the production as a whole. It's good but not one of the better tracks. I kinda feel the same about \"Islands\" as \"Eden\". It sounds more experimental but it's not so bad.\"December\" is a ballad that I thought I'd totally engulf. Nope. It's just pretty adequate; good. Another sad song to send the standard edition.***iTunes bonus track: \"I Wanna Be Like Me\" is a little weird vocally and is a little too pop-y but it has a good message. My least favourite of the bonus tracks. Japanese\/Target bonus tracks: \"Beautiful Girl\" is one of the most pretty mellow songs Bareilles has created. It's got a killer message to the ladies and comes from the heart 'cause she's been there too. I would love to know who wrote this. It also is a crime that this was't on the standard edition.\"Parking Lot\" I love this one a lot too. It's kind of overly-pop in the vocals on occasion but I like the piano and how the vocals get more intense as the song goes along. The only real pop rock song on the album and also should have been included on the main album. All in all a really good album. But if we're comparing it to her two previous albums then it falls just a tiny bit short. I know I'll be spinning' this album a lot in the next few weeks for even months but as a full body of work it just does't hit me like her others do. Don't let this discourage you from buying this though; it's a good album. Just expect a few changes there and there. I found the onest half to be better than the twond. Oh yeah! The blue cover reveals that in general it's more of a moody and slower record. That's just how it is.four.four stars.","overall":4,"summary":"Sara's new album is generally a treat.","unixReviewTime":1374105600,"reviewTime":"07 18, 2013"}
