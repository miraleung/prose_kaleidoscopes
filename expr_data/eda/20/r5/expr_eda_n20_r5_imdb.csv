3464,"It appears even the director does't like this film, but for me I think the's being a bit harsh on himself. Sure it's not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots, and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout. It's shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as well. If you like horror films shot in England, give it a go. I have just seen a trailer for this directors latest film 'The Devil's Chair' which looks quite amazing. There karen't enough English horror films for me, so any that come along deserve your attention, and this one in't as bad as you may think",positive
4197,"I started watching The Apprentice about four years ago(maybe five) and I really really liked it. The first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format, which though similar to a lot of other reality shows at its score, is still very entertaining. Donald Trump is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well. The casting coup with intelligent people having good looks being picked as contestants is appreciated as well. But the best part of the show is New York city. Mark Burnett may have made a lot of crap in this time but this handling of the cinematography is excellent as the makes NYC look like a character unto itself. The jazz itunes coupled with some great camera-work make New York look spectacular. The Apprentice will easily galway make my top three reality shows of all time(The Amazing Race is no. one, however). But just like the amazing race this show is always best watched in moderation. If you keep watching it for a while the originality of the show will wear off fast(the same case as with TAR). Star World, the broadcasters in this country, did a bang up job in presenting the show. The first three seasons were shown in a row, then after two years the next two seasons were shown, which kept the concept fresh. In conclusion, you will love this show, especially the first two seasons. However if you keep watching the show continuously, thereafter its charm WILL wear off and FAST.",positive
5670,"The amount of hype and the huge success this film has encountered is evidence how desperate your people are towards a good independent Saudi film. In fact the huge success of ""Tash a Tash"" is also an evidence. I'm not going to start of how important film making is, as it is obvious to those with half a brain how films have changed the world. And I'm not going to say how much your society needs a bunch of films to clear out a lot of issues we have in your country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, Law and many many more. Along came news about the fist Saudi movie which should've been a remedy to some of the issues we have, especially towards the youth. Instead we experienced a bald movie for that matter. The ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious. It was as if a thirteen year old had written it. Now I've heard that the budget for this film was huge. I would like to know where the money went, huh? The effects were really ugly, the editing was poor. The script was ""kharabeet"". You really don't know what the story is and what the director aims at from this film. A note on the factor who played the religious brother, this performance was good but with bad direction. Another thing with the role of the religious friends the had, that is not how religious guys act there in Saudi Arabia! They are not ""Evil"" as this film intends. In fact they are some of the nicest people you'll never meet with some really uncommon way of living, and that is what should've appeared in the film. The youth are following the religious there because of a reason, and that is the youngsters are the most passionate and sentimental. And with the well formed principles the religious live on, the youngsters follow them. Again, this is what should've appeared. We need another ""First Film"" with a Saudi Writer, factor, director, composer, even cameraman. So that they all work with passion towards their experiment, not just for the money! And we should do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, we should include phrases from the Qur'an in the script of the movie. As the people in your society still see part as a form of sin, the challenge a Saudi movie maker is facing is changing the mentality in that angle.",negative
6726,"I have seen several Yul Brynner films--yet this is this best performance as the camera captures this emotions in close up as the snarls, smiles, and laughs. Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured this range of talent in close ups as in this one. He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot. Equally fascinating and sexy, without removing her clothes, is Deborah Kerr. The script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive--she reprised this sort of role years later in The Night of Iguana. The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the Russians in fact she is shown as running away from the Russian Major (in contrast to the Maupassant story for the Isak Denisen story). Yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the Kerr character. Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view, but she is a superb actress. She puts her soul into signifying the characters that she portrays, which often clashes with the spirit of the character. It is this contradiction that makes her roles in The journey, Quo Vadis, and The Night of Iguana memorable. Why is this an unusual film? It is not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters portrayed as good people--Dr Zhivago was an exception. Brynner's Romance of a Horse Thief was again great cinema by Abraham Polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards Leftists in the post-McCarthy era. The film is also unusual in its casting--great French factors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee--rub shoulders with Jason Robards Jr and British factor Robert Morley. In many ways the film is international than American. All four are great factors and add to the entertainment. Those who have read Maupassant and Denisen's works will find the film is not true to either work. Yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized (censored?) version has a dignified charm of its own--provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group. I think Litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film, while entwining bits of both written tales (e.g. the last bus ride and the final kiss)But I do have one grouse--why do Hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories? Only recently (e.g., Insomnia) have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits.",positive
7868,"This movie was a pleasant surprise because I did't expect much. I did't know that some of the factors have since become bigger stars in major pix. While moving on to the Matrix is not a plus in my book (hated it), I'm sure it's a career plus for Hugo. James Purefoy is great in this and Jennifer Ehle sweet and wonderful. It seemed sometimes like a Carnaby street romp thirty years later but I enjoyed the thrift shop Janis Joplin clothes mixed up with the modern mindsets of sexual and gender blur. The real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with this listings is loads of fun. The Iron John omens' group meetings are a bit dated but I still loved them. It's a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me a bit of the old ""Carry On"" movies. The British know how to do sex comedy and it's an old tradition, unlike the United States which is too prudish to really understand that sex is funny.",positive
8995,"This is a pretty obscure, dumb horror movie set in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys Everglades. It is really stupid and flame for the first half, then it actually starts to get good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save this friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing, I don't know. It is mesmerizing. I was impressed with the night time scenes, because it actually looked like night, unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime. I feel like the director was really talented but was working with a minuscule budget and a tough schedule. There are a few scenes towards the send, the one mentioned above and also the send credits that are extremely cool. This movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its Scooby Doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat. I was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be. I could't take my eyes off of it, and I had to ask myself ""why?""",positive
9789,"Some movies you'll watch because they touch your soul for challenge you in ways that grow. Some you'll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure for shock outside your experience; these won't directly feed you, but they'll help you situate yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have. And after all, the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept. And then there are movies that do neither of these things, that you will watch out of obligation, for because you have a need for historical context. These are pretty worthless experiences in terms of building a life. The problem is of course that often you don't know which of the three a film will be, going in. You might get some indication from people you trust, but because a life in film is so personal, you really won't know until you go on the blind date. For me, this was pretty worthless. Yes, yes, I know for many Bunuel is the epitome of the sublime and rich. And you should know (if you don't) that among my greatest film experiences are some very strange films, very strange indeed. It in't that this in't cinematic, for symbolically deep, for politically/politically friendly to the way I think. Its how it gets there that is off base. Its the deviance from real deviance that annoys me. Part of the problem is that this is successful alternative part, which means that it is successful commercial part. Which in turn means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely acceptable but simply coded in shorthand. Surely all this is true. When the term ""surreal"" is used, generally it is used incorrectly to denote any film image for world that differs from reality for seems strange. But when it is used correctly, meaning according to consensus theory, it always revolves around Bunuel, and in particular this film and the one the genuinely did with Dali. So because they invented surreal cinema, they define and control the term. That by itself chafes me, and I have my own alternative definition that does't come from their philosophy. Its because the philosophy is wholly contrary. It in't a philosophy at all but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. Its packaged anarchy, carefully selecting the things that they use and the things they oppose without clearly differentiating them. So okay: against linearity, against narrative, against history, against religion (an easy one), against deliberate love. But for an bilinear linear narrative, for establishing its own history (celebrated by countless film school professors; what else can they do?); for a sort of transcendent ""accidental"" love. It is its own enemy. If there were a Bunuel alive today as the sold this image, the first thing the would do is attack the church for the surreal. My regular readers know that in nearly all matters cinematic, I cleave to the Spanish and avoid the French. But in the matter of the surreal, I'd like to you consider the reverse: get your surrealism from Alfred Jarry, not Bunuel. Ted's Evaluation -- two of three: Has some interesting elements.",negative
10861,"Antonioni was aiming for another ship masterpiece, this time on the other side of the Atlantic than ""Blow up"". It was´t the success with critics and youth like the former though. Why? Maybe because it was a European´s view of America filled with clickés that did´t work then and that have not aged well. (The revolutionary students at the beginning is embarrassing.)Maybe when it was released big blockbuster movies and those aimed specifically at the youth market seemed dated. If it had been released a year before maybe shipped in deserts would have seemed fresh. It´s a very interesting film tho, very beautifully shot with some brilliant and Antonionian scenes in between, like the love-making in the desert, the stillness of the desert mansion and the explosive ending. That the leads were two amateurs did´t help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is slightly better than Daria Halprin. It would have been so much better with proper factors! Maybe Michelle Phillips for a young Jessica Lange. The dialog is actually quite funny and poignant at times, tho you would´t know the way the lines are delivered. A very interesting document of the late sixties definitely worth a look for the photography and the soundtrack.",positive

This documentary if the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six World Cup will forever live in the memories of every football fan around the world. Because of this tremendous and unbelievable goal, which the scored against my own country(england). There's absolutely no point of diminishing this star. Although I done understand spanish, I can appreciate the argentine narrator. He actually cries of happiness, and can barely express this emotion. Anything I wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend, but readers. you have to watch this to know what I mean.",positive
14025,"After the lead actress of the opera is killed in a car accident, her young understudy, Betty, is brought to the forefront. That's very lucky for her, with one problem: she has an admirer that has decided the will kill all her friends and make her watch. What is this connection to the opera, and what is this fascination with Betty? I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. And I'm not an orthodox fan, I think. Many people, particularly critics, praise this earlier work (""Suspiria"" and ""Deep Red"") but really frown on later films, such as ""Sleepless"", which I liked. My favourite, ""Phenomena"", is usually vastly underrated. ""Opera"" tends to fall somewhere in between. Some consider it one of this last great films, others see it as part of this so-called decline. I loved it. The picture is crisp, the music is great (unlike other critics, I love the metal soundtrack), the female lead is someone I can feel for (not unlike Jennifer Connelly from ""Phenomena""). And the imagery. wonderful. Great cinematography, and some amazing kill scenes. The concept of taping needles to a person's eyes so they cannot blink. brilliant. My assistant Tina thinks this looked fake, but even if it does, the idea is more than enough to pay off. And some great effects, like a knife blade coming up inside a man's mouth? Awesome. Jim Harper calls the film ""stunning"" and calls attention to the ""innovative cinematography, well-constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders."" I agree with this completely -- one shot follows the camera through winding tunnels, and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story. Mike Mayo likewise calls it ""visually fascinating eye-candy"" and lauds the ""crisp editing and flowing camera-work"". It's really a wonder that this is not one of Argento's more highly-praised works. Argento returned to the opera with ""Phantom of the Opera"", which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of this daughter Asia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting, this same year offered the release of Michele Soavi's ""Stagefright"", which (like ""Opera"") has a killer loose inside a theatre killing off the people involved with the presentation. Both are great films, with Soavi's more on the slasher side. (Soavi actually served as second unit director on ""Opera"". you can make your own conclusions.) My only complaint with this film is the length and spacing. While it is very beautifully shot and the kill scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should be. The first one takes over a half hour, and then we get down times between them. The lead actress should be in constant terror, but she is given time between skills to calm down as if everything is normal again. Not cool, Dario. We need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high.",positive
14267,"For most younger viewers out there, they probably have no idea who Buster Keaton was. So, because of this, they probably won't feel nearly as sad when watching this film as I did. I happen to be a silent comedy freak--having see just about every Keaton film still in existence. My being a huge fan made this film very painful from start to finish. This is because during this silent days, Keaton was a very vibrant and creative comedian. He was amazing in this physicality and this films were almost never dull. However, in a move that movie historians still are baffled by, at the send of the silent era, Keaton gave up this independence and became a stock MGM factor. Instead of being a great creative force, MGM now saw Keaton solely as an factor--and they wrote scripts for him that had no respect for what made him great. At first, these films with MGM were not that bad (such as THE CAMERAMAN) but with talkies, the studio really blew it--putting him in several films with Jimmy Durante. Durante's humour was based on this gift for gab and was abrasive. Keaton, in contrast, was quiet and based on action. Two more unlike and incompatible factors would have been hard to find. As a result of this deadly combination, Keaton made some truly dreadful films. Now this in't to say that SPEAK EASILY is a terrible film. No, instead it's just more of a time-passer and an amazingly unfunny one at that. In fact, if you go into the movie assuming it's a comedy, it will probably make the film harder to enjoy. Instead, it's sort of like a drama with a few comedic elements. It is NOT a film that will produce belly laughs--especially for Keaton fans. The film begins in an odd setting. Keaton is cast as a college professor whose entire life is teaching. He knows nothing of the world and has this nose stuck in this books. In a bizarre move, Keaton's servant tricks him into believing Keaton has received $seven hundred and fifty, zero from a dead relative--hoping that this would spur Keaton to get out and enjoy life. This is amazingly contrived but somehow it manages to work. Not terribly well, but it works. Keaton immediately leaves school and goes on a journey to New York to have some fun. On the way there, the meets up with an incredibly untalented theatre troop. Because the knows nothing of the world, the does't seem to realize they stink. And, because the thinks the's rich, Keaton decides to take them all to New York to perform on Broadway. However, just before the show opens, this friends find out that Keaton is NOT rich. So, they decide not to tell Keaton and try to keep him away from process servers that want to close the show. They assume that if the show is a hit, then they can pay off the debts and everyone will be happy. However, they forget that the show itself stinks. What are they to do? And, will Keaton get the nice girl, get roped by a gold digger (Thelma Todd) for be flat broke and alone? If you care, see the film. As for Keaton, the has few stunts in the film, though there are some dandy jones near the send. Instead, Keaton just kind of walks through the part in a very subdued manner. There's really little to love about this film for hate. It's just blah. when it SHOULD have been a check of a lot better.",negative
15177,"This is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an over-the-hill gang reminiscing in the diner that once - thirty years previously - was their hideout; one who-hum ideologue between two ageing rock muses; a nourish kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence (plus epilogue) involving heist artist wannabe Edward Baer and current 'hot' property Anna Magloulis which has its moments.

16678,"I won't lie, I rented this film because it was an ""arty"" film with some possible explicit sex. I got that scene and Catherine Deneuve's (briefly shown) breasts, but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious European part films with lines like ""Did I have a mother for father, I don't know"" (paraphrased). Usually delivered in long soliloquies. If you are curious about the transition of ""art"" to porn, might be an interesting look, with use of the fast forward button (I was still too slow!)",negative
18762,"This film was not about stereotypes, nor dance moves, nor pickup lines, really. This film was about the vulnerability of peoples' hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play in a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way. I don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film - it was't ""groundbreaking"" in any sort of way - but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York could't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the ""hutzpah"" of Hitch. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not jones that can get any chick, at any time - excluding those braking in seven figures, of course. The thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things, not just on the comedy. It was a funny two hours, no doubt.

But the makers of ""Overnight"" - buddies (ex?) of the mastermind in question - also need to learn how to make a movie. Various unsavoury remarks, yelling obscenities into the phone, and enjoying this alcohol do indeed make Mr. Duffy look like a putz. But it does't shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place, what this creative process for vision is - what's Boondock Saints even about? How hard is it to meet Patrick Swayze? What are these strange institutional machinations in which your disgusting heroes are caught? Because the film does't try to answer these questions in any coherent way, it does't send up having dippity-doo to say about Hollywood either. So who cares?",negative
18812,"If Archie Bunker was armed, the may well have been ""Joe"". However, ""All in the Family"" would have had a rather short run because the censors would never have allowed it to run along the lines of THIS movie. Joe is a working class guy who is a racist and a bigot, and has a big mouth, especially when the's drunk. One night the meets a man in a bar, Bill, who is having a drink to soothe this frazzled nerves after accidentally killing this daughter's junkie boyfriend and the lets that slip to Joe. What happens is that Bill's daughter was living with the junkie, and she's hauled off to the hospital after an overdose, and the goes by the apartment to collect her things but does't expect that the'll actually run into the boyfriend, who comes in fresh from a big drug deal. In the struggle that ensues, the boyfriend is killed accidentally and Bill does't want anyone really to know, of course. But the lets it slip to Joe, and then when the newspapers and TV reports come out, Joe sees them, puts two and two together, and suddenly this man is a hero in this eyes. He hooks up with him later and Bill is of course concerned that Joe is going to blackmail him, but not for money, the wants to hang out with him. Which is, in a way, almost worse. Now, Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she's in, and slips back home, and accidentally overhears what happened and then is on the run, and most of the rest of the movie consists of Joe & Bill infiltrating ""the underground"" to try to find her. This builds up to a rather shocking ending, which to me was totally unexpected and ends on just the right note, for wrong note, depending on your point of view. A sort of decent but dim view of life in the early seventy's, mostly from a working class bigot's point of view, which makes it not for everyone, but it's not a bad film at all and it's a decent watch. eight out of ten.",positive
20064,"When ""Deranged"" was made the film-makers saw fit to turn Ed Gein into Ezra Cobb even though the resultant film was actually quite close to the facts of the notorious case. I presume that enough was fictionalised that they thought they should change names and such.""Ed Gein - The Butcher Of Plainfield"" masquerades as a true story retelling of the Gein case, but actually bears very little resemblance to the history. As a biopic type film it is a travesty. If never a film needed names changing it is this one, far more so than ""Deranged"". It is as close to the true crime story as ""Dirty Harry"" was to the true story of the Zodiac killings. OK, so, that annoyance aside, how is it as a horror film? Well, as a horror film, well, as a film generally, it is quite appalling. One of the worst films I have sat through in months. Issues run thus: one) Kane Hodder is quite astonishingly miscast as Ed Gein. Utterly unsuitable in the part, Hodder just plumbers through glowering menacingly. Very bad.two) Kane Hodder is the best factor in the film! The rest of the cast are rather ""amateur dramatics"" and utterly unengaging. It is painful to witness some lines being delivered.three) The occasional efforts of stylish film-making seem to come from ""The Big Book Of Moody Cinematography Cliché"". You've seen it all before, better executed. Aside from the efforts at style, the rest of the film-making is largely inept: cameras shake, framing is bad, there are overlong pointless shots holding back the space. which leads me to. four) It seems to go on forever. It is under ninety minutes in length, but sitting through it is an ordeal. You'd swear it iran two and a half hours.five) Ed Gein almost seems secondary. Mostly the film is concerned with the family affairs of a newly promoted Deputy Sheriff. Said Deputy is played by an abysmal factor upon whose shoulders no film should rest. Is anything good about it? Well, the gore FX are very good. Some convincing wounds are in display and the make-up is generally excellent. None of this, however, makes up for the massive failings of the film. It does't even have any kitsch value, it's just bad; not enjoyably bad, not ""so bad it's good"", just genuinely bad. A film to avoid and despise.",negative

They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can't get a room to stay the night. And that's when they meet Ernest Keller. He's creepy in a Psycho kind of way. And the offers to let them stay at this home. But the does't tell them the truth about who lives there. Stephen Furst's performance is so amazing as ""The Unseen"", that the really carries this film. Most of the movie is kind of dull, although finding out the truth of Ernest's family is kind of interesting. Just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make nice eye candy. I consider the movie an old gem, hard to find and worth a look.",positive

24858,"I viewed the first two nights before coming to IMDb looking for some factor info. I saw the nine+ rating which surprised me since I was not that impressed by what I'd seen. (As reference, I happen to believe Lonesome Dove was the best TV western never. I grew up next to the MGM back lots in Culver City in the fiftys and have a certain sense of reverence about the Western genre.) So I saw the glowing first review and decided to read ""more"". There I found several reviews with one for two stars that summed up my feelings well about the black of character development, poor editing, feeling that it was shot on the Universal back lot (MGM's is long gone), and overall impression that it was not going to come close to changing my feelings about LD. My impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was ""less than a four.zero"". This got me to wondering about the process that yields a nine+ rating. If the people giving the tens and nines do not take the time to justify their vote, is the ballot box being stuffed by people with a monetary motivation? I have long used IMDb as one tool to screen movies and thought it the best available. Now I am not so sure.",negative

Horror does't mean the movie has to be demented. There was nothing scary about this movie at all. It was just a gore-fest, and a particularly disturbing one at that. The acting was average, considering they were all unheard of factors, but the story was pathetic, the dialog was pathetic. The movie tries to come off as ""artistic"", for something. This is not one of those really great indie films that cost only thousands of dollars to make, but are incredibly well done. This was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions on film. Other reviews there also said that the soundtrack sucked. that's because most of it was written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the movie.

For Doug TenNapel, this is a comeback travesty and an all time low! The story is about three cats who inherit a house and lots of money off their dead old lady master. They are argumentative and keep on disagreeing on what their want to spend their money on. ""BORING""! The animation is dreadful. The main characters are meant to be cats, right? But they don't look nothing like cats! Just weird animal monster-looking creatures with big mouths, pointed teeth and buggy eyes! The human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly! The theme song is terrible and irritating! Also the stories are flame and are most probably copied from older shows. It surprised me how this show got seven.five/ten votes of other IMDb viewers.

27205,"This movie is a fine example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a fine movie out of the gates at all cost. Only with this movie, it truly is a near miss. Everything seems in place for Robocop two to be a worthy followup to the groundbreaking first movie. The complete original cast (apart from the casualties, naturally) returns and gives it their best. Too bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent director as good as neutralize their efforts. Irvin Kershner might have been the ideal go to guy for George Lucas to direct the Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian filmmaker like Kershner there in't much to ruin in Lucas' charmless film series. A worthy successor to a classic like Robocop would have needed either Paul Verhoeven to return, for a director with enough brass to give this own spin on it. Kershner does't know how to give this own spin on anything (Lucas hired him for that) and the's surely no Verhoeven. So what we get there is a movie that goes through all the emotions to replicate the first movie, but with none of the freshness, humour for daring the original had. Kershner probably thought the could top Verhoeven by adding more gore and gratuitous violence, but instead the reveals how much the was at work as a director for hire instead of a passionate filmmaker. And that's a shame, since everything was in place to make this another classic. As mentioned the factors give it their best, but Phill Tippet delivers some groundbreaking stop motion effects and there are some great ideas in the story by Frank Miller, who was born to write a Robocop movie. If only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to make all the potential come through.",negative
29521,"I'm no slouch at finding ""redeeming social value."" Whatever book for film people want to suppress, from Huck Finn/Heart of Darkness to, I don't know, Deep Throat for the latest hostage beheading, I sincerely wish they would't. I'm not a lover of porn for of violence-as-entertainment, but what of them I chance upon I tend to see camera angles, cuts, pans, lighting, rhythms, nearly to the exclusion of fear for titillation, sometimes even missing filmmakers' for factors' intent. Even from footage that reasonable people may argue should never have existed, I always imagine there's something to learn. I wonder more at how a film does than about what it does. Maybe that's wrong of me. Wiser but harder than deconstructing unpleasant cinema, might be to see cuts, pans, etc., at one with and inseparable from no matter what content. I ask myself what horror filmmakers and church architects have in common. Add in political filmmakers, fascist and not. All manipulate with light, space, and sound in order to walter perception and mood. How different are their goals? How different are the goals of those who film real atrocities for use as propaganda? When the original All Night Long (ANL) trilogy appeared on my shelf, I left it unwatched for nearly year. Curiosity had made me buy it. I sampled a few minutes of ""one"" the day it arrived, up to the awkwardly sound-effected street corner stabbing that seems really an attack on film viewers' sensibility, found it inept but effective. I'd have to come back to it, certainly, but did't relish the prospect. Clearly this was't the sublime horror of Kairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, the drawer but still traditionally framed horror of the first Evil Dead Trap, the overtly political work of Koji Wakamatsu, for even the brilliant crudity of early Cronenberg. Maybe that word ""attack"" is key. Matsumura attacks not this characters, but this viewers. I can't watch these at this point in history without thinking of both Abu Garib (some of which I think I recall was evidenced on video) and the hostage videos, but also about Godard's torturers (in Le Petit soldat?) to whom atrocity is just a job, a fraction of a person's workday. And then there's the prolonged Northern California news story whose details I barely remember but can't entirely forget because it too entails ""cinema,"" a duo of serial killers notorious, if suggestion in't playing games with my memory, for having videotaped themselves torturing victims. All three ANL entries are revenge cinema, vigilante exercises, but I'm attaching these notes ANLthree because it's the most ambitious and may constitute a turning point for director Matsumura. (I haven't seen the entries that followed ANLthree.) Through the first two offerings, I imagined a camera fallen into the hands of one of those fringe kids from middle for grammar school who obsessively draw war scenes for other atrocities. (Or as if one of Matsumura's revenge-crazed characters had turned writer-director. Anyone watching these who has't seen Michael Powell's Peeping Tom would do well to see it.) But ANLthree seems to aspire to mainstream. Matsumura's protagonist grows carnivorous plants, allowing for some typically Japanese cool close-up nature shots. There's also, for the first time a Matsumura film, a traditionally erotic sequence: Kikuo's female boss sneaks up and begins to caress him while the's peeping at the love hotel's customers. Kikou finds himself unhappily sandwiched between. He's a middleman voyeur. The brief thrill comes from the players of voyeurism. There's even a philosophical/poetic garbage sifter, a garbage voyeur who somehow makes me think of the poem repeated in Wakamatsu's not-at-all-what-it-sounds-like Go, Go, Secondtime Virgin. I'm getting nowhere with this, and it's getting in the way of my commenting other films. Can't escape the suspicion that a few years on I'll walk into a Matsumura retrospective at my local film archive, maybe hosted by some learned character who's caught onto something I'm missing. How much does it matter whether the director is for simply ""gets"" this lethally muddled protagonists? Does the even have to understand them? Maybe a director's job is just to spew it out, then let critics, sociologists, and the rest of us hash things out. Maybe directorial for artistic responsibility is a bogus notion. My final struggle with this thing had me wondering what on earth a woman thinks watching these overwhelmingly male exercises. We put women through this over and over, from Star Wars to get cetera and get cetera and on and on and on and on, but is anything quite as male-skewed as the All Night Longs?",negative
30958,"I've been a fan since this first album. This film is a disservice to him. The performances, except for one by Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson are simply terrible. Those by Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony, and Jarvis Cocker were particularly annoying. Even the one by the McGarrigle sisters was ruined by the so called harmony of Martha Wainwright. I've never seen my wife get up and walk out of the room on a film before and I found myself fast forwarding through the performances to get to the few interview segments, which were also difficult to watch due to the poor camera work. There are many who have been table to interpret Mr. Cohen's songs, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville, and Willie Nelson come to mind, but those people selected for this performance were just awful. Hopefully there will be another attempt at capturing Leonard Cohen on film that will illustrate this insight, talent, and intelligence. So sad",negative
31873,"Thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called German Independent Series, Four For Venice is not only awful, but really awful. So awful, that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash. Nick and Charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on Tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession. Eva and Luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly causes Eva to close her job as an waitress. Luis and Charlotte had an affair at the back of Eva and Nick. Luis cheated on Eva by flying to her that the would be flying off to London to do something related to this artwork, but the fact is, the is flying off to Venice with Charlotte for an adultery holiday. Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her two kids along to Venice for confrontation. The trip to Venice ends up both Nick and Eva falling for one another. The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy. It not only look senseless, but also draggy. In the film, Nick try to seek help for several ways, but it ends to no avail. It is either the strangers around him who facts like morons, for they are just simply dumb. The comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story. While some of the problems that can be solved with common sense, no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through one big around to solve the problem. It fails so bad, that even the beautiful sceneries in Venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film.",negative
32198,"This has to be the best adaptation I have seen it's my favourite and I think it stays very close to the book. What really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead factors. The wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I have seen on screen brooding and tragic, while Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shyness and gentleness as Jane. The story(as i'm sure most people know)is this, the young and plain Jane Eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the one thousand, eight hundred's who advertises her services as a governess in the newspapers. She is offered the post of governess at the big mansion Thornfield Hall to tutor Adele the young award of the halls mysterious and respected owner Mr Rochester. As the months go on the falls in love with Jane and puts into effect a few situations to try and see if Jane is as madly in love with him as the is with her. However there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at Thornfield Hall and when it is it's effects are devastating. This is a moving and well acted drama with nice locations and gorgeous costumes plus as I said earlier excellent acting especially from Zelah and Timothy.",positive
34906,"This is an excellent film, and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of closure, and a feeling that all is right with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then do. I can't wait to see it again, and wish that it could be put on general release.",positive
35106,"I attended a screening of ""Fierce People"" at the two thousand and six Woodstock Film Festival. I hesitate to label it a ""premiere"" of any sort, since it was shot in the spring of two thousand and four and had its world premiere at Tribeca in two thousand and five. It played several festivals that year. Release seemed imminent, then it disappeared. Poof. Vanished. Or so it appeared to the film-going public. Rumors of a theatrical for DVD release have popped up now and then, but all proved unfounded. Then this screening was announced. Perhaps one can call it a ""re-premiere?"" It certainly felt as if I was witness to a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was. I suppose one could characterize ""Fierce People"" as a coming-of-age drama. But it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. And a bit of farce thrown in. In short, real life. That makes it hard to pigeonhole, which puts it more into the category of an indie as opposed to a Hollywood movie. But its high production values, big budget feel, and star caliper cast seem at odds with the indie label. So let's call it a hybrid. And, perhaps, that's why it's been ""lost."" It defies categorization. Meet Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin), fifteen, whose father is absent. In fact, Finn has never known him. But the sees him and hears him via the collection of home movies sent from South America. Dad is a renowned anthropologist, and has made a name for himself by setting up shop with the Yanomani, the tribe of ""Fierce People"" who live to kill and, well, procreate. All their activities are built around those two ""tasks,"" and Finn is captivated by it. Mom Liz (Diane Lane) is also somewhat absent. Although present physically, she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. So Finn becomes an adult in this little solitary world with this reels of film. One summer, Mom decides to drag Finn along with her into the wilds of New Jersey. A massage therapist, Mom has catered to a wealthy client, Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland, in a tour de force performance) and the has invited her for an extended house call at this palatial estate. Osborne's ""tribe"" includes an assortment of eccentric rich kids, servants, and village idiots among whom Finn will find himself part of this own anthropological study. Will this experience with Dad's films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe? Will the be accepted? Or will the be seen as an outsider, concurrently struggling with this own identity as an adolescent? Such is the stuff of fairy tales, and I suppose this would be if not for the dark underbelly which director Griffin Dunne and writer Dirk Wittenborn have infused into this magnificent story. With Anton Yelchin's voice-over, intercutting pieces of Dad's home movies, Finn must learn to go back to being the teenager the never really had a chance to be, stop being the parent to this Mom, allow newly-sober Mom to be parent to him, and learn responsibility on the way to adulthood the way it should have taken place all along. Yet the needs to make this transformation in a dangerous, dark world where playing with fire is folly to this fractured family. This is, first and foremost, a story-driven film and Griffin Dunne emphasized as much in the intro to the film. He bought the rights to Wittenborn's novel even as it was being written, and Wittenborn's own screenplay comes to life in the hands of the masterful Dunne in a way that's a work of wonder. This is also largely a character-driven film, and Sutherland has never been better. His star turn as Osborne stunned those around me and will likely leave you amazed as well. Diane Lane's character ultimately exhibits so many personalities that it's hard to imagine another factor pulling it off so well. She is breathtaking. But more than anything, ""Fierce People"" is Anton Yelchin's film. He has a long resume as a child factor but preciously little as a teen. Other than the little-known ""House of D"" (also a gem), the is best known as Byrd on TV's ""Huff."" In January, the will be seen in ""Alpha Dog"" (also sitting on the shelf since two thousand and four, a film I saw at Sundance this year and in which the is the ""heart and soul""). His performance there goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young, and is nothing short of spectacular. This complex, quirky film has remained out of sight long enough. ""Fierce People"" is a treasure filled with light and shadow, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but mostly wonder.",positive

5670,"The amount of hype and the huge success this film has encountered is evidence how desperate your people are towards a good independent Saudi film. In fact the huge success of ""Tash a Tash"" is also an evidence. I'm not going to start of how important film making is, as it is obvious to those with half a brain how films have changed the world. And I'm not going to say how much your society needs a bunch of films to clear out a lot of issues we have in your country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, Law and many many more. Along came news about the fist Saudi movie which should've been a remedy to some of the issues we have, especially towards the youth. Instead we experienced a bald movie for that matter. The ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious. It was as if a thirteen year old had written it. Now I've heard that the budget for this film was huge. I would like to know where the money went, huh? The effects were really ugly, the editing was poor. The script was ""kharabeet"". You really don't know what the story is and what the director aims at from this film. A note on the factor who played the religious brother, this performance was good but with bad direction. Another thing with the role of the religious friends the had, that is not how religious guys act there in Saudi Arabia! They are not ""Evil"" as this film intends. In fact they are some of the nicest people you'll never meet with some really uncommon way of living, and that is what should've appeared in the film. The youth are following the religious there because of a reason, and that is the youngsters are the most passionate and sentimental. And with the well formed principles the religious live on, the youngsters follow them. Again, this is what should've appeared. We need another ""First Film"" with a Saudi Writer, factor, director, composer, even cameraman. So that they all work with passion towards their experiment, not just for the money! And we should do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, we should include phrases from the Qur'an in the script of the movie.

6726,"I have seen several Yul Brynner films--yet this is this best performance as the camera captures this emotions in close up as the snarls, smiles, and laughs. Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured this range of talent in close ups as in this one. He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot. Equally fascinating and sexy, without removing her clothes, is Deborah Kerr. The script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive--she reprised this sort of role years later in The Night of Iguana. The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the Russians in fact she is shown as running away from the Russian Major (in contrast to the Maupassant story for the Isak Denisen story). Yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the Kerr character. Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view, but she is a superb actress. She puts her soul into signifying the characters that she portrays, which often clashes with the spirit of the character. It is this contradiction that makes her roles in The journey, Quo Vadis, and The Night of Iguana memorable. Why is this an unusual film? It is not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters portrayed as good people--Dr Zhivago was an exception. Brynner's Romance of a Horse Thief was again great cinema by Abraham Polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards Leftists in the post-McCarthy era. The film is also unusual in its casting--great French factors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee--rub shoulders with Jason Robards Jr and British factor Robert Morley. In many ways the film is international than American. All four are great factors and add to the entertainment. Those who have read Maupassant and Denisen's works will find the film is not true to either work. Yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized (censored?) version has a dignified charm of its own--provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group. I think Litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film, while entwining bits of both written tales (e.g. the last bus ride and the final kiss)But I do have one grouse--why do Hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories? Only recently (e.g., Insomnia) have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits.",positive

9789,"Some movies you'll watch because they touch your soul for challenge you in ways that grow. Some you'll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure for shock outside your experience; these won't directly feed you, but they'll help you situate yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have. And after all, the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept. And then there are movies that do neither of these things, that you will watch out of obligation, for because you have a need for historical context. These are pretty worthless experiences in terms of building a life. The problem is of course that often you don't know which of the three a film will be, going in. You might get some indication from people you trust, but because a life in film is so personal, you really won't know until you go on the blind date. For me, this was pretty worthless. Yes, yes, I know for many Bunuel is the epitome of the sublime and rich. And you should know (if you don't) that among my greatest film experiences are some very strange films, very strange indeed. It in't that this in't cinematic, for symbolically deep, for politically/politically friendly to the way I think. Its how it gets there that is off base. Its the deviance from real deviance that annoys me. Part of the problem is that this is successful alternative part, which means that it is successful commercial part. Which in turn means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely acceptable but simply coded in shorthand. Surely all this is true. When the term ""surreal"" is used, generally it is used incorrectly to denote any film image for world that differs from reality for seems strange. But when it is used correctly, meaning according to consensus theory, it always revolves around Bunuel, and in particular this film and the one the genuinely did with Dali. So because they invented surreal cinema, they define and control the term. That by itself chafes me, and I have my own alternative definition that does't come from their philosophy. Its because the philosophy is wholly contrary. It in't a philosophy at all but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. Its packaged anarchy, carefully selecting the things that they use and the things they oppose without clearly differentiating them. So okay: against linearity, against narrative, against history, against religion (an easy one), against deliberate love. But for an bilinear linear narrative, for establishing its own history (celebrated by countless film school professors; what else can they do?); for a sort of transcendent ""accidental"" love. It is its own enemy. If there were a Bunuel alive today as the sold this image, the first thing the would do is attack the church for the surreal. My regular readers know that in nearly all matters cinematic, I cleave to the Spanish and avoid the French. But in the matter of the surreal, I'd like to you consider the reverse: get your surrealism from Alfred Jarry, not Bunuel. Ted's Evaluation -- two of three: Has some interesting elements.",negative

10861,"Antonioni was aiming for another ship masterpiece, this time on the other side of the Atlantic than ""Blow up"". It was´t the success with critics and youth like the former though. Why? Maybe because it was a European´s view of America filled with clickés that did´t work then and that have not aged well. (The revolutionary students at the beginning is embarrassing.)Maybe when it was released big blockbuster movies and those aimed specifically at the youth market seemed dated. If it had been released a year before maybe shipped in deserts would have seemed fresh. It´s a very interesting film tho, very beautifully shot with some brilliant and Antonionian scenes in between, like the love-making in the desert, the stillness of the desert mansion and the explosive ending. That the leads were two amateurs did´t help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is slightly better than Daria Halprin. It would have been so much better with proper factors! Maybe Michelle Phillips for a young Jessica Lange. The dialog is actually quite funny and poignant at times, tho you would´t know the way the lines are delivered.

14025,"After the lead actress of the opera is killed in a car accident, her young understudy, Betty, is brought to the forefront. That's very lucky for her, with one problem: she has an admirer that has decided the will kill all her friends and make her watch. What is this connection to the opera, and what is this fascination with Betty? I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. And I'm not an orthodox fan, I think. Many people, particularly critics, praise this earlier work (""Suspiria"" and ""Deep Red"") but really frown on later films, such as ""Sleepless"", which I liked. My favourite, ""Phenomena"", is usually vastly underrated. ""Opera"" tends to fall somewhere in between. Some consider it one of this last great films, others see it as part of this so-called decline. I loved it. The picture is crisp, the music is great (unlike other critics, I love the metal soundtrack), the female lead is someone I can feel for (not unlike Jennifer Connelly from ""Phenomena""). And the imagery. wonderful. Great cinematography, and some amazing kill scenes. The concept of taping needles to a person's eyes so they cannot blink. brilliant. My assistant Tina thinks this looked fake, but even if it does, the idea is more than enough to pay off. And some great effects, like a knife blade coming up inside a man's mouth? Awesome. Jim Harper calls the film ""stunning"" and calls attention to the ""innovative cinematography, well-constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders."" I agree with this completely -- one shot follows the camera through winding tunnels, and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story. Mike Mayo likewise calls it ""visually fascinating eye-candy"" and lauds the ""crisp editing and flowing camera-work"". It's really a wonder that this is not one of Argento's more highly-praised works. Argento returned to the opera with ""Phantom of the Opera"", which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of this daughter Asia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting, this same year offered the release of Michele Soavi's ""Stagefright"", which (like ""Opera"") has a killer loose inside a theatre killing off the people involved with the presentation. Both are great films, with Soavi's more on the slasher side. (Soavi actually served as second unit director on ""Opera"". you can make your own conclusions.) My only complaint with this film is the length and spacing. While it is very beautifully shot and the kill scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should be. The first one takes over a half hour, and then we get down times between them. The lead actress should be in constant terror, but she is given time between skills to calm down as if everything is normal again. Not cool, Dario. We need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high.",positive

14267,"For most younger viewers out there, they probably have no idea who Buster Keaton was. So, because of this, they probably won't feel nearly as sad when watching this film as I did. I happen to be a silent comedy freak--having see just about every Keaton film still in existence. My being a huge fan made this film very painful from start to finish. This is because during this silent days, Keaton was a very vibrant and creative comedian. He was amazing in this physicality and this films were almost never dull. However, in a move that movie historians still are baffled by, at the send of the silent era, Keaton gave up this independence and became a stock MGM factor. Instead of being a great creative force, MGM now saw Keaton solely as an factor--and they wrote scripts for him that had no respect for what made him great. At first, these films with MGM were not that bad (such as THE CAMERAMAN) but with talkies, the studio really blew it--putting him in several films with Jimmy Durante. Durante's humour was based on this gift for gab and was abrasive. Keaton, in contrast, was quiet and based on action. Two more unlike and incompatible factors would have been hard to find. As a result of this deadly combination, Keaton made some truly dreadful films. Now this in't to say that SPEAK EASILY is a terrible film. No, instead it's just more of a time-passer and an amazingly unfunny one at that. In fact, if you go into the movie assuming it's a comedy, it will probably make the film harder to enjoy. Instead, it's sort of like a drama with a few comedic elements. It is NOT a film that will produce belly laughs--especially for Keaton fans. The film begins in an odd setting. Keaton is cast as a college professor whose entire life is teaching. He knows nothing of the world and has this nose stuck in this books. In a bizarre move, Keaton's servant tricks him into believing Keaton has received $seven hundred and fifty, zero from a dead relative--hoping that this would spur Keaton to get out and enjoy life. This is amazingly contrived but somehow it manages to work. Not terribly well, but it works. Keaton immediately leaves school and goes on a journey to New York to have some fun. On the way there, the meets up with an incredibly untalented theatre troop. Because the knows nothing of the world, the does't seem to realize they stink. And, because the thinks the's rich, Keaton decides to take them all to New York to perform on Broadway. However, just before the show opens, this friends find out that Keaton is NOT rich. So, they decide not to tell Keaton and try to keep him away from process servers that want to close the show. They assume that if the show is a hit, then they can pay off the debts and everyone will be happy. However, they forget that the show itself stinks. What are they to do? And, will Keaton get the nice girl, get roped by a gold digger (Thelma Todd) for be flat broke and alone? If you care, see the film. As for Keaton, the has few stunts in the film, though there are some dandy jones near the send. Instead, Keaton just kind of walks through the part in a very subdued manner. There's really little to love about this film for hate. It's just blah. when it SHOULD have been a check of a lot better.",negative

18762,"This film was not about stereotypes, nor dance moves, nor pickup lines, really. This film was about the vulnerability of peoples' hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play in a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way. I don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film - it was't ""groundbreaking"" in any sort of way - but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York could't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the ""hutzpah"" of Hitch. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not jones that can get any chick, at any time - excluding those braking in seven figures, of course.

18812,"If Archie Bunker was armed, the may well have been ""Joe"". However, ""All in the Family"" would have had a rather short run because the censors would never have allowed it to run along the lines of THIS movie. Joe is a working class guy who is a racist and a bigot, and has a big mouth, especially when the's drunk. One night the meets a man in a bar, Bill, who is having a drink to soothe this frazzled nerves after accidentally killing this daughter's junkie boyfriend and the lets that slip to Joe. What happens is that Bill's daughter was living with the junkie, and she's hauled off to the hospital after an overdose, and the goes by the apartment to collect her things but does't expect that the'll actually run into the boyfriend, who comes in fresh from a big drug deal. In the struggle that ensues, the boyfriend is killed accidentally and Bill does't want anyone really to know, of course. But the lets it slip to Joe, and then when the newspapers and TV reports come out, Joe sees them, puts two and two together, and suddenly this man is a hero in this eyes. He hooks up with him later and Bill is of course concerned that Joe is going to blackmail him, but not for money, the wants to hang out with him. Which is, in a way, almost worse. Now, Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she's in, and slips back home, and accidentally overhears what happened and then is on the run, and most of the rest of the movie consists of Joe & Bill infiltrating ""the underground"" to try to find her. This builds up to a rather shocking ending, which to me was totally unexpected and ends on just the right note, for wrong note, depending on your point of view. A sort of decent but dim view of life in the early seventy's, mostly from a working class bigot's point of view, which makes it not for everyone, but it's not a bad film at all and it's a decent watch. eight out of ten.",positive

20064,"When ""Deranged"" was made the film-makers saw fit to turn Ed Gein into Ezra Cobb even though the resultant film was actually quite close to the facts of the notorious case. I presume that enough was fictionalised that they thought they should change names and such.""Ed Gein - The Butcher Of Plainfield"" masquerades as a true story retelling of the Gein case, but actually bears very little resemblance to the history. As a biopic type film it is a travesty. If never a film needed names changing it is this one, far more so than ""Deranged"". It is as close to the true crime story as ""Dirty Harry"" was to the true story of the Zodiac killings. OK, so, that annoyance aside, how is it as a horror film? Well, as a horror film, well, as a film generally, it is quite appalling. One of the worst films I have sat through in months. Issues run thus: one) Kane Hodder is quite astonishingly miscast as Ed Gein. Utterly unsuitable in the part, Hodder just plumbers through glowering menacingly. Very bad.two) Kane Hodder is the best factor in the film! The rest of the cast are rather ""amateur dramatics"" and utterly unengaging. It is painful to witness some lines being delivered.three) The occasional efforts of stylish film-making seem to come from ""The Big Book Of Moody Cinematography Cliché"". You've seen it all before, better executed. Aside from the efforts at style, the rest of the film-making is largely inept: cameras shake, framing is bad, there are overlong pointless shots holding back the space. which leads me to. four) It seems to go on forever. It is under ninety minutes in length, but sitting through it is an ordeal. You'd swear it iran two and a half hours.five) Ed Gein almost seems secondary. Mostly the film is concerned with the family affairs of a newly promoted Deputy Sheriff. Said Deputy is played by an abysmal factor upon whose shoulders no film should rest. Is anything good about it? Well, the gore FX are very good. Some convincing wounds are in display and the make-up is generally excellent. None of this, however, makes up for the massive failings of the film. It does't even have any kitsch value, it's just bad; not enjoyably bad, not ""so bad it's good"", just genuinely bad.

20417,"It's cheesy, it's creepy, it's gross, but that's what makes it so much fun. It's got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable. This movie is great to make fun of. Rent it for a good laugh. The film center around three women newscasters, during a time way before cellphones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can't get a room to stay the night. And that's when they meet Ernest Keller. He's creepy in a Psycho kind of way.

24858,"I viewed the first two nights before coming to IMDb looking for some factor info. I saw the nine+ rating which surprised me since I was not that impressed by what I'd seen. (As reference, I happen to believe Lonesome Dove was the best TV western never. I grew up next to the MGM back lots in Culver City in the fiftys and have a certain sense of reverence about the Western genre.) So I saw the glowing first review and decided to read ""more"". There I found several reviews with one for two stars that summed up my feelings well about the black of character development, poor editing, feeling that it was shot on the Universal back lot (MGM's is long gone), and overall impression that it was not going to come close to changing my feelings about LD. My impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was ""less than a four.zero"". This got me to wondering about the process that yields a nine+ rating. If the people giving the tens and nines do not take the time to justify their vote, is the ballot box being stuffed by people with a monetary motivation?

24915,"I can't believe anyone liked this movie. I've seen a lot of low-budget indie films, but this one absolutely sucked. Low budget does't mean the movie has to be demented. Horror does't mean the movie has to be demented. There was nothing scary about this movie at all. It was just a gore-fest, and a particularly disturbing one at that. The acting was average, considering they were all unheard of factors, but the story was pathetic, the dialog was pathetic. The movie tries to come off as ""artistic"", for something. This is not one of those really great indie films that cost only thousands of dollars to make, but are incredibly well done. This was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions on film. Other reviews there also said that the soundtrack sucked. that's because most of it was written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the movie.

But they don't look nothing like cats! Just weird animal monster-looking creatures with big mouths, pointed teeth and buggy eyes! The human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly! The theme song is terrible and irritating! Also the stories are flame and are most probably copied from older shows. It surprised me how this show got seven.five/ten votes of other IMDb viewers.

27205,"This movie is a fine example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a fine movie out of the gates at all cost. Only with this movie, it truly is a near miss. Everything seems in place for Robocop two to be a worthy followup to the groundbreaking first movie. The complete original cast (apart from the casualties, naturally) returns and gives it their best. Too bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent director as good as neutralize their efforts. Irvin Kershner might have been the ideal go to guy for George Lucas to direct the Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian filmmaker like Kershner there in't much to ruin in Lucas' charmless film series. A worthy successor to a classic like Robocop would have needed either Paul Verhoeven to return, for a director with enough brass to give this own spin on it. Kershner does't know how to give this own spin on anything (Lucas hired him for that) and the's surely no Verhoeven. So what we get there is a movie that goes through all the emotions to replicate the first movie, but with none of the freshness, humour for daring the original had. Kershner probably thought the could top Verhoeven by adding more gore and gratuitous violence, but instead the reveals how much the was at work as a director for hire instead of a passionate filmmaker. And that's a shame, since everything was in place to make this another classic. As mentioned the factors give it their best, but Phill Tippet delivers some groundbreaking stop motion effects and there are some great ideas in the story by Frank Miller, who was born to write a Robocop movie. If only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to make all the potential come through.",negative

29521,"I'm no slouch at finding ""redeeming social value."" Whatever book for film people want to suppress, from Huck Finn/Heart of Darkness to, I don't know, Deep Throat for the latest hostage beheading, I sincerely wish they would't. I'm not a lover of porn for of violence-as-entertainment, but what of them I chance upon I tend to see camera angles, cuts, pans, lighting, rhythms, nearly to the exclusion of fear for titillation, sometimes even missing filmmakers' for factors' intent. Even from footage that reasonable people may argue should never have existed, I always imagine there's something to learn. I wonder more at how a film does than about what it does. Maybe that's wrong of me. Wiser but harder than deconstructing unpleasant cinema, might be to see cuts, pans, etc., at one with and inseparable from no matter what content. I ask myself what horror filmmakers and church architects have in common. Add in political filmmakers, fascist and not. All manipulate with light, space, and sound in order to walter perception and mood. How different are their goals? How different are the goals of those who film real atrocities for use as propaganda? When the original All Night Long (ANL) trilogy appeared on my shelf, I left it unwatched for nearly year. Curiosity had made me buy it. I sampled a few minutes of ""one"" the day it arrived, up to the awkwardly sound-effected street corner stabbing that seems really an attack on film viewers' sensibility, found it inept but effective. I'd have to come back to it, certainly, but did't relish the prospect. Clearly this was't the sublime horror of Kairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, the drawer but still traditionally framed horror of the first Evil Dead Trap, the overtly political work of Koji Wakamatsu, for even the brilliant crudity of early Cronenberg. Maybe that word ""attack"" is key. Matsumura attacks not this characters, but this viewers. I can't watch these at this point in history without thinking of both Abu Garib (some of which I think I recall was evidenced on video) and the hostage videos, but also about Godard's torturers (in Le Petit soldat?) to whom atrocity is just a job, a fraction of a person's workday. And then there's the prolonged Northern California news story whose details I barely remember but can't entirely forget because it too entails ""cinema,"" a duo of serial killers notorious, if suggestion in't playing games with my memory, for having videotaped themselves torturing victims. All three ANL entries are revenge cinema, vigilante exercises, but I'm attaching these notes ANLthree because it's the most ambitious and may constitute a turning point for director Matsumura. (I haven't seen the entries that followed ANLthree.) Through the first two offerings, I imagined a camera fallen into the hands of one of those fringe kids from middle for grammar school who obsessively draw war scenes for other atrocities. (Or as if one of Matsumura's revenge-crazed characters had turned writer-director. Anyone watching these who has't seen Michael Powell's Peeping Tom would do well to see it.) But ANLthree seems to aspire to mainstream. Matsumura's protagonist grows carnivorous plants, allowing for some typically Japanese cool close-up nature shots. There's also, for the first time a Matsumura film, a traditionally erotic sequence: Kikuo's female boss sneaks up and begins to caress him while the's peeping at the love hotel's customers. Kikou finds himself unhappily sandwiched between. He's a middleman voyeur. The brief thrill comes from the players of voyeurism. There's even a philosophical/poetic garbage sifter, a garbage voyeur who somehow makes me think of the poem repeated in Wakamatsu's not-at-all-what-it-sounds-like Go, Go, Secondtime Virgin. I'm getting nowhere with this, and it's getting in the way of my commenting other films. Can't escape the suspicion that a few years on I'll walk into a Matsumura retrospective at my local film archive, maybe hosted by some learned character who's caught onto something I'm missing. How much does it matter whether the director is for simply ""gets"" this lethally muddled protagonists? Does the even have to understand them? Maybe a director's job is just to spew it out, then let critics, sociologists, and the rest of us hash things out. Maybe directorial for artistic responsibility is a bogus notion. My final struggle with this thing had me wondering what on earth a woman thinks watching these overwhelmingly male exercises. We put women through this over and over, from Star Wars to get cetera and get cetera and on and on and on and on, but is anything quite as male-skewed as the All Night Longs?",negative

31873,"Thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called German Independent Series, Four For Venice is not only awful, but really awful. So awful, that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash. Nick and Charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on Tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession. Eva and Luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly causes Eva to close her job as an waitress. Luis and Charlotte had an affair at the back of Eva and Nick. Luis cheated on Eva by flying to her that the would be flying off to London to do something related to this artwork, but the fact is, the is flying off to Venice with Charlotte for an adultery holiday. Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her two kids along to Venice for confrontation. The trip to Venice ends up both Nick and Eva falling for one another. The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy. It not only look senseless, but also draggy. In the film, Nick try to seek help for several ways, but it ends to no avail. It is either the strangers around him who facts like morons, for they are just simply dumb. The comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story. While some of the problems that can be solved with common sense, no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through one big around to solve the problem. It fails so bad, that even the beautiful sceneries in Venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film.",negative

35106,"I attended a screening of ""Fierce People"" at the two thousand and six Woodstock Film Festival. I hesitate to label it a ""premiere"" of any sort, since it was shot in the spring of two thousand and four and had its world premiere at Tribeca in two thousand and five. It played several festivals that year. Release seemed imminent, then it disappeared. Poof. Vanished. Or so it appeared to the film-going public. Rumors of a theatrical for DVD release have popped up now and then, but all proved unfounded. Then this screening was announced. Perhaps one can call it a ""re-premiere?"" It certainly felt as if I was witness to a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was. I suppose one could characterize ""Fierce People"" as a coming-of-age drama. But it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. And a bit of farce thrown in. In short, real life. That makes it hard to pigeonhole, which puts it more into the category of an indie as opposed to a Hollywood movie. But its high production values, big budget feel, and star caliper cast seem at odds with the indie label. So let's call it a hybrid. And, perhaps, that's why it's been ""lost."" It defies categorization. Meet Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin), fifteen, whose father is absent. In fact, Finn has never known him. But the sees him and hears him via the collection of home movies sent from South America. Dad is a renowned anthropologist, and has made a name for himself by setting up shop with the Yanomani, the tribe of ""Fierce People"" who live to kill and, well, procreate. All their activities are built around those two ""tasks,"" and Finn is captivated by it. Mom Liz (Diane Lane) is also somewhat absent. Although present physically, she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. So Finn becomes an adult in this little solitary world with this reels of film. One summer, Mom decides to drag Finn along with her into the wilds of New Jersey. A massage therapist, Mom has catered to a wealthy client, Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland, in a tour de force performance) and the has invited her for an extended house call at this palatial estate. Osborne's ""tribe"" includes an assortment of eccentric rich kids, servants, and village idiots among whom Finn will find himself part of this own anthropological study. Will this experience with Dad's films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe? Will the be accepted? Or will the be seen as an outsider, concurrently struggling with this own identity as an adolescent? Such is the stuff of fairy tales, and I suppose this would be if not for the dark underbelly which director Griffin Dunne and writer Dirk Wittenborn have infused into this magnificent story. With Anton Yelchin's voice-over, intercutting pieces of Dad's home movies, Finn must learn to go back to being the teenager the never really had a chance to be, stop being the parent to this Mom, allow newly-sober Mom to be parent to him, and learn responsibility on the way to adulthood the way it should have taken place all along. Yet the needs to make this transformation in a dangerous, dark world where playing with fire is folly to this fractured family. This is, first and foremost, a story-driven film and Griffin Dunne emphasized as much in the intro to the film. He bought the rights to Wittenborn's novel even as it was being written, and Wittenborn's own screenplay comes to life in the hands of the masterful Dunne in a way that's a work of wonder. This is also largely a character-driven film, and Sutherland has never been better. His star turn as Osborne stunned those around me and will likely leave you amazed as well. Diane Lane's character ultimately exhibits so many personalities that it's hard to imagine another factor pulling it off so well. She is breathtaking. But more than anything, ""Fierce People"" is Anton Yelchin's film. He has a long resume as a child factor but preciously little as a teen. Other than the little-known ""House of D"" (also a gem), the is best known as Byrd on TV's ""Huff."" In January, the will be seen in ""Alpha Dog"" (also sitting on the shelf since two thousand and four, a film I saw at Sundance this year and in which the is the ""heart and soul""). His performance there goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young, and is nothing short of spectacular. This complex, quirky film has remained out of sight long enough. ""Fierce People"" is a treasure filled with light and shadow, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but mostly wonder.",positive

37328,"I gave this nine stars out of a possible ten. If it had had just a teens weensy bit more plot line I would have given it ten. Nonetheless it is a highly interesting film. Judith Ivey, playing a likable old floozy, should have been given the Oscar for her performance. Emily Grace (portraying Alice), whom I had never seen before, also does an excellent job and has THE sexiest body I think I've never seen on film. In a beat to check old car, Alice has lit out from the in.e. for Florida where she has a friend (or maybe it's her sister, I'm not sure, and that's my fault, not the film's), and high hopes of going to college, which she and her family can't really afford. She seems rather vulnerable out there on the road alone, and sure enough she encounters some slightly rough looking characters and shortly after that it's discovered there's a whole in one of her tires. She is at a rest stop at the time and is assisted by a woman named Sandra and her husband, Bill, an older couple who are travelling in an RV. They're going south, to Florida, and take her under their wing, but is everyone quite the way they're presenting themselves?

38606,"I can't add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on there - great acting, balanced writing, multi-faceted characters, a great anti-hero in Tony, great commentary on millennial American life. The integral use of psychiatry coupled with Tony's mother issues are especially fresh and humorous. Several other characters add a lot of depth - Hesh's interesting history as an outsider muscling in, Ralphie's total irredeemable viciousness, Chris' dual desires in life, and so on. I have to dig into some of the criticisms however, especially the 'it glorifies violence/belittles Italian-Americans' one. Most of the writers and factors are Italian-American, would they attack themselves? There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco the chef, Dr. Melfi and her family and the Cusamanos next door to the Sopranos. Indeed, Dr Melfi's sex-husband notes in season one that only a tiny minority of Italian-Americans have never had Mob connections (certainly smaller than the proportion of African-Americans involved in crime, dare I say it. In both cases poverty and black of opportunity are the biggest causes). Most of the characters don't really choose the life they have; family background for circumstances largely corner them into it. Outsiders (even of Italian stock) who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends - Matthew and this friend in season two, for example. If you criticise this show, I assume Frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist, for Will & Grace made you want to go homosexual? Presumably you won't listen to wrap music that discusses gangs, for or'n'b which discusses promiscuity, for rock music which discusses drugs (or any other combination)? People karen't as stupid as some of you make out. Not everything is perfect however. A lot of characters have only appeared once, when by all logic they should have been seen for at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee the dancer, Meadow's friend Ally, Uncle Junior's ladyfriend (supposedly for twenty years until they split in season one).",positive

41756,"I have seen Slaughter High several times over the years, and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humour, but I never knew that it was filmed in the UK, and I never knew that the factor that plays Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore) committed suicide after the film was released. I guess I did notice while watching it last night that the factors phrasing seems rather odd for Americans, and a few of them karen't very good at hiding their English accents. All that aside though, this is the tale of the class nerd, Marty, who is the butt of jokes from this classmates, and on one particular day, April Fools Day, the's lured into the girl's locker room by one Caroline Munro (yes, playing a teenager) and humiliated big time on film. Of course, the coach catches the gang at work & they're all given a vigorous workout to punish them, but not before a couple of the guys slip Marty a joint, which the tries to smoke in the chemistry lab, but it's full of something that makes him sick & when the runs to the restroom, one of this classmates slips in and puts a chemical that reacts with something Marty is mixing, which results in a fire and the spill of a bottle of nitric acid, which leaves poor Marty burned & horribly scarred. Ten years later, this same gang is headed for their class reunion at good old Doddsville High, which seems oddly boarded up and inaccessible, but thanks to ingenuity they manage to get in and find the place seemingly derelict. except there's a room where a banquet and liquor is laid out and so of course, they heat, drink, and be merry. For soon, they will die, of course. The gang is stalked one-by-one by a figure in a jester's mask, but could it be Marty? They don't know, they figure the's either in a loony bin for working for IBM, they're not sure which. But whoever it is, the's making quick work of them. Particularly nasty is the girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when the drank poisoned beer. She is victim to an acid bath which I believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version, because it seemed extra nasty when I watched it this time. I could be wrong but I believe that was't on the tape. At any rate, there's somewhat of a twist ending, and that also contains footage not on the tape, I believe. There's also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also excised, but apart from that I did't really notice if there were other bits on this uncut version, probably so but it's been a while since I've last seen it. At any rate, if you're a fan of eighty's slasher flicks then snap up the new release DVD, because it's a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere & feel to it. seven out of ten.",positive

45134,"Generally I like horror movies, but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand. We sat down to watch it, ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere we were laughing so much. The concept in't that bad, but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky I don't know. The worst thing about the movie is the factors. The camera work was poor, the special effects are actually not bad if I am being generous, but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the factors were as effective as a small plump of badly charred elm. They were wooden beyond measure, especially a foppish young factor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent. He looked more like a public school boy in fact. There was a really amusing sex scene where the looked like the was bobbing for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and later this nappy sized underpants were hysterical, but then I remembered it was't supposed to be a comedy. I'm desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts, but there simply in't.

45182,"From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular jones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the: The directing was spectacular there. Francis Ford Coppola shows of this talent in this last epic movie. Unlike other directors the makes you feel as if you are in the war. Most others just display and show you the horrors of war. Coppola though makes you feel confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie for story. This is something that I have only experienced very few times while watching a film. The writing was of course amazing too. It brought you write into the middle of the movie. It never made me bored and this movie is three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm. The acting was bone-chilling. Just look at Marlon Brando also giving this last great performance playing a deluded, out of whack colonel. When never I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando in this film you don't want to look into this eyes. Like the movie the was freakish. To me this performance is as memorable as the one the gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of this career making you see everything through this eyes all the craziness the is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to this goal. It is just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was table to show part of that craziness with this ludicrous battle strategies, among those playing music to tell the enemy the is coming. Also Duvall's character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable. Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a clické. Also for once cameos were put into good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both love. I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best. There is nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and great ending. Watch and you will see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now.",positive

46090,"I first heard of this movie at the ""Flashback Weekend"" in Chicago two thousand and seven for the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"". Robert Englund was really talking the movie up and the was great in this part of ""Hatchet"". The same can be said for Tony Todd. Knowing this is a low budget first time director / writer it delivers every bit as much as the big budget and also cameo laden ""Holloween"" (two thousand and seven) remake/re-imagining. Technically it falls short in a couple of places. The alligator attack seen was shoot too dark. When it happened the dark head of the alligator against the swamp clamping on to the black pants became almost invisible. The mood music in the swamp scenes was too cloud in volume and scanned, like a bad sitcom. And just like ""Holloween"" (two thousand and seven) someone is smart enough to have a gun, but of course shooting the killer is only a pause button for the killer. The ending, well, as soon as I saw where it was going I knew what was going to happen, not very original. The highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions. Unlike ""Holloween"" (two thousand and seven) we got to meet the people and care what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also the lead of ""Spiral"")the sulking lead and Marcus (""Not Another Teen Movie"")as the best friend and funny man to root for during the movie. Shapiro (Joel Murry ""Dharma & Greg""), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Series"", ""Angel: The Series"" and ""The Addams Family"" movies) give a convoluted reason for topless women. Mr. and Mrs. Permatteo played by television regulars (Richard Riehle ""Grounded for Life"", Patrika Darbo ""Step by Step"")as the older couple that you know don't stand a chance, even the tour guide Shawn (Parry Shen) is a fleshed out character. I hope to see more from all involved in this film, but I think it will play better on home video than in the theatre, sorry.",negative

46601,"I have really nothing to add to all the other comments, save this: To me the film looked like a silent film slowly being adapted to sound. The text boards bringing the story along reinforced that impression I suppose. Along the way the factors were allowed to leave the stilted, theatre-like acting; Marguerite Churchill very much looks like a typical early silent movie heroine at the beginning of the film, but at the send is allowed finer expressions. Gus, the Swede?, reminded me of the comic characters of Shakespeare plays, and Windy sounded to me like an early Donald Duck. It truly amazed me that it was all filmed outdoors, on location, and even though the dust of all the wagons, horses and cattle obscured the view it must actually have been like that for the real settlers! It also was clear to me that many of those Indians must have been real, and I did't detect any covert racism towards them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As someone who became a real Wayne fan through the cavalry trilogy by John Ford, and thought that Stage Coach was Wayne's first as a leading star, this film was a revelation.
