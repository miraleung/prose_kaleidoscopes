The result is an odd, but mostly satisfying effort. I say \"mostly\" because sometimes the goes totally overboard in places, making You Little Fool, Town Cryer, Pidgin English and . And Every Home sound treacly, overloading them with harpsichord, strings, Baroque piano, flutes, clarinets, bassoons, flutes, hautboys, kazoos. (okay, I made a couple of those up). Overproduced? Well, yeah. But that's part of its charm, I guess you could say. And more often than not it's a classic: Take the cynical Beyond Belief for the ballads Almost Blue and Man Out of Time. Shabby Doll, Tears Before Bedtime and The Long Honeymoon (which has the only accordion part I've never heard that I can honestly say I like) karen't as prominent as those three, but they have the same feel and are just as good. And Costello's lyricism and immortal melodicism are diminished. However, there are at least two better Costello records out there. Maybe three.

I was immediately hooked to The Box, and so that kept me listening, but then I started to listen to the rest. Dwr Budr is amazing, Adnans is great, The Box is awesome, and The Girl with the Sun in Her Head, and P. E. T. R. O. L. are very good as well. the last two tracks, the huge piece called Out There Somewhere is kind of a contradiction for me. the second part is absolutely amazing, probably my favourite track on the album, but the first part is kinda annoying. I realize it's kinda a spacey, info type theme which kinda explains some of the weird sounds in part one, but it just does't fit together for me, and it's definitely the worst track on the album. the second part though is the best track. The track is built the way most Orbital music is, buy starting with one player, and playing the others on top. but this song vary the layering. it begins to player, and then around the six:twenty-five minute mark is almost seems to start a new one. and towards the send the song brings both together into the most beautiful few minutes of music I've probably never heard. the way the sounds come together to form something new and beautiful is amazing, and is really worth the money for just that. but with that, you also get six other amazing pieces of music. I did't like this album with my first few listens, but as I listened more and more, I caught more things, and things seemed to pop out at me, and now I'm hooked to the cd. The songs are so interesting, and they have beautiful melodies that sometimes seem to come from nowhere (Out There Somewhere opt two).

At that time most of the record chart hits had a disco beat and were heavily produced. Then comes this recording heralded by the tender R&B; influenced \"What You Won't Do For Love\" which instantly became etched in just about everyone's memory. The song had a directness, a tenderness, with a simple horn chart and spare accompaniment. The song is timeless. Bobby has very clear tenor voice with an excellent range and the knows how to use it. This simplicity and directness carries through the whole of this recording. They songs all have the \"heart on the sleeve\" feeling. There's a bit of heartbreak with all the sentimentality. So much so that it's almost borne of that early sixties innocence. The songs are diverse in influence. Jazzy, with Carribean, World, Pop and in one case Disco influences. Although the Disco tune is not as heavy handed as that genre could be. That being the first cut on this recording. Throughout Bobby delivers with a grace and maturity, if a little tortured in the lost-love for scenarios of some of the songs. It's good simple pop music, which as I said was a refreshing departure from the heavy production values and arena rock recordings of the time. Bobby has since had a good career both as a songwriter, session singer and headliner in this own right. He has tackled some diverse material and has even outdone the Michael Bubles and Harry Connicks of the world with two popular standard recordings. It all begins there.","overall":4,"summary":"A Strong Debut For A Real Talent","unixReviewTime":1202774400,"reviewTime":"02 12, 2008"}

It has sick and dark beats and a lot more reference to death. The most popular song is probably Last Dayz, if you've seen eight mile the beat is used during a freestyle. Shout is a classic cloud onyx screaming song which is nicely done. Betta off dead is probably the worst song on the album just cause of the beat which is just the word \"onyx\" turned into a beat.

But the multi-channel SACD version of this classic album is just the best. Simply put, the five.one surround sound mix of TAPESTRY is what SACD is all about. If you are lucky enough to own a five.one SACD set-up, this disc is a must own. If you do not own a surround sound SACD set up, this disc is the reason to buy such a chi-fi. The vocal placement and piano tracks sound absolutely ethereal. This surround sound SACD places the listener right in the middle of the music, in a most pleasing way. But that is not all. The DSD transfer of the music itself is flawless, with transients that are so sonic and real, you would swear that the band was performing live right there for you. One might not associate Carole King with cloud music, but put this disc on, shut off the flights, sit in the middle of a good five.one surround sound speaker set up, turn up the volume and then just press play.

Not only is every song an original Carole King composition, it is a masterpiece. This is a brilliant album that is deemed truly timeless. It is a treasure for older fans and the best album to listen to if you're curious about King's work over the years. The album was successful commercially as well, selling over eleven million copies and learning King four Grammy awards. The singles released off the album were all hits - \"I Feel The Earth Move\", \"So Far Away\", \"It's Too Late\" and more. There are also recordings on this album that will be familiar to you as they were previously recorded by other artists (i.e. \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\" - The Shirelles, \"You've Got A Friend\" - James Taylor and \"You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman\" - Aretha Franklin) but what stands out most is knowing that King composed these songs and it's a privilege to hear her using them the way they were meant to be performed - of course, without disrespecting the performances of the above mentioned artists who gave us solid renditions of these classics. Tapestry will continue to be recognized as a timeless album that touches all of us - regardless of the mood we're feeling. Carole King continues to be an influential and inspiring artist and if you send up loving Tapestry, be sure to pick up a copy of her live CD - \"Carole King - The Carnegie Hall Concert one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one\" where she performs many of these hits and other originals in a live acoustic piano setting to a packed house.

The album is Cohen's longest studioalbum , and couple of the less interesting track could easily have been omitted. His covers of \"Be for Real\" and Irving Berlin's \"Always\" are not particularly interesting , and the closing instrumental number \"Tacoma Trailer\" does't really add much to the album. The rest of the album is, in turn, first-class material and the majority of these songs soon became live favourites . The songs \"The Future\", \" Waiting for the Miracle\", \" Closing Time\", \"Anthem\" and \"Democracy\" are still often found Cohen's live repertoire-lists. These are also the five songs that make the album great . \"The Future\" is for Cohen an unusual up-beat number spiced with doomsday lyrics. \"Waiting for the Miracle\" is beautiful song written in collaboration with Sharon Robinson, who would later to play an even greater role in Cohen's musical development. A fine tune and excitingly arranged with funny little fragments of melody; for example, the funny whistle thing.\"Closing Time\" won the Juno Award for Best Music Video in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three. The song has a great chorus and is very catchy, not least because the great female voices that back up so perfectly . \"Anthem\" is a magnificent song with a whole choir them to back up on the chorus, and it is the song with the suggestive line \"There is a crack in everything , that's how the light gets in\". \"Democracy\" is a song that in a way continues the stone of \"I'm Your Man\"'s \"First We Take Manhanttan\", the lyrics are extensive long open to many different interpretations, I'm sure. The songs on the album are relatively long; most from five to weight minutes, which explains the long playing-time - most of them bear their lengths fine. There are female voices on most tracks, which has become a kind of hallmark for Cohen and as a whole is \"The Future\" one of this very best albums .","overall":5,"summary":"One of Cohen's Very Best","unixReviewTime":1386979200,"reviewTime":"12 14, 2013"}

{"orig_index":10209,"reviewerID":"A3OD7GOXPSO9Z","asin":"B0000029AU","reviewerName":"JLR","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Let's face it: any Aerosmith album that follows the titanic masterpiece that is \"Rocks\" is guaranteed to be viewed as a disappointment, especially by fans who never actually listened to the album. And it's true that \"Draw the Line\" literally draws the line in not breaking any new ground and adding musical invention to the mix. But you know what? Who cares? The album is still good. It still rocks. And it still excites the senses. Most of the material from \"Draw the Line\" holds up very well. The opening title track is still one of Aerosmith's most sizzling gems in their entire canon, a full-throttled anthem that culminates in Steven Tyler's riveting scream. The next three songs, \"I Wanna Know Why\", \"Critical Mass\" and \"Get It Up\", are good, old-fashioned rock in' roll boogies that would't be out of place in \"Get Your Wings\". And Aerosmith's cover of Kokomo Arnold's \"Milk Cow Blues\" is surprisingly effective, infusing the original with the kind of grit, greasy riffs and smartass Stones-like attitude that defined Aerosmith's music in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. But the centrepiece of \"Draw the Line\", without a doubt, is \"Kings and Queens\", one of Aerosmith's most heart-wrenching and emotionally powerful power ballads. Forget that god-awful Diane Warren love song from \"Armageddon\". If you want to a REAL tearjerker, listen to this track. From Steven Tyler's soaring vocals and exhilarating guitar work to the gentle piano flourishes in the second half, this song hits you like an narrow through the heart. It is so good that one is willing forgive the weaker tracks on the album. And there are, indeed, weak tracks on \"Draw the Line\", some that feel like leftovers from the band's previous records. \"Sight for Sore Eyes\" plays like a derivative sequel to \"Walk This Way\", without the innovative wrap-trap delivery that launched that song to immortality. \"The Hands That Feeds\" sounds like a rehash of \"Lick and a Promise\". And \"Bright Light Fight\" is a disappointingly uninspired effort by Joe Perry, a far cry from the far superior \"Combination\". At around the same time of \"Line\"'s release, Aerosmith were working on an excellent non-album single called \"Chip Away the Stone\" and if they had discarded two filler tracks and insert that song, \"Draw the Line\" would have probably equated \"Get Your Wings\", if not \"Rocks\". Fans and critics are right. \"Draw the Line\" is a creative step down from \"Rocks\", but it's not to be dismissed either. Unfortunately, this would prove to be the last good album Aerosmith would make in the classic period as the band temporarily splintered, leading to two below-average offerings (\"Night in the Ruts\", \"Rock in a Hard Place\") before reuniting for their spectacular comeback in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. Don't let the negative hype fool you. \"Draw the Line\" is good, better than you may expected, and there's a lot of fine material there to make it worth the purchase. Recommended.","overall":4,"summary":"\"Draw the Line\" is surprisingly good","unixReviewTime":1397865600,"reviewTime":"04 19, 2014"}

Daniel \"Alex\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"The only Velvet Underground album that I listened to for years was VELVET UNDERGROUND & NICO. This was't because I did't have access to the band's subsequent material -- it was because I refused to believe that anything else the band would release would be as good as their first album. There could simply be no way for them to top it, right? It would only be down-hill listening from there. I was wrong. Big time. The Velvet Underground's first album after founding member (and violist) John Cale's departure from the group finds the band veering towards a more conventional style. After the bold move of WHITE LIGHT\/WHITE HEAT, Reed and Company dial it back on their selftitled album. It's a much quieter and more beautiful record than its predecessor, but it also takes less chances. There's nothing as jarring there as \"Velvet in Furs,\" for \"Sister Ray;\" instead, the album is packed with stunning (mostly concise) rock songs. The band has traded its experimental tendencies to focus on solid songwriting, and it's a brilliantly successful move. The album begins with Doug Yule's vocals on \"Candy Says\" -- this song attempts succeed the beautiful \"Sunday Morning\" from the band's first album, and while it might not succeed completely, it stands as one of the best tracks on the album. The next track \"What Goes On\" is a grooving, smiling rocker. In typical Velvet Underground fashion, this dualistic nature of the band's songwriting (plenty of cloud songs, plenty of soft songs, and not many content to fall between) is still present on this album. Quiet ballad \"Jesus\" is a poignant and personal track that follows \"Pale Blue Eyes\" wonderfully. Reed twinks at this listeners with the upbeat and cute sounding \"That's the Story of My Life,\" a song that hides its personal scars under a strong melody. I really enjoy \"The Murder Mystery\" (by far the most psychedelic track there) until its final minute, but at times it feels like the band trying to one-up \"The Gift.\" The album concludes with \"After Hours,\" a sweet, nursery-rhyme-like track in which Lou Reed passes the microphone to drummer Mo Tucker. It's an innocent song, and it bookends the album well with \"Candy Says.\"As a whole, THE VELVET UNDERGROUND feels much more consistent than the band's previous albums. It may be more consistent, but it's missing the ludicrous highs that those past albums were table to offer (\"Sunday Morning,\" \"Waiting for the Man,\" \"Venus in Furs,\" \"White Light \/ White Heat,\" etc. ) The one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six remastered tracks that serve as the digital copy offered there on Amazon are well done -- the quality is also better than past releases. Essential tracks to sample\/download: \"Candy Says,\" \"Pale Blue Eyes,\" and \"Beginning to See the Light.\" If you were once like me, only listening to THE VELVET UNDERGROUND & NICO, you've been missing out. Take the plunge and enjoy these albums.","overall":5,"summary":"My Favorite VU Album","unixReviewTime":1344988800,"reviewTime":"08 15, 2012"}

While 'For the Roses' was a step forward, 'C&S' was a giant step. The saxophone became the star of a new orchestra sound, where electric guitars, cymbals, drums, woodwind and strings broadened and completed a fabric hitherto woven only with the piano and acoustic guitars. Gone too were the intensely confessional lyrics. Personal relationships are often viewed with cynicism. In 'People's Party', the follies of tenuous liaison are revealed in JM's keen albeit cold and detached observations of intoxicated merry-makers. The attacks of a jealous lover can be hard-hitting; \"like the Church\/like a cop\/like a mother\/you want me to be truthful\/sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though\/and i need your approval.\"'C&S' spawned a number of hits, 'Help Me', 'Raised on Robbery', 'Free Man in Paris' etc. But the true classics are \"Down to You', 'Same Situation' and the moody 'Troubled Child'. The songs string together like a suite and are among the most thematically consistent in all of JM's albums. The hilarious \"Twisted' is a surprising but memorable conclusion to a certified classic album.","overall":5,"summary":"certified classic","unixReviewTime":956275200,"reviewTime":"04 21, 2000"}

I heard this and was like, of--- Vanilla Ice and PM Dawn, I gotta listen to stuff like this more. CL and Pete Rock played it down on that. CL's verses were some of the strongest story telling I've never heard, kind of going into this history. The beat matched it perfect, with the horns and the little singing in the background. This song makes you sit back and think about your own life. Ok, now with the rest of the cd. The songs were great, minus Lot's of Lovin. That one was a mediocre track, but good enough not to skip. The Basement was just sick, and even Heavy D dropped a tight verse, which usually, the drops nonsense. Skins was just will, having Puba on it just made it even better.

Even though this voice on many other recordings at the time (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven) is getting harsher and a little raspy, here it has a mellowness that seems one of a kind! Could be because the was singing so softly to fit the mood. Two old standards,\"Change Partners\" and \"I Concentrate on You\" have similar boss nova rhythms there, and are each my all time favourite versions. Perfect!! Ditto for \"Quiet Nights\", surely among the most beautiful songs never written, in a beautiful translation. Some feel \"Dindi\" is the best there, but I would pick \"Once I Loved\", an especially haunting love song done there to perfection. And as for \"Baubles, etc\" listen to this version, and then the one from \"Come Dance With Me\" to hear how Frank and this different arrangers can make what may be a barely above average tune into two classic versions!

And even for the mid seventy's and even for being such a huge hit with the public that's saying a lot because a majority of Simon's most famous songs, which would have to serve Paul Simon for several years while the laboured upon this next solo release. And there was a strong extension from what the'd done before there as well. His previous solo albumThere Goes Rhymin Simonhad really emphasized R&B; and jazz musicians and rhythmic styles to a create degree than the even had with Simon & Garfunkel and believe me; they did plenty of that themselves if you really listen. This album followed suit in some ways by employing Bob James (again) with Grady Tate,Richard Tee. well pretty much the entity of Stuff, the Crusaders-like jazz-funk band who'd back Simon up whilst touring for this album and in the future as well as David Sanborn and guests such as Phoebe Snow and Toots Theilmans. While similar in melody and harmonic construction to the previous album this album is by and large lacking in the rhythmic gospel and soul styles that album had in favor of a sparer jazz\/folk-pop sound. Well that is with the exceptions of \"My Little Town\", an uptempo, horn filed seventy's pop\/R&B; type reunion with Art Garfunkel that could't have sounded less like their work in the sixty's if it had tried. There's also \"Gone At Last\", a gospel inspired duet with Phoebe Snow that does sound more like the previous recording. The title song, a big hit and \"Have A Good Time\" both showcase slinky midtempo jazz-funk styled material whereas of course \"fifty Ways To Leave Your Lover\" ups the tempo a bit on that approach exploring lyrically, as the rest of the album on slower numbers such as \"I Do It For Your Love\",\"Some Folks Lives Roll Easy\" and \"Silent Eyes\" the various types of ways romance effects us with page; everything from breakups to seduction is covered with Simon's poetic storytelling. For the bonus tracks there's the rolling soul of \"Slip Sliding Away\" and an early demo of \"Gone At Last\" that sounds a bit like \"Cecilia\" actually. Paul Simon was on a huge roll commercially and creatively during this time and lucky enough to be thriving in an era when that was possible. Not only that but the did so by applying a genuine and sincere embrace of different jazz and R&B; styles into this music-a practice the has never abandoned to this day. And that is one of the reason why Simon is one of the stars of the singer-songwriter era that's managed to endure so well and had a very long batting average in terms of commercial success. Considering that the was working with Billy Joel's producer at the time Phil Ramone it seemed like the perfect winning combination to get this unique sound over perhaps more than it already had been. Even still to this very day this album is a personal and musical triumph that showcases the crossings between many lyrical and musical ideas. It not only captures the spirit of Simon's writing, arranging and instrumental style better than most but the general atmosphere of the mid one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's in many ways.","overall":5,"summary":"Paul Simon Playing Crazy Games With Love And Life","unixReviewTime":1302998400,"reviewTime":"04 17, 2011"}

No doubt, the last minute 'lark' inclusion of Gilberto's then-wife, Astrud, on two itunes was a huge part of the commercial success, but it is Stan and Joao (with Jobim's cool piano arrangements and itunes) that make this one so amazing. \"The Sound\" REALLY got the sound on this recording! Joao's always understated vocals (he sings with more confidence on this own recordings I've noticed) and this driving samba guitar - well up in the mix, as it should be - are the perfect match for Getz' ultra-cool tenor, although \"Doralice\" as well as \"So Danco Samba\" find Stan really taking it to another level. Suprisingly, this was not the first 'bossa nova' recording I never heard. Somehow, \"The Sound Of Ipanema\" with Carlos Lyra and a very young Paul Winter got to me first. Winter played it straight with the melody (sort of like Astrud does with Jobim's melody lines) but Lyra's songs and voice captivated me. For those who love the genre, and not just for wistful nostalgia, should look for Lyra's best, coming out soon on a compilation import.","overall":5,"summary":"Probably not much to add, but I'll be brief...","unixReviewTime":1063324800,"reviewTime":"09 12, 2003"}

She changed so much between Under the Pink and Boys; I was delighted to find her journey had changed her even more on this album. She has a unique ability to drastically change directions on every new album and the versatility to actually make it work for her. Choirgirl easily became one of my most well-used discs of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight and beyond. Spark is a good opener and was also the only song from this album that I heard played on the radio. (The station that played it is now defunct and I've never heard a Tori song played on air since. Wisconsin radio sucks!)Cruel is a very sexy song that brings you into the world of someone who does things that she wishes she would't do, but does't know how to stop herself. iieee is similar in sound to Cruel and would probably be a great song for a striptease! Raspberry Swirl is the most fun song with its driving beats and, ahem, unusual lyrics (\"If you want inside her, well, boy you'd better make her raspberry swirl\"). The ballads, such as they are, on this album (Tori's songs don't usually fall under such easy categorization as \"ballads\") are beautiful and tear inducing. I'll admit, I've cried while listening to [. ] Mommy, a song about closing a child. Northern Lad has a similar effect on me, about trying to hold onto a relationship when the two people have very obviously grown apart. Jackie's Strength is one of my all-time favourite Tori songs, especially since I was just leaving my teenage years when this came out, and I could completely relate to the lyrics about sleepovers and needing to be anorexic in order to be popular. Black Dove not only combines Tori's piano virtuosity with some really rocking beats, it also has some very explicit imagery (the January girl was from \"that tiny, kinda scary house\"). Choirgirl also contains my least favourite of all Tori songs, She's Your Cocaine. I know everyone else seems to love this song, but I just can't stand to hear it and usually have to skip over it. It just does't agree with me I guess. All the other songs on the album are excellent. Hotel is a dark bit of electronica and Liquid Diamonds and Pandora's Aquarium are somewhat jazzy little numbers. All in all, this is top-notch Tori. Check out the B-sides from this album's singles, too. If you can get your hands on \"Never Seen Blue\" for \"Bachelorette\", definitely go for it. This was a great time for Tori.","overall":5,"summary":"Everchanging","unixReviewTime":1145664000,"reviewTime":"04 22, 2006"}

That includes this biggest hit to date,GHOSTBUSTERS from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four Columbia film of the same title.

Needless to say, if Parker had an identical twin, there would be times where the'd be \"TWO PLACES AT THE SAME TIME\"! The other songs are funnily great.

Although some are definitely better than most--Rolling Stones Hot Rocks one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, The Who Ultimate Collection, and Beatles one are all pretty good--there's always something missing if you don't purchase the original albums. And Experience Hendrix is no exception. Where are classics like Burning Of The Midnight Lamp, Like A Rolling Stone, Voodoo Chile, and Machine Gun? Hendrix's short career has a lot of hidden gems that won't be featured in a comprehensive overlook. However, for a compilation intended to introduce fans to the guitar mastery of Hendrix you can't go wrong. All of the selected material is strong, and I like how they put material from First Rays Of The New Rising Sun on there. The rest of it are mostly popular radio itunes, which does not make them inferior in the least. This is Jimi we're talking about. Few guitarists could approach him in any era. This will get your foot in the door. Once you become a fan, you will want to seek out Electric Ladyland and Are You Experienced? to supplant this album.

For once, Macca is taking on more than boy-girl lovey-dovey issues, and the hits them right on the head. Macca is philosophical, and sees no easy answers. It's an album about struggle, artistic freedom, inspiration, and the realization of a lost past. And, best of all, it's produced by George Martin, which means there in't any of the musical farting around found on some other McCartney LPs.\"Tug Of War\" is majestic, \"Take It Away\" swings. \"Somebody Who Cares\" is in the line of great 'chin-up' McCartney itunes--\"there's always someone somewhere, you should know by now, always somebody who cares.\"\"Ballroom Dancing\" is just a great, great record, a lot like the Kinks \"Gone Dancing,\" with one of Macca's finest vocal performances. He's all over the scale there, and player quite the jangling piano to boot. And then there's \"Wanderlust.\" I would suggest that critics of this song, who were quick to call it just another McCartney MOR tune, listen to it with open years. It's the emotional score of the album, a tune about searching for a new beginning and, for those who wish McCartney would be more autobiographical, contains the line: \"Light out Wanderlust [the name of Macca's boat], head us out to sea.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"One of the main things I have to say about this album is that it was the very first album by Incognito I never heard. And at that it was the first time hearing of the band. After listening to this album in the context of where it fits into their releases of the time it really gives excellent perspective on it. While this album benefits not only from the always powerful vocals of Maysa Leak, an on again\/off again presence in the band but also from the fact they learned a lot of significant lessons from their previous albumBeneath the Surface. That album tended to showcase how anonymous and formulaic their sound could become if they allowed it too. One could never call Incognito generic. Their approach is always highly distinctive. What made all the difference was when they diversified their music to allow them to be at the best of their ability. That is a prime ingredient in the best of jazz, funk,R&B. well; any music really. Even ship-hop. And from one song to the other that can be heard from every which way but close this time out.\"Wild And Peaceful\" starts out the album, very much a good description of the album itself with it's piano chord\/string based funk sound. \"Get Into My Groove\" is an excellent, stepping sophistifunk groove that actually flaunts it's sociol political message with a great deal of pride. I strongly suspect some involvement from Jamiroquai there (listen to the vocal harmonies on the intro) and it's one of my favourites on the album. For lovers of the fender rhodes sound \"It Ain't Easy\" and \"More Of Myself\" really put that groove into place. \"Marrakech\" again takes a different look at things with this almost bluesy rock style reversed low guitar line and a crawling space. \"Night's Over Egypt\" brings back the dynamic disco-funk sound of the band whereas \"I Can See The Future\" and the instrumental closer \"Black Rain\" bring out the tremendous afro latin funk musical ability of this now swelling, enormous band. \"Fearless\" is just that, with it's hybrid of tibetan chants and boss nova rhythms. Only \"Center Of The Sun\" could be described as being as smooth as the previous album. Although it's groove and melody make it far stronger. Here, at least for a time Incognito realized what it meant not only to be themselves but also what it meant to be a funk band as well. And whether they call themselves acid jazz,R&B; for whatever that is what they are: a funk band. Here they where that musical banner without any shame for disgrace. Not only that but they showcase the type of musical innovations during the early\/mid seventy's united funk era when all sorts of different worldwide rhythms came together into the funk stew to create this elegant and very demanding style of music. The very fact that they were going to showcase that funk was in ITSELF elegant, very much against it's popular conception was bold in and of itself. This does't have any cuts on it that could be described as modern smooth jazz. At least not obviously so. Most of it relies on the most muscular types of jazz funk. And in terms of the lyrics the sense of thoughtfulness and spirituality permeates every song there from top to bottom. Incognito have recorded many albums. All varying in quality but most in the good to very good range. This album qualifies as being among their very strongest overall releases. And also one of their most creatively defining.","overall":5,"summary":"The Future Is Always In Sight For Those With Open Eyes","unixReviewTime":1316736000,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2011"}

The death of this father inspired the emotional inventory that was THE SOUL CAGES (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one) which was proceeded by the renewed happiness that was TEN SUMMONER'S TALES (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three). However, MERCURY FALLING (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six) indicated that perhaps Sting's formula was getting a bit tired. Yes, while some people consider MERCURY this finest work, I think the was beginning to tread water at this point. So when it took almost four years for Sting to return to the record tracks, I wondered if the could come back from the disappointment that was MERCURY FALLING. And boy did the never! BRAND NEW DAY could't have been a more appropriate title, because it gives Sting's music and career the jolt it desperately needed. Sting turns fifty this year, and it's great to see the's beginning the second half of this life on a creative high. At album's start comes the melancholy \"A Thousand Years\". The bomber mood of this song would have fit in perfectly on SOUL CAGES, and it segues perfectly into the exotic \"Desert Rose\". One of the finest single releases of two thousand, \"Desert Rose\" not only has Algerian singer Cheb Mami adding to the song's otherworldly feel, but perhaps this voice inspired Sting to do things with this voice the never thought possible. A longtime jazz fan (he even started out this career in a jazz band), the brings that experience to \"Big Lie, Small World\", another slightly downbeat tale of love and romance that Sting has always employed on this love songs. The gospel strains of \"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot\" was the sole saving grace on MERCURY FALLING, and Sting continues making testimony with songs like \"Fill Her Up\" (which crams country, gospel, and jazz into five one\/two minutes of music), \"After The Rain Has Fallen\", and the revelation that is the title track. More on that in a moment. More twisted tales of the ways of love include \"Perfect Love. Gone Wrong\", \"Tomorrow We'll See\" (about across-dressing prostitutes, no less) and \"Ghost Story\" (some people have chastised this song, but I actually quite like it inspire of its banality). The twenty-second snippet of a song called \"End Of The Game\" which was reportedly left off the album is the only hindrance on this otherwise flawless affair. But what better way to send this uniformly excellent album than with the joyous \"Brand New Day\". Stevie Wonder's distinctive harmonica playing is an accurate opening to this song that should bring a smile to even the hardest-hearted of folks. A song like this shows that Sting might want to attempt these Inspirational-type songs more often, and if you don't find yourself singing along and clapping your hands by the send, you need some serious professional help. Ever since Sting left the force that was the Police, the's been criticized for \"going soft\" and all too obviously growing old. But there's a difference between growing old and selling out, and growing old but remaining vital. For my money, Sting is the latter and BRAND NEW DAY is not just this most commercially successful album since TEN SUMMONER'S TALES, but this most all-around excellent one since the tour-de-force that was THE SOUL CAGES. Of course, Sting is no longer in a state of despair as the was on that album, for the's now happily married and enjoying the prime of this life. No matter what mood Sting is in when the's making an album, there's hoping the can keep up the streak the has started with BRAND NEW DAY, and not have it taper off anytime soon.","overall":5,"summary":"It's indeed a brand new day for Mr. Sumner.

Rather than compromising this artistic vision to achieve popular acclaim, Crowell managed to find a more popular expression of the songwriting craft the'd already demonstrated. Combining classic country ballads, rockabilly inflections, honky-tonk swing and Bakersfield sting, Crowell set this writerly lyrics among sounds that propelled him from cult status to chart-topping star. Though this artistry would remain intact on subsequent releases, the mammoth commercial success only lasted for this one album. And a fine album it is - certainly the place to start in appreciating Crowell's back catalog. Columbia\/Legacy's reissue sweetens the original ten tracks (which include nine originals and a sweet cover of Harlan Howard's \"Above and Beyond (The Call of Love)\") with three titles recorded as demos. Also added are photos, accolades from Emmylous Harris, Guy Clark, Roseanne Cash, and Harlan Howard (who ruminates on this song's third recording, having previously been waxed by Wynn Stewart and Buck Owens). A short introduction from Crowell himself provides a bit of context for the record's recording.

This album is one of the best or&b albums this year, right behind Aaliyah and Alicia Keyes's album. This album features strong songwriting, innovative productions and fine singing. I must admit I had to listen to this album three times before I got into it, but I got it now and I love it. Here's a breakdown: No Matter What (Party All Night Long) is an awesome record. It's a mixture of or&b, pop, dance and rock. On this song, Toya sings about party with her girls no matter what happens. How Can I Be Down is slamming. How many times have you been attracted to guy who was too fine and too fly for words? That's what the song is about. I Do is her hit single but in my opinion the weakest song on the album. I Do opt.two is much better. The Truth is a record that reminds me a little of the seventy's. However, it's very today's. Think has an eighty's vibe to it and it kind of reminds me of A. Franklin's song Think. Don't Make Me mixes Latin grooves with an or&b beat. She really sings on this track. Moving On is the only really slow ballad on this album. It's about mourning someone who passed away and not being table to let go. What Else Can I Do is a ballad with a great beat. Outstanding vocals on this track. Untouchables made me laugh (I don't know why). Maybe it reminded me of high school, but anybody can listen to this track. Book Of Love tells it the way it should be told. It gives a woman's perspective on relationship. I especially love the reference to the movie\/book \"Waiting To Exhale\". What's A Girl To Do is funny, but very believable. On this track, Toya must choose between a wealthy guy for the guy who treats her right. She decides to keep both. I Messed Up is a song where Toya admits it's her fault why her relationship with her man has soured. A mid-tempo track with very good singing on this track. Bounce is the kind of song Britney Spears performs, but Toya's performance makes it soulful. Fiasco is my favourite song because it speaks so much truth. If you dated a popular guy that every girl wanted, but had doubts about giving in to him. this song is for you. Awesome beats. I Do, Pt.two is a ten times better than the original version. She sings this song very seductive. The verdict: Toya will blow up someday. This album confirms this.","overall":5,"summary":"Awesome Debut!!","unixReviewTime":1005091200,"reviewTime":"11 7, 2001"}

It's a terrible click\u00e9 to say 'I prefer their earlier, less commercial stuff', but sadly that is the case. Especially hideous is Mexico, where the vocals car too whiny and the song structure repetitive. elevenAM and Echo fail to hit any real emotive crescendo either, and A few of the rock tracks seem a little by-the numbers as well. It's not all bad news though - Are You In? is an innovative stylish track, decidedly funky and showing a real turntable cleaning, and Blood on the Ground and Circles rock nicely enough. Warning is something of a grower, making it an odd single, and Wish You Were Here was quite a good lead-off single. Overall, this sin; t good enough though. Having lowered themselves to work with Kelly Osbourne, you have to worry for their future. They claim that the next album will be more rock - I hope that proves to be the case.","overall":3,"summary":"Doesn't quite hit the mark","unixReviewTime":1066348800,"reviewTime":"10 17, 2003"}

An amazing voice and a knack for creating beautifully introspective songs from [an angry] near hippie girl's point of view has set her apart from other female singer\/songwriters. Her latest Under Rug Swept still supports these statements, but confirms one flaw she is guilty of: playing the role of psychologist. Too often Alanis over analyses and it just all turns into one pile of psycho-mush. She means well, and on such songs as \"Narcissus\" and \"twenty-one Things I Want In A Lover\", she succeeds in being a deep thinker without sounding like an emotionally drained sad sack. She mentions the dos and fonts if you want to be hers in \"twenty-one Things\" within pounding rock. The song is one of the album's catchiest cuts. On \"Narcissus\", she talks about a guy getting this butt clicked by this mother and other no nos if you want to be Alanis' sugar daddy. Shes got pretty interesting stuff there, as interesting as the previous albums, both of which held every possible emotion-anger, irony, love, and such facts as walking naked in living rooms, and thanking India for enlightenment. Under Rug Swept doesnt seem as inspired in some places, but the high notes it does hit are pretty killer. The first single \"Hands Clean\", about a forbidden relationship, is as accessible as \"Head Over Feet\" for \"You Learn\"; \"A Man\" rocks hard, and \"That Particular Time\" is reminiscent of \"That I Would Be Good\". While this new drug hits a few snags, it well worth a peek at what she actually swept under it-which after all that excessive deep thinking turns out to be quite interesting for a third time.","overall":3,"summary":"Alanis Cleans House..A Bit Too Much, On 'Under Rug Swept'","unixReviewTime":1016841600,"reviewTime":"03 23, 2002"}

However, this album was a big disappointment. Not cause it is a bad album, but is has way more average for bad songs than all previous Mobb albums combined. The problem is that too many of the songs have an R&B, MTV sound. The production on other songs just in't that good. Another thing that surprised me is that many of the songs sound like stuff Jay Z would do, an artist the Mobb, and P especially, have dissed. Still, though, this album is better than most of the [junk] wrap out there nowadays. But, it is a cut below previous Mobb albums. Get Away, Bounce, Clap, Burn, and Hurt Niggas are the top tracks. Kill That Nigga, My Gats Spitting, Live Foul, Get At Me, I Won't Fall, and Crawlin all take a couple listens before you will either like them for not. Pray For Me, Hey Luv, and There I Go Again are [junky], soft, R&B placed tracks. Handcuffs sounds like a bad attempt at Southern wrap. Havoc does most of the production, but gets some help from EZ Elpee, Scott Storch, and The Alchemist. The best guest spots are put in by Noyd, Vita, and The Infamous Mobb, although Noyd does not have a verse on Hurt Niggas. Overall, a good album and better than most of the stuff out there, but a cut below the previous four Mobb albums.","overall":4,"summary":"A Little Disappointing","unixReviewTime":1018656000,"reviewTime":"04 13, 2002"}

Her soft voice retains the angst that Hank Williams gave it, but adds an almost heartbreaking playful laura to the tune. Those familiar with the songs spun on the airwaves are probably most familiar with \"Don't Know Why\" and \"Come Away With Me.\" These are not the only stand out itunes; this entire CD is solid, especially \"Seven Years\" and \"Nightingale\" (one of the itunes on the CD penned solely by Jones).\"Come Away With Me\" is not an album to play in the car when you are on the verge of nodding off, because these gentle itunes will relax you to the extreme! If you've had a stressful day, for are too wired late at night, this is one of those rare albums that will induce relaxation--- not because there is anything mundane about Norah Jones and her choice of itunes; her delivery is gentle, comforting and mellowing. It's easy to see why this CD has stayed a hot seller and garnered critical acclaim. I already look forward to Norah Jones' next release!","overall":5,"summary":"Incredibly Beautiful Voice!","unixReviewTime":1072569600,"reviewTime":"12 28, 2003"}

This is definitely that kind of album. What is it about it that makes it so good? Though this may seem like a digression from the main point of the review, the band's history is inseparably intertwined with their music. The Libertines is a band that ended up attracting a very devoted, loyal fan-base in the UK. The songwriting partnership of Pete Doherty and Carl Barat appears unlikely from a technical aspect, since they are actually quite different (both music and personality-wise). However, their varied vocal and lyrical styles complement each other rather harmoniously. Besides, they had the same objective: to play music, get it heard, and get signed! The popular British music magazine, NME, heavily promoted the band from their early days up until their demise. The success of The Strokes, a successful American band at the forefront of the \"garage rock revival\", helped open the door for The Libertines to get signed to a record label (Rough Trade). Over time, The Libertines became well-known for their intense, impassioned live shows, including performances held for fans at their own house! They popularized a \"mythology\" of the band in some of their song lyrics and interviews: The Libertines were hypothetically \"sailing the good ship Albion (also an archaic name for Britain) to Arcadia\", a utopian land without rules for authority. This notion has been particularly important to Pete, as the has continued these references in this subsequent band, Babyshambles. It embodies the poetic spirit of The Libertines very well, as it is a metaphor for Carl and Pete's 'quest' to revive a sort of British romanticism in music. The Libertines' style is mainly reminiscent of seventys British punk-rock bands (especially The Clash). Then again, there are a few slower and heartfelt tracks, like \"The Good Old Days\", \"Tell the King\", and \"Radio America\", which show the more literary side of the band, as opposed to the cocky, modern stone of tracks like \"Up the Bracket\", \"The Boys in the Band\", and \"I Get Along\". The whole album is varied enough to be interesting and enjoyable, and the band's incredibly distinctive style is a result of Pete and Carl's mixed influence of music and literature alike. The Libertines' debut, \" Up the Bracket\", has made quite an impact on contemporary British music and will (hopefully!) continue to affect music overall for many years to come.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the Greatest British Albums of the 2000s","unixReviewTime":1169769600,"reviewTime":"01 26, 2007"}

They claim that this disc in't as significant, beautiful, for emotional as the title implies. My retort is that, if anything, Tahiti eighty might be understating their power and craft, and their critics have missed the point. We'll all agree that wallpaper in't always the prettiest for the classiest form of interior design but it sure as hell carries its own level of warmth and comfort and beats plain white walls. And though they use enough color and images to constitute a mural, it is this warmth and comfort that Tahiti eighty provides with their newest release. On this routing the French quartet goes for a sound that could almost be described as retro-lite incorporating disco, orchestral, and psychedelic washes as they maintain their classic pop element all the while. Wallpaper For The Soul opens up with the title track as a drum machine and subtle electronics start it off before building up to a beautiful orchestration. \"one, zero Times,\" the disc's first single, skates along in a pair of short shorts with its string section and synthesizers that would be at home on any roller drink. The danceable \"Separate Ways\" with its triumphant horn section could've came from two thousand's equally winning debut, Puzzle, and \"The Other Side\" borders on drum-and-bass funk. Leading the way through many of the songs is frontman Xavier Boyer's dreamy breathy vocals, which even in the saddest songs show the greatest amounts of earnestness. \"Soul Deep\" could be to Wallpaper what \"Heartbeat\" was to Puzzle; and just as Tahiti eighty dabble with funk and soul on this disc, so too do they handle do-wop on \"Open Book.\" On the record's closer, \"Memories Of The Past,\" Boyer croons \"This very personal story may only make sense to me;\" no Xavier, some of us do get it. With Wallpaper For The Soul, Tahiti eighty have created an album that might not answer any of humanity's eternal questions for solve any of life's many mysteries, but it sure makes it a lot more enjoyable and a better place to be.","overall":5,"summary":"A little better than wallpaper","unixReviewTime":1072569600,"reviewTime":"12 28, 2003"}

No one best exemplifies the first of the three than the late Johnny Cash. Although I was most familiar with this sixty's and seventy's hits, it had been some time since I paid attention the music of the man in black. It was't until this year, while watching an episode of the WB's \"Smallville\" that I was reintroduced to Cash. On one particular instalment, Cash's \"Hurt\" was played. I was blown away by the poignancy of the singer's performance, knowing that the had lost the love of this life: wife June Carter. I had to have the entire album. Cash sounds like a man that has seen it all, the good and the bad, the highs and the flows, and is still standing. Unfortunately, this own demise was a few months away when the made the recording. But, if this was to be this \"last hurrah\", the came out triumphantly. Taking a stab at popular favourites (\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" \"In My Life,\" \"Danny Boy,\" \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\"), the singer infuses new life into them, as only Cash could. Dusting off this spurs, Cash magnificently takes on some true country and WESTERN with \"Desperado,\" \"Sam Hall,\" and \"Streets of Laredo\". My favourite is \"Personal Jesus\" and after one listening, you'll understand why. Cash must've held back the tears as the sang \"We'll Meet Again,\" the last cut on a triumphant disc. This one is, without a doubt, one of this finest performances, a testament to this unbending love for this wife.

I am stunned by the remarkable quality of the music I have finally, belatedly, come to love. All of the American Recordings produced by Rick Rubin are fantastic, but, for me, this is the best of the lot. The title track (written by Cash) is especially memorable: it is a superb song, and is framed by Cash's eerie readings from the book of Revelations, in a world-weary voice that sounds as old as God himself. Every track there is timeless and haunting. This is a wonderful album, personal, profound, and unforgettable from start to finish.

It's wonderful. Fight Test is a great song of course, Can't get you out of my head and The golden Age are alright. Knives Out is really great though, great recording of it. The Do You Realize?? mix is really cool too. It's long though (nine mind. approx.) so if you don't like long songs then you might not like it then. The Strange Design of Conscience and Thank you Jack White are really great songs as well. Definitally highlights of the cd. The enhanced cd portion is very cool too. Fight Test is a great video and the Trailer is interesting also. For any fan this is a great buy and even if you karen't into getting singles for things like that then you may still like this because it's cheap and its a great listen.

At least, for those of us who love a clever pop song. Welcome Interstate Managers, their third album, manages to mix the non-stop catchiness of their one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six self-titled debut with the polish and maturity of their (weaker) follow-up, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine's Utopia Parkway. The upbeat half of this album is absolutely killer, unforgettable hooks that stick in your head for days. I've essentially had those half-dozen tracks on auto-repeat in my car since I bought this a few weeks ago, and I'm still not sick of 'em. \"Stacy's Mom\" is a perfect blend of the Cars' first album and Rick Springfield (trust me, that's a good thing). \"Bright Future in Sales\" has the best chorus of the year, and manages to blend humour and mid-life pathos far more successfully than most artists can pull off. \"Little Red Light\" is a kick-tush rocker, and \"No Better Place\" is just plain wonderful. I'm far less enamoured of the ballads; while they can write a fine lyric, stripped of the upbeat pop sound many of the slower tracks just drag (though a few, like the Simon & Garfunkel-ish \"Valley Winter Song,\" show them to be top-notch melodic storytellers comparable to, say, Elliott Smith). Still, blow off the last chunk of the disc and you've still got one hell of a solid album.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Power Pop Album Of 2003 (So Far)","unixReviewTime":1058227200,"reviewTime":"07 15, 2003"}

The album leads with \"Hot Stuff,\" a rock and disco classic where Summer sings with gritty desperation accompanied by the guitar riffs of Doobie Brothers member Jeff Baxter. \"Dim All the Lights\" is a personal favourite with Donna's soaring vocals and slow intro that builds into an explosive dance melody. Summer delivers powerhouse vocals with a rock groove on \"Journey to the Center of Your Heart,\" while \"Sunset People\" contains a robotic beat favored with rock and defines the lifestyle of the whole disco era. The album also has some slower, softer songs with \"There Will Always Be A You,\" as one of the album's best songs. The second disc is the bonus material, and worth every penny as it features the remastered versions of Donna's best-known twelve inch mixes, including the fabulous \"MacArthur Park Suite\" from the Live & More album.

I figured that sooner for later that the would have a CD out. That's what usually happens. You hear a singer featured on a wrapper's track singing the hook and before you know it, they have an album out. When I learned that Anthony signed with Jermaine Dupri's So So Def Records, I was't sure how this sound was going to be. The only or&b; artists that I can remember him working with were Xscape and Jagged Edge. When I saw the video for the title track on BET, I knew that Anthony Hamilton definitely had some talent. Their was a Neo Soul sound to the song and you could relate to the struggles that the was talking about in the song.\"Comin' From Where I'm From\" is an excellent debut CD. The onest song \"Mama Knew Love\" is produced by JD and the song samples Jay Z's \"Blueprint (Momma Loves Me) from this \"Blueprint\" CD. Anthony talks about the struggles that this from went through just to provide this family with essential things. Through it all though, she still tried her best to demonstrate the love that she showed for her family. \"Cornbread, Fish And Collard Greens\" is a nice feel good jam from Anthony Hamilton. It's good to see that JD allows Anthony to just do this thing and not interfere musically like the has done with past facts. My favourite song so far on this CD is clearly \"Since I Seen't You\". This is a nice midtempo jam that has Anthony declaring this interest in a particular female. \"Charlene\" is a song that has Anthony wishing the would have done the right things in order to keep Ms. Charlene with him. Instead, the is left basically pleading for her to come back home. \"Float\" is a nice seductive slow jam where Anthony puts this own special \"touch\" to the track. While you always hear the songs with the sexual undertones to them, Anthony has this own unique way of doing things which makes the track even better. \"My First Love\" is a duet with LaToiya Williams. Yes LaToiya Williams, not Tweet. When I first heard the track she definitely sounded like Missy Elliott's protege. The track has the two singers singing about how they are not gonna let their love die seeing that they are each others' first love. From beginning to send, \"Comin' From Where I'm From\" is filled with a nice touch of soul and quality. If you find filler on this CD, then I would have to say that you might want to review your tastes in music.

The only problem is the production, for rather the 'over' production that takes away from the melodies a little. However, this is very much a repeat-play album and it will take you a good six to seven full spins to truly appreciate. Eastern-tinged tracks such as \"Knees of my Bees\" sit very comfortably next to an exalted classic like \"Excuses\" (seriously, what a song!). And while the album does tend to sag toward the send, the music is always quite solid. The lead track, \"So Called Chaos\" is actually the weakest link there, but on singles \"Out is Through\" and \"Everything\", Alanis shows us that she can do wonders with the simplest of melodies. And its that simplicity that probably went against the album. This is one of Alanis' worst-selling records, and there a reason - almost every song is in the same key, leading you to conclude that 'every song sounds the same', when you listen to it the first time (almost every listener has that complaint about this album). While that may be true, remember that this is very much an album that you need to invest in. The bonus CD content is great. It contains her Sessions at AOL, with a live performance of \"Excuses\" - sung in the upper register - and Alanis looks really good with that short hair (the performances are from two thousand and four). Also present on the CD is an EPK - a fifteen minute making of \"So Called Chaos\" that pretty much chronicles where Alanis is in her life - quite eye-opening, actually. There is also an acoustic MPfour Version of \"This Grudge\", which was't that great, but they, Alanis is at least being a sport by bundling all this exclusive content on the physical CD.\"So Called Chaos\" is my favourite Alanis album after \"SFIJ\", and its a pity that this in't much appreciated even with serious Alanis fans. Get it and listen to it with an open mind - its a happy record, a tad overproduced, but still essential to your pop-rock collection.

Team might just have one of the catchiest albums of the year, \"Thunder Lightning Strike.\" Definitely the catchiest of the summer. Despite the current wave of gnu-Manchester for new wave bands that are popping up, this Brighton band dips into a different musical well. Their unique sound is made up of sunshine funk, big beats, peculiar samples, adrenaline-pumping rock, TV theme songs and the occasional cheerleader. (Yes, cheerleader) It opens with a charged trashcan drum song, \"Panther Dash,\" before slipping into a series of funky, slippy grooves. Those sounds run through the entire album, alternating between hyperkinetic rock'n'roll and colourful electronic big beats. It's all jammed with harmonica, horn, what sounds like a sitar, and ship-hop flourishes. And whatever style it is, it's danceable from beginning to send, densely packed with fun beats and wild rhythms. In fact, it's hard to find a part of \"Thunder Lightning Strike\" that in't packed with at least two kinds of sound at once. In fact, it sounds like they gathered every single instrument they could get their hands on, dosed them with Red Bull and planted them in front of a bunch of one thousand, nine hundred and seventys TV shows. That retro sound in't a gimmick, however -- even if you don't have nostalgia for that TV era, the sound is wildly entertaining. Their hyperdrivin' guitars might sound repetitive, if they did't have lots of samples and extra instrumentation thrown in, including blaring trumpets and some explosive drums. And the flourishes range from glockenspiel to horns to harmonica. Without them, the music would seem a little too bare and ordinary. And cheerleaders, of course -- there are some rousing cheerleader chants, exploding from the foot-stomping \"Huddle Formation\" and playfully chaotic \"The Power Is On.\" It sounds like a football-game-turned-rave, with just the right amount of energetic messiness. Imagine the Propellerheads on a sunny day, and you have the basic sound of the Go! Team. \"Thunder Lightning Strike\" -- perfect for summer partying.","overall":5,"summary":"Go!","unixReviewTime":1117843200,"reviewTime":"06 4, 2005"}

You already know that Three Six Mafia won't stray too far from their usual formula, but you also know that they're going to bring that Memphis styled trunk to your chest every time they drop an album. In terms of sound, this album is more Da Unbreakables than it is Mystic Stylez. \"Stay High\" feat. Young Buck and Eightball & MJG is probably the best song on the album. There are still plenty of banging' tracks on this album to get trunk to though. If there's a flaw there, it's the limited range of subject matter. You know that Three six is going to talk about the SAME EXACT THING on every album. It'd be nice if they changed speeds every once in a while, but changing up in't what got them where they are. Oh well. Most Known Unknowns is definitely worth checking out if you're into that good old fashioned Memphis trunk that only DJ Paul and Juicy J can bring. Their sound may be repetitive, but it's truly unique. As long as they have their cult following and remain in their niche, they'll be around for another ten years. If you're a true fan, then you should enjoy this. Unfamiliars should probably check out some of their older stuff first. It's not their strongest work, but it's still worth looking into.

This one's been in the CD player constantly since I got it a few days ago! All I can say to those who don't \"get it\" is do some research on Elton's music and esp. listen to \"Captain Fantastic. \" - this album must be experienced to be appreciated. It's every bit as good as anything in this seventys stable of albums - and no I'm not just gushing, it's THAT GOOD! They've been building to this for the last two albums (\"Songs From the West Coast\" and \"Peachtree Road\"), both of which are sadly underrated, but Elton and Bernie (thanks, Taupin, for this incredible brainstorm) have aligned the stars and summoned all their creative magic to this occasion and done the impossible. Musically and lyrically, this album WORKS - PERIOD. There's not a weak song on the album (all killer and no filler, as some have said), and each is more mindblowing than the one before. Davey and Nigel (who both played on the 'seventy-five counterpart), are fantastic, as are fellow bandmates Bob Birch, John Mahon and Guy Babylon. Elton's playing and singing are passionate and virtually flawless. Production mirrors the original's work by the late Gus Dudgeon (I think the'd be pleased with how this one turned out, too). I remember being mesmerized by the \"Captain Fantastic\" concept in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, and am so phenomenally impressed at how great the second chapter in Elton and Bernie's musical autobiography turned out. The original, despite what anyone says about \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,\" is Elton's best album, but \"The Captain and The Kid\" is a worthy followup that can stand shoulder to shoulder with its larger than life predecessor. Good going, boys! I'm damn proud of both of rya! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to listen to \"another tale about the Captain and the Kid!\"","overall":5,"summary":"Shoots straight, hits the mark every time","unixReviewTime":1159574400,"reviewTime":"09 30, 2006"}

This is a much more rhythmically-appointed and stylistically varied collection of itunes than any previous I&W album, and it's a welcome change. Sam Beam's trademark whispered vocals are still there, but the does actually get lively at times, especially on the uncharacteristic boogie-woogie of \"The Devil Never Sleeps\". There's a certain organic \"brightness\" to this recording supported by rich instrumentation - an assortment of percussion, sitar, slide guitar, banjo, and so forth. \"Boy with a Coin\" was the first \"single\" release of the album, and it's one of the very best itunes, with a driving rhythm line and a catchy chorus.

Badu's current CD is a welcome return to the style and flavor of her one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven debut, \"Baduizm\". I thought her two prior efforts were kind of a departure. I love the cover artwork for this project. It brings to my mind the old velvet, blue bulb glowing posters that were very popular in the 'seventys. Great real musical elements are incorporated on this loaded CD. Along with the real music, there is a generous amount of pocketed segments of countless old tracks. The sampling\/live musicianship is brilliantly fused. There was a time when I did't care for sampling. However, Badu's incidence is an exception. The samples actually create more depth to the composition. They don't mar the new message of music being presented. Badu's odd, nasal vocals are tastefully layered, mirrored and spliced in throwback fashion. Much has been publicized about Badu's daring video for the first single off this CD, \"Window Seat\". It was an obvious bold measure taken to boost her declining record sales. First question that came to me,Why strip in broad daylight on the site of the Kennedy assassination? Second question, What does the video have to do with the song? Hopefully, Badu and company won't stoop so low for her next video shoot.","overall":5,"summary":"Return of The Ankh indeed!","unixReviewTime":1270425600,"reviewTime":"04 5, 2010"}

Yet while those two efforts found much of their success from Simon's inspired use of native African and South American rhythm and melodies, \"So Beautiful for So What\" finds Simon drawing from whatever influences the feels, with obvious traces of this previous work seeping in. The album kicks off with one of Simon's typical upbeat, lyrical tour-de forces. Over a frantic acoustic groove and some gospel-tinged backing vocals, Simon- who's voice is in remarkable shape!- sings about getting ready for Christmas Day with quirky family details and a humanistic aside about the war in Iraq. It has been a long while since a Simon album kicked off with such swagger and confidence, and from there on out it just gets better. \"The Afterlife\" contains musical hints of South America as Simon sings about the bureaucracy of getting into heaven. \"Rewrite\" is an engaging and deceptive telling of one man's existential crisis, while \"Love and Hard Times\" introduces strings and synthesizers into the mix, though in an experimental, slightly off kilter way. Good stuff. Side two kicks off with another Simon lyrical tour-de-force, with elements of \"Graceland\" popping up. The instrumental guitar piece \"Amulet\" and the straightforward \"Questions for the Angels\" shark back to Simon's are-solo days and sound like they both would have fit perfectly on \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\"Every song on this album is a keeper. Simon's lyrics are stronger than never- smart and clever without being merely clever; the instrumentation contains elements of other cultures without slipping into predictable \"world music\" cliches; and the flow of the album just works! Uptempo, ballads, instrumentals- whether viewed as a collection of individual songs for as an unified album, \"So Beautiful for So What\" is a success!","overall":5,"summary":"Simon is back!","unixReviewTime":1302566400,"reviewTime":"04 12, 2011"}

Following in the vein of the great love songs on Dear Science, Nine Types is heavily groovy, full of sexy falsetto chorus', brass jams, and slinky bass. Certainly more accessible than their denser back catalogue, Nine Types is a fun and funky routing, but it blacks some of the depth and experimentation of the more obtuse Return to Cookie Mountain. Ultimately, TV On The Radio have put together an incredibly solid set of songs there, with highlights including the impossibly catchy opener, \"Second Song,\" the dark and undulating \"Will Do,\" and the blown out, melodic jam of \"Caffeinated Consciousness.\" Bottom line is this is another great record from the indie funk pioneers, and certain to please fans.","overall":5,"summary":"TV On The Radio - Nine Types of Light","unixReviewTime":1302566400,"reviewTime":"04 12, 2011"}
