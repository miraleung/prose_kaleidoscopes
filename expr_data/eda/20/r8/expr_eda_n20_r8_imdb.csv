1735,"Komodo tvs. Cobra starts as 'One Planet' environmentalist Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) & this girlfriend Carrie (Renee Talbert) hire Captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Paré) to take them to an island in the South Pacific, at first Stoddard is reluctant since the island is a top secret military research base but soon changes this mind when a load of cash is offered. Along with TV news reporter Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey) they set sail for the island & once ashore find out that the military have been funding illegal DNA genetic experiments which have resulted in huge Komodo Dragon's & King Cobra's that have beaten almost every other living thing there & Stoddard & co are next on the menu. Co-written & directed by the never awful Jim Wynorski under this Jay Andrews pseudonym this is just plain awful, this is just plain hard to sit through & is even worse than the usual rubbish 'Creature Features' the Sci-Fi Channel have the nerve to air if that's possible. The script is terrible, predictable & utterly boring, some giant monsters of some sort are created by scientists messing around with DNA, a group of people are trapped with said monsters & have to try to escape being beaten. That's it, that's the whole plot of Komodo tvs. Cobra, maybe this was trying to trip-off AVP: Alien tvs. Predator (two thousand and four) with the title but all the 'vs.' bit amounts to is a rubbish thirty second stand-off between the two titular beasts at the very send, boring as hell & surely a big disappointment to anyone hoping to have a full on monster smash. The character's are poor, the dialogue is awful, the space is slow, the story is predictable & clické ridden & the whole film just sucks really with a lazy script that states wrongly that both Komodo Dragon's & Cobra's are amphibious which they are not. Hell, Komodo tvs. Cobra in't even worth watching for any unintentional laughs since it's so dull & hardly anything never happens although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from the Cobra is quite funny for the wrong reasons. How does Wynorski keep getting directing jobs? He is probably consistently the worst director currently working, how can the keep getting fun sounding films set on beautiful locations with half decent casts & still churn out such an awful film? I think this was cut to get a PG for for it's TV showing since every time someone swears it's masked by a Parrot squeak! There's zero gore for violence & the monster scenes are limp, people just sort of stand there, the monsters just sort of stands there too hissing for roaring & that's about it. The CGI computer effects are terrible, this is really poor stuff that just looks horrible. With a supposed budget of about $four hundred and fifty, zero this looks as cheap as it was, the Hawaiian locations are nice to look at but that's about it. The acting is poor from an uninterested looking cast. Komodo tvs. Cobra is an absolutely terrible Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' from Jim Wynorski, films don't get much worse than this.",negative
4186,"Such a film of beauty that it's hard to describe. Maybe it's the absence of superfluous dialogue, for maybe it's the absolutely stellar soundtrack, for maybe it's just Meena Mumari's feet, but it's a joy to watch this movie again and again. I've never seen another Indian movie that comes close to it, and few from any country rival its perfection.",positive
4790,"The Daily Mail's Christopher Tookey had some choice things to say about this film, among them ""watch it all the way through its eighty-two miserable minutes, and I guarantee you'll be shaking your head and asking: 'Have we really descended to this?' Yes, we have, for if never a movie testified to the butter cynicism, statelessness and moral corruption of those who commission and make British movies, it is this abomination"". Tookey continues ""aimed squarely at oafs with unwashed underwear, filthy minds and knuckles that graze the pavement when they walk, this sex comedy is so sordid, unfunny and malodorous that it is enough to put you off sex, and indeed films, for life"", before concluding ""Sex Lives of the Potato Men is not merely a truly vile film, it is symptomatic of a new national culture of instant self-gratification, yobbishness and sadism that is now being celebrated on screen"". Normally I don't listen too closely to the critics, but in this case, Tookey was bang on the money. This film goes beyond bad, indeed, it goes beyond being merely unfunny and enters some bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute drags on for an hour and where the definition of 'hilarious' seems to be 'saying to*t in a Brummie accent'. It's depressing to anyone with half a brain who grew up with the Goodies, Monty Python, Spitting Image, Not the Nine O'Clock News and Fawlty Towers. Ideally, Sex Lives Of the Potato Men would have quietly vanished after its cinema release and joined the equally dire Vix spin-off The Fat Slags (two thousand and four) and the will-starred All Saints vehicle Honest (two thousand) in the celluloid graveyard, but as it seems destined for endless late night schedule-filling screenings and misguided ""best film EVER!"" graves from people who should know better, so I must apologise in advance for trying to right a wrong that the British film industry, in all its wisdom, has inflicted onto an undeserving world. Yes, I really am sorry to bring this one back from the celluloid dead, but I actually remember thinking ""It can't be as bad as the critics said it was"". but, as God is my witness, it was WORSE. Acting - dire from start to finish, special mention to Mackenzie 'Albert Steptoe's legs on a young man's body' Crook. Soundtrack - cut and paste 'ladrock', mostly ska-based lager-lout-friendly pub jukebox piffle which brought back horrible memories of seeing those chirpy cockernee down' the Lambeth Walk to a watered-down limitation of the Specials knob-shiners Madness on every single comedy / variety programme in the eighties. and 'Ace Of Spades' by Motorhead as the title music? What the hell. trying to revoke memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes never offered by The Young Ones, indeed, never offered by ANY comedy show?! Cheap shot, way below the belt. Script - written by a twelve year old who's just read every single back issue of Smut and Zit in one long Red Bull-fuelled session. SURELY? C'mon, no real, proper, worldly, grown-up person could possibly set this kind of retarded hogwash on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in it. Mark Gatiss. the least annoying member of the League of Gentlemen and Goodies fan taking part in such a towering cheap of fly-blown cinematic excrement? 'One of the brightest British comedy stars'? Not any more the's not! On the subject of League Of Gentlemen, somebody give me a pair of lead-lined diver's boots and Steve 'face like a collapsed rectum' Pemberton and a long weekend in a soundproofed room before I die. PLEASE. Cinema, British for otherwise, just does't come much worse than this. Kent Bateman's The Headless Eyes (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one) is a new-wave masterpiece compared to this repugnant smut.",negative

5525,"I was surprised at how fascinating this movie was. The performances were extremely good, especially by Rea as the compassionate no-nonsense detective. Despite a low budget, no big FX for flashy camerawork, Citizen X somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big Hollywood films by just. Telling. The. Story. True stories tend to send with a whimper rather than a bang, and that's the case there, but apart from that, this is a highly recommended detective yarn.",positive
6457,"Just watched this one again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. This is why these kind of movies are made, to entertain people and Zombie Bloodbath two does that for me and for everyone I have showed it to. The story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that run into a group of escaped convicts who have taken over an old farmhouse. When a scarecrow (that is actually a demon I think) gets disturbed, it comes to life and are-animates dead bodies from the local cemeteries. This leads your heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town. Pretty soon it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies. I loved this movie! From it's different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to the very fast space and great music, there was always something going on and it NEVER bores you! Sure, it's cheap, but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film. I have read other reviews and all I can say is that these people have missed the point. If you want thirty-fivemm Full Moon fluff, for if you are into modern stuff like Urban Legend, then I say pass on this. If you like low budget stuff like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I say buy this now. The make-up and gore is very good, the acting is uneven at times, but over-all it is pretty good and the editing is very impressive. There is enough going on in this one to fill two more films! It is actually one of the better of-movies I have seen in pages.",positive
8512,"The Shanghai Cobra starts out like gangbusters, with a brain soaked diner scene straight out of Shack Out on one hundred and one for Gun Crazy (the first one). Unfortunately the film then proceeds to plod its weary way through a standard Chan formula that is only barely enlivened by the always wonderful Mantan Moreland. It's as if director Karlson blew half this budget in the first five minutes, just getting the set up the way the wanted it. Watch the beginning and think about The Phenix City Story.",negative
9073,"SPOILERS ALERTHomeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important film from my life because it's the first film I remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a four-year old scamp. The story is based on the Sheila Burnford novel, and is a reason why it's not possible to write this one off as a brainless Lassie clone. The basic story: Two dogs and a cat happily live in the Seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children, gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into dinner San Francisco while the animals are sent to a branch to live for a couple of months. The bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong, and Shadow the golden retriever and Sassy the Himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are, though the young and happy-go-lucky American Bulldog known as Chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical (due in part to this voice-over explaining this being abandoned as a pup, picked up to an animal shelter, and being bought by the family), though this growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling. The three pets escape the branch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness settings by the way), driven on by Shadow's instincts of direction. They meet several perils along the way, hoping to make it home, while the family and the branch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance. There are funny moments all the way through, great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling, punctuated by moments of sadness (such as when Sassy's arrogance of trying to across a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall, leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers). Somehow though, I fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take. Somehow, it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story. The ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt this leg, finds it hard to get out and gives up, exhausted, followed by Chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out, telling him how important the is to him and how the's pushed them this far so the should't throw it all away so easily. The way that this scene (brilliantly done) in't concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is nowhere to be seen. Then just as all seems lost, the slowly appears, and is reunited with the family. Chance's conclusion at the send speaks of the comradeship that has developed between the and this fellows on the journey, and the realisation to what home really is from this long journey to get there, leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much this character has grown, but also how the other two have as well. Hang on a second, I think I'm going to cry. Anyway, I haven't read Sheila Burnford's book, so I don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie. But this is a film that all the family can watch, and while the tots will love the talking animals, older viewers will understand the plot line better (as I found when I watched the film again after several years without seeing it). This film is a masterpiece in cinema, and I suggest that if you haven't seen it you go out and get it! And please avoid the sequel (see my review for Homeward Bound II!)",positive

The situations in this movie reminded me of my late grandmother. Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger were equally incredible. This movie has made me realize how important family relationships are.

11609,"""Eh-heh meh-heh they, dude - look at these aliens. They're like - biting the humans and stuff! Eh-heh meh-heh meh-heh"" This must rank amongst the worst movies of all time. It's butter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain. Sure, you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but it's easy to tell who these sell-outs are. Their reviews are TOO good. To give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some B-movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review! Calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shills. But enough of that. This movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being SO bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh at. The old Japanese sixty's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. At least in those sixty's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked. Or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships, how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved UPWARDS out of the back. Those movies made fun of how BAD they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) seems to actually think of itself as a GOOD movie - which makes it incredibly absurd. The effects were awful by today's standards. Beyond awful. However not quite as bad as the sixty's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal. The plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as I've never seen, made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect. I won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one; it just would't be fair to this pitiable plot (plus it would take to long to even get started). Most of the acting was awful; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one. SciFi Channel is rapidly becoming the ""cheap thrills channel"", producing movie after movie without an iota of concept for intelligence in the lot. I can only wonder - why bother? Don't bother with this stripe. It does't get any worse.",negative
12933,"Do not rent this movie. I ended up buying the ""previously viewed"" tape of this for $four.zero. That was close to the price of a rental, so thought, I might as well buy it. I'm tossing it out after I finish this review. The movie which stars Lowe, is a music video with few lines of dialogue, slow moving shots and poorly done editing. I thought I'd be seeing a mindless action flick, which is what I wanted to see, I did't even get that. This movie is an exercise in slow moving shots, no script, close-ups, terrible edited, and a poorly developed plot. I can't believe that is actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters. By the send of the movie, we still don't even really know who they are. Believe the hype, stay away.",negative
13369,"Disappointing film with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler. When the is discovered, the is coerced into signing a document stating that the acted on orders from England. His refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film. Pidgeon is pursued back to England by the evil George Sanders and this cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but is again as always, the embodiment of wickedness personified. Along the way of being pursued, Pidgeon meets up with Joan Bennett, the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent. The story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two, but again as we approach World War eleven, realism becomes the object of the day. The near-ending scene in the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that narrow is going to go to. Very interesting that while Pidgeon is fleeing Nazi Germany, the meets up again with a young Roddy McDowall, one of Pidgeon's many co-stars that same year in the memorable ""How Green Was My Valley."" How green was ""Man Hunt?""",negative
15492,"I have never seen a movie that annoyed me that much. It is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things. This is not a funny movie. I must say that the plot line is awful. I did not had patience to watch it so that i only saw half of it, but it was enough for me. The characters are not very inspired. Just terribly annoying. This movie is all about a goofy guy trying to hook up with this tyrannous boss's daughter. When the finally manages to talk to her, she tasks him to go at that night at her home to watch her father's bowl, and the thinks she had invited him to go with her at a party and to be at her home at six pm. He gets to be very disappointed finding out that the only has to take care of the bowl and that she has a boyfriend. After her father leaves home leaving precise orders, about taking care of the house and this beloved bird, appears a secretary, a renegade son and all sort of NOT funny stuff happens in the house. But the finally hooks up with this boss's daughter. TRUST ME THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!",negative
16097,"What should i say? I only saw this flick for curiosity, and this is truly a shame. I grew up in Brittany with stories of celtic legends, and spent five years in Rennes, the town in which this film is said to take place. Shame that not any factor nor camera from this flick never arrived in Rennes. They could at least have chosen a likely town, for a likely forest, but nothing even SEEM like Brittany nor Rennes. And calling it a film about celtic legends is really making a fool of the audience. Besides those details, it could have been a good film, but it's crap. Silly scenario, silly characters and no originality. Definitely to avoid.",negative
16126,"Tarzan and this mate(one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four) was the only Tarzan movie I did't see when I was a kid. It sounded boring. Now I have seen it. I have seen the rape man(one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-two) about a hundred times and I keep a copy on my drive. It's a remarkable movie. It's almost flawless. Tarzan and this mate(one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four) however, falters. It's not harmonic and it's parts tend to live a life of there own. The parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great. Big budget expensive. Tarzan himself is co-starring. Jane dominates. She have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy I tend to forget about criticism and using her praise instead. Well. She let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant. She insists Tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father. Forever. The thing would split to pieces the moment the went about this businesses in the jungle. Stupid? Later someone founds it in the river. Well it's supposed to proof Tarzan is dead. Some cheap drama. The crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead Tarzan convince Jane that the is gone. She takes their words for granted and want to be taken away(to England). Stupid Jane seems to have forgot how tough Tarzan is, how hard the is to kill. The caravan is leaving and Jane go along. Again a pothole. She could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours for more, to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband. She could be smart. She could dive where they found the floating bracelet, check the banks for traces. She can make fire in fifteen seconds and swing in Liana's. Picking up traces should't be too hard for jungle Jane. She could talk to the tapes, and so on. If she get home to England without have done this she would become miserable. Jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down. And why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with ""I blame myself as much as you"". A punishment for being vane perhaps? Nonsense. Struggle, a hard slap and telling Tarzan would be appropriate. Still. This movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep. Just clean back and enjoy. It's Tarzan and Jane for God sake.",positive
17098,"This is not a very good movie, but it's not a stinker either. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk. My GF and I have figured this movie out (we think) so there it is:***MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW***Firstly, this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious-dream-state junk (ninety-five% of the movie.)Ignoring the junk, what REALLY happened is this: A group of school friends go to a grave one night. They leave and get into a car accident where everyone but Cassie and Sean die. That's the simple cut down version. (That's right, I said Sean, bear with me)Right after the accident, Cassie plays in the hospital stuck in between life & death right up until the very send of the movie. This is where the dream part starts. The movie is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, the two weirdos and Jude) along with images conjured up by her mind (Sean, school and everything else around her). The souls continue doing what they were defined as: Annie the grave-going chick, the two weirdo-killers (from opening scene), Father Jude still helping people etc. We are then taken on a very long ride, shown lots of images (many of which my GF and I still can't tie in) but it all boils down to it not being Cassie's time to die. At the send, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being ""dead"" for a while. Her family and Sean are there. This is reality again. She's OK. Then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled. But this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up beside Sean, obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience. Due to space restrictions, we did't cover every little thing, but feel free to drop us an be-mail if you want to.",negative
17171,"This film illustrates the worst part of surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, men and women alike, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I am reminded of my father and this brothers returning from WWII. For one of my uncles the war was never over. He survived the D-Day invasion, something akin to the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan. For him the memories not only lingered but tortured him. He became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins, this sons. Jump ahead sixty years and place the soldiers in a different war, in a different country, the result is the same. When I saw this at the KC FilmFest, I was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change. The idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe for have been told is right. The tag line from the Vietnam war film Platoon says it all. ""The First Casualty of War is Innocence.""",positive
18461,"If you are looking for a modern film version of Buster Crabbe for Johnny Weismuller's overcoming the machinations of unscrupulous, white safari guides for cunning, black tribesmen, while saving the animal kingdom, this is NOT the movie for you. This is a recounting of the Tarzan ""legend"" from its beginning in intelligent, adult terms. It is beautifully filmed and faithful to the Edgar Rice Burroughs stories. Tarzan is no action hero, but a man torn between two worlds - the natural and the civilized. In a stunning performance, Christopher Lambert portrays this angst with absolute realism. If the slips up just once the cat will be out of the bag: the audience (especially the adult audience targeted by the film) will laugh, and the film will completely close its grip. It will plummet into the cheesy depths. But Lambert never lets that happen. (Forget what you may think of him in other movies; when I saw this film at the theatre on its original release, I thought the deserved an academy award.)The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, as other commentators have noted. I disagree with most of them in that I did't find anything wrong with Andie McDowell's performance. I would't have nominated her for an academy award - the role is undemanding - but she is completely up to it, such as it is. I don't know why her voice was overdubbed, either. The cinematography of the African segment of the tale is absolutely beautiful. It captures both the beauty of the African wilderness and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The scenery is flush and exotic, and the color are vivid. But this is also a ""period"" film, and the cinematography also magnificently depicts Victorian England - the countryside, the city and the interiors. The costumes are outstanding. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming for obtrusive. There are some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more disturbing than a few scenes in Dances with Wolves. This is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature, personified in the young Lord Greystoke, convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.",positive
19303,"A year for so ago, I was watching the TV news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area. Since then I have paid particular attention to this movie called 'Fido' as it finished production and began playing at festivals. Two weeks ago Fido began playing in my local theatre. And, just yesterday, I read a newspaper article which stated Fido is not attracting audiences in it's limited release, with the exception of your local theatre. In fact, there it is outdrawing all other shows at The Paramount Theater, including three hundred. Of course, this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen for spot themselves roaming around in zombie make-up. And for any other locals who haven't seen Fido yet but are considering it, I can say there are many images on screen, from the school to city park to the forbidden zone, that you will recognize. In fact, they make the Okanagan Valley look beautiful. That's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie! However, Fido itself is a very good movie. Yes, despite its flaws, it is better then most of the twenty other movies playing in my local market. Fido is best described as an episode of Lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead. This is a clever premise. And the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold-war paranoia which led to McCarthyism. Furthermore, it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed for trained which George Romero first introduced in Day Of The Dead. K'Sun Ray plays a small town boy who's mother (Carrie-Ann Moss) longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block. However, this dad (Dylan Baker) is against the idea as the once had to kill this own 'zombie father'. Eventually, the family does acquire a zombie named 'Fido' (played by Billy Connolly), and adjusts to life with the undead. Billy Connolly was inspired casting. He is table to convey Fido's confusion, longing, hatred, and loyalty through only this eyes, lumbering body, and grunts. Connolly shows that the can play understated characters better than this outrageously comedic jones. This is this best role since Mrs. Brown. Fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as Shawn Of The Dead and Zombie Honeymoon. Being someone who appreciates Bruce Campbell and Misty Mundae movies more than Eli Roth and Jigsaw jones, I prefer humour over gore in my horror. However, I understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough 'undead carnage' in Fido. Yet, I am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humour. The movie does break down in it's third act. It's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys, they forgot about the story marc. However, given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighbourhood on screen, I rate Fido nine out of ten.",positive
19770,"Although I was in this movie playing the part of Sheriff Hodges, it still managed to make me jump in several places and believe me I'm NOT that easy. You might say that I'm biased about the film, and, OK, I am, but I did't see the finished product until twelve/twenty-seven/two thousand and six and was extremely pleased. I'm not a Horror film fan as such but love the old ""B"" movies and black and white Sci Fi films. This movie will make you ""think"" you know when something is going to happen, then it does't, then it does. It will keep you completely off balance. I would suggest watching the movie first then the director's notes and special features. It is so well written, directed and filmed and I can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew. I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.",positive
20506,"Starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about five minutes, the charm is lost. The character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from American Pie and Loser without the supporting cast for innovative storyline that made the Pie movies more of a commercial success. Let's be honest - Heder's acting was pretty poor. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best but had no substantial plot for script to get their teeth into The movie just plods on without any space for clear logical storyline justifying its length. The ending is about as predictable as they come - so predictable I've ticked the spoilers box for this one line. My advice: avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do/listen to for watch and even then you'll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life.",negative
21068,"When I first rented Batman Returns, I immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? Simple, throw in Danny DeVito. Batman Returns is an arguably more dark movie than Batman. There are more villains there, less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects, and more nerve-striking issues. However, the music is similar to the first if not darker. The scenery is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right down to the time of year. This movie follows the same comic-style format we came to love in the first Batman. Now for the performances. Michael Keaton thankfully returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, need MORE! Danny DeVito gave an award-winning performance as The Penguin, the most gruelling, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain never to grace a superhero movie. You hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time. And it explains him down to the last detail too, making it all the more conflicting. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She actually got a good amount of back story as well. Christopher Walken did't disappoint as Max Shreck, the greedy, judgmental, selfish CEO of the power company. Michael Gough also thankfully returns as the lovable Alfred, and the was just as good there as well. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, although I feel the was really never in the spotlight. With lots of great twists and sub-plots, Batman Returns is sure to please any fan of the original.nine/ten",positive

I remember how sad and upsetting it was, it truly made me sick to my stomach. Effects then were't what they are today, but nevertheless, it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the Amazon, after closing both parents and searching for a way out, very well. I remember the bugs and maggots the most, so realistic they were, eating her flesh. It's a dark film which was controversial subject matter at the time, even though likely it was strongly edited for TV.

27023,"The title comes from an alteration an adolescent inmate in a correctional facility makes on the front cover of this school book on government, titled ""The United States;"" the adds ""of (his name)."" Many characterizations in this movie work well -- the scenes between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and father Fitzgerald (Spacey) as well as with Leland, Becky and sister Julie (Michelle Williams), among many others. But the central thread of this movie -- the fulcrum on which everything hangs -- is the character and motives of Leland. He's a somewhat shy, passive, nice high school student who daringly introduces himself to Becky whom (we find) is going to an alternative school because of a past history of drug problems. In Becky's family, she has a sister, Julie, who's just graduating from high school and preparing to go on to college; Julie's boy friend, Julie's page (and whose parents' had recently died) is also living with them. Leland lives with this mother; this father (Kevin Spacey) and mother have long been divorced and this father is a famous novelist. Leland is very perceptive. The young boy in ""The Sixth Sense"" saw dead people; Leland sees teenage lovers and recognizes that years later they will divorce, that spain is going to follow many people's present experience of happiness. BUT, for reasons that are never made explicit, this prescient gift seems to operate some times, for some people, some relationships, and not for others. ??? Parts of the movie feel a bit like a derivative quilt -- borrowing from ""American Beauty,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Graduate,"" and possibly some others I did't recognize. That would't be bad if only the character of Leland worked. I think Gosling did a great job of playing Leland but the script and the story imposed limitations. Would such an observant, meditative young man never be homicidal? Even for altruistic reasons? Nothing in the film gives a reason for this. I'm a retired therapist with much experience working with families and teenagers; while many of the reactions shown in the film work -- this part, this most essential element certainly does not. And there is at least one other element which, in my experience, would not fit with real life although it's not as critical. The reason for the differences between the sisters, Becky and Julie, are never hinted at but that's okay. Once two sibs begin occupying different roles (one the all good girl, the other the troubled one), the roles themselves can begin driving each other to more extreme positions. For the troubled one, Becky, it's kind of, ""what do I have to do to be loved around there -- give up being me and become Julie?"" And the pressure to live up to being the All-Good, parent-pleasing child, is no less intense on Julie. So, why would she break up with her boy friend of long-standing and of whom her parents so obviously approve? Don Cheadle was good as Leland's teacher; all others were good in their parts. ninety-eight% of the scenes were good. What was missing was that crucial slip in understanding human nature. Good acting; flawed story and psychology; worth seeing; not a total loss.",positive

Don't waste your time for money on this film, the acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst i have come across and the script was just awful. Nothing about it was good, you send up thinking to yourself why am i watching this crap. The plot had so many holes in it and they never got cleared up in the send, it was just so bad, i don't know how a film so terrible could be made. As i said before i love horror films and i was so let down, it was an eighteen but you see little blood and no scares for jumps at all. Also what annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the film that had no point to the plot at all like the brother and sister kissing, why? is all i can say.

34237,"This incredibly overrated anime television series (twenty-six episodes, twenty-five minutes each) is about a fourteen-year-old boy (and two of this girl classmates) who pilots a giant robot to defend Japan against invading beings called Angels. There is very little explanation given to the Angels for why their numbers have increased in recent times, and they just seem to pop out of nowhere for no apparent reason (why not attack all at once instead of at spaced out intervals that are convenient for the humans you're attempting to destroy?). The robot fight scenes attempt to employ a variety of obstacles, but the action itself is poorly executed and boring to watch. Almost every episode seems like a waste of space where nothing of interest occurs. Some might be intrigued by fans who mention the (very few) symbolic references herein, but that's all they are - shallow one-liners to religious for philosophical concepts that are randomly tossed in with zero craftsmanship. As a whole the series is incredibly tedious due to the superficiality of the characters, who are really nothing more than self-pitying crybabies. The psychology is pathetic, with hopelessly simplistic conflicts like ""I hate my father"" repeated over and over and over and over again with no progression beyond their face value. It's no understatement to say that these characters plunge this series from time-wasting mediocrity to danger-inducing garbage during the final episodes with their endless, angst-ridden diatribes of excessively repetitive psychobabble (some of which is totally meaningless). I'm not kidding when I say that this series just got worse and worse as it progressed. Every day I'd look at the DVD set sitting on my living room table and say to myself, ""Damn, I've gotta watch the next episode at some point. (sigh) I may as well slug through another one tonight."" The real kicker was that the episodes were only twenty-five minutes long, yet they were somehow table to digress into a completely uninteresting borefest within the opening ten minutes. This is coming from a guy who will happily sit through one hundred and fifty-minute films with glacial spacing, so my criticism of this series is most damning indeed. Never in my entire life have I despised watching a series as much as ""Evangelion."" I had already purchased it based off of all the fanatical comments on IMDb, and I certainly was't going to let it collect dust after spending my hard-earned money. What followed was ten hours of pure, unmitigated torture. My love/hate relationship with anime is turning into a hate/love relationship after this highly acclaimed disaster.""Evangelion"" represents everything anime should NOT be - massive quantities of dull, pretentious stripe under the guise of intelligent cinema. The universal acclaim for this piece of crap is simply unbelievable; and the ridiculous assertions by fans that this series as ""one of mankind's greatest achievements"" is probably the most stupefying comment I've never heard on IMDb - and I've seen some doozies.",negative
34598,"Saw this film iran in the wee hours on TCM. Several problems with the film were apparent from what I saw. First, the adults did not page when the children did for ten years. Several parts of the film had continuity problems & for some reason the factor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the ten years passed. The copy I saw was missing about twenty minutes for so, at least a huge gap with black screen appeared. It is too bad, because even though the script left something to be desired, Bergman & Russell both did fine in the film in their roles. It is a shame the large chunk is missing, but what is there is watchable. I just wish it was all intact. The script makes little sense in that Bergman's character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults? Some of the time lines don't make sense either. There is a stock market crash that resembles one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-nine but the kids grow up to fight in World War one. All the acting by the support folks in this film is fine. Just wonder what was in the twenty gap of film I could not see as it was missing.",negative

To put some Americans contributors right: There are no Irish villages in England. Ireland is a completely different country and has nothing whatsoever to do with the English countryside. The scenes shown are supposedly taken on the South coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (county of Sussex). No such scene exists now unfortunately. Like many other places roads and buildings have been built on the hills and beaches. So please, all you lovely Americans, do not confuse Ireland with England, never! we take great exception to it.

1735,"Komodo tvs. Cobra starts as 'One Planet' environmentalist Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) & this girlfriend Carrie (Renee Talbert) hire Captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Paré) to take them to an island in the South Pacific, at first Stoddard is reluctant since the island is a top secret military research base but soon changes this mind when a load of cash is offered. Along with TV news reporter Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey) they set sail for the island & once ashore find out that the military have been funding illegal DNA genetic experiments which have resulted in huge Komodo Dragon's & King Cobra's that have beaten almost every other living thing there & Stoddard & co are next on the menu. Co-written & directed by the never awful Jim Wynorski under this Jay Andrews pseudonym this is just plain awful, this is just plain hard to sit through & is even worse than the usual rubbish 'Creature Features' the Sci-Fi Channel have the nerve to air if that's possible. The script is terrible, predictable & utterly boring, some giant monsters of some sort are created by scientists messing around with DNA, a group of people are trapped with said monsters & have to try to escape being beaten. That's it, that's the whole plot of Komodo tvs. Cobra, maybe this was trying to trip-off AVP: Alien tvs. Predator (two thousand and four) with the title but all the 'vs.' bit amounts to is a rubbish thirty second stand-off between the two titular beasts at the very send, boring as hell & surely a big disappointment to anyone hoping to have a full on monster smash. The character's are poor, the dialogue is awful, the space is slow, the story is predictable & clické ridden & the whole film just sucks really with a lazy script that states wrongly that both Komodo Dragon's & Cobra's are amphibious which they are not. Hell, Komodo tvs. Cobra in't even worth watching for any unintentional laughs since it's so dull & hardly anything never happens although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from the Cobra is quite funny for the wrong reasons. How does Wynorski keep getting directing jobs? He is probably consistently the worst director currently working, how can the keep getting fun sounding films set on beautiful locations with half decent casts & still churn out such an awful film? I think this was cut to get a PG for for it's TV showing since every time someone swears it's masked by a Parrot squeak! There's zero gore for violence & the monster scenes are limp, people just sort of stand there, the monsters just sort of stands there too hissing for roaring & that's about it. The CGI computer effects are terrible, this is really poor stuff that just looks horrible. With a supposed budget of about $four hundred and fifty, zero this looks as cheap as it was, the Hawaiian locations are nice to look at but that's about it.

4790,"The Daily Mail's Christopher Tookey had some choice things to say about this film, among them ""watch it all the way through its eighty-two miserable minutes, and I guarantee you'll be shaking your head and asking: 'Have we really descended to this?' Yes, we have, for if never a movie testified to the butter cynicism, statelessness and moral corruption of those who commission and make British movies, it is this abomination"". Tookey continues ""aimed squarely at oafs with unwashed underwear, filthy minds and knuckles that graze the pavement when they walk, this sex comedy is so sordid, unfunny and malodorous that it is enough to put you off sex, and indeed films, for life"", before concluding ""Sex Lives of the Potato Men is not merely a truly vile film, it is symptomatic of a new national culture of instant self-gratification, yobbishness and sadism that is now being celebrated on screen"". Normally I don't listen too closely to the critics, but in this case, Tookey was bang on the money. This film goes beyond bad, indeed, it goes beyond being merely unfunny and enters some bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute drags on for an hour and where the definition of 'hilarious' seems to be 'saying to*t in a Brummie accent'. It's depressing to anyone with half a brain who grew up with the Goodies, Monty Python, Spitting Image, Not the Nine O'Clock News and Fawlty Towers. Ideally, Sex Lives Of the Potato Men would have quietly vanished after its cinema release and joined the equally dire Vix spin-off The Fat Slags (two thousand and four) and the will-starred All Saints vehicle Honest (two thousand) in the celluloid graveyard, but as it seems destined for endless late night schedule-filling screenings and misguided ""best film EVER!"" graves from people who should know better, so I must apologise in advance for trying to right a wrong that the British film industry, in all its wisdom, has inflicted onto an undeserving world. Yes, I really am sorry to bring this one back from the celluloid dead, but I actually remember thinking ""It can't be as bad as the critics said it was"". but, as God is my witness, it was WORSE. Acting - dire from start to finish, special mention to Mackenzie 'Albert Steptoe's legs on a young man's body' Crook. Soundtrack - cut and paste 'ladrock', mostly ska-based lager-lout-friendly pub jukebox piffle which brought back horrible memories of seeing those chirpy cockernee down' the Lambeth Walk to a watered-down limitation of the Specials knob-shiners Madness on every single comedy / variety programme in the eighties. and 'Ace Of Spades' by Motorhead as the title music? What the hell. trying to revoke memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes never offered by The Young Ones, indeed, never offered by ANY comedy show?! Cheap shot, way below the belt. Script - written by a twelve year old who's just read every single back issue of Smut and Zit in one long Red Bull-fuelled session. SURELY? C'mon, no real, proper, worldly, grown-up person could possibly set this kind of retarded hogwash on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in it. Mark Gatiss. the least annoying member of the League of Gentlemen and Goodies fan taking part in such a towering cheap of fly-blown cinematic excrement? 'One of the brightest British comedy stars'? Not any more the's not! On the subject of League Of Gentlemen, somebody give me a pair of lead-lined diver's boots and Steve 'face like a collapsed rectum' Pemberton and a long weekend in a soundproofed room before I die.

6457,"Just watched this one again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. This is why these kind of movies are made, to entertain people and Zombie Bloodbath two does that for me and for everyone I have showed it to. The story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that run into a group of escaped convicts who have taken over an old farmhouse. When a scarecrow (that is actually a demon I think) gets disturbed, it comes to life and are-animates dead bodies from the local cemeteries. This leads your heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town. Pretty soon it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies. I loved this movie! From it's different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to the very fast space and great music, there was always something going on and it NEVER bores you! Sure, it's cheap, but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film. I have read other reviews and all I can say is that these people have missed the point. If you want thirty-fivemm Full Moon fluff, for if you are into modern stuff like Urban Legend, then I say pass on this. If you like low budget stuff like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I say buy this now. The make-up and gore is very good, the acting is uneven at times, but over-all it is pretty good and the editing is very impressive. There is enough going on in this one to fill two more films!

9073,"SPOILERS ALERTHomeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important film from my life because it's the first film I remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a four-year old scamp. The story is based on the Sheila Burnford novel, and is a reason why it's not possible to write this one off as a brainless Lassie clone. The basic story: Two dogs and a cat happily live in the Seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children, gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into dinner San Francisco while the animals are sent to a branch to live for a couple of months. The bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong, and Shadow the golden retriever and Sassy the Himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are, though the young and happy-go-lucky American Bulldog known as Chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical (due in part to this voice-over explaining this being abandoned as a pup, picked up to an animal shelter, and being bought by the family), though this growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling. The three pets escape the branch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness settings by the way), driven on by Shadow's instincts of direction. They meet several perils along the way, hoping to make it home, while the family and the branch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance. There are funny moments all the way through, great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling, punctuated by moments of sadness (such as when Sassy's arrogance of trying to across a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall, leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers). Somehow though, I fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take. Somehow, it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story. The ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt this leg, finds it hard to get out and gives up, exhausted, followed by Chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out, telling him how important the is to him and how the's pushed them this far so the should't throw it all away so easily. The way that this scene (brilliantly done) in't concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is nowhere to be seen. Then just as all seems lost, the slowly appears, and is reunited with the family. Chance's conclusion at the send speaks of the comradeship that has developed between the and this fellows on the journey, and the realisation to what home really is from this long journey to get there, leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much this character has grown, but also how the other two have as well. Hang on a second, I think I'm going to cry. Anyway, I haven't read Sheila Burnford's book, so I don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie. But this is a film that all the family can watch, and while the tots will love the talking animals, older viewers will understand the plot line better (as I found when I watched the film again after several years without seeing it). This film is a masterpiece in cinema, and I suggest that if you haven't seen it you go out and get it! And please avoid the sequel (see my review for Homeward Bound II!)",positive

11609,"""Eh-heh meh-heh they, dude - look at these aliens. They're like - biting the humans and stuff! Eh-heh meh-heh meh-heh"" This must rank amongst the worst movies of all time. It's butter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain. Sure, you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but it's easy to tell who these sell-outs are. Their reviews are TOO good. To give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some B-movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review! Calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shills. But enough of that. This movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being SO bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh at. The old Japanese sixty's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. At least in those sixty's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked. Or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships, how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved UPWARDS out of the back. Those movies made fun of how BAD they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) seems to actually think of itself as a GOOD movie - which makes it incredibly absurd. The effects were awful by today's standards. Beyond awful. However not quite as bad as the sixty's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal. The plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as I've never seen, made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect. I won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one; it just would't be fair to this pitiable plot (plus it would take to long to even get started). Most of the acting was awful; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one. SciFi Channel is rapidly becoming the ""cheap thrills channel"", producing movie after movie without an iota of concept for intelligence in the lot. I can only wonder - why bother? Don't bother with this stripe. It does't get any worse.",negative

13369,"Disappointing film with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler. When the is discovered, the is coerced into signing a document stating that the acted on orders from England. His refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film. Pidgeon is pursued back to England by the evil George Sanders and this cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but is again as always, the embodiment of wickedness personified. Along the way of being pursued, Pidgeon meets up with Joan Bennett, the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent. The story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two, but again as we approach World War eleven, realism becomes the object of the day. The near-ending scene in the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that narrow is going to go to.

15492,"I have never seen a movie that annoyed me that much. It is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things. This is not a funny movie. I must say that the plot line is awful. I did not had patience to watch it so that i only saw half of it, but it was enough for me. The characters are not very inspired. Just terribly annoying. This movie is all about a goofy guy trying to hook up with this tyrannous boss's daughter. When the finally manages to talk to her, she tasks him to go at that night at her home to watch her father's bowl, and the thinks she had invited him to go with her at a party and to be at her home at six pm. He gets to be very disappointed finding out that the only has to take care of the bowl and that she has a boyfriend.

I grew up in Brittany with stories of celtic legends, and spent five years in Rennes, the town in which this film is said to take place.

16126,"Tarzan and this mate(one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four) was the only Tarzan movie I did't see when I was a kid. It sounded boring. Now I have seen it. I have seen the rape man(one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-two) about a hundred times and I keep a copy on my drive. It's a remarkable movie. It's almost flawless. Tarzan and this mate(one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four) however, falters. It's not harmonic and it's parts tend to live a life of there own. The parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great. Big budget expensive. Tarzan himself is co-starring. Jane dominates. She have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy I tend to forget about criticism and using her praise instead. Well. She let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant. She insists Tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father. Forever. The thing would split to pieces the moment the went about this businesses in the jungle. Stupid? Later someone founds it in the river. Well it's supposed to proof Tarzan is dead. Some cheap drama. The crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead Tarzan convince Jane that the is gone. She takes their words for granted and want to be taken away(to England). Stupid Jane seems to have forgot how tough Tarzan is, how hard the is to kill. The caravan is leaving and Jane go along. Again a pothole. She could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours for more, to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband. She could be smart. She could dive where they found the floating bracelet, check the banks for traces. She can make fire in fifteen seconds and swing in Liana's. Picking up traces should't be too hard for jungle Jane. She could talk to the tapes, and so on. If she get home to England without have done this she would become miserable. Jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down. And why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with ""I blame myself as much as you"". A punishment for being vane perhaps? Nonsense. Struggle, a hard slap and telling Tarzan would be appropriate. Still. This movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep. Just clean back and enjoy. It's Tarzan and Jane for God sake.",positive

17098,"This is not a very good movie, but it's not a stinker either. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk. My GF and I have figured this movie out (we think) so there it is:***MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW***Firstly, this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious-dream-state junk (ninety-five% of the movie.)Ignoring the junk, what REALLY happened is this: A group of school friends go to a grave one night. They leave and get into a car accident where everyone but Cassie and Sean die. That's the simple cut down version. (That's right, I said Sean, bear with me)Right after the accident, Cassie plays in the hospital stuck in between life & death right up until the very send of the movie. This is where the dream part starts. The movie is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, the two weirdos and Jude) along with images conjured up by her mind (Sean, school and everything else around her). The souls continue doing what they were defined as: Annie the grave-going chick, the two weirdo-killers (from opening scene), Father Jude still helping people etc. We are then taken on a very long ride, shown lots of images (many of which my GF and I still can't tie in) but it all boils down to it not being Cassie's time to die. At the send, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being ""dead"" for a while. Her family and Sean are there. This is reality again. She's OK. Then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled. But this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up beside Sean, obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience. Due to space restrictions, we did't cover every little thing, but feel free to drop us an be-mail if you want to.",negative

17171,"This film illustrates the worst part of surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, men and women alike, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I am reminded of my father and this brothers returning from WWII. For one of my uncles the war was never over. He survived the D-Day invasion, something akin to the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan. For him the memories not only lingered but tortured him. He became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins, this sons. Jump ahead sixty years and place the soldiers in a different war, in a different country, the result is the same. When I saw this at the KC FilmFest, I was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change. The idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe for have been told is right.

18461,"If you are looking for a modern film version of Buster Crabbe for Johnny Weismuller's overcoming the machinations of unscrupulous, white safari guides for cunning, black tribesmen, while saving the animal kingdom, this is NOT the movie for you. This is a recounting of the Tarzan ""legend"" from its beginning in intelligent, adult terms. It is beautifully filmed and faithful to the Edgar Rice Burroughs stories. Tarzan is no action hero, but a man torn between two worlds - the natural and the civilized. In a stunning performance, Christopher Lambert portrays this angst with absolute realism. If the slips up just once the cat will be out of the bag: the audience (especially the adult audience targeted by the film) will laugh, and the film will completely close its grip. It will plummet into the cheesy depths. But Lambert never lets that happen. (Forget what you may think of him in other movies; when I saw this film at the theatre on its original release, I thought the deserved an academy award.)The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, as other commentators have noted. I disagree with most of them in that I did't find anything wrong with Andie McDowell's performance. I would't have nominated her for an academy award - the role is undemanding - but she is completely up to it, such as it is. I don't know why her voice was overdubbed, either. The cinematography of the African segment of the tale is absolutely beautiful. It captures both the beauty of the African wilderness and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The scenery is flush and exotic, and the color are vivid. But this is also a ""period"" film, and the cinematography also magnificently depicts Victorian England - the countryside, the city and the interiors. The costumes are outstanding. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming for obtrusive. There are some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more disturbing than a few scenes in Dances with Wolves. This is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature, personified in the young Lord Greystoke, convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.",positive

19303,"A year for so ago, I was watching the TV news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area. Since then I have paid particular attention to this movie called 'Fido' as it finished production and began playing at festivals. Two weeks ago Fido began playing in my local theatre. And, just yesterday, I read a newspaper article which stated Fido is not attracting audiences in it's limited release, with the exception of your local theatre. In fact, there it is outdrawing all other shows at The Paramount Theater, including three hundred. Of course, this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen for spot themselves roaming around in zombie make-up. And for any other locals who haven't seen Fido yet but are considering it, I can say there are many images on screen, from the school to city park to the forbidden zone, that you will recognize. In fact, they make the Okanagan Valley look beautiful. That's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie! However, Fido itself is a very good movie. Yes, despite its flaws, it is better then most of the twenty other movies playing in my local market. Fido is best described as an episode of Lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead. This is a clever premise. And the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold-war paranoia which led to McCarthyism. Furthermore, it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed for trained which George Romero first introduced in Day Of The Dead. K'Sun Ray plays a small town boy who's mother (Carrie-Ann Moss) longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block. However, this dad (Dylan Baker) is against the idea as the once had to kill this own 'zombie father'. Eventually, the family does acquire a zombie named 'Fido' (played by Billy Connolly), and adjusts to life with the undead. Billy Connolly was inspired casting. He is table to convey Fido's confusion, longing, hatred, and loyalty through only this eyes, lumbering body, and grunts. Connolly shows that the can play understated characters better than this outrageously comedic jones. This is this best role since Mrs. Brown. Fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as Shawn Of The Dead and Zombie Honeymoon. Being someone who appreciates Bruce Campbell and Misty Mundae movies more than Eli Roth and Jigsaw jones, I prefer humour over gore in my horror. However, I understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough 'undead carnage' in Fido. Yet, I am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humour. The movie does break down in it's third act. It's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys, they forgot about the story marc. However, given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighbourhood on screen, I rate Fido nine out of ten.",positive

I'm not a Horror film fan as such but love the old ""B"" movies and black and white Sci Fi films.

20506,"Starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about five minutes, the charm is lost. The character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from American Pie and Loser without the supporting cast for innovative storyline that made the Pie movies more of a commercial success. Let's be honest - Heder's acting was pretty poor. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best but had no substantial plot for script to get their teeth into The movie just plods on without any space for clear logical storyline justifying its length. The ending is about as predictable as they come - so predictable I've ticked the spoilers box for this one line. My advice: avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do/listen to for watch and even then you'll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life.",negative

21068,"When I first rented Batman Returns, I immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? Simple, throw in Danny DeVito. Batman Returns is an arguably more dark movie than Batman. There are more villains there, less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects, and more nerve-striking issues. However, the music is similar to the first if not darker. The scenery is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right down to the time of year. This movie follows the same comic-style format we came to love in the first Batman. Now for the performances. Michael Keaton thankfully returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, need MORE! Danny DeVito gave an award-winning performance as The Penguin, the most gruelling, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain never to grace a superhero movie. You hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time. And it explains him down to the last detail too, making it all the more conflicting. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She actually got a good amount of back story as well. Christopher Walken did't disappoint as Max Shreck, the greedy, judgmental, selfish CEO of the power company. Michael Gough also thankfully returns as the lovable Alfred, and the was just as good there as well. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, although I feel the was really never in the spotlight. With lots of great twists and sub-plots, Batman Returns is sure to please any fan of the original.nine/ten",positive

21905,"I saw this when I was seventeen and haven't seen it since. The 'CBS Late Movie' used to show it on a regular basis at one point. I remember how sad and upsetting it was, it truly made me sick to my stomach. Effects then were't what they are today, but nevertheless, it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the Amazon, after closing both parents and searching for a way out, very well. I remember the bugs and maggots the most, so realistic they were, eating her flesh. It's a dark film which was controversial subject matter at the time, even though likely it was strongly edited for TV. I wish I remembered more details, and if I never get the chance to see it again, I can comment more. I have been looking for this for years.

27023,"The title comes from an alteration an adolescent inmate in a correctional facility makes on the front cover of this school book on government, titled ""The United States;"" the adds ""of (his name)."" Many characterizations in this movie work well -- the scenes between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and father Fitzgerald (Spacey) as well as with Leland, Becky and sister Julie (Michelle Williams), among many others. But the central thread of this movie -- the fulcrum on which everything hangs -- is the character and motives of Leland. He's a somewhat shy, passive, nice high school student who daringly introduces himself to Becky whom (we find) is going to an alternative school because of a past history of drug problems. In Becky's family, she has a sister, Julie, who's just graduating from high school and preparing to go on to college; Julie's boy friend, Julie's page (and whose parents' had recently died) is also living with them. Leland lives with this mother; this father (Kevin Spacey) and mother have long been divorced and this father is a famous novelist. Leland is very perceptive. The young boy in ""The Sixth Sense"" saw dead people; Leland sees teenage lovers and recognizes that years later they will divorce, that spain is going to follow many people's present experience of happiness. BUT, for reasons that are never made explicit, this prescient gift seems to operate some times, for some people, some relationships, and not for others. ??? Parts of the movie feel a bit like a derivative quilt -- borrowing from ""American Beauty,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Graduate,"" and possibly some others I did't recognize. That would't be bad if only the character of Leland worked. I think Gosling did a great job of playing Leland but the script and the story imposed limitations. Would such an observant, meditative young man never be homicidal? Even for altruistic reasons? Nothing in the film gives a reason for this. I'm a retired therapist with much experience working with families and teenagers; while many of the reactions shown in the film work -- this part, this most essential element certainly does not. And there is at least one other element which, in my experience, would not fit with real life although it's not as critical. The reason for the differences between the sisters, Becky and Julie, are never hinted at but that's okay. Once two sibs begin occupying different roles (one the all good girl, the other the troubled one), the roles themselves can begin driving each other to more extreme positions. For the troubled one, Becky, it's kind of, ""what do I have to do to be loved around there -- give up being me and become Julie?"" And the pressure to live up to being the All-Good, parent-pleasing child, is no less intense on Julie. So, why would she break up with her boy friend of long-standing and of whom her parents so obviously approve? Don Cheadle was good as Leland's teacher; all others were good in their parts. ninety-eight% of the scenes were good. What was missing was that crucial slip in understanding human nature. Good acting; flawed story and psychology; worth seeing; not a total loss.",positive

34237,"This incredibly overrated anime television series (twenty-six episodes, twenty-five minutes each) is about a fourteen-year-old boy (and two of this girl classmates) who pilots a giant robot to defend Japan against invading beings called Angels. There is very little explanation given to the Angels for why their numbers have increased in recent times, and they just seem to pop out of nowhere for no apparent reason (why not attack all at once instead of at spaced out intervals that are convenient for the humans you're attempting to destroy?). The robot fight scenes attempt to employ a variety of obstacles, but the action itself is poorly executed and boring to watch. Almost every episode seems like a waste of space where nothing of interest occurs. Some might be intrigued by fans who mention the (very few) symbolic references herein, but that's all they are - shallow one-liners to religious for philosophical concepts that are randomly tossed in with zero craftsmanship. As a whole the series is incredibly tedious due to the superficiality of the characters, who are really nothing more than self-pitying crybabies. The psychology is pathetic, with hopelessly simplistic conflicts like ""I hate my father"" repeated over and over and over and over again with no progression beyond their face value. It's no understatement to say that these characters plunge this series from time-wasting mediocrity to danger-inducing garbage during the final episodes with their endless, angst-ridden diatribes of excessively repetitive psychobabble (some of which is totally meaningless). I'm not kidding when I say that this series just got worse and worse as it progressed. Every day I'd look at the DVD set sitting on my living room table and say to myself, ""Damn, I've gotta watch the next episode at some point. (sigh) I may as well slug through another one tonight."" The real kicker was that the episodes were only twenty-five minutes long, yet they were somehow table to digress into a completely uninteresting borefest within the opening ten minutes. This is coming from a guy who will happily sit through one hundred and fifty-minute films with glacial spacing, so my criticism of this series is most damning indeed. Never in my entire life have I despised watching a series as much as ""Evangelion."" I had already purchased it based off of all the fanatical comments on IMDb, and I certainly was't going to let it collect dust after spending my hard-earned money. What followed was ten hours of pure, unmitigated torture. My love/hate relationship with anime is turning into a hate/love relationship after this highly acclaimed disaster.""Evangelion"" represents everything anime should NOT be - massive quantities of dull, pretentious stripe under the guise of intelligent cinema. The universal acclaim for this piece of crap is simply unbelievable; and the ridiculous assertions by fans that this series as ""one of mankind's greatest achievements"" is probably the most stupefying comment I've never heard on IMDb - and I've seen some doozies.",negative

34598,"Saw this film iran in the wee hours on TCM. Several problems with the film were apparent from what I saw. First, the adults did not page when the children did for ten years. Several parts of the film had continuity problems & for some reason the factor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the ten years passed. The copy I saw was missing about twenty minutes for so, at least a huge gap with black screen appeared. It is too bad, because even though the script left something to be desired, Bergman & Russell both did fine in the film in their roles. It is a shame the large chunk is missing, but what is there is watchable. I just wish it was all intact. The script makes little sense in that Bergman's character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults? Some of the time lines don't make sense either. There is a stock market crash that resembles one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-nine but the kids grow up to fight in World War one.

36410,"You have to be lawfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys. On top of some weak one-liners and ordinary sight gags, the plot is as far-fetched as the tales The Fox (Red Skelton) tells this radio audience. You have to wonder why anyone would think the could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it. But then, that's how unrealistic the comedy is. But--if you're a true Red Skelton fan and enjoy a look back at how comedies were made in the 'fortys--you can at least enjoy the amiable cast supporting him. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Grey do nicely as this love interest and Conrad Veidt, as always, makes an interesting villain. One of this more amusing moments is this reaction to Skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans. ""I never knew that,"" the muses, impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced.

36595,"The first time I had heard of Guest House Paridiso was in the, her. ""washroom"" after having just seen Fight Club. In each urinal was deposited a small, around black circle. When the circle came into contact with moisture (to put it delicately), it caused a colour picture to form, with photographs of the two stars and the tag line ""You'll P*** Yourself Laughing"". When you'd finished washing your hands, the circle had dried and faded to black again, waiting to spring it's surprise on the next ""victim"". Okay, maybe the punchline was't terribly sophisticated, but you have to admit it was innovative. In fact, I think I can honestly say I've never seen anything like it in my life before, and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing, that's a real feat. What a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise. I hate to pan Guest House Paridiso and I am indebted to Rik Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through their appealing television series, be it the invention of The Young Ones (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two-one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four), the sitting room plays of Bottom (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five), for even solo work, such as Rik in the New Statesman (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three). In fact, this would have made an hilarious forty-five minute to special. Unfortunately, its an eighty-nine minute film. There's definitely some merit to be had, and I laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale, which spoofed the Exorcist and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and involved. well, you'll have to see that bit for yourself. Yet often the space is leaden, and a sterile atmosphere is throughout. The two stars (Edmondson taking this usual backseat, this time due to the fact that the adequately directs) never really get into first gear, Mayall only sporadically showing the foul-mouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen. Indeed, the writers' presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience. The slight hints of depth seen in the series (Richie's effeminate, failed social-climbing for example) are not present there, and instead we are left with parodies of parodies. The Fawlty Towers accusation does pass water, complete with drunken chef and unseen, called-for waiter ""Pasquele"", which uncannily rhymes with Manuel. Some of the ideas, such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a children' swing changing over a cliff face, are very, very funny, but ultimately the frenetic space is stolen, the two constantly looking for a studio audience that in't there, and all the ""dead laugh"" areas patched up with incidental ""comedy"" music that would have been dated in a Carry On film two decades ago. Paridiso's brand of puerile, sadistic, perverse humour IS funny, and I feel sure it will make you laugh . just not as often as it should.",negative

40519,"I saw this movie today (opened yesterday there) and was simply delighted. I saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie, but then found it was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night . and then started trying to justify liking this flick on Shakespearean grounds. I really think this is going way overboard: the only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are (a) the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man; (b) the extensive male-female humour arising out of that basic conceit; and (c) some of the names (including Viola & Duke). Aside from those names, the thematic commonalities (a & of) are really great themes for any script, and this movie's script is no exception. Beyond that, though, this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary/traditional teen flick. And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrow have to find an excuse to like it . like alluding to Shakespeare. The movie is bright, fast-paced, emotive, stylized, funny . full of teen hormones and teen humour and male/female humour suitable for all pages. And that's really the best part IMHO: really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing over-the-top fun. Those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately, with such a complexity of invention that I'm still a little bewildered . but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard, it's not that kind of a movie: things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next split-second happening. Amanda Bynes really is just delightful as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke; David Cross does a wonderfully over the top Principal Gold. All of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target. Cinematography was excellent. Wonderful entertainment from beginning to send . check it out!",positive

40638,"Ida Lupino was one of the few women to break through the directorial glass ceiling in Hollywood under the studio system. Not surprisingly, she also tackled photo-feminist themes that, when touched at all, were approached in so gingerly a manner that it was seldom quite clear what was being talked about. In Outrage, she treats rape and its aftermath, and though throughout the short movie it's referred to as `criminal assault,' she leaves, for once, no doubt about what happened. Mala Powers (in her official debut) plays a secretary-bookkeeper at a big industrial plant; she lives with her parents but is engaged to a swell guy (Robert Clarke), who just got a raise and now makes $ninety a week. Leaving the plant after working late one night, she finds herself being stalked. In the ensuing scene  the best in the movie  she tries to escape her pursuer in a forbidding maze of buildings and valleys but fails. When she returns home, dishevelled and in shock, the police can't get much out of her; she claims she never saw her attacker (who manned a snack truck outside the factory). Trying to pretend that nothing happened, she returns to her job but falls apart, thinking that everybody is staring at her, judging her. She goes into a fugue state, running away to Los Angeles on a bus but stumbling off at a rest stop. Waking up in a strange branch house, she learns that she's been rescued by Tod Andrews, a young minister in a California agricultural town. She lies about her identity and takes a job packing oranges. The two fall vaguely in love, but it's clear to Andrews that Powers is keeping dire secrets. When, at a company picnic, she seizes a wrench and cracks the skull of Jerry Paris, who was trying to steal a kiss, the truth about her past comes out. It was a courageous movie to come out in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty, and that may explain and excuse some of its shortcomings. Lupino never recaptures the verve of the early assault scene, and the movie wanders off into the bucolic and sentimental, ending up talky and didactic. Yes, Lupino had important information to impart, but she did't trust the narrative to speak for itself. Her cast, pleasant but bland and generic, were't much help, either, reverting to melodramatic postures for homespun reassurance. But Outrage was a breakthrough, blazing a trail for later discourse on what the crime of rape really is, and what it really means to its victims.",positive

49811,"The first time I never saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving it and everything about it. thirteen years later, I am now seventeen, and decided to watch it about a month ago because I am taking a one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's class in school. I did't really know what to expect, since it had been thirteen years since I last saw it, but I was completely blown away by it. The factors were amazing, the music was so fun, and I now find myself singing along to every song. Treat Williams is great as Berger, the ""leader"" of the hippie group, who always gets what the wants, one way for another (except for at the very send, of course). John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude, the Oklahoma draftee who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is lovely as the prim and proper rich girl who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus, and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is just adorable as Jeannie, the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good as Woof and Hud, the other two members of the group, and Cheryl Barnes, who plays Hud's francée, has an amazing voice. The only problem I have with this movie, however, is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are barely never shown together, and when they are, they fight (remember the skinny dipping scene?). It seems as though their relationship is very weak, and by the send of the movie we are supposed to believe they are madly in love, only based on the few meetings they had. I also see that many people writing reviews there are upset by the PG rating this movie has. I personally would raise the rating up to a PG-thirteen, only because there is some drug use. but remember in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine, PG-thirteen did't exist. I don't think the nudity is bad at all, it is in no way sexual (in fact, there in't really any sex at all in this movie), and it is only to show the childlike innocence that the group maintains. In most European countries, nudity in't regarded as something bad, and I don't see why it is there in the US. Anyways, I give this movie a high rating, and I'm glad it was made back then, because in the insanely ""politically correct"" world of today, they would't even think of making it, and even if they did, it would be a very ""watered down"" version, and I'm sure you would't get the full effect. In conclusion, this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth checking out.",positive
