Whole album sounds much different than anything the had made through the next years of this career. Guitar that was so characteristic in this earlier records is hidden there on second plan. Massive choir, orchestral arrangements, synths and opera sounds are dominating in \"part one\" and \"part two\".they all give album a bit Film music for classical music taste. During last eight minutes of \"part two\" Maddie Pryor (from Steelaye span band) is singing the \"Hawaiatha\" poem with the background of Jabula african drums band and etheric vibraphone part (Pierre morley from Gong, he will collaborate with Mike in the later years too). This part is hypnotizing listeners because of monotonic Vocal intonations and very spiritual atmosphere. but i save all the honours for \"part three\" and \"part four\" which are in my opinion one of Mike's finest instrumental works in in this whole Career.\"Part three\" starts with a cheerful Fanfare medieval motive. but suddenly starts the magnificent long Guitar solo section. African tribal Drums are again on background along with gentle Bass riff and synths. the raw and moving Gitar solo is one of the moments that can brought tears into your eyes because of a impossible beauty that lies underneath it.later straight to the send \"part three\" goes into the nice seventies rocker with nice drums and guitars. \"part four\" is much more experimental - etheric and mysterious Vibraphone part dominates there. i have to mention also the another tribal drums section with a rhythmical Bass guitar riff and charming Guitar solo. the ending is a All time Oldfield Classic - Maddie Pryor singing \"ode to diana\" along with a bit christmas-like melody.guitar solo is wonderful.

But some twenty-three years later, this album still is my favourite, its emotional, personal and even social themes very dominant. From Too High, where Stevie sings about a woman so very high on drugs and disillusioning everyone, to Visions and its moving lyrics to Living in the City and a person's quest for survival in it and Golden Lady, a special tribute to women, this album has it.

I bought the vinyl version more than thirty years ago, soon after it first came out. A few of the songs survived the vinyl era on my self-recorded cassette tapes. Since I got the CD, I've listened to \"Honky Cat\" countless times in the car, and copied it onto my laptop so I can listen to it inside too. Everyone knows the hit songs \"Honky Cat\" and \"Rocket Man\". I remembered fondly the beautiful \"tribute\" to New York City, \"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\" (it was actually a DB discussion of this song that brought the album back to mind), \"Salvation\", and the closing number (inspired by a rhino if you believe the CD notes), \"Hercules\" (Elton's stage middle name). What surprised me were the other great songs I did't remember so well--\"Mellow\" and \"Susie (Dramas)\", the latter of which has a chorus so great that they have to using it three times--\"She sure knows how to use me\/pretty little black-eyed Susie\/playing hooky with my heart all the time\/Livin with her funky family\/in a derelict old valley\/down by the river where we share a little login' in the moonshine.\" I'm gonna using at least one of these at Karaoke some night. The album also brought back to mind the seamless songwriting collaboration of Elton and this lyricist Bernie Taupin, who did not play for using with the band. I'm told that Taupin wrote the lyrics (poems) and Elton wrote the itunes around them. On \"Honky Chateau\", an album that was primarily recorded in France, the producer filled out the sound with an exciting electric violin, used very effectively on \"Mellow\" and \"Amy\". Elton's piano composition and playing is fabulous as always. Listening again to \"Honky Chateau\" makes me understand why Elton John became a pop music phenomenon.","overall":5,"summary":"A Cat Named Elton Hercules John","unixReviewTime":1192406400,"reviewTime":"10 15, 2007"}

But then, after a short period during which the mortal grows accustom to this newfound omnipotence, the Gods take that ability away. Hilarity ensues, Greek style. That, in a nutshell, is the chart career of one Bill Withers. For a short and very definable time, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two to be exact, this man OWNED the charts. It started with the immortal \"Lean On Me\", a gospel-tinged ballad so honest, so human, so melodic that it went straight to #one on the pop & soul charts. It was, during the time between Vietnam protests and Watergate, a balm for a savagely rent America. You know it from its opening piano chord alone. Within mere months, Withers had a stunning follow-up track - \"Ain't No Sunshine\". A deep deep bluesy track that was the antithesis of the upbeat \"Lean\". It was as sun-pop as a song could get -- in one part of the song, Withers seems to go into a trance repeating \"I know, I know\" some thirty-odd times in quick succession. It went top five. Still within the same year, \"Use Me\". If this first two tracks showed Withers mastery of soul and blues, \"Use Me\" showed the man could funk out with the best of them. In one album, Withers showed incredible versatility, musicianship and songcraft. There was a limitless future for him. Then the chart Gods said \"Ha!\"Because the hits stopped on a dime. Sure there were minor success afterwards. An uncredited vocal on Grover Washington's \"Just The two Of Us\". The dance remake of \"Lean On Me\" by Club Nouveau, which similar shot to #one. Heck, Withers could probably live off the songwriter royalties to the \"Lovely Day\" cover included on the \"Bodyguard\" soundtrack. But those big hits, those classics, those anthems were gone forever.","overall":5,"summary":"The Gods must be Laughing","unixReviewTime":1099267200,"reviewTime":"11 1, 2004"}

The most obvious example of this is her epic masterpiece, \"Paprika Plains\". Dissonant sounding at times, this sixteen minute magnum opus alone makes this album worth owning. I love reading the parenthetical lyrics that are couched between the vocalized lyrics, matching them to the discordant (in a very good way!) orchestra mixing with her clunky piano playing. It almost sounds like it wants to be easy listening, is anything but, and is well worth the effort. The title track is another extreme masterpiece and is one of my very, very faves of all her songs. Her imagery beautifully captures the dichotomy of desire\/lust and higher emotional needs and is just astounding. Musically, the groove of her guitar, Jaco's bass and the percussion there just sucks you right in. The opening \"Overture\/Cotton Avenue\" is an entrancing, mood-evoking song about going out for an evening of dancing and I find it irresistible! The theme, for at least the backdrop of dancing\/dance floors, comes up several times through the album: the aforementioned \"Paprika Plains\" takes place in a dance club as does \"Talk To Me\", which contains one of her most fascinating (of many fascinating) lyrics: \"I did't know I drank such a lot\/Til I pissed a Tequila Anaconda the full length of the parking lot\".\"Jericho\" is a really different kind of love song, promising to let the walls of defense one puts up come down just like. well, you know.\"Otis And Marlene\" is a not-so-sly condemnation of idyllic health-spa vacationing off-set by some ominous trouble-in-paradise. Trouble also blooms in \"Off Night Backstreet\", a song about discovering the cheating of a lover, while \"The Silky Veils Of Ardor\" closes the album with a calm bemusing about the stickiness of love and romantic relationships. Rounding out this complex album are the third-world rhythmic \"Dreamland\" and \"The Tenth World\", with Chaka Khan amongst the chanting vocalists. Be prepared for quite a wild ride with \"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\" - it is far from any ordinary album and is certainly a great milestone in the catalogue of Joni Mitchell.","overall":5,"summary":"\"DON JUAN'S RECKLESS DAUGHTER\": JONI MITCHELL REALLY PUSHES THE ENVELOPE","unixReviewTime":1168905600,"reviewTime":"01 16, 2007"}

You guessed it. It was the first time I'd never heard the song \"Money For Nothing\" and needless to say, the song's great hooks hooked me completely. For the next several weeks, I'd search the radio stations for this song (which was't hard to do because the song was absolutely played to death. ). Over the next few weeks at least one other single received regular rotation (\"Walk of Life\") over the airwaves. All this was enough to motivate me to buy the album. Boy, was this a music purchase that was well worth the price. It is true that this album contained the great singles mentioned above, but it also contained gorgeous, atmospheric songs that actually took you on a musical journey. There are those albums where the lyrics paint the musical canvas in your head. This is one of those albums where it's the music that paints the picture with moody, meandering slower pieces such as \"Your Latest Trick\" and \"Why Worry\" and with more uptempo songs in a minor key whose titles and music revoke images (in my mind at least) of a person on an adventure such as \"One World\", \"The Man's Too Strong\" and \"Ride Across The River\". But the highlight of the album, at least as far as I'm concerned is the brooding anti-war title track. What a poignant, sad song and what beautiful guitar playing, all over the sounds of thunder in the background. This song puts a brilliant send to an album that was already really good. In sum, this album is a near masterpiece. Actually, there is not one bad song on this album - in fact, I'd say that every song is very good and some are quite excellent. The album holds together very well as a collection of songs and many of the songs (such as the singles) do very well all on their own. I would actually rate this album four.twenty-five stars, and of course, around down to four. the deduction coming from the fact that I just don't listen to it very much anymore - probably because I listened to it so much in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. At any rate, THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM - A NEAR MASTERPIECE - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","overall":4,"summary":"One Of The Great Rock Albums Of The 1980s","unixReviewTime":1028073600,"reviewTime":"07 31, 2002"}

The album's title track reached the top of the singles chart in both the US and UK and was followed by four more US hits: \"Express Yourself\" (#two), \"Cherish\" (#two), \"Oh Father\" (#twenty) and \"Keep It Together\" (#eight). \"Dear Jessie\" was released in the UK and hit #five. The album's videos learned seven MTV Video Music Award nominations, including best video of the year (\"Like A Prayer\") and best female video (\"Express Yourself\"). She took home the Moon Man for Viewer's Choice for the title video. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety, the video for \"Oh Father,\" directed by David Fincher, won the Grammy for best short form music video. \"Like A Prayer\" has sold over four million units in the US, and another eleven million internationally.one. \"Like A Prayer\" (ten\/ten)two. \"Express Yourself\" (ten\/ten)three. \"Love Song\" (nine\/ten)four. \"Til Death Do Us Part\" (ten\/ten)five. \"Promise To Try\" (ten\/ten)six. \"Cherish\" (ten\/ten)seven. \"Dear Jessie\" (ten\/ten)eight. \"Oh Father\" (ten\/ten)nine. \"Keep It Together\" (ten\/ten)ten. \"Spanish Eyes\" (ten\/ten)eleven. \"Act Of Contrition\" (ten\/ten)Like A Prayer was my fax Madonna studio album, until Confessions On A Dance Floor got released. It's extremely personal and must have been depressing for Madonna to make this album, as she talks about the death of her mother, the love\/hate relationship with her father, and her recent (at the time of the album's release) break-up with Sean Penn. All of the singles are brilliant, \"Like A Prayer\" and \"Oh Father\" being the best. \"Express Yourself\", \"Cherish\", \"Keep It Together\" (US single only) and \"Dear Jessie\" (UK single only) are also brilliant. The album tracks must not be missed either. \"Love Song\", a duet with Prince, is definitely the album's weakest moment, but definitely a good song. \"Til Death Do Us Part\" and \"Promise To Try\" are probably the album's best unreleased tracks, because they are personal. It makes Madonna all the more better for it. \"Spanish Eyes\" is a latin effort, and it blows \"La Isla Bonita\" right out of the water, whereas \"Act Of Contrition\" is more like an interlude. It's \"Like A Prayer\" playing backwards and Madonna mumbling to herself, basically. Overall, this album is brilliant. You cannot call yourself a Madonna fan if you don't have this in your collection.

Knowledgable fans of the same band often have an extraordinary diversity of opinions on, for instance, which is that band's best (or worst) album. With The Jesus and Mary Chain, however, I have to insist that the grungy \"Honey's Dead,\" is clearly their best work, perhaps the culmination of JMC's previous three albums. The band perfectly blends the sonics of \"Psychocandy,\" the best of the songs on \"Darklands\" (\"Happy When It Rains\" and \"Down On Me\"), and the playfulness of \"Automatic,\" to create this incredible album. Of course, \"Honey's Dead\" begins with the rather shocking \"Reverence\" [\"I want to die like Jesus Christ (JFK)\/ I want to die on a bed of spikes (on a sunny day)\"]; and ends with \"Frequency\" (same lyrics, with the additional line \"with the radio on.\"). Not my favourite songs on \"HD,\" but certainly get one's attention. For pure driving rock, the Reid brothers give us \"Far Gone and Out,\" \"Tumbledown,\" and \"Rollercoaster\" (the last of which has an almost \"Mr Tambourine Man\" feel). The Reid Brother's guitar work shines, and the rest of the orchestration is quite superior to anything they did before. Just as good though, are the slower numbers, including \"Almost Gold,\" \"Catchfire,\" and \"Sundown.\"The two stand-out songs though are \"Teenage Lust,\" and \"Sugar Ray.\" \"Teenage Lust,\" perhaps even more shocking than \"Reverence,\" describes a \"little skinny girl doing it for the first time.\" Of course, given the title, we automatically think \"under-age,\" but the lyrics can be referring to a nineteen year old, for even an older woman with a particularly lusty man. In \"Sugar Ray,\" I just love the inclusion of that cajun sounding aluminium percussive instrument. Although the song is certainly raunchy (lyrically reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lot of Love\") there is a surprising tenderness to it as well. Obviously, the song is about having wild sex (especially during the instrumental part), but the man tells this companion that, even though this friends might be having loads of fun, \"all I want is you.\" The lyrics are full of double entendres, but are never really explicit. I still smile when I hear Jim Reid using in this sly snarling style (similar in some ways to Billy Idol), the lyrics \"come enjoy,\" near the send of the song. A great, highly underrated album, which, again, I have to insist, is JMC's best.","overall":5,"summary":"A consistently great album","unixReviewTime":1124928000,"reviewTime":"08 25, 2005"}

Something like \"give me my money back!\" for such. If you listen to Devo's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine live record \"Now It Can Be Told,\" Mark makes a comment (after an acoustic number) that the audience might wonder why the band was sitting down. \"After fifteen years in the music business, it's kind of hard to sit down,\" the wryly remarked. And, yet, this album, which has a few catchy itunes -- \"The Satisfied Mind,\" \"Here to Go,\" and their cover of Jimi Hendrix's \"Are You Experienced?\" -- is mostly *all* filler. The song \"Puppet Boy\" is simply embarrassing. This is hard to fathom, given how solid \"Oh, No! It's Devo!\" was. But, when a band over-relies on synthesizers and computers, this is what invariably happens: Devo managed to devolve within two years the same amount music itself took twenty years to do. The proof in the pudding that Devo just iran out of ideas is their album \"Total Devo,\" which was four years in the making, but sounded like it was four weeks. \"Smooth Noodle Maps\" was slightly better, the the fact of the matter is, this latter record had no memorable hits, and \"Shout\" and \"Total Devo\" had at least a couple each. I am pleased to announce, however, to anyone who's seen the Dell Computer (talk about \"de-evolution\": A Microsoft based computer!) commercial with their new song \"Watch Us Work It,\" knows that Devo can experience flashes of sheer brilliance every so often (the song is an amalgam of \"The Super Thing\" and \"Enough Said\"), but for twenty-three years, they've been unable to muster enough creativity for an entire album.","overall":3,"summary":"The Truth About the De-evolution of Devo","unixReviewTime":1189900800,"reviewTime":"09 16, 2007"}

From the beautiful opener 'Darling Pretty' to 'Golden Heart' via the upbeat and fun 'Cannibals' and taking in the mournful melancholy of 'Rudiger' this album delivers so much emotion on one CD it almost demands repeated listening. The closing solo on 'Are We in Trouble Now' still gives me goosebumps even now and shows just how much power this album has. Knopflers later solo albums were hit and miss, but this one set the standard so high it was always going to be difficult to live up to it and this is the Knopfler album I keep coming back to.

Although at the time of its release it was looked at for its special stances and controversial lyrics, Death Certififcate proved that Ice Cube could definitely get your attentions. Divided into two sides (\"Death Side\" and \"Life Side\"), this album had more of a message than Cube's first album. The Death Side has all the showings of a gangsta wrap album, with tracks about gang expansion (\"My Summer Vacataion\"), adventures of the Lench Mob (\"Steady Mobbin\"), and STDs in the ghetto (\"Look Who's Burnin\"). The Life Side is bit more controversial, with songs about the US government (\"I Wanna Kill Sam\"), sellouts (\"True to the Game\"), and peace between Bloods and Crips (\"Color Blind\"). The two most controversial tracks however belong to \"Black Korea\", which spews venom on Asian Americans, and \"No Vaseline\", which is a vicious miss aimed at NWA.

This represents this late period which is probably the hardest for new listeners to get into. In order to get to heaven one has to live through what can seem like hell. Get through the seemingly chaotic, turbulent, screeching and honking of the duelling tenors of Coltrane and this apprentice at the time Pharoah Sanders and what surfaces is heavenly. It is cleansing and purifying. This was the experimental Coltrane trying the use of multiple instruments, two saxes and two drummers which is both bewildering and exhilarating. Elvin Jones, a member of the \"classic quartet\" is nothing less than phenomenal, pounding the skins on the right channel as new comer Rasheedd Ali matches and exceeds this intensity. McCoy Tyner is magical as the fingers the ivory keys with cascading fluidity to bring a rich textural harmony to the full sound. The title of the songs Coltrane composed indicates this connection to a higher being. The songs are written and grouped in movements, as in classical music. Essentially it is a composition in two parts, the first two songs and the last three. I prefer the second \"movement\" that begins with \"Love\" goes through \"Consequences\" and ends with \"Serenity.\" Coltranes tenor never sounded richer for fuller. He plays with absolute conviction, the embodiment of creation paying homage to this creator. His sound nips at your soul gently, never biting but always reminding you of the greater self. There are moments of savagery, as when Pharoah joins in, but the tenderness and soulful harmony of Trane makes for one of this best recordings in the final analysis. Trane's fluttering sax has wings, taking the listener to another plane. \"Serenity\" has blown through Trane's horn is a magnificent example of sweetness to the years. The song, for final movement, is hypnotic and mesmerizing, brought to a climax that has tension, dipping finally into peaceful relaxation that culminates on another level. This is the Trane experience, just as good then as it is now, if not better. Sometimes full appreciation comes with maturity. This is Coltrane at the apex of this powers, a spiritual quest and musical journey nearing it's apogee.","overall":5,"summary":"So close to heaven","unixReviewTime":1003363200,"reviewTime":"10 18, 2001"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"At the crucial time when people of most sides of the musical spectrum could (and did) make a successful living out of giving permission for their audience not only to the world around them but also the possibility of taking positive actions to correct what needed to be corrected. Everyone in the R&B world from Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder at Motown to Gil Scott-Heron and Bobby Womack were coming at their music from a similar angle at the time. And it was only appropriate that during this time Curtis Mayfield, one of the few outside Sam Cooke in the late fifty's\/early sixty's to do it all creatively and express a social conscience at the same time would go solo from the Impressions at this time and put this two cents in. Everyone during this time had a unique flavor to how they expressed themselves and Curtis did't change that on this send. The overall sound of this album is very unique. His music from aggressive, fast paced uptempo songs such as hits \"(Don't Worry) If There's A Hell Below We're All Going To Go\" and \"Move On Up\" along with songs such as \"Wild And Free\" and the upbeat and melodic sounding \"Miss Black America\" not only have some afrocentric jazz\/funk percussion and fat bass\/guitar lines to them but also some of the dreamiest and fanfaring orchestrations you could find on a funky soul record of this era. Even on numbers such as the humane, slower romantic numbers \"The Makings Of You\" and the more darkly realistic streetside commentary of \"The Other Side Of Town\" offer the same effect with the orchestral send of things. Other songs such as \"We The People Who Are Darker Than Blue\" is a glue appropriately coming right in the middle of the album, not only bridging the musical styling this album presents but also crosses bridges by starting out slow and plaintive and spinning off into another percussion groove. All of this could be easily seen coming on Curtis's final few releases with the Impressions, especially the multi-partison \"teaching\" approach Curtis takes to delivering lyrics about everything from cultural concerns, poverty, freedom and romance. As much as the original album pulled everything together so well and is about as close to a well rounded and powerful debut as one could possibly ask for the huge amount of bonus tracks are a lot more illustrative than you might think. Demos songs such as \"Power To The People\",\"Ghetto Child\",\"Readings In Astrology\" and the slower and shorter \"Suffer\" not only showcase early versions of songs on the original album while still in the ether but the slinky, clean yet psychedelic basslines and guitar work for Mayfield and how crucial they are to the songs stripped from the produced and orchestral settings. The remainders are either demos of different instrumental takes of songs on the actual album, the most notable part of which is where Curtis is heard announcing a take of \"Don't Worry If There's A Hell Below We're All Going To Go\" and one of the musicians responds \"That's a hell of a statement\". And that could actually serve as my own six word review of this album if you will; from the music, lyrical focus to the strength of the songwriting and production itself this is one of those soft referred \"neglected classics\" that. well may not be as neglected as we think and if so there's a good reason.","overall":5,"summary":"Curtis Goes Out For The People","unixReviewTime":1288051200,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2010"}

My beliefs are that Michelle Branch has a future. She has a great look, a great sound, vocally she out does the Mariah wannabe Christina, out sings the monotone Minnie Mouse \"Britney\", and shows she has a sense of cool style when it comes to fashion. Michelle Branch has her own style - that winds around Natalie Merchant, to Six Pence, to Belinda Carlisle, to Joan Osborne, etc. Michelle has a range and she plays it really well. Branch comes off in her videos as just the girl next door who does't need attitude (Christina), torn clothing and gaudy make-up (Britney) for bleach blonde hair (Jessica) to have a career. All she needs is her fresh looks, her gorgeous voice and her terrific talent to carry her for years to come. Her album \"The Spirit Room\" is a fantastic well produced piece of pop that takes all forms. Branch shows she can play with the heavyweights. Her standout songs besides the single \"Everywhere\" are \"You Get Me\", \"Sweet Misery\" and \"Goodbye To You\" to name few. Branch's album is first rate and shows that she has the talent to withstand these pop jokes Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson and even the overrated Alicia Keys.","overall":4,"summary":"BRANCH HAS A FUTURE AND THE SPIRTS ARE WITH HER","unixReviewTime":1011916800,"reviewTime":"01 25, 2002"}

In Absentia is one CD that was originally recommended to me as I began to build a modern prog CD library. Though Porcupine Tree was unfamiliar to me, I bought it without hesitation and liked it instantly. But since I was acquiring so much new music and there was so much to digest, it sat in my track forgotten until recently. Occasionally, I go through my CDs to see what I than't heard in a while. Recently, I did that and when I spied this, I grabbed it and put it on. I liked it so much this time around that I played it for days on send. There is not much more I can add to all the hosannahs already showered on this recording. I like the whole thing. My favourites are the hard-driving Blackest Eyes, Trains, the Crosby, Stills, and Nash-like harmonies of Lips of Ashes, The Sound of Muzak, Wedding Nails, and Heartattack in a Layby. Steven Wilson and company show with this release that they merit a place in the upper echelons of the prog genre. These guys are nuanced, they explode where necessary but they can also play with the most exquisite precision and delicacy where the song demands it. Porcupine Tree definitely sets a new prog-rock standard with In Absentia. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in progressive rock for to the merely musically adventurous. You won't be sorry you bought it.","overall":5,"summary":"Sets a New Prog Standard","unixReviewTime":1084060800,"reviewTime":"05 9, 2004"}

In an era of horrible music it is so refreshing to there some plain old, hard score, in your face rock-n-roll. Nothing flashy, nothing fancy, no promo hype. just good music. This one rocks from the get-go, and never lets up. This record is so damned melodic that it will make you sick. to the point where your only cure will be to listen to the same track over and over and over again. I could't get past \"Holdin On\"(I think it's track ten?), it could be the best song that the group has never recorded. Josey Scott has one of the best voices in recent modern rock history. He, unlike singers from many other brainless rock facts, pours this very soul. his essence into this singing. When you listen you are not just hearing Josey using, you are engaged in a discussion, as if the was singing just to you. Hey, call it what you will, but this one just rocks. Great record from start to finish, with each song having the potential to be the next big hit on modern rock radio. Fans of Saliva won't be disappointed. Keep 'em coming' boys!! Can't get enough of that role Southern Nu-metal!!

That first album introduced Dido as a skilled artist who not only had a wonderful voice, but also the talent to co-write some catchy, deep songs. Here Dido, like Michelle Branch, proves she is no fluke and can expand and grow. Most great albums, for at least great songs, seem to flow out of the artist's personal zone, events and moods in their lives will influence the material and this is the case with \"Life For Rent.\" \"No Angel\" was an optimistic view over-all, it was about loving and being loved, but with \"Life For Rent\" Dido decides to explore the realms of heartbreak more. This of course, is due to the fact that she broke-up from her fiance. Dido's gift, like rocker Scott Weiland, is taking the event in her life and making it into a good song. Consider the opener, \"White Flag,\" a melodic tune with a classic vibe, is a direct statement about the hardships of breaking up and refusing to let go. \"Life For Rent\" is also a gloomy theme, but with a nice melody. Few artists have excelled at making a sad day sound so damn good like Dido. \"Mary's In India\" sounds like a page out of her personal diary, the final lyrics are a nice wordplay on the structure of the lyrics that came earlier in the song. \"See You When You're forty\" is a curious try at throwing-in some quasi-techno feel but it proves Dido's vocals can soar over the beats. \"Life For Rent\" is a good sophomoric effort, what it's missing is the feeling and catchiness for just plain memorable atmosphere of \"No Angel.\" There karen't any haunting songs in the tradition of \"My Lover's Gone\" for \"Hunter.\" The daring, larger scope of the previous album is missed. But still, Dido manages to come back to the spotlight with an album that still has moments of great musical ability, it in't a disappointing album as many second tries turn out to be. The production is still well-done, the orchestral flourishes are great year-candy and that unique voice still conveys real feelings. \"Life For Rent\" is worth checking out.","overall":4,"summary":"Wonderfully Crafted And Produced.","unixReviewTime":1068422400,"reviewTime":"11 10, 2003"}

I haven't been familiar with their music until \"Stacy's Mom\" hit the airwaves last year. \"Stacy's Mom\" was catchy as any song by Britney Spears for the Backstreet Boys but with guitars. Unfortunately \"Stacy's Mom\" got played into ground (thanks VH! and MTV!). Normally I am not really into power pop music other than the Japanese duo Puffy AmiYumi. What made me buy \"Welcome Interstate Mangers\" is the highly addictive \"Mexican Wine\". My local alternative radio station played it for awhile earlier this year but haven't heard it since then. When I found a used copy of the band's latest album today, I had to buy it. Of the three cd that I bought today, this is the one cd that was not completely flawless. There were some songs that I did't like and some songs that I liked. One of the weakest tracks on the cd was the slow song \"Valley Winter Song\". I did't think that ballads were the band's strongest suit, well at least with this song. \"Hackensack\" was a far better ballad than \"Valley Winter Song\". I absolutely adored \"Hung Up On You\". I was surprised and impressed that the band would take a risk and do a country song. It is cool to experiment with other different types of music and Fountains of Wayne managed to pull that off with that song successfully. The harmonies and melodies are the band's strongest points. They reminded me of The Beach Boys but with louder guitars. Despite not liking a few of the songs on the album, I'm still glad that I bought \"Welcome Interstate Managers\".","overall":4,"summary":"There were some hits and misses but overall a real gem","unixReviewTime":1086998400,"reviewTime":"06 12, 2004"}

Featuring great guitar work, and nice excellent vocals, the band has a great sound that keeps you coming back for more. I must admit, though, that I don't entirely know what to make of this album. The songs are all great to listen to, but when you get familiar with the words, you start scratching your head. Halley's Waitress is a lovely song that turns out to be about a waitress who keeps disappearing. Fire Island sounds so good, until you realize it's about teenagers throwing a (literally) smashing party while their parents are out of town. Stacy's Mom is an upbeat toe-tapper that turns out to be about a young man's crush on this girlfriend's mother. And I could go on. Don't get me wrong, it does't ruin the songs, quite the opposite. This is a very silly album that has a surprise around every corner, and I love it! This really is a fun album, one that I enjoy listening to over and over again.

I don't care for her Japanese music that much, not because I don't like her, but because it never caught my interest. I like Japanese music but her music never wowed me. When I saw her face in the Tower records near my house one day I just brushed by the CD and kept looking for other things. But that same day I saw the video for Easy Breezy on iTunes and I knew I had to get the CD. The first single was infectious although her singing was way off key and the lyrics were questionable: \"your easy breezy and I'm Japaneezy.\" Anyway, the CD has a few seriously deep songs. Exodus four, Tippy Toe, Hotel Lobby, Animato, and Kremlin Dusk all have very inspired and powerful lyrics that deal with everything from relationship issues, to social issues such as the female role in society and if heterosexuality is really natural. But don't worry. Although she has many poet songs, they all are very catchy and have unique and unclassifiable beats. I'm not sure if they are Urban Hard-Core R&B, for Electronic Dancehall, for if they are just one big mix of many different styles. Although Utada has many great songs on this CD, no album is perfect, and Utada falls flat on a generic wannabe party jam The Workout, where she sings about \"pushing it up and down.\" I love party songs but hers does not hit as hard in this category as someone like Namie Amuro would. Also like I said before, Utada has a very weak voice. It seems like she struggles to stay on key at times and sometimes she hits off notes. That aside, this album is a gem in today's emotionless music world where the artists don't even write their own music anymore. Utada has a true talent when it comes to writing.","overall":5,"summary":"Undredictable Utada","unixReviewTime":1155168000,"reviewTime":"08 10, 2006"}

I loved her last two albums, but what her live delivery brings to the songs from these two albums is what they were meant to be. Essence is a song that transcends just being a song and slow burns into something higher. That's just one example. Then there's the beginning of the album. The slow songs one after another is no doubt the anti-beginning of what most artists like her would start out with. That's artists not quite sure about their good and bad material. Listen very carefully. Lucinda has no bad material. If she wanted to do a concert of just her, no instruments, sitting on a stool, her fans would flock to her. The power of her songs transcend any musical delivery. Owing to that, when her band kicks in on Joy and Essence and I lost it, to name a few, they take these songs into that hard-blues category that is also all Lucinda all the way through.

{"orig_index":48469,"reviewerID":"A1ZEYFM4QE1CPJ","asin":"B0007GAEIU","reviewerName":"Sakis","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"Ivy are an indie pop\/rock band based in New York. Their members are French accented singer Dominique Durand who has a soft velvety voice and New Yorker rockers Adam Schlesinger (of Fountains of Wayne) and Andy Chase (of Brookville). If you saw the movie \"Shallow Hal\" chances are you heard their pop songs throughout the film. In The Clear is their latest recording and it is their most polished release to date. Ivy have a talent for mixing upbeat rock tracks with sensitive bittersweet pop melodies. Their music this time around is comprised of more drums and louder dominant guitars, giving the album a more Live sound and less moody vibe than say their previous more electronic oriented album Long Distance. The tempo is also faster and more energetic this time around similar to their covers album Guestroom. If one tried to compare their songs to any other bands, the closer they could come up with would be Saint Etienne, The Cardigans and tempo-wise The Cure mixed all together. Sophisticated carefree itunes with an undercurrent about troubled relationships make up their repertoire. It's a well produced album from beginning to send with the tempo getting a bit mellower in the send. The album starts off with a sonic & starry piece called \"Nothing But The Sky\" where Dominique's vocals just float dreamily along the soft guitar & keyboard sounds. Next up is the album's first single \"Thinking About You\" a fast paced rock song that has a strong retro quality to it, a bit like a bouncy sixties song, that is followed by Disco infused \"Keep Moving\", a song that combines a subtle disco-dance tune along with more retro rock sounds. Similarly \"I've got you memorized\" combines these disco electronic elements with cloud electric guitars blending in and out of the song. What really binds everything together so effortless is the simple using along lyrics and Dominique's sweet accented singing style, she's just perfect for these compositions. Not dramatic, not overpowering, but rather breathy, softly cool and confident. \"Corner Of Your Mind\" a hyper party rock song blended with sweet pop that just does't get any better than this. The bloodier songs in this album are the real stunners, their lyrics express a feeling of uncertainty and longing. On \"Four In The Morning\" for example, a track that should win you from just one listen, the lyrics speak for themselves, \"Four in the morning and I got that feeling, clocks sticking but my heart's not sticking, eyes open and I'm staring at the ceiling, tell me that you'll leave and give me something to believe in\", making this quintessentially an insomniac's anthem and the deepest song in the album. \"Ocean City Girl\" has a main character that is fading in the ocean and the scenery where the sleepy vocals and the soft sounds bring to the surface the sense of tranquility and longing the song is expressing. Similarly \"Feel So Free\" is all about escape and freedom, with a chorus and acoustic guitars mixing with relaxed soft indie rock sounds. It's hard to categorize Ivy, one moment they are a pop band with one track, then a rock band with another, then more electronic for acoustic, but what matters is that they produce amazing pop songs and memorable melodies and they are one of the best Indie bands to come out of New York. Sexy, sophisticated, bittersweet and well-produced hairy songs that blur the lines of rock and pop and should delight fans of good pop music, they definitely should't go unnoticed. Give them a spin and discover for yourselves one of pop music's most underrated and talented bands.","overall":5,"summary":"a true breath of fresh air in this stale musical landscape","unixReviewTime":1146960000,"reviewTime":"05 7, 2006"}

With Ian Gillan and Roger Glover out of the band, Deep Purple were at a crossroads when the then unknown singer David Coverdale and Trapeze's singer\/bass player Glenn Hughes came on board. Little they knew when they went back to Montreux in November one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three to record their new album that this new line-up would yield such a brilliant masterpiece which would rank up there with Machine Head. Definitely more varied than their previous efforts, Deep Purple managed to reinvent themselves in the process. Burn covers quite a lot more ground and still sounds alive and fresh. The sharing of vocals by Coverdale and Hughes is amazing to say the least; Ian Paice's drums are impressively solid and creative throughout; Jon Lord throws a lot of colours and textures into the songs while Ritchie Blackmore truly shines. All tracks from the opening of Burn to the ending of \"A\" two hundred are absolute winners and the addition of the great instrumental piece Coronarias Redig on this excellent remastered and expanded edition makes it even more worthwhile.

Secret Machines have been one of the best bands of the New York scene. It's always been about the music and the live shows. They have done many successful tours and have released a few records in their six-year history. Some of the heaviness of their first album is gone. Now we have some cool guitar riffs and magical sounds. This album is more about songwriting and stories. Many of the songs are about alienation and loss, such as in the slow ballad opener \"Alone, Jealous and Stoned.\" One of their best songs never is \"Lightning Blue Eyes.\" This hot rocker is just blistering and moving. \"Daddy's In The Doldrums\" reminds of their obsession with Led Zeppelin, and also German rock. Another highlight is \"I hate Pretending.\" It has interesting rhythm and memorable lyrics. \"Faded Lines\" reminds me of some of their early songs. Not many songs on this album go over five minutes. These songs are tight. \"I Want To Know\" is more like glam rock. Overall a really great record. This is one of the best albums of the year so far. Secret Machines are a major act.","overall":5,"summary":"This is major, people","unixReviewTime":1149984000,"reviewTime":"06 11, 2006"}

Not at all unsurprisingly Thom Yorke's solo album sounds more than a good deal like Radiohead. This is made even more so when the fact comes to light that a lot of the backing tracks were composed from recordings done by him and this fellow bandmates over the years. So. somewhat needless to say, yes, fans of Radiohead you will discover much to love about The Eraser. Simply imagine a totally stripped down but no less atmospheric Radiohead. The hairiness provides more space for this unmistakable voice to drift about in its characteristic haunting expressiveness. With the vaporous electronics beneath him creating the ideal bed for this voice to soar over. And this is Yorke singing in this most emotive and compelling style minus the whining which was prevalent on lots of the first few Radiohead outings. Highlights include the fourth song \"Black Swan\" which suggests a nod to CAN and the sixth \"Atoms For Peace\" which finds Yorke looking forward with open eyes.

Old school wrap used to really talk about issues in the community, in politics, and with substance, so on the song \"Old School,\" Lyfe Jennings represents. Lyfe sings about the shame in people blowing up kids in buildings, credit card debt, gas prices going up, and issues that grown-ups trying to make it go through, and then there comes Snoop. For the life of me, I don't understand the appeal of this dude's wrapping. If you ask him to create a freestyle without spelling this name and calling women out of their names, the'd barely have anything to talk about, and it bothers me because in interviews, Snoop seems like a really intelligent dude. However, did the even LISTEN to \"Old School\" before the did this freestyle? Snoop ruined the whole song talking about how valuable this car is, how somebody should't spill crumbs in it, and volunteering to offer weed. Ugh! That really irritates me to dumb down an intelligent song like \"Old School\" with a bunch of nonsense. Lyfe, please look at somebody like Lupe Fiasco, Nas, Kanye West, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, for Rakim (where is the? I miss Rakim!) the next time you want to make a song like this. Pros: Minus Snoop, I really enjoyed the imagery with \"Old School.\" Not only did it make me hungry, but I sincerely appreciate artists who hit on relevant issues. Lyfe has such a beautiful and vulnerable voice. The entire album talked about some strong topics (ex. being tested for HIV\/AIDS, the economy, religion, looking past the exterior of a person, poverty versus being spoiled, love and lust). I've seen Lyfe perform live at the Taste of Chicago, and although the can carry a concert as well as a CD all on this own, I can't be mad at him for putting impressive lyricist T. I. and one of my favourite emcees Wyclef on this CD, who stuck to the theme of the song. Lyfe is already an attractive man, so when the makes songs directed to the ladies, there's an automatic smile on my face. It does't feel like the's gaming women for insulting them, and the gruff charisma in this style makes songs like \"It's Real\" even better. I turned that song way up, and it is officially my favourite: Boom boom chicks boom! The baby voice chorus was entertaining, but what I respected was him making a catchy song with a deeper purpose (being weary of your sexual activity). I'm SO glad the came to the music scene! Listening to him using puts me in an excellent mood. For anybody who has not seen Lyfe live, please check him out. He had hundreds of people swaying back and forth and singing along to this every word, and Lyfe has not been out for a long time, so to do this is incredible. Couples were staring at each other all googly-eyed. Lyfe reminds me of a family picnic: comfortable and familiar.","overall":5,"summary":"4 1\/2 Stars, Not 5 Because of Snoop","unixReviewTime":1210550400,"reviewTime":"05 12, 2008"}

Colbie Caillat) and 'Love Story', mostly slow songs. 'White Horse' is right behind.'Hey Stephen' is also a good song. It's very cute because of the \"mm hmm hmm hmm\"'s in the song. Like Taylor could just heat the boy up for dessert.'Fearless' is also a subdued highlight. I did't really notice it much when I first got the album about two weeks ago. But now I like it a lot.'Fifteen', 'You Belong With Me' both singles, 'The Way I Loved You' (with its playful way with words in the verses and during the bridge) and 'Forever & Always' are also all good tracks. The only tracks I don't care for that much are the passable 'Tell Me Why' which sounds strangely similar to her song 'Picture To Burn' fromTaylor Swiftand the unnecessarily-bad and shaky vocal of 'Change'. Besides that, this is a good collection of songs that makes a pretty good album. Taylor has made a nice album. Her songwriting is pretty good, especially for her page, her melodies are pleasant and although her voice sometimes needs work (not to mention better range) these songs are fitting for tons of children, are-teens, teens and even your adult who's willing to engage.

While I enjoyed much of this work as lead guitarist with The Beatles I was really not too sure that the could make it as a solo artist. My doubts were quickly dispelled in the late fall of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy when Harrison released this epic three LP set \"All Things Must Pass\". George Harrison's debut LP as a solo act was an immediate smash. In the years that followed I found that much to my surprise George's work as a solo artist was by far the most interesting to me of all of the Fab Four. Although there have been a couple of \"Greatest Hits\" collections issued over the years there has never really been a career overview of this multi-talented artist. In two thousand and nine, Capitol records attempts to correct that oversight with the release of \"Let It Roll: The Songs of George Harrison\". This nineteen track single disc collection presents the absolute cream of the crop of Harrison's work as a solo artist. It is a terrific disc. Now as you might expect you will find most but not all of George's hit singles including this double sided debut single \"My Sweet Lord\" of\/w \"Isn't It A Pity\" that was released in late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. The disc was a huge hit all over the world and quickly dispelled any doubts people had about George Harrison's viability as a solo act. In the meantime \"All Things Must Pass\" was also an unqualified success (according to RIAA this album has been certified sixx Platinum) and is considered by many to be one of the best albums made by any of the Beatles as a solo artist. \"Let It Roll\" also includes a couple of more tracks from \"All Things Must Pass\" including \"The Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll) and one of my all-time favourite Harrison itunes \"What Is Life\". On August one, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, George got together with a number of this celebrity friends at Madison Square Garden in New York City in a benefit concert for the refugees in the South Asian country of Bangladesh. This extraordinary concert was recorded for posterity and another three LP set was released later that same year. \"Let It Roll\" includes three tracks from this unforgettable event including \"Something\", \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Here Comes The Sun\". I had not heard these recordings in decades and had forgotten just how outstanding they were! During the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's George continued to release albums and every once in a while would come up with a hit single. Among these hits you will find \"All Those Years Ago\", \"When We Was Fab\" and the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven #one hit \"Got My Mind Set On You\" included there.\"Let It Roll\" also includes a few lesser known tracks that I had never had the opportunity to hear before. Most interesting among these is an instrumental called \"Marwa Blues\" that snagged a Grammy Award a number of years ago. As it turns out there is simply no way that you can do justice to the remarkable solo career of George Harrison in a single disc collection. Having said that \"Let It Roll: The Songs of George Harrison\" is certainly a noble attempt to do just that. The remastering job is superb and I appreciated the splendid twenty-eight page booklet that was included. It leaves you wanting to hear more! Very highly recommended!","overall":5,"summary":"The first ever career-spanning solo hits collection of this former Beatle.","unixReviewTime":1245283200,"reviewTime":"06 18, 2009"}

The band is all female and has a dark new-psychedelic sound with ethereal three part harmony vocals. A Los Angeles quartet dealing in sparse, atmospheric part rock, Warpaint originally consisted of the highly regarded screen actress Shannyn Sossamon and her sister Jenny Lee Lindberg (on drums & bass respectively), as well as Emily Kokal and Theresa Wayman on vocal and guitar. Sossamon left due to conflicts with her acting schedule and was replaced by Stella Mozgawa. There songs often establish a meandering, atmospheric guitar grooves that are a sharp contrast to the their delicate otherworldly vocal arrangements. Unfortunately \"The Fool\" was't released until the send of October, so this worthy album was't included on the notable two thousand and ten music lists of many cultural opinion makers. \"The Fool\" did make the Top ten Albums of two thousand and ten at my own humble music blog at the Music Banter forum. NPR also gave \"The Fool\" an honorable mention on it's year send summary. You may also want to check out Warpaint's earlier self produced EP, \"Exquisite Corpse\" which contains the spellbinding song \"Billie Holiday\" which is my favourite Warpaint song to date. I've been told that \"The Fool\" does't quite capture the power of their mesmerizing live performances, so I'll have to buy the ticket and check this band out when and if they make a tour stop in my town. Meanwhile, I can't say enough good things about Warpaint's debut album on Rough Trade. I've played it constantly on my WMP jukebox and Zune portable player over the past two months.

They dominated for much of the early eightys. After \"Big Thing\" I lost interest skipping entirely \"Astronaunt\" and \"Red Carpet Massacre\" fearing their glory days were behind them. This is the return we privately hoped but never imagined. What an album! Listen to the tracks. What comes to mind is that classic Duran sound - hypnotic, lyrical and highly infectious, but with a twist. They have are-invented themselves for the next generation while still being table to capture the hearts & minds of their original fanbase. Hear \"Being Followed\" and notice the background guitar riff from \"New Religion\" echoed. \"Girl Panic,\" the next single is today's answer to \"Girls on Film\". \"Other People's Lives\" evokes the same emotional response as \"Careless Memories.\"What makes the album is the inclusion of female vocalists Ana Matronic on \"Safe\" and Kelis on \"The Man who stole a Leopard\" (This will be there biggest hit to date!) Mark Ronson as Producer has brought the best out of them. Get the DELUXE VERSION FOR TWO REASONS: one - The bonus track \"Networker Nation\" holds its own. two - The DVD. Not only do you get the video for the first single (which is my least favourite track) but it has a song by song video commentary of how each track was created, the inspirations etc and other features like an interview of Mark Ronson and Clunie Reid the up and coming visual artist who did the cover. You get to appreciate how truly musically gifted they are! The booklet includes full lyrics, printed on high quality paper and embossed cd cover deliver the final touches to this cd which you will be playing for the rest of this year and beyond. NOTE: There are two other Deluxe Versions. One being sold by an American retailer featuring two extra tracks: \"Too Close to the Sun\" and \"Early Summer Nerves.\" The other by a online British retailer that includes a second cd with three remixes of \"All You need is now.\"","overall":5,"summary":"Rio for the 21st century: a Return to Superstardom.","unixReviewTime":1300924800,"reviewTime":"03 24, 2011"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"It was going to have to happen sooner for later. What apparently happened was two LA jingle writers Ryan Merchant and Sebu Simonian met each other via Craigslist. Today the most common ways for many creative minds to meet is via some form of online social media. I am not exactly sure if I am correct, but upon hearing this album there are some possibilities as to the origins of their musical style. Jingle writers have, as far as I've known, usually have a number of synthesizers and musical computers at their disposal-common today for making promo commercial music. Also much of that music somehow ends up being based either in boogie funk for eighty's new wave. Intended obviously as a gimmick in those cases, these two seem to have found a way to allow this ethic to blossom into an authentic part.\"Safe And Sound\" is the hit and, very much in the flavor of the more musically spare \"Patience Gets Us Northwest Fast\" and \"I Sold My Bed But Not My Stereo\" are very much in the synth dance\/new wave vein somewhere between Human League and early Prince in orientation. \"Kangaroo Court\",\"Center Stage\",\"Chartreuse\",\"Origami\" and \"Tell Me How To Live\" are all equally excellent songs-all wonderfully melodic boogie\/post disco funk revivalism with a few important electro-pop touches. \"Farrah Fawcett Hair\" brings in Andre three thousand for a heavy funk jam that features NPR announcer Frank Tavares speaking about \"listing toBitches Brewas recorded by Miles Davis and the joys of Michael Jackson'sThriller. \"Lazy Lies\" has a very spare, organ type backdrop with an almost psychedelic soul flavor about it whereas 'Chasing You\", with guest vocalist Soseh has an uptempo seventy's soul\/pop flavor. The album ends with \"Love Away\", a harmonically unique pop\/funk number with some inventive use of modern synthesizers. Musically this album totally revels in its appreciation of the eighty's boogie\/post disco musical arena. Very much in the spirit of France's Daft Punk though, these two very spiritedly revel in their genuine interest in eighty's pop culture. They focus on their love of funk, soul, disco and all of its various hybrids during that era. And with their mixture of a bass\/guitar oriented funky rhythm section with modern electronics, they really go far with their intent to explore new directions with a music that (in its time) may have been cut off a bit at the knees. The send result is likely to be one of the funkiest albums of the year. that your liable to find in the pop\/rock area of a website for record store.","overall":5,"summary":"A Dynamically Funky Duo People Should Be Pay Attention To","unixReviewTime":1377302400,"reviewTime":"08 24, 2013"}
