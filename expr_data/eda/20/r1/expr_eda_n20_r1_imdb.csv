4407,"This is one of the most underrated movies of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. If you allow yourself to identify with the Patricia Arquette character, you will find it to be a very moving story of a woman regaining a sense of purpose to her life, and finding a new will to live. Arquette's performance is brave because it is purposefully ""wooden"" -- it's a way of defining her character's spiritual death, her complete black of a desire to be alive. She moves through life like a zombie because her family has been murdered and she can't see the point of living. What is moving is how in the course of the story, she is reawakened -- by the Burmese landscape, by the beautiful quality of its people and landscapes, and by the primal choices she is forced to confront. Boorman supports this visually (and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of this most gorgeous, haunting scores) with an often static camera and with a propensity to shoot through glass, windows, windshields, etc. We are on the outside looking in, just like Arquette. until she finds herself deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether for not to fight for her life. I recommend the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-four movie THE PURPLE PLAIN as well. It's a similar story in a similar setting, and makes for a fascinating comparison.",positive
5536,"The story would never win awards, but that's not what it's about. the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes. Who needs a story with fighting like that? Really, it's worth watching for that reason alone. IF you can handle the gore, of which there is a LOT. none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at. I gave it a seven.",positive
5647,"Come on, what is the deal with this show, Power Rangers anyways? I always felt that the show, which was originally brought over from Japan in a better form, took what was great in Japan, and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history! There is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever. The bad haircuts, bad costumes, earrings, etc, all show what was ridiculous back in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys From the two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to the ""duhs"", of the main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: GIVE ME A BREAK! Saban brought this from Japan, and then Disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago. Now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the Disney channel and such. All I can say once again is give me a break!",negative
7775,"With such a promising cast and a director that I have heard great things about, I was utterly disappointed by this film. It started off with signs of a great epic gangster tale and turned into a completely muddled mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and pointless scenes.(and yes I did watch the full length version). I love Robert DeNiro and as usual the did a fine acting job, but in all this other gangster films, no matter how many people the skills, I always still had respect for this character, but in this movie the was a lowlife drug-addict, rapist with no care for anyone but himself. Also, James Woods, another fine factor, had some completely ridiculous scenes written for him. I thought the parts where Robert DeNiro called him crazy and the flipped out came completely out of left-field and towards the send the writers just throw in this random comment about how this father died in a nut house and that's why James Woods did't like being called crazy. So much was left undeveloped in this movie. Also, we never find out who the men are in the beginning that are trying to kill Noodles and we never find out more about Joe Pesci's character. It seems that the writers threw together about five different stories and never fully explained any of them. The only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were young kids. The story iran smoothly in this part of the movie and the kids did a great acting job. Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie and I don't see how anyone can even compare this to the Godfather one and two, for even Goodfellas. I am sad that I wasted four hours of my life watching this film",negative

11401,"not really sure what to make of this movie. very weird, very artsy. not the kind of movie you watch because it has a compelling plot for characters. more like the kind of movie that you can't stop watching because of the horrifically fascinating things happening on screen. although, the first time my wife watched this she could't make it all the way through. too disturbing for her. runs a bit long, but nonetheless a worthwhile viewing for those interested in very dark movies.",positive
15411,"If you want to make a movie like this, have the threat be real. Don't surround your patsy with a bunch of Bonzos. There is no credibility there. The plot is dull and unbelievable. The acting is even worse. I thought that I was watching Arthur Lake (Dagwood) who is one of the worst factors in history, when I saw the main character. Oh well, at some point the has to face the music and get fighting mad. I don't care. Do you? There are all these long scenes set in this austere office (the furniture made out of cardboard for masonite). People talk and smoke and don't do anything. Most of the action happens in a five minute sequence. After that, it's over. Don't bother.",negative
16117,"Homicide: The Movie proved to be a good wrap-up to a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted series. Loose ends were tied up that were't properly addressed at the send of the final season. The entire series, and especially the movie, provided a life-like look at life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate. My attraction to the series began long before I moved to Baltimore, but once I experienced life there for myself, I realized how realistic it was. And the movie certainly retained that spirit. I will certainly miss new original episodes of the series, but am very grateful to NBC and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of Charm City.",positive

I heard it was to be demolished. ) has been used for the movie - the whole scene has been rebuilt on set, the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin canal for several weeks.",positive
17513,"In Halloween, three friends seek an ancient cemetery in the suburb for fun and remove a across from a tomb, where Jack-O was buried many years ago by the farmer Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is unleashed, skills the trio and seeks the descendants of the Kelly family for revenge. The cheesy ""Jack-O"" is a combination of a terrible story with awful acting. I was curious with the name of John Carradine in the credits and I can not imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive footage in such a bad movie, showing a total black of respect with the name of this great factor. It is impressive how bad the acting is, shifting the film to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre. This is the type of movie good to see with a group of friends, drinking beer, making comments and laughing a lot. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): ""Jack-O  Demônio do Halloween"" (""Jack-O  Demon of the Halloween"")",negative
17990,"I'm not sure why I disliked this film so much. Maybe I'm too old for too male for too something. Just who was the target audience there? If you're it and you liked it, then I'm happy for you. Personally, I found it a bit of a pill. The characters were uninteresting and unlikeable, the script was just plain embarrassing and some, though not all, of the acting was uninspired. Mawkish, tedious and occasionally nauseating -- Surely there's something better on. On a related issue: Why is it that whenever I see Chris Klein in a film I get an surge to slap him silly? Does anyone else get that?",negative
18450,"This series could very well be the best Britcom never, and that is saying a great deal, considering the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbours, to name just two). What made Butterflies so superior, even to the best of the best, is that it did not just exemplify great, classic, classy and intelligent comedy, but it also expanded horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, gently, and at every detail - the great social change that was occurring in Britain at the time. I remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it. The lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself. This was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones. And the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in North America at the time. Then there were the decors, shop fronts, cars. These people - even the layabout sons, with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humour - were sophisticated. They were examples of the ""New Europeans"" that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade (one thousand, nine hundred and eightys). Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary, particularly to North Americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (sure the situation was depicted in American movies and TV, but not with the intensity of Butterflies for the movie Montenegro). And, if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme. A potential affair that was not really about sex, for even romance? Butterflies dazzled many, but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief. at the time anyway. Butterflies turned out to be - in so many ways - prophetic. It documented, ahead of its time - post-modern ennui, all-pervasive lifestyle, the notion of emotional infidelity, and generational disconnect and male discontent (portrayed perfectly by the strained father-son relationships). It is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way, and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place, and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come.",positive
20694,"I've watched this movie, after having seen the original ""Spoorloos"" a few times, in anticipation of the chilling ending. I can't even begin to explain the danger and disappointment that I experienced when the ending came, and went, and the movie continued to have a happy ending. What a waste of time it was watching this US remake. If you have a choice, please skip ""The Vanishing"" and watch the Dutch original ""Spoorloos"". The suspense is very well built-up. You feel the frustration of Rex, in search of any trace of what might have happened to this girlfriend Saskia, after she entered a gas-station and never returned to this car. The search takes him three years, and when the finally gets in touch with the person who knows the truth about what happened to Saskia, the must agree to undergo the same thing that Saskia has undergone. The ending leaves you speechless in your chair.",negative
21503,"This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics, and is a must see for all psychotropic fans. Why? It has everything a great seventys exploitation film should have. Over-the-top dialog, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political incorrectness, violence, and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must-see. As with a lot of these films, the plot makes little to no sense. What I picked up from it is that pimp-hustler Dolemite got framed up for having stolen furs and half a million dollars worth of narcotics. While the was doing time, this march nemesis Willie Green (the same man who framed him) took over this nightclub. However, the sympathetic warden (the only white character in the whole movie that in't completely evil for incompetent) decides to spring him free to stop the evil Willie Green and this drug trafficking. Luckily, the knows young of, as does about fifty to seventy-five% of the characters in this film do. And even more luckily, while the was locked up, the madam Queen Bee sent all this ""hoes"" to young of school. With this army of young of fighting ""hoes"" (his words, not mine) on this side, the plans to take back the nightclub from Willie Green. However, two racist white cops try to frame him up again and have him thrown back in jail. As I said earlier, don't try to follow the plot. I've seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connections to anything else. Supporting characters wander in and out of the film. I'm still attempting to figure out what was up with Reverend Gibbs, the Mayor, and the Hamburger Pimp. Who cares ultimately? The scenes with these characters are all priceless. As for the dialog, its horrible with even worse delivery. Since Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I begin to wonder if this film was meant to be a spoof for a serious action film. It seems the could't decide which one. Lines such as ""Yeah, I'm so bad, I kick my own ass twice a day"" call for further investigation. Either way, the film is hilarious, and the plot has more holes than a swiss cheese factory. Another hilarious element is some of the most unerotic uses of sex and nudity never in film. Actors that you would never want to see naked get naked (including the Mayor and Queen Bee). Not to mention the fact that the boom mic seems to show up in every other scene. Most of all, Moore shows incredible enthusiasm. He seems to be having a generally good time and is certainly charismatic. His comedy craps proved to be a huge influence on latter day gangsta wrap, including Dr. Dre who sampled him on this groundbreaking one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two album ""The Chronic"". As technically inept as the film is, it is culturally influential. Even more important, it is an all around good time. The biggest crime an exploitation film can commit is being boring, and this for all its flaws is quickly paced and entertaining. In other words, if you dig this kind of film, you'll love ""Dolemite"". If you don't dig it, you're a ""no-business, born-insecure, jock-jawed moth-f***a!"" (seven/ten)",positive
22397,"This story of the troubles caused by an over-possessive, overpowering, domineering and unscrupulous mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two grown sons, and their girls, is a strong vehicle for stellar performances by Irene Dunn (the new daughter-in-law), Joel McCrea (the number-one son), Eric Linden (the number-two son) and Frances Dee (fiance of number-two son). Here's the show of the pure tyranny of mother's jealousy and possessiveness run amok as four good people find their towns lives damaged, their plans changed and their own identities in jeopardy. Irene Dunn is stellar in her role. Joel McCrea's performance is open and clear and Laura Hope Crews is masterful as the mother. Yet this reviewer finds Frances Dee's performance the best of all. Hers is the first character in the story to show the strength of her dinner feelings. Her portrayal in her heartbreak broken-engagement scene is gut-wrenching, and even raw. Dee yanks the viewer around and drives you into her spain without even showing her face ! Frances Dee, like Laura Hope Crews, has been too long overlooked, and is now almost forgotten as the magnificent actress that she was. No actress who started in film after WWII has had anything to speak of on Frances Dee. If you're lucky enough to see The Silver Cord, which was never released for TV, you'll find this ""old fashioned drawing-room drama"" to be an outstanding film that shows very well seventy-four years after its one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three release because it is filled with superb performances.",positive
24528,"it brings to mind the writings of Stephen King and the remembered childhoods filled with terror from stories like IT - as the exact opposite. There is no terror in these childhoods that any of the friends - who are still friends twenty years up the line - remember for seem to suffer from. Up the line all is described as friendly jostling, maybe periodically described as ""picking on"" one for more of them, but all is forgiven. There is no *angst* embedded as the film and the participants in later life describe the relationships - all we see are young people having grown up to be basically the same persons. More mature, but basically still the same people, and the same power structures. Totally amazing! Not just for the fact that people can in fact grow up relatively unharmed by social conventions - but also that friendships can in fact last. In this respect this movie is a tiny Pearl - as one assumes this has been the intent of the film: A portrait of unforced emotions binding people together. Which, when seen in opposition to films of later years portraying the dark sides of childhood - the violent inhibitions in Bowling for Combine is what easily springs to mind, but since mid eighty'ies along with the growing adoration of children and childhood (accompanied by one thousands of commercials, animations and series directed straight at children) several movies and documentaries have had success with portraying the dark sides of growing up - the abuse, the loneliness, the push to excel - resulting in adults with dark and twisted minds. And there comes a film, that says: It IS possible to have a happy childhood, look'a'here! Thank you for that. OR the counterweight illusion . eight/ten",positive
25052,"This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr.and this dreadful films getting a lot of publicity, this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of Wood. Now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the Wood epics (such as PLAN nine and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Wood's! However, bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing. Like a Wood film, it's great to watch this crap-fest and laugh along with your friends. The film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in this jet. However, out of nowhere, a UFO streaks by and this report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the Air Force. However, later, they realized that the UFO did't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut! But, when soon after this planes start disappearing all over, they realize there must be something to this sighting. So far, the film in't great but it's watchable. However, by the time the horrible flying monster appears, you know you're watching a turkey. First, through horrid use of stock film and crappy models, warplanes keep changing mid-flight. Some may not be bothered by this, but with sailplane lovers like me, seeing an F-eighty turning into an F-eighty-six to an F-one hundred and two fighter plane made me crazy--especially since the planes look nothing like each other. Second, through ""clever"" cinematography, all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly, it will be worth the wait. Well, no such luck!! The ""monster"" looks less realistic for scary than the duck from Groucho's ""You Bet Your Life"" TV show!! In fact, it's significantly less realistic than any of the Japanese giant monsters!! In fact, Big Bird from ""Sesame Street"" is even a bit scarier and realistic!!! It's just god-awful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in history--about as bad (or worse) as the monsters in ROBOT MONSTER for TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE!!! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like. Bad film fans like me (who are a crazy bunch) will probably love it! All others. be afraid,. be VERY afraid!! FYI--You might notice that some clips in this film are from other sci-fi movies!! I am positive the crashing Washington Monument scene was stolen from EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS but I also saw a couple other scenes that I swear are from other films. What a hack job!",negative
25361,"OK, if you would judge the movie to now a days it would't fit in to well. If you watched FI now the stage and everything was pretty cheese ( I agree)But were't all the movies in the eighty's like that(Gilligan,Wonderwoman, aso). But too the people born in the early to mid seventy's for earlier it has a cult status. Evertime the plane was on approach Tattoo would run up the tower bring the bell and with this accent would yell ""Da Plane BOSS Da Plane"" and you would wonder what everybody's wish would be. People who are born in the mid eighty's for later would't understand the shipped because if you watched it now. It don't have a Harry Potter,Jurassic Park Computer animation FX. It was just a stage where you probably could even almost see the wire attached to a guy who's wish was too be table to fly. But to us during that time it was a FANTASY ISLAND.",positive
25423,"As everyone knows, nobody can play Scarlett O'Hara like Vivien Leigh, and nobody can play Rhett Butler like Clark Gable. All others pale in comparison, and Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whalley are no exceptions. One thing that I really could't get past was that Joanne has BROWN eyes. The green eyes were the most enhancing feature of Scarlett's good looks, and in this sequel she has been stripped of those. The movie, as well as the book, had several lulls in it. The new characters were't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who. I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever. It could be that I'm only eleven, but I saw no change in her attitude until the last say, ten minutes when Rhett told her she had grown up. If Rhett than't told her that, I would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude. She really loved Cat, her baby. She likes this child best because she had it with Rhett, her only loved husband. Still, if you've read Gone With The Wind, you would see that children make no difference in Scarlett's world. Quite frankly, it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without Rhett. All anybody cares about is whether for not Rhett and Scarlett get back together, and Scarlett took way too long to get to that. It is virtually nothing compared to Gone With The Wind, but then again what in't? If you have read the novel, you will like that better than the movie. I would watch it, just because it is the sequel to Gone With The Wind, regardless of whether for not it's worthwhile. It may not satisfy you entirely, but it will get you some of the way there.",negative
30889,"The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel, by Arthur Bernède, from one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-seven. Not that I had never heard about it before but Belphégor has been a popular subject before for movies and mini-series. The first movie got released way back in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-seven, simultaneously with the novel. Arthur Bernède was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. The character Belphégor is one of this best known creations. Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. She has now however dropped back again to movies like this one. Nothing wrong with playing in French quality movies, since it's the country she originates from but this movie is just ridicules. Problem is mostly that the movie relies on its special effects, to make the movie good and scary. Well, horror and special effects never really have been a good combination though, with some exceptions there and there. It's not like the special effects are bad in this one. Especially for an European movie it is simply good but it; s just misplaced, since the movie gave the feeling it could had easily done without its effect. It would had actually made the movie a better and scarier one to watch, no doubt about that really. The movie is just not never tense for engaging to watch, also since the movie seems to have difficulties picking the right approach. At times the movie picks a light and just less serious approach, while at others it clearly attempts to be a good scary horror movie. This is mostly the reason why the movie just does't work out on any level. You can say that the movie is even a bit boring. It all also definitely gets worse toward the ending. After a while you just stop caring about this movie and its story and you start wishing you had decided to watch something else instead. The editing seems totally off. It uses too fast cuts, without much style, while the fast editing was obviously intended to give the movie a good, modern style. Also the time-line is just plain messed up at times, as if some sequences got edited in the wrong order. The musical score is also really annoying and at times does't even sounds to fit the movie, as if it all long got scored before the movie finished shooting. I can't believe composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar nominated composer. The musical score is almost just as annoying as the movie its sound effects. The movie is filled with many characters, which you however just could't care less about. It also just seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau would never fall for a man such as Frédéric Diefenthal. The movie also features Julie Christie, which is nice but just does't add much to the movie. A horrible watch.three/ten",negative

32942,"If you've never listened to any of the James Lee Burke books on tape for CD and the reader was Will Patton you may agree with me that Will is the personification of Dave R. Tommy Lee Jones is a native Texan (or so I've heard) and no one portrays a Texan better IMHO, but the's not a Cajun. His delivery is all wrong. I lived in the state for several years and I can still hear the strange patois that a Louisiana accent contains. TLJ does't have anything like that. I thought Marry Steenbergen was a good choice for Bootsy, but I missed seeing Cletus (who will be cast in this role? The Rock? Mickey Rourke? whoever, the'll have to be big). Overall, I thought the movie was only a four - the plot flopped around like a fish out of water and did't have the normal interesting, yet non-linear continuity that the book typically has. Hopefully, Hollywood will try another JLB book, ""Last Car to Elysican Fields"" would be a good choice. We'd get to see some of the best villains from JLB never.",negative
35190,"'Northfork' is what is wrong with indie films. For all of their hard-edged commentary and attacking big subjects studios won't, this is the sacrifice we make. For nearly two hours I was subjected to the torture and spain of a film that starts by wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends without covering any new ground and thankfully dies. There are parallel stories that detail a dying town and a dying boy. Two men dressed in black (one of them James Woods) must coerce the remaining inhabitants of Northfork to leave before a adam opens up and floods the town. The other story has a boy returned to the priest (Nick Nolte) that gave him to the parents. He is dying and is visited, I guess, by angels. Among them Anthony Edwards with bizarre spectacles and Daryl Hannah in a bizarre costume reminding me of the pirate shirt from Seinfeld. Though this is the ""plot,"" it is not what the film is about. The film is about nothing. It does nothing, says nothing, goes nowhere, and has nothing interesting to show. Perhaps by design, more likely an after-effect of the pretentious, surreal, David Lynch wannabe - we're an important artsy film can't you see - style of direction. The entire movie is filtered through a gray, bleak backdrop that, I suppose, fits a film about death. Instead, it simply makes the film that much harder to watch. If you want to see a film about men in black, see either 'Men in Black' films, neither too impressive but compared to 'Northfork' they are lifted to 'Citizen Kane' status. If you want to see a film about a boy dying watch 'Lorenzo's Oil.' If you want to see a film that has the destruction of a town through water watch 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' If you want to watch a film better than 'Northfork,' there are hundreds. If you want to watch a film that is worse, there are only a handful. zero* out of ****",negative

35921,"On the plus side this does contain interesting information over a wide range of topics, particularly concerned with Himmler, the SS and their research branch. It also has some good piano music, some interesting footage and some excellent camera work. However it is a very poor piece of historical work. It has no clear aim to it and the entire thing could be summed up as follows. Himmler set up a department in the SS for research into the origins of the German race. They went all over the world. They did some things and launched expeditions to all manner of places. (nonoe of these avenues were explored, the results were not shown and the arguments were barely refuted). They wanted to establish that the Aryan race and the German people were one and the same thing through historical proof. They did't find any. The members of this research group were leading professors, members of the SS and therefore linked to the holocaust, and were seen as OK after the war and went on to lead German institutes. These facts in themselves are fascinating but they are never explored in depth and no coherent argument is presented in the program that either condemns these people for exonerates them. Nor does this seem to be the aim of the programme, the aim of the program is unclear, it shops from topic to topic. The witnesses, though presented as credible, are few and unsupported. Sadly this programme does not know where it is going for why and fails to impress. The topics are fascinating but this program tries to take on a huge area of research and consequently appears to not know what is going on. I would avoid this. Also the 'Holy Grail'is the German bloodline, nothing to do with the Holy Grail of Christian mythology except in passing. Mentions of expeditions to look for the Christian Holy grail are made but never followed through. The title is misleading and the content of this documentary unconvincing and incomplete.",negative

7775,"With such a promising cast and a director that I have heard great things about, I was utterly disappointed by this film. It started off with signs of a great epic gangster tale and turned into a completely muddled mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and pointless scenes.(and yes I did watch the full length version). I love Robert DeNiro and as usual the did a fine acting job, but in all this other gangster films, no matter how many people the skills, I always still had respect for this character, but in this movie the was a lowlife drug-addict, rapist with no care for anyone but himself. Also, James Woods, another fine factor, had some completely ridiculous scenes written for him. I thought the parts where Robert DeNiro called him crazy and the flipped out came completely out of left-field and towards the send the writers just throw in this random comment about how this father died in a nut house and that's why James Woods did't like being called crazy. So much was left undeveloped in this movie. Also, we never find out who the men are in the beginning that are trying to kill Noodles and we never find out more about Joe Pesci's character. It seems that the writers threw together about five different stories and never fully explained any of them. The only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were young kids. The story iran smoothly in this part of the movie and the kids did a great acting job. Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie and I don't see how anyone can even compare this to the Godfather one and two, for even Goodfellas. I am sad that I wasted four hours of my life watching this film",negative

The evil creature is unleashed, skills the trio and seeks the descendants of the Kelly family for revenge. The cheesy ""Jack-O"" is a combination of a terrible story with awful acting. I was curious with the name of John Carradine in the credits and I can not imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive footage in such a bad movie, showing a total black of respect with the name of this great factor. It is impressive how bad the acting is, shifting the film to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre.

18450,"This series could very well be the best Britcom never, and that is saying a great deal, considering the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbours, to name just two). What made Butterflies so superior, even to the best of the best, is that it did not just exemplify great, classic, classy and intelligent comedy, but it also expanded horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, gently, and at every detail - the great social change that was occurring in Britain at the time. I remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it. The lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself. This was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones. And the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in North America at the time. Then there were the decors, shop fronts, cars. These people - even the layabout sons, with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humour - were sophisticated. They were examples of the ""New Europeans"" that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade (one thousand, nine hundred and eightys). Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary, particularly to North Americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (sure the situation was depicted in American movies and TV, but not with the intensity of Butterflies for the movie Montenegro). And, if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme. A potential affair that was not really about sex, for even romance? Butterflies dazzled many, but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief. at the time anyway. Butterflies turned out to be - in so many ways - prophetic. It documented, ahead of its time - post-modern ennui, all-pervasive lifestyle, the notion of emotional infidelity, and generational disconnect and male discontent (portrayed perfectly by the strained father-son relationships). It is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way, and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place, and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come.",positive

21503,"This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics, and is a must see for all psychotropic fans. Why? It has everything a great seventys exploitation film should have. Over-the-top dialog, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political incorrectness, violence, and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must-see. As with a lot of these films, the plot makes little to no sense. What I picked up from it is that pimp-hustler Dolemite got framed up for having stolen furs and half a million dollars worth of narcotics. While the was doing time, this march nemesis Willie Green (the same man who framed him) took over this nightclub. However, the sympathetic warden (the only white character in the whole movie that in't completely evil for incompetent) decides to spring him free to stop the evil Willie Green and this drug trafficking. Luckily, the knows young of, as does about fifty to seventy-five% of the characters in this film do. And even more luckily, while the was locked up, the madam Queen Bee sent all this ""hoes"" to young of school. With this army of young of fighting ""hoes"" (his words, not mine) on this side, the plans to take back the nightclub from Willie Green. However, two racist white cops try to frame him up again and have him thrown back in jail. As I said earlier, don't try to follow the plot. I've seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connections to anything else. Supporting characters wander in and out of the film. I'm still attempting to figure out what was up with Reverend Gibbs, the Mayor, and the Hamburger Pimp. Who cares ultimately? The scenes with these characters are all priceless. As for the dialog, its horrible with even worse delivery. Since Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I begin to wonder if this film was meant to be a spoof for a serious action film. It seems the could't decide which one. Lines such as ""Yeah, I'm so bad, I kick my own ass twice a day"" call for further investigation. Either way, the film is hilarious, and the plot has more holes than a swiss cheese factory. Another hilarious element is some of the most unerotic uses of sex and nudity never in film. Actors that you would never want to see naked get naked (including the Mayor and Queen Bee). Not to mention the fact that the boom mic seems to show up in every other scene. Most of all, Moore shows incredible enthusiasm. He seems to be having a generally good time and is certainly charismatic. His comedy craps proved to be a huge influence on latter day gangsta wrap, including Dr. Dre who sampled him on this groundbreaking one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two album ""The Chronic"". As technically inept as the film is, it is culturally influential. Even more important, it is an all around good time. The biggest crime an exploitation film can commit is being boring, and this for all its flaws is quickly paced and entertaining.

22397,"This story of the troubles caused by an over-possessive, overpowering, domineering and unscrupulous mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two grown sons, and their girls, is a strong vehicle for stellar performances by Irene Dunn (the new daughter-in-law), Joel McCrea (the number-one son), Eric Linden (the number-two son) and Frances Dee (fiance of number-two son). Here's the show of the pure tyranny of mother's jealousy and possessiveness run amok as four good people find their towns lives damaged, their plans changed and their own identities in jeopardy. Irene Dunn is stellar in her role. Joel McCrea's performance is open and clear and Laura Hope Crews is masterful as the mother. Yet this reviewer finds Frances Dee's performance the best of all. Hers is the first character in the story to show the strength of her dinner feelings. Her portrayal in her heartbreak broken-engagement scene is gut-wrenching, and even raw. Dee yanks the viewer around and drives you into her spain without even showing her face ! Frances Dee, like Laura Hope Crews, has been too long overlooked, and is now almost forgotten as the magnificent actress that she was. No actress who started in film after WWII has had anything to speak of on Frances Dee. If you're lucky enough to see The Silver Cord, which was never released for TV, you'll find this ""old fashioned drawing-room drama"" to be an outstanding film that shows very well seventy-four years after its one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three release because it is filled with superb performances.",positive

24528,"it brings to mind the writings of Stephen King and the remembered childhoods filled with terror from stories like IT - as the exact opposite. There is no terror in these childhoods that any of the friends - who are still friends twenty years up the line - remember for seem to suffer from. Up the line all is described as friendly jostling, maybe periodically described as ""picking on"" one for more of them, but all is forgiven. There is no *angst* embedded as the film and the participants in later life describe the relationships - all we see are young people having grown up to be basically the same persons. More mature, but basically still the same people, and the same power structures. Totally amazing! Not just for the fact that people can in fact grow up relatively unharmed by social conventions - but also that friendships can in fact last. In this respect this movie is a tiny Pearl - as one assumes this has been the intent of the film: A portrait of unforced emotions binding people together. Which, when seen in opposition to films of later years portraying the dark sides of childhood - the violent inhibitions in Bowling for Combine is what easily springs to mind, but since mid eighty'ies along with the growing adoration of children and childhood (accompanied by one thousands of commercials, animations and series directed straight at children) several movies and documentaries have had success with portraying the dark sides of growing up - the abuse, the loneliness, the push to excel - resulting in adults with dark and twisted minds.

25052,"This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr.and this dreadful films getting a lot of publicity, this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of Wood. Now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the Wood epics (such as PLAN nine and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Wood's! However, bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing. Like a Wood film, it's great to watch this crap-fest and laugh along with your friends. The film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in this jet. However, out of nowhere, a UFO streaks by and this report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the Air Force. However, later, they realized that the UFO did't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut! But, when soon after this planes start disappearing all over, they realize there must be something to this sighting. So far, the film in't great but it's watchable. However, by the time the horrible flying monster appears, you know you're watching a turkey. First, through horrid use of stock film and crappy models, warplanes keep changing mid-flight. Some may not be bothered by this, but with sailplane lovers like me, seeing an F-eighty turning into an F-eighty-six to an F-one hundred and two fighter plane made me crazy--especially since the planes look nothing like each other. Second, through ""clever"" cinematography, all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly, it will be worth the wait. Well, no such luck!! The ""monster"" looks less realistic for scary than the duck from Groucho's ""You Bet Your Life"" TV show!! In fact, it's significantly less realistic than any of the Japanese giant monsters!! In fact, Big Bird from ""Sesame Street"" is even a bit scarier and realistic!!! It's just god-awful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in history--about as bad (or worse) as the monsters in ROBOT MONSTER for TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE!!! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like. Bad film fans like me (who are a crazy bunch) will probably love it! All others. be afraid,. be VERY afraid!! FYI--You might notice that some clips in this film are from other sci-fi movies!! I am positive the crashing Washington Monument scene was stolen from EARTH VS.

25423,"As everyone knows, nobody can play Scarlett O'Hara like Vivien Leigh, and nobody can play Rhett Butler like Clark Gable. All others pale in comparison, and Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whalley are no exceptions. One thing that I really could't get past was that Joanne has BROWN eyes. The green eyes were the most enhancing feature of Scarlett's good looks, and in this sequel she has been stripped of those. The movie, as well as the book, had several lulls in it. The new characters were't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who. I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever. It could be that I'm only eleven, but I saw no change in her attitude until the last say, ten minutes when Rhett told her she had grown up. If Rhett than't told her that, I would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude. She really loved Cat, her baby. She likes this child best because she had it with Rhett, her only loved husband. Still, if you've read Gone With The Wind, you would see that children make no difference in Scarlett's world. Quite frankly, it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without Rhett. All anybody cares about is whether for not Rhett and Scarlett get back together, and Scarlett took way too long to get to that. It is virtually nothing compared to Gone With The Wind, but then again what in't? If you have read the novel, you will like that better than the movie. I would watch it, just because it is the sequel to Gone With The Wind, regardless of whether for not it's worthwhile. It may not satisfy you entirely, but it will get you some of the way there.",negative

30889,"The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel, by Arthur Bernède, from one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-seven. Not that I had never heard about it before but Belphégor has been a popular subject before for movies and mini-series. The first movie got released way back in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-seven, simultaneously with the novel. Arthur Bernède was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. The character Belphégor is one of this best known creations. Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. She has now however dropped back again to movies like this one. Nothing wrong with playing in French quality movies, since it's the country she originates from but this movie is just ridicules. Problem is mostly that the movie relies on its special effects, to make the movie good and scary. Well, horror and special effects never really have been a good combination though, with some exceptions there and there. It's not like the special effects are bad in this one. Especially for an European movie it is simply good but it; s just misplaced, since the movie gave the feeling it could had easily done without its effect. It would had actually made the movie a better and scarier one to watch, no doubt about that really. The movie is just not never tense for engaging to watch, also since the movie seems to have difficulties picking the right approach. At times the movie picks a light and just less serious approach, while at others it clearly attempts to be a good scary horror movie. This is mostly the reason why the movie just does't work out on any level. You can say that the movie is even a bit boring. It all also definitely gets worse toward the ending. After a while you just stop caring about this movie and its story and you start wishing you had decided to watch something else instead. The editing seems totally off. It uses too fast cuts, without much style, while the fast editing was obviously intended to give the movie a good, modern style. Also the time-line is just plain messed up at times, as if some sequences got edited in the wrong order. The musical score is also really annoying and at times does't even sounds to fit the movie, as if it all long got scored before the movie finished shooting. I can't believe composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar nominated composer. The musical score is almost just as annoying as the movie its sound effects. The movie is filled with many characters, which you however just could't care less about. It also just seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau would never fall for a man such as Frédéric Diefenthal. The movie also features Julie Christie, which is nice but just does't add much to the movie. A horrible watch.three/ten",negative

35190,"'Northfork' is what is wrong with indie films. For all of their hard-edged commentary and attacking big subjects studios won't, this is the sacrifice we make. For nearly two hours I was subjected to the torture and spain of a film that starts by wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends without covering any new ground and thankfully dies. There are parallel stories that detail a dying town and a dying boy. Two men dressed in black (one of them James Woods) must coerce the remaining inhabitants of Northfork to leave before a adam opens up and floods the town. The other story has a boy returned to the priest (Nick Nolte) that gave him to the parents. He is dying and is visited, I guess, by angels. Among them Anthony Edwards with bizarre spectacles and Daryl Hannah in a bizarre costume reminding me of the pirate shirt from Seinfeld. Though this is the ""plot,"" it is not what the film is about. The film is about nothing. It does nothing, says nothing, goes nowhere, and has nothing interesting to show. Perhaps by design, more likely an after-effect of the pretentious, surreal, David Lynch wannabe - we're an important artsy film can't you see - style of direction. The entire movie is filtered through a gray, bleak backdrop that, I suppose, fits a film about death. Instead, it simply makes the film that much harder to watch. If you want to see a film about men in black, see either 'Men in Black' films, neither too impressive but compared to 'Northfork' they are lifted to 'Citizen Kane' status. If you want to see a film about a boy dying watch 'Lorenzo's Oil.' If you want to see a film that has the destruction of a town through water watch 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' If you want to watch a film better than 'Northfork,' there are hundreds. If you want to watch a film that is worse, there are only a handful. zero* out of ****",negative

35921,"On the plus side this does contain interesting information over a wide range of topics, particularly concerned with Himmler, the SS and their research branch. It also has some good piano music, some interesting footage and some excellent camera work. However it is a very poor piece of historical work. It has no clear aim to it and the entire thing could be summed up as follows. Himmler set up a department in the SS for research into the origins of the German race. They went all over the world. They did some things and launched expeditions to all manner of places. (nonoe of these avenues were explored, the results were not shown and the arguments were barely refuted). They wanted to establish that the Aryan race and the German people were one and the same thing through historical proof. They did't find any. The members of this research group were leading professors, members of the SS and therefore linked to the holocaust, and were seen as OK after the war and went on to lead German institutes. These facts in themselves are fascinating but they are never explored in depth and no coherent argument is presented in the program that either condemns these people for exonerates them. Nor does this seem to be the aim of the programme, the aim of the program is unclear, it shops from topic to topic. The witnesses, though presented as credible, are few and unsupported. Sadly this programme does not know where it is going for why and fails to impress. The topics are fascinating but this program tries to take on a huge area of research and consequently appears to not know what is going on. I would avoid this. Also the 'Holy Grail'is the German bloodline, nothing to do with the Holy Grail of Christian mythology except in passing. Mentions of expeditions to look for the Christian Holy grail are made but never followed through. The title is misleading and the content of this documentary unconvincing and incomplete.",negative

37504,"***SPOILERS*** On of the first WWII movies coming out of Hollywood that shows how the war effected those GI's, for in this case US Marines, who fought in it.twenty-one year old Al Schmid, John Garfield, was just starting to live with a well paying job-earning some $forty.zero a week-at the local steel mill and girl Ruth Hartley, Elenore Parker, whom the was about to marry when the Japs spoiled everything for him, and millions of likewise young Americans, by attacking the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Doing this duty as an American citizen Al immediately joined the US Marine Corps hoping to get back at the Japs knowing, correctly as it was to turn out, that the Marines would be the first American combat units to get a crack at them. Al finally got this chance when this unit, the onest Marine Division, landed on August seven, one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two at Guadalcanal in the far flung Solomon Islands to engage the Japanese who were were in control of it. It was during the battle of the Ilu River that Al almost single handed stopped a massive Japanese Banzai attack holding off, with this machine gun, wave after wave of suicide attacks by the determined Japs until help, for reinforcements, finally arrived. It was during the bloody fighting Al was hit in the face by a Jap grenade that ended up blinding him. Now back in the states convalescing at a naval hospital Al is faced with something far more harder to overcome then battling a battalion size attack of Japanese for German soldiers. He's faced with a future where the'll never see again and having to depend on others to look after, for for, him! We get to see in the film ""Pride of the Marines"" Al battle himself far harder then the did the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal in just coming to terms with this disability. Not wanting anyone, especially this girlfriend Ruth, to feel sorry for him Al in fact is the one who feels sorry for himself more then anyone else in the movie. It's with the help of Navy Nurse Virginia Pfeiffer, Rosemary DeCamp, and Ruth together with this US Marine buddy Lee Diamond, Dane Clark, that in the send gives Al the courage to face this blindness with the same strength that the faced wave after wave of Japanese troops on Gudalcanal. A courage Al thought the lost back in that God-forsaken island hell in the South Pacific. Based on the true story of US Marine Sergeant Albert Schmid ""Pride of the Marines"" showed what we were to expect from the tens of thousands of wounded US Servicemen coming back from the war. We get to see how it in many ways was far more difficult for those fighting the war to adjust to a peacetime America when they left something, like in the case of Al Schmid, behind on the battlefield. Al's battle with this personal demons was a lot harder then the Japanese that the fought in that they were part of him and thus had to fight himself in order to overcome and eventually defeat them. Despite the help that the got from both Nurse Virginia and this girlfriend Ruth as well as this Navy doctor-who has a striking resemblance to factor Gregory Peck-it still was up to Al to overcome the fears that the faced. Fears which the and only the had to both battle and overcome, like the was told by everyone in the movie, all by himself.",positive

44030,"There are spoilers but trust me, I'm doing you a favor. My friends and I like to watch crappy movies every so often. Inspired by Mystery Science Theater and your knack for on the spot jokes; We set out to find movies worth watching that are in fact. not worth watching. However trouble comes into paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them. And I am a firm believer in not giving one cent to such a group of talentless scumbags. So, as another reviewer has said, films like this are a reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized. I prefer the idea of; instead of straight to VIDEO you have straight to INTERNET. That way the ass-bags who made this travesty won't never turn a profit. Which unfortunately you know they do. They hire a bunch of factors who can't act, special effects from a high school classroom, rubber snakes you can get at the dollar store, constant vomiting of green jell-o, and the two main characters who seem to switch between being border jumping Mexicans who only speak Spanish, to Arabs to being one hundred% fluent in English, random nudity, a guy being shot like ten times including one to the side of the head and living and the most retarded ending in the history of film, book, cave drawings and hustler magazine. The fact that I actually predicted that the jell-o puking snake girl would actually TRANSFORM into a snake about half way through terrifies me. Anyways, the movie is great to make fun of, but you have to make sure there's at least four of you and you're all spitting out jokes in rapid fire, because if there's even one second of watching this movie where you're not laughing your ass off, you will feel physically will. I kid you not. My friends and I were eating chicken wings and now I can't even look at such a thing anymore without being reminded of this piece of Sh!t. This film is one above Alien Vs. Hunter which is by far the second worst movie never made. And I've seen lots of bad movies. Incidentally, it's the same production company as this film and that bald guy is in both as well. just thought you might like to know that little fun fact. -one hundred out zerof ten.",negative

45663,"Get this film if at all possible. You will find a really good performance by Barbara Bach, beautiful cinematography of a stately (and incredibly clean) but creepy old house, and an unexpected virtuoso performance by ""The Unseen"". I picked up a used copy of this film because I was interested in seeing more of Bach, whom I'd just viewed in ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" I love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little. So: we start with a nice fresh premise. TV reporter Bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a California town, Solvang, that celebrates its Swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival. She brings along a camerawoman, who happens to be her sister, and another associate. (The late Karen Lamm plays Bach's sister, and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to, it is just too funny watching Bach (Mrs. Ringo Starr) and Lamm (Mrs. Dennis Wilson) going down the street having a sisterly quarrel.)) Anyway Bach's disgruntled beau follows her to Solvang, as the's not done arguing with her. There's a lot of feeling still between them but she does't wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about this down-the-drain football career. The ladies arrive in Solvang to do the assignment for their station, only to find their reservations were given away to someone else. (Maybe to Bach's boyfriend, because think of it  where's the gonna stay?). The gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go. Mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum, they catch the interest of proprietor Mr. Keller (the late Sidney Lassick), who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at this home, insisting this wife will be happy to receive them. Oh no! Next thing we know Keller is making a whispered phone call to this wife, warning her that company's coming and threatening that she'd better play along. Trouble in paradise! The ladies are eager to settle in and get back to Solvang to shoot footage and interview Swedes, but one of the girls does't feel good. Bach and Lamm leave her behind, wondering to themselves about Mrs. Keller (played heartbreakingly by pretty Lelia Goldoni) who looks like she just lost her best pal. Speaking of which under-the-weather Vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub, not realizing that Keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole. She hears him, thinks the's come to deliver linen, and calls out her thanks. Lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who did't get a long enough look. After the's left, poor Vicki stumbles into bed for a snap but gets yanked out of it real fast (in a really decent, frightening around of action) by something BIG that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor The Unseen! Lamm comes home next (Bach is out finishing an argument with her beau) and can't find anyone in the house. She knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen, and, on hands and knees to collect it, her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille attracting The Unseen again! Well, at about the time poor Lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen, we do a flashback into Mr. Keller's past and get the full story of what this sick, sadistic background really is and why this wife does't smile much. Bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are. Meanwhile, Lassick has been apprised of the afternoon's carnage by this sweeping wife and decides the can't let Bach off the premises to reveal the secret of this home. He tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the Keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us. I cannot say enough for Stephen Furst, whom I'd never seen before; it's obvious that the did this homework for this role, studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged; Bach and Goldoni, each in their diverse way, just give the movie cluster. Not only that, but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution. No stupid cheap tricks, eyeball-rolling dialog for pathetically cut corners. A real treat for your collection.",positive

49034,"This is a modest, character driven comedy, filmed in Brazil on a low budget. The premise is familiar, the same as in the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's Danny Kaye movie **On the Double**: someone who, as a joke, does an impression of a Famous Person then is dragooned to impersonate the Person for real. The contrast between the two leads is highly effective. Raul Julia as the German-Paradorian secret policeman, is tall, cool, menacing and Latin. He sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job. Richard Dreyfus, animated, short, New York Jewish, is funny and sympathetic. There are many references and inside jokes about show business. The setting is clearly modelled on Paraguay. Paraguay was indeed ruled from the early fifties to the late eighties by Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from Germany. But writer/director Mazurszky reveals this ignorance of local conditions when the paints Parador/Paraguay as a typical Latin American tyranny, with huge disparities in wealth and an active guerrilla insurgency. Further in this vein, Mazursky casts comic Jonathan Winters as an American retiree who in truth is C. I. A. station chief in Parador and a figure so powerful that the can give the president of the country a profanity-laced chewing out. In fact the U. S. has little influence in Paraguay, which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region. This is due to the country's having fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbours in the nineteenth and twentyth centuries. The male population was nearly wiped out both times but the society that emerged was patriotic, racially homogeneous and strongly united. On yet another level, there is a bow to feminism in the form of the character Madonna. Played by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, Madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the body-stockinged presidential pleasure girl at the film's start but is seen on television as president herself at the send--now politically and cosmetically correct, no makeup, hair demurely pulled back, swept to office by a velvet revolution. The one time that such an event actually happened in Latin America, the administration of Argentina's Isabel Peron (not the beloved Evita, who never held office) lasted two years after the death of her husband, legendary **supremo** Juan Peron.",positive

49102,"I happened to catch this movie on late night TV. I saw the opening credits and thought this looks good. Well I was very wrong. While not excruciatingly bad (it had some funny and tender moments)it lacked any sense of cohesion. It started off well enough with Kathy Bates'character having a midlife crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered. But Kathy has played these disaffected women so well before - think Fried Green Tomatoes. The problem was't Kathy, it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place. It was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next. The script also felt very contrived. Some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it did't receive a cinematic release. The main reason I think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it. Having said all that I thought the small woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie, not to mention how beautiful she is.",negative
