Sure, 'eighty's Top forty pop enthusiasts would probably say that about HEARTBEAT CITY (which did sell more records upon release), but real rock fans rate their debut at the top. Why? Because, just like most great rock debuts (such as BOSTON and VAN HALEN), it shows The Cars in hungry mode, pulling out all the stops to create a hard, edgy, and energetic record that was different from anything else out at the time. This band combined hard guitar-rock with a spacey keyboard-driven New Wave sound (that only then was beginning to emerge) in equal amounts, with straightforward, simple lyrics--and created a sound that was raw yet sleek, edgy but commercially accessible, and totally fresh at that time. Between Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr's similarly cool, unaffected lead vocals, Greg Hawkes' incredibly cool, futuristic keyboards, and Elliot Easton's slicing, awesome guitar-work, this album was truly unique. It influenced countless other New Wave\/rock bands afterwards. It has since stood the test of time, and that's what makes it a true classic. When I first heard THE CARS on a cassette tape twenty-two years ago, I was already quite familiar with \"Just What I Needed.\" Then, I really got hooked on \"Good Times Roll\" and \"Best Friend's Girl.\" It was't until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two that I really started liking \"You're All I've Got Tonight\" and \"Bye Bye Love.\" The following year, I got into \"I'm In Touch With Your World.\" But it has only been in the past couple of years that I have totally fallen for the medley of \"Moving In Stereo\/All Mixed Up.\" Talk about a true classic; over the years, every now and then, it's given me something new to love about it!

There are three original Guy tracks. All are great. One- title track, two- a slow moody instrumental dedicated to Stevie Ray Vaughan, three-one of Guy's best songs and captures some ferocious guitar playing for five minutes and is called Too Broke Too Spend the Night. If you wanted to, you could fit all of these songs into contemporary blues music for either lyrics for music, but only six of the ten tracks fit in a traditional sense. There's three slow blues, including the instrumental track called Rememberin' Stevie, the classic Black Night{done by Willie Nelson and Dr. John later}and also Five Long Years another classic covered in Eric Clapton's all blues album From the Cradle. I don't want insult the great musicians on this album, but you could say the only truly remarkable thing about it is Buddy himself. At this top level of playing on this record the is definitely one of the best guitar players in blues. Ups: Alot of powerful vocals. The keyboards are used perfectly, not over for underdone. Let me love you baby is a song that was written by Willie Dixon and one of the last songs Steve Vaughan covered on record and one of Buddy's best recordings. There may be possible downs there for you, though it is all great music. In my opinion the extra guitar players were almost completely unhelpful, and were needed at any rate. Of course Mark Knopfler and Eric Clapton did't take anything away but your years would have to put mine to shame to be table to distinguish them. Jeff Beck was clear but the did't do anything Guy could't do. Bottom line is that these great guitarists were just for promotion and they probably knew it. As for John Porter and Neil Hubbard who are probably in Guy's live band for studio musicians- One for both played on all tracks including the jones with the other guitarists. They were probably only there for the occasional rhythm for tiny sound effect for mimicry and really were't much help even if they did more. They maybe even taking away from Buddy at times. I can't even understand Guy using them. There were back up vocalists in three songs which is an uncommon thing in straight blues. Lastly -highly produced and slightly cluttered with people who may not have belonged. The production may bother some blues fans but did however cause some great sound through the record and did't take away from the character which Guy and the blues is known for. If you are looking for Guy at a more raw hard blues stage then get Stone Crazy which is a standard- Buddy on lead guitar and this brother Phil doing back-up work-then Bass and drums. It's simple and also one of the classic hardcore blues albums.","overall":4,"summary":"Great music","unixReviewTime":985478400,"reviewTime":"03 25, 2001"}

Yes, there are elements that are deeply sad, stark, and depressed, but I find most of the music beautiful, haunted, and beguiling. The title track is justifiably a Drake classic, and despite being used in a car commercial, I still love the song. The commercialisation of the song did't hurt the integrity of it. Drake's music is like that. It's completely in its own universe than nothing can never damage it. It's so pure and so unique. Nothing can poison it in the eyes of those who love this man's work. This is the most stripped down album Drake never did. It's just this voice, this guitar, this songwriting, and a touch of piano in the title track. That's all that's really needed. Despite the fact that this other albums have beautiful instrumentation (including appearances by Richard Thompson and John Cale), the stripped down quality of this recording really enhances it. I'm not going to say if this is my favourite Nick Drake album, but ultimately, it does't matter with him. All three of this albums are so unique and special there's no need to divide them up. They are like chapters in a book, all contributing to the greatness of the man himself.

He was from the band Thin Lizzy. \"The Boys Are Back In Town\" was one of Thin Lizzy's biggest hits. If you noticed, Thin Lizzy did't have lot of huge guitar solos with John Sykes. So, how will the fit into Whitesnake then? In the song \"Straight To The Heart\" a very fast guitar solo is present, and it shocked me. This song mos def rubbed off me lot, because of the guitar solo. It's so incredibly fast. I'm sure this also shocked Whitesnake lovers. Also, a new version of \"Here I Go Again\" came out. It was't so \"churchy\" as some of my friends say. This album has everything, and after this album was thrown out there, John Sykes left the band. So, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine comes around, just about to crack into one thousand, nine hundred and ninety. Whitesnake has a crazy guitarist named Steve Vai. He was in David Lee Roth's band, and was taught guitar by Joe Satriani who are four years apart. Steve Vai mos def does a great job. Basically, Whitesnake's self-titled debut was a huge hit, just like Boston's self-titled debut. But, it was't a debut. So, you need to go out and get it if you love classic rock\/hair metal. What a surprise John Sykes was.","overall":5,"summary":"Terrific Album","unixReviewTime":1134172800,"reviewTime":"12 10, 2005"}

Likewise, if there is one name that comes to mind when one thinks of wrap, it is Tupac Shakur. Why is this exactly? Well, when it comes to twoPac and Bruce Lee, they were untouchable, and were masters of their mediums of expression. Okay that is enough about Bruce Lee (this is supposed to be a review about a twoPac CD afterall), but I've stressed my point enough I think. But why exactly was twoPac so great a wrapper? Well, for starters this beats were always strong. A HUGE pet peeve of mine when listening to wrap is beats that sound awkward for clunky that don't mix with the wrapper's own lyrical flow. Tupac's beats always flow well with this lyrics. And speaking of lyrics, twoPac remains one of, if not the, single greatest wrap lyricist never (the only wrapper I would consider close to Tupac when it comes to lyrics is Nas, but the is always hit for miss, while I believe twoPac's skill was more consistent). His tracks range from hardcore gangsta wrap, to catchy dance hits, to thoughtful lyrics about poverty, death and politics, and even to the occasional track meant to make you laugh. twoPac was perhaps the most intelligent and energetic man to never grace the wrap genre, and all fans of wrap should already have this CD as part of their collections. However, if you are not usually a fan of wrap but you are open minded enough to try something new, I still highly recommend this album. However, those new to Tupac Shakur should probably check out this \"Greatest Hits\" Album first. It is packed with some of this best tracks and is probably a better introduction to twoPac than this CD is.","overall":5,"summary":"2Pac was to Rap as Bruce Lee was to Martial Arts","unixReviewTime":1146096000,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2006"}

Many snobbish critics\/fans dismiss the album as lightweight since it came after this more serious and bomber albums, which to them means they are just 'artistically better'. Not so. Not so at all. Elton and the music did change with this one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three release, and it was a change for the better. A necessary change. Just because something is more pop-ish and commercial friendly does't mean it in't as equally good for impeccably done as anything more 'serious'. This was't even the first album to show the changing Elton. The album before this, \"Honky Chateau\", another perfect EJ release, was the first to start the change. This new course saw more of a bounce and step in Elton's vocals and playing. The lyrics were fresher and given more room to breathe. It developed the harmonies and melody's that would become the Elton John sound. While the disc includes \"Daniel\" and \"Crocodile Rock\", two of EJ's popiest classics, the rest of the disc is not something to be discarded after knowing those two songs are on it. There is nothing but good work there. Even though they are simple little pop ditties, \"Teacher, I Need You\" and \"Elderberry Wine\", revoke a lot of fun with nice, rhythmic lyrics from Taupin, and some great piano playing from Elton. A more bomber, folk type tune called \"Blues For Baby And Me\", is a track that is one of those Elton\/Bernie itunes that should of been on radio, but was't. With string arrangement from Paul Buckmaster, it sounds like earlier Elton. \"Midnight Creeper\" is a racuos grave-up with stellar piano thumping, and a craving vocal by Elton. Traces of earlier Elton are found with the sweeping epicness of \"Have Mercy On The Criminal\", another track touched with the amazing talent of Paul Buckmaster. It also features a sweaty, frenetic piano work out from Elton. \"I'm Going To Be A Teenage Idol\", with it's entrancing piano melody, is a fun little song. The final three tracks, including \"Crocodile Rock\", are classic Elton. The first is a real twangy, country tune called \"Texan Love Song\". It has a nice melody and vocal, and the lyrics are funny, interesting, and kind of surprising in ways. The CD closer is a real stand out. Another one of those Elton\/Bernie gems that most people, who are casual listeners, haven't heard, and should. It's an overlooked gem, on an album filled with them, and showcases nice background vocals by \"the guys\", and lead vocals by Elton. It's a sweet and rousing little country-ish pop ballad to send on. Many people think of this album as the one that has the already mentioned hit songs on and nothing more. But it is so much more. It is as good as any of the classic Elton albums that came out of the seventy's, and one of my all time top favourites. It signalled a change and new direction in Elton and this sound, and it was a necessary evolution that brought out an even grander performer\/singer\/writer. While many others have claimed that the only Elton is the less glitzy one are Don't Shoot Me, others realize that great, brilliant Elton is there and like any good things, it comes in all different shapes and sizes. This is classic Elton and it's a must.","overall":5,"summary":"\"I'm Gonna Write Myself A Place In History....\"","unixReviewTime":1102723200,"reviewTime":"12 11, 2004"}

It primarily has that typical early one thousand, nine hundred and eightys New Wave to it except this album is far FAR above most of that . eightys fluff and has far more poetic lyrics. The Hurting is dark and yet daytime sounding at the same time. Basically it has an apocalyptic feel lyrically as is shone on 'Start Of The Breakdown' and 'Mad World'. The edition I'm reviewing is the remastered edition with four bonus tracks. It's hard for me to explain the tracks in detail but I can say this CD is great and is a must have for any eightys lover like myself. The term '. eightys fluff' I mentioned earlier does not necessarily mean I don't like eightys music. Contrarily I love eightys music. Just that I tend to enjoy some of the lesser known eightys hits. Hurting is much lighter and less heavy than its successor 'Songs From The Big Chair' and is much more synth pop than 'The Seeds Of Love'. It seems strange that this album is from the same band who would eventually evolve from a synth-pop group into a more soul-rock sounding group with that one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine masterpiece. This Cd had little notice there in the US when it came out in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three but it did well in England. Tears For Fears would have two year to go before setting the charts on fire in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four with 'Shout' and again in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five with EWTRTW(The name is so long I sometimes don't feeling like typing out the whole name). Unlike the bonus tracks in The Big Chair and Seeds Of Love the bonus tracks while good kind of dissapointed me a smidgen bit. The World Remix of Mad World is dead identical to the original version except with a more echoing beat. This version is still good. The other three are good to excellent. The Way You Are on there is extended to almost eight minutes long. I love the extended versions of Pale Shelter and Change. The extended version of Mad World has a less metallic beat and the beat is more flat. The version of Change is extended to six minutes for more listening pleasure. My favourite track besides the bonus tracks is 'Start Of The Breakdown'. This song is like the blueprint of what was to come on The Big Chair and this song could have fit well on that album. This CD is worth having if you love Tears For Fears but I would start with The Big Chair and The Seeds Of Love. Then I would get this one. Oh what the hell get all of TFFs albums.","overall":5,"summary":"Great kickstart for the best band in the world","unixReviewTime":1019865600,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2002"}

Alongside other real bands like Cameo, Kool & The Gang, The Brothers Johnson, Brass Construction & Skyy (just to name a couple), the Gap Band made sure we kept dancing back in the late seventys and early eightys. Lead singer Charlie Wilson, himself clearly influenced by soul legends that had preceded him, was a huge influence on many great singers that were yet to come; people like Keith Sweat, R. Kelly, Joe and all those who have followed on from them. All these guys have had huge success with Charlie's style though not one of them was as good as the original, in my opinion. That was clear to anyone who had years when Charlie appeared alongside Justin Timberlake on the recent Snoop Dogg single \"Signs\", even though this performance is often not even credited. This one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two monster was full of the good stuff. \"Early In The Morning\" (with that iconic crowing cockerel intro and its wild guitar solo) was one of my favourite itunes never and still is. \"Outstanding\" is a classic that surely needs no introduction and as for \"You Dropped A Bomb On Me\", boy. I wonder if anyone would find it possible to resist this kind of music even now? But their mid-tempo ballads were equally magnificent. \"Seasons No Reason To Change\", with its brilliant piano-led instrumental outdo & \"Stay With Me\", are both heartfelt and incredibly soulful. I also really love the flugelhorn-driven \"I Can't Get Over You\". The album was produced by Lonnie Simmonds and I feel a need to reiterate the fact that this trio of brothers were a proper band, playing live instruments - something that hardly exists anymore. They had a group of other musicians behind them, playing keyboards, synthesizers, bass, drums, percussion, horns and guitar but Charlie did't just using; the also played keyboards, synthesizer, mini-moog and percussion. Robert played the bass, lead guitar and percussion and Ronnie played keyboards, flugelhorn, synthesizer and percussion. I'm glad to finally get this on CD. My sad vinyl version is scratched beyond redemption and I've been looking for this for years. Oh, how I miss the good old days!","overall":5,"summary":"Another solid 80s classic","unixReviewTime":1205020800,"reviewTime":"03 9, 2008"}

This album only hints at this genius with this sound and the disco dancing of the time. If this was this first album, it could be seen as a potential of what came with Thriller. Anyway, this is a must for Michael Jackson fans. I have to say I was disappointed because it's not this best work but most artists don't give their best up at first. Anyway, I was troubled by the fact that my computer Itunes needed the album information such as songs and artist and album name. Also, I was disappointed because the last tracks of the compact disc (the so-called extras) did't have a name not even on the Compact disc. I know a couple of them are other versions of the same song and interviews with Quincy Jones. I found the interviews to be just bits and pieces and not explained enough for me. I still have listed as the track numbers and I wished that they did name them after the song listings.

This would obviously open him up to a big audience, but who could have thought it would long stand as the best seller of all time? In an industry ravaged by tape copying the sales there kept pop music alive near enough. The album opens with the uptempo funk pop of \"Wanna Be Starting Something\", mixture of eightys production technique and African chants all couple to make this a standout. My other album favourite would be the immortal \"Billy Jean\" in which we first see the paranoid Michael of future years. At this time the wonders if the baby is this as \"Billy\" alleges. It is a classic pop song and who could forget this Motown TV performance of it for the video?\"The Girl Is Mine\" is a title embarrassing in parts and the horror movie soaked title track \"Thriller\" does spoil the album's flow a little, but both have merit and the later's video made a massive impact. Dance tracks like \"Beat It\" (With it's Van Halen guitar solo), \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"P. Y. T\" all hit the spot and contain aspects of the feel good nature found in classic previous effort \"Off The Wall\". We also get \"The Lady In My Life\" to close out the LP and keep ballad fans happy with it's flush melody. Nothing about this album can be understated. I may prefer \"Off The Wall\" overall but this and the subsequent \"Bad\" and \"Dangerous\" are almost equally wonderful in their own ways.

He was almost completely ignored by the music-buying public of this day, even in the market this records were aimed at. Yet in the present day, the's practically the only country blues artist most people know about. On one level, this is because of relentless championing by other blues artists, not least Eric Clapton. On another level, Johnson's fame rests on the fact that the was table to write, for more properly pull together from this various mentors and influences, this songs and make them complete unto themselves. His songs have made an impact, and have been covered time and again by countless artists. That counts for something. Part of who Robert Johnson was as a singer and songwriter is obscured by this legend, which has been retold so often it borders on cliche. But even after the hype has been dismissed, this box set shows Johnson as a powerful, innovative, soulful blues man, a great performer and a great songwriter (in the context of blues songwriting) with this own unique sound. Johnson was not without this influences, and if the had lived the would have told you that himself. However, the interesting thing was that the managed to transform this influences and personalize them into this own vision of the blues, a blues that was one of the first steps away from country blues toward city blues - a vision that would eventually become Chicago blues. It has been fashionable in blues circles to put Robert Johnson down recently, and to gripe about how Johnson's influences should be as well known as the is. This is a valid point. However, Johnson became an influence himself, and as such, the still deserves a good deal of respect. This box set, which contains every recording the is known for, is a just tribute to a brilliant singer, songwriter and performer. The remastering is surprisingly good, considering the sources. Johnson's voice and guitar playing come through vividly and illustrate this wealth of talent. The only possible drawback to this box set, for the casual listener, is the number of alternate takes included. They show that Johnson was an adept performer, because a lot of the alternates are similar to the \"released\" versions. This showed that the was no closet bluesman for flash-in-the-pan, but was adept at entertaining an audience. And to this day this guitar playing is astonishingly fluid and innovative. However, the repetitiveness of the alternate takes can become trying to people who are not students of the blues, and for the casual listener a single-disc set would probably be sufficient. This box set, is, and remains, a worthy overview of a talent that received its due far too late. I would advise the listener not to be put off by people who would place Johnson's influences over him, but to listen to Johnson on this own merits. My guess is that the'll win you over, as the has generations of listeners.","overall":5,"summary":"Invaluable document of a great talent","unixReviewTime":1056240000,"reviewTime":"06 22, 2003"}

It spent weight weeks at No. one and more than a year in the Top ten. Eventually, it would spend almost three years in the Top forty! Alpert played all the trumpet parts, dubbing and overdubbing as many as four for five times.

Unfortunately, the hits did't really materialize on this second album New Masters. Cat then developed Tuberculosis and ended up with a collapsed lung. The experience proved to be a life changing one. He was released from this Deram contract and auditioned for Chris Blackwell of Island Records and secured a contract. He was then put in touch with former Yardbirds member turned record producer Paul Samwell-Smith. Paul would go on to produce most of Cat's other 'seventy's albums as well as bringing in Alun Davies. It's there that we hear Cat Stevens finding this sound with stripped down production and haunting melodies. Mona Bone Jakon was first released in July one thousand, nine hundred and seventy with the title originally going to be The Dustbin Cried The Day The Dustman Died. It was decided that the title was too long and changed to Mona Bone Jakon. The album features Cat with Alun on guitar\/backing vocals as well as John Ryan on bass and Harvey Burns on drums. Guest appearances from Peter Gabriel, Nicky Hopkins and string arrangements from Del Newman around out the personnel. This is a great album and the standouts for me are: Lady D'Arbanville, Maybe You're Right, Trouble, Katmandu, Time, Fill My Eyes and Lilywhite.","overall":5,"summary":"The Dustbin Cried The Day The Dustman Died","unixReviewTime":1373068800,"reviewTime":"07 6, 2013"}

Up until this point, Amy was mainly known for her Christian music, although she had a big pop hit in the eighty's with Peter Cetera on the song \"The Next Time I Fall In Love.\"\"Heart In Motion\" yielded five big hit singles. \"Baby Baby\" is by far the best and most memorable and a single I will forever associate with the early ninety's. It was a #one single and catchy as anything on the radio at that time. \"Every Heartbeat\" was the other monster and actually, I consider one of the weakest songs on the album. It hit #two on the charts *I'm pretty sure* and its upbeat, but just does not grab me like \"Baby Baby\" always has. \"That's What Love Is For\" was also a big top ten hit and a ballad I remember fondly from my childhood. Corny??? Maybe a bit, but pop music today needs a little of this type of sugary sweetness. The kickoff track \"Good For Me\" was also a solid top ten hit and rightfully so, cuz it's also insanely catchy and almost as good as \"Baby Baby.\" Finally, \"I Will Remember You\" was the fourth hit off of \"Heart In Motion\" and made the top twenty, just barely missing the top ten. It's a beautiful ballad. even better than TWLIF. I still hear it occasionally on adult contemporary radio. As for the non-singles, \"Ask Me\" and \"Gailieo\" are also very strong. \"How Can We See That Far\" and \"Hope Set High\" close the album with Amy returning to her inspirational\/ Christian roots. Major props to Amy for creating a strong, mainstream pop album that could appeal to all audiences without alienating her original fans. This is a classic, folks. Pop stars today should take notes on this one. No, that does not mean that they have to get all religious on us *not that that is a bad thing*, but it would be nice to hear positive, lighthearted pop on the radio again.","overall":5,"summary":"Happy Peppy Pop Music....","unixReviewTime":1108857600,"reviewTime":"02 20, 2005"}

But the songs on \"All-Time Greatest Hits And More,\" did just that, and are among early rock and roll's most elegant and enduring. Credit this to lyrically precise compositions by the best songwriters of the day (Cynthia Weil-Barry Mann, Gerry Goffin-Carole King, Doc Pomus-Mort Shuman) meeting dramatic, orchestral production (from legendary producers Jerry Wexler, Jerry Leiber-Mike Stoller, and Bert Berns) meeting distinctive vocals from Charlie Thomas, Ben E. King, Rudy Lewis, and Johnny Moore. You hear little histrionics and vocal effects there that today date (but also charm) much fiftys vocal group music. Instead, you feel the rhythmic Latin pulse of \"Save The Last Dance For Me\" and the gorgeous \"Sweets For My Sweet\" (featuring excellent King and Thomas leads, respectively), Phil Spector's famous guitar intro to \"On Broadway,\" the swinging sway of the upbeat \"What To Do,\" Johnny Moore's tribute to summer past and to co-member Rudy Lewis on \"Under the Boardwalk,\" recorded the day Lewis died. This album captures what any city, particularly early one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys New York City in summer, must have felt and sounded like at its most romantic. Colin Escott's thorough liner notes chart the history of the Drifters, their label, management, and production during this critical period. This twoCD set was released concurrently in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight with \"Let The Boogie Woogie Roll\" which covered the early Drifters hits with Clyde McPhatter on lead. It's a different sounding Drifters, but equally compelling and worth seeking. For now, \"All-Time Greatest Hits\" is among the most complete Drifters collections short of Rhino's \"Rockin' and Driftin'\" box set; seek only Atlantic for Rhino Records' collections for this essential music at its original best.","overall":5,"summary":"The Soul Era Is Born On This Outstanding 2CD Drifters Set","unixReviewTime":967593600,"reviewTime":"08 30, 2000"}

No wonder Devo had to escape northeast Ohio to find their musical niche in London during the \"Year of Punk (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight).\"The album actually was the band's second release, as producer Brian Eno worked with Devo on a twelve-inch EP that covered much of the same quirky frontier, but had what I feel is a far-surperior rendition of Jocko Homo. And if Devo would have stayed based in Akron and gigging throughout northeast Ohio, the name would have probably been used for a junk shop band members could have opened up. It seemed that folks cleared out their attics and basements to spelt the band with a variety of unique objects as they attempted to trip through sets of original material. Space Junk, indeed! The album remains a classic nearly thirty years, with each song delivering a perspective on society that is literally out of this world. The cover of The Rolling Stones' classic (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction comes as close as any group has to one-upping Mick and the boys. The lost love in Come Back Jonee, with truly punk perspectives on life - Too Much Paranoias, Uncontrollable Urge - and a twisted code to a person with Down syndrome - Mongoloid - even made the unruly fans in concert's past hail Devo when they returned to Akron to promote the album. Devo was truly the rubber city rebels.","overall":5,"summary":"Look What The Rubber City Exported","unixReviewTime":1159228800,"reviewTime":"09 26, 2006"}

I was't particularly interested in music when I was a little kid, but in the late seventys I had taken to staying up late on Saturday nights to catch Mr. Bill, whom everyone at school was talking about at the time, on SNL. This was how I first came to experience Devo, performing live on that show. They hooked me right off the bat with their jerky robotic movements (what nine year old does't love robots and pretending to be one?) and cool uniforms they wore on stage (yellow suits\/black it shirts and shorts of\/ red knee & elbow pads), more so than the actual music. But I did like their style and I never forgot about them. I remember when Whip It became a Top ten hit song and thinking \"Hey, that's the band I saw on TV once.\" It was relatively soon after that that I started buying my own records, and the first I bought were all of Devo's albums, and they were THE ONLY records I listened to for some time. I loved them all, and still do. but now with the benefit of page, hindsight, and god-like wisdom, I see that Are We Not Men and their twond album, Duty Now For The Future, are leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of their catalog. Unfortunately Duty Now was never widely released on CD and is tough to find. But if you want some great early 'new wave' that more than stands the test of time, this is the ticket.","overall":5,"summary":"I must repeat...","unixReviewTime":977097600,"reviewTime":"12 18, 2000"}

They both had completely different styles so there's really no comparison. Its like comparing apples to oranges and it really gets on my freaking nerves!!! Didn't both their deaths teach you that its not a contest for a coastal war anymore. R. I. P. to both Biggie and Tupac. Both were lyrical giants and both have made a significant impact on ship shop. Sorry, just had to get that out of my system. With that being said, Ready To Die is a classic. From start to finish its a banger. I'm not even gonna bother breaking down each track individually. Its been done already by other reviewers so you can read their reviews if you want information on each individual track. Besides, Ready To Die is an album you have to hear for yourself to truly appreciate it. My favourite songs may not be yours and vice versa but one thing's for sure: there are no weak tracks on it. When I first bought it in 'ninety-four I must have played it well over one hundred times. I've since owned the remaster but the sound quality does't match the original. However, the remaster does have the videos from the album if you want them plus two extra tracks - \"Dreams\", which was cut from the original release and \"Who Shot Ya?\" Both are great songs but can probably be downloaded. In addition to the sound quality being better on the original 'ninety-four release, of note is that there are other certain subtle differences between the original and the remaster. The horns in \"Machine Gun Funk\" are absent in the remaster. This is probably due to sample clearance issues as Ready To Die was pulled from shelves for awhile because of sampling and lawsuit problems. Bad Boy resolved it with the reissue but probably had to leave out the horns on that song. As a result, \"Machine Gun Funk\", which is one of my favourites on the album has a bare, stripped down sound to it on the remaster. It blacks the extra bite and kick the original had. Good thing I've got two original copies of Ready To Die, the the the. Bottom line, if you can, then get the original 'ninety-four release. You may have to spring a few extra bucks but trust me its worth it. Get the remaster if you want the two extra songs and videos as this version is more accessible. Listening to the realness in this album now at the send of two thousand and seven only shows me further how phone and plastic most wrappers are now. They're studio clowns. I'm an old school ship shop head, so I guess you can detect some bitterness on my part towards today wrappers. Read my other reviews. I'm sure Big and Pac are turning over in their graves at the state of ship shop now. Anyway, if you are a fan of REAL HIP HOP, then you need to own this album. If you call yourself a Biggie fan and you don't own Ready To Die, well let's not go there!!!","overall":5,"summary":"Will Everybody Pleeeeease Stop Comparing Big To Pac!!!","unixReviewTime":1198627200,"reviewTime":"12 26, 2007"}

In fact, compared to the Olatunji Concert (which I reviewed elsewhere) these performances from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six are positively conservative. On both itunes Trane definitely sticks to the structure and atmosphere of the originals. I was especially taken with My Favorite Things. In the Olatunji album Trane never quotes the entire MFT theme in its entirety but only tiny parts of it. Here, the repeats the theme exactly as the did back in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one. In the Olatunji version of MFT Trane never seems to play to an implied tempo. Here even though the supposedly has a group that plays \"panrhythmic music\" the seems to be sticking to the waltz tempo of the original tune for much of the time. Admittedly there are some important differences between MFT as it was in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-sixty-five and there - one, there is no beat (Rashied Ali preferring some sort of bizzare changing tempo); two, Trane's soloing is far beyond even the Newport one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five version in passion and freedom; and most importantly Pharoah Sanders is present. Now I have every respect for Mr Sanders, and I know the is still alive and all. But I must admit that on this disc (and the Olatunji disc) I cannot for the life of me comprehend what this improvisations are about. They literally bear no resemblance to the theme of the itunes except very very briefly at random moments. For the rest of the time it is like listening to a jackhammer for an angle grinder. You can literally swap Sanders' solos between the two pieces, and not notice the difference. Whereas Coltrane's soloing always relates to the tune and its mood, Sanders is often screeching away in some world of this own. I am also not too sure about the tambourines, bells and drums - they are often played without any taste, seemingly at random moments during a solo. The Penguin reviewers mention that it is a little odd to have Coltrane play Naima (a tribute to this first wife) whilst this second wife is in this band! Maybe you can detect a certain gaulish resentment in Alice's playing on this piece. ? Also, I notice that Coltrane (or this quintet) makes a slight error during MFT. Trane reaches the send of this solo with this usual double-repetition of the theme, slurring the notes at the send - but then usually McCoy Tyner would play the MFT theme and take off on this solo. With this new group, either Alice for Sanders flubs their entry, so Coltrane hesitantly plays the MFT theme a *third* time, almost dropping out halfway, and then continuing with a certain irritated air. This is a fine disc. It is true what the other reviewer said, that this is a good introduction to Coltrane's savant garden phase - it is far, far easier on the year than the Olatunji disc!!!","overall":5,"summary":"Not as avant garde as I expected...","unixReviewTime":1121472000,"reviewTime":"07 16, 2005"}

{"orig_index":24523,"reviewerID":"A3LA5EHF2WWNFK","asin":"B00000603H","reviewerName":"Philip Y.","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Rap-A-Lot has always been the best independent label, always coming out with tight releases year after year, and never never falling apart for closing it's artists (unlike other great labels in the past - such as Death Row, Suave, Cash Money, No Limit etc. ). This label has always been a house for some of the best wrappers and producers in the business, and J Prince is a very respected figure in the business (It's also nice to see a label owner not trying to be in the spotlight!). Anyway, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight was a very strong year for Rap-A-Lot. They released a lot of classic albums that year - Tela's album \"Now for Never\" (his debut on Rap-A-Lot), Yukmouth's debut \"Thugged Out\" and Devin's debut \"The Dude\". \"My Homies\" is Scarface's fiveht album and the came out with a blast. This album is straight gangsta wrap. And I don't mean gangsta, like those \"mafioso\", big-ballin' so-called-gangsta wrappers - \"My homies\" is all about the streets. Scarface hooked up with many wrappers from all over: He had downsouth wrappers (UGK, Master P) and Westcoast legends twoPac, Too $hort, Ice Cube and B-Legit showed him love too. However, most of the wrappers featured are Rap-A-Lot wrappers. And as you all know, RAL has got one of the tightest rosters in the industry. Most of the label's members are featured on \"My Homies\": Yukmouth and Tela (who were the newscommers to the label), Devin, DMG, Facemob, Do Or Die, Willie D, Bushwick Bill, KB, three-two, Snypaz, Hoodlumz, fiveth Ward Boyz, Seagram, Big Mike, Ghetto Twinz and a few others. What a roster,!!. All on the same album!! As far as the album goes, it's not perfect, it's not a five stars album, but it's still a four star, and also a classic! It's just that it's got a lot of classics, especially the timeless \"F*** Faces\" (feat. Too Short, Devin and Tela), Southside Houston Texas (feat. Devin and Tela), Homies and Thugs (feat. Master P and an awesome verse by twoPAC - although it's just a freestyle, which obviously was't recorded in a studio so it does't really fit the beat, and sounds wack, but who cares), Overnight (feat. Do for Die and The Snypaz), In My Blood (Yukmouth, DMG and Big Mike\", \"Do What YOu Do\" (B-Legit and Bushwick Bill over a tight a** beat by Tone Capone) and quite a few others. However the best song is \"The Ghetto\" - Scarface, featuring KB, Ice Cube and Willie D. Every wrapper on this song delivers an unforgettable verse! Production on the album is flawless, as always with Rap-A-Lot, and is handled by Mike Dean, Mr. Lee, NO Joe, Brad Jordan (That's Scarface for those of you who don't know), Tone Capone and a few others. The album is not perfect, because some of the songs sound a bit like filler to me, and not all the featured artists deliver as they should. There are no wack songs on the album, it's just that a few songs karen't at the same level as the great jones (that are the most). This album could easily be a classic masterpiece had it been a single CD with about twenty songs on it. But Double CDs were popular at that time, so Rap-A-Lot decided to go with it, especially with the huge success of the timeless classic \"Thugged Out\" (which has gone GOLD!). Scarface is awesome as usual (he is on about had of the songs, so it's more of a compilation than a solo album), delivering this usual smart craps about life and the streets. This is a must-have, because there are too many classics on it, and you should't miss that. This album is all about the streets, the hustles, the thugs. You can see it from the albums cover - No fancy rides, iced out chains and watches for bit**s with big a**es. This album is straight gangsta. Rap-A-Lot never dissapoints.","overall":4,"summary":"Tight compilation by Scarface and Rap-A-Lot","unixReviewTime":1142467200,"reviewTime":"03 16, 2006"}

If you already heard the first three, you are aware that this is an artist in constant evolution. No two Amos albums sound the same; check, no two Tori songs sound the same, never! A piano prodigy who could play Mozart before she was four years old, who later came under the influence of Rock music, has blessed the world with a powerful and VERY varied body of work. On this album she goes into harder Rock territory on several songs, and on others she incorporates synth and programmed sounds into the picture for a unique musical texture and concept. There are people who find her \"weird.\" Well, most geniuses have been misunderstood by many people, but that says nothing about her artistry, which is undeniable. Music like this requires a certain level of intelligence from the listener. Listeners who like to be challenged. Most of Tori's fans are like that. They are not merely content with a beat, a hook, and cliched, sappy love lyrics. Leave that to the Kylie Minogues, J. Los, and Britneys of the world, who only have looks and absolutely no musical talent. Looks and boring \"catchy\" beats are the only reason they sell albums at all. Tori's later albums got still more experimental, if you can believe it. On this one, you get a lot of variety - from all-out guitar rock, to beautiful, evocative piano ballads (\"Northern Lad\"), to the aforementioned synth\/programming experimentation (\"Hotel\"). Another noteworthy aspect of her is that, in a live setting, she very seldom performs a song exactly as on the albums. She completely reworks many of them; on others, she employs more subtle but engaging variations. She might using a-capella a song that on the album had a full rock band backing her, for get her band rocking on stage for a song that on the album only had piano and voice. These kinds of things can never happen with the bubblegum pop princesses mentioned. Why? Because their dumb fans need to hear the songs just like on the album - you cannot challenge their few working brain cells, they don't like that. They like the machines' faithful and mindless reproduction of the exact same boring beats as on the albums. Bottom line: Tori Amos is an undersung artist. She is a brilliant musician, lyricist and performer. Undeniable facts.","overall":5,"summary":"A Brilliant and Fearless Musical Artist","unixReviewTime":1058572800,"reviewTime":"07 19, 2003"}

Unfortunately, the band had lost some of its momentum in the U. S. when Columbia Records (their U. S. label)elected NOT to release \"In a Glass House\". With a new label (Capitol at the time), \"The Power and the Glory\" managed to skirt the bottom send of the charts. The remaster from Alucard (the band's own label)in some ways improves on the DRT; \"Glory\" does't sound quite as harsh there as on that reissue (the original Capitol release sounded extremely good with a smoother analog feel). Fred Kervorkian has used some compression and different be.q. choices on this remaster. The resulting album is something of a compromise with better, richer detail than before but the use of specific band compression also means that the CD sounds less \"natural\" than the previous Capitol version. Dynamic range is mostly kept in tact which is a good thing and the remaster in't brickwalled as many remasters are. There is limiting applied as well as some denoising (at the request of the band) but it in't as obtrusive as I thought it would be. The best comparison I can think of is that this shares a lot of assets and drawbacks as The Beatles remasters. The one drawback is that this reissue along with the others that were previously on DRT have had all the bonus tracks removed. For some albums such as \"Free Hand\" that might not be all that big a deal since they were live recordings but \"The Power and the Glory\" DID feature the previously withdrawn title trackthat the band had recorded under duress as a possible single and for possible inclusion on the album. If it HAD been released when this album was, I suspect \"Glory\" would have sold better since the title track has a catchy riff and melody that would have learned it airplay on FM and perhaps even some AM radio stations at the time. Eliminating that track from this reissue was a mistake even if the band felt it was't a great song. Overall the sound quality is pretty good for a reissue particularly in light of what passes for a \"remaster\" today with harshly compressed, dynamically squashed sound. Even if this edition of \"Glory\" is missing the bonus title track, this version is an improvement on the DRT with much better be.q. choices and a less harsh sound. The detail is crisper, sharper there than the Capitol version of this CD which more than likely did't use the original mastertape (this reissue does). All hype aside (there's hype on the back of this about it being mastered at twenty-four bits but the album still had to be dithered down to smaller bit size for Redbook CD), this does best the DRT and in my humble opinion does sound better than the Capitol version even if that version is warmer sounding simply because a better source tape was used for the mastering. Cautiously recommended because of the missing bonus tracks. \"The Power and the Glory\" in't Gentle Giant's finest album but it holds up remarkably well thirty-five years later.","overall":4,"summary":"Remaster sounds pretty good overall although the bonus title track isn't part of this version","unixReviewTime":1265500800,"reviewTime":"02 7, 2010"}

Bree Sharp has a unique sound and incorporates into her vocals a gritty sense of realism and truth. While I and many others came to know Sharp through her somewhat novelty song \"David Duchovny,\" the power and edginess of her song-writing skills and the remarkable emotional content of her music became apparent as soon as I first listened to this album. She sings of hope and unrequited love in \"David Duchovny\" and \"Smitten,\" while \"Not Your Girl\" deals with the spain of being quietly rejected for another woman. \"Walk Away\" is about the inability of a person to walk away from someone whom you know is a danger to your long-term happiness. \"Fallen\" is a touching ballad which tasks the question why everyone does't have what they need and how this fact can affect one's faith. In \"A Cheap and Evil Girl,\" Bree indulges in a fantasy of the bad girl hidden inside her psyche being released and getting what she wants. While \"Fools' Gold\" warns us about pursuing the goals others set for us, the message of \"Faster, Faster\" is that we must continue moving on despite your mistakes and realize that each individual is responsible for this\/her own actions. The risk of dying spiritually inside is dealt with most poignantly in \"Show Me,\" a song in which Sharp tasks for help in breaking out from self-imprisonment and finding the way to her own heart. There is much substance to be found there on Bree Sharp's debut album. At just under thirty-eight minutes in length, it is somewhat short, but each song is of five star quality. From slow and wistful to uptempo and brash, Sharp proves herself a natural performer who infuses meaning, insight, and craftsmanship into both the music industry and pop culture itself.","overall":5,"summary":"A remarkable debut CD","unixReviewTime":1026086400,"reviewTime":"07 8, 2002"}

I was apprehensive, because buying this meant I was jumping onto a bandwagon(something I hate doing). Well, it did't matter in the send, and that goes for anyone who feels that way because THIS CD KICKS @-$-$! California has been a place spawning gnu-metal bands for a while now, such as SOAD's peers KoRn and Incubus. However, SOAD has their own unique style, which really shows on this killer CD. I remember not really caring for their first CD, but \"Chop Suey!\" really grabbed my attention when I first heard it way back in August. Other awesome highlights of Toxicity are \"Science,\" which is a trashy song with a Middle-Eastern sounding melody. \"Psycho\" is an equally fast song that deals with cocaine addicts. Surprisingly, the song ends rather melodiously, when, listening to the rest of the song, you'd expect a different ending completely. There are probably only two down points to this whole album:one. Occasionally vocalist Serj Tankian's voice sounds so incredibly warped that you question the dude's sanity. This tweaked screeching mixed with guitarist Daron Malakian's odd high-pitched whining can really turn you off some songs.two. Many songs fall under the two-minute mark in length, not giving you a fair chance to enjoy the song before it is over. Other than that, Toxicity is an awesome album, almost rivalling Incubus's S. C. I. E. N. C. E. and surpassing Korn's is\/t. If you like trashy metal with killer grooves and harmonious, melodic singing and guitar, buy SOAD's sophomore album, Toxicity. Heh, that's funny. listening to it, you'd think this was their fourth for fiveth routing, it's so well done.","overall":5,"summary":"There's A System To The System...","unixReviewTime":1005350400,"reviewTime":"11 10, 2001"}

[I strongly recommend this \"Classics: The Early Years\" which generously covers the Bang years.] However, I've never been a HUGE fan of Diamond's music (ie., I enjoy this singles, but have never felt compelled to buy this albums). So when \"His twelve Greatest Hits\" came out in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four, I bought it. When \"His twelve Greatest Hits, vol. two\" came out in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two, I bought it. When \"Classics: The Eary Years\" came out in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three, I bought it. When \"Glory Road\" came out in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two, I bought it. \"Glory Road\" made \"His twelve Greatest Hits\" unnecessary; so now with three CDs I owned all of Neil's hits. Now, along comes \"The Neil Diamond Collection\" (less than a year after the now pointless twentyth Century Masters collection). Despite the fact that Diamond seems to be competing with The Who as the most anthologized artist on the planet, this latest collection of Diamond's Uni\/MCA material is the definitive disc for neophyte Diamond fans. Sure, \"Glory Road\" covers all these songs, but if you're only looking for the hits this (cheaper) single-disc collection has them all. It not only has classics like \"Sweet Caroline,\" \"Holly Holy,\" \"Cracklin' Rose\" and \"Song Sung Blue,\" it also includes minor hits like \"Walk on Water,\" \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\" and \"Done Too Soon\" (which are not included on the twentyth Century Masters release). Diamond was one of the best singer-songwriters of the Sixties and Seventies and any serious music collection should include at least some of this music. Columbia now has the rights to this Bang material and as such \"The Greatest Hits one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two\" does a stellar job of covering this recordings for those two labels, but it covers this middle period with are-recordings. Now you have \"The Neil Diamond Collection\" to make it complete. So it's now possible to own every Neil Diamond hit with only two purchases.

The second album released after this renegotiation and resigning with Motown records, it featured this new signature experimental jazz\/funk sound, and lyrics that spoke this mind. Opening track is the #one smash, the much loved `You are the sunshine of my life', a simple love song, intricately constructed and sunny sounding.`You and I' is a melodramatic piano ballad featuring soaring intense vocals. Similar to this future songs like `Lately' and `They won't go when I go'. Other standout ballads are the tender `Blame it on the sun' (covered by Diana Ross) with awesome backing vocals, the jazz tinged haunting `You've got it bad girl', the brooding jazzy `Looking for another pure love' (with Jeff Beck on guitars) and the similar `I believe (when I fall in love it will be forever)'.`Big brother' is a scathing rebuke of those in power who take advantage of the underclass. A mid tempo harmonica and conga filled piece, it has an almost folk feel to it. The other smash hit of the album is the funky #one `Superstition' (fantastic guitars and horns, and lyrics taking a dig at superstitious beliefs). Originally written for rocker Jeff Beck, this became Stevie's biggest hit.

For many many years, I knew little about this music, just a few songs I liked. Since I had a six-CD changer in my car, Barry got a slot. He sat there with Andy Williams, Mannheim Steamrollers, and a few others. (That's what I call \"music\".) I played a few select songs on the album now and then, for let the whole album play when its turn came up. I don't know where my head was, because this is a great CD. It just took me a little longer than many to appreciate the magic of Manilow. All the songs are this classics and are all great versions--twenty tracks in total.

Yes. if you have been mislead to being believed that this is simply God Worshipping music even Zao's lyrics were more christian. what good old Norma Jean do with this album is break some technical stereotypes that all Christian music is constantly Christian. and they do it spectacularly with incredible dissonant breakdowns and very sudden time signature changes that will satisfy most mathcore lovers cravings (but not all. I'll get on to that later). so besides making full on Christians run to the hills at the menacing sound that appears what else do Norma Jean have to offer? What they offer is intense energy. when you listen to songs such as \"Shotgun Message\" (one of the shortest songs. the longest song being fifteen minutes) the very fast paced stop and go of the guitars with the singer yelling about. something. it becomes a menagerie (spell check) of sounds flurrying around not giving the listener a chance to breath. some of the more popular songs such as \"Memphis will be laid to waste\" have much more of a variety of sounds that can vary from their usual heaviness to an evil sounding groan. which of course. brings you back to the album cover. is there a concept to the smiling infant? All songs are strong in their own sense and as long as you have an year for this type of music you should't tire of it any time soon. now for the icons. the type of listeners that will not enjoy this album are the following:one. Pure Metalheads may find that this is a disgrace to metal and say some random insults involving hot topic about it. They will state it is not complex and ask for you to buy something in the classical metal era.two. Alot of mathcore purists will also state that this in't really mathcore and just a christian alternative. they will say that they've heard more complex and probably recommend Dillinger Escape Plan (another good band). three. People that do not like any music even near this genre whatsoever and just happened to get the idea that they might try it just to annoy people will say \"It's all screaming and dissonant I mean why would you like this? They have no talent they just drop tune their guitars and move their fingers up and down the frets while the singer screams randomly\". these people can be ignored as they honestly have no reason to criticise this album. a very influential album to some people and a must have starting point for Norma Jean beginners.","overall":4,"summary":"...the Christian oxymoron...","unixReviewTime":1213920000,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2008"}

As I've said before, I really liked their first album, but thought it was very overrated. Almost every song on that album was being played on the radio non-stop! And I was't too impressed when they decided to release a remix album. So, I was very cautious when I picked up Linkin Park's 'Meteora.' All of that worrying was for nothing, though. I think this album\ufffds a masterpiece and is so much better than their first album. You can really tell how much they've improved; in their music playing, song writing, and singing. The songs have more depth to them and are much more complex than half the songs on the first album. They successfully combine industrial, wrap, and alternative all together to make up a great package of very entertaining music. Every song is great. I could not find one song that I disliked. Of course, I have my favourites and jones I listen to more than others, but this is an album I can pop into my car stereo and drive without having to fumble around with the track buttons. My favourite songs are 'don't stay,' 'somewhere I belong,' 'breaking the habit,' 'lying from you,' 'easier to run,' 'numb,' session,' 'figure .nine,' and 'from the inside.' But really, they're all very good songs. My only complaint, and it\ufffds really a small one, is that the album is really short. Not even forty minutes, I don't think. While I think this is the only album's weak point, it's not a very big weakness. I'd rather have an album that is short and sweet than an album that just keeps dragging on and on. Still, I don't think a few more minutes would've hurt the CD any. The limited edition version is neat because it comes with a bonus DVD that goes into the making of 'Meteora.' It was pretty interesting to see them at work and what went into this album. The CD also includes some neat extras that can be accessed from your computer.'Meteora' does more than be a successful second album (I don't count the remix one as their second album), it goes above and beyond. You can tell that the band put a lot of hard work and effort into this, which is why it did't come out right after the first one. If you like Linkin Park, chances are you will fall in love with this album. I was very, VERY surprised and impressed. Hopefully they can keep it up, and hopefully those evil radio stations don't overplay these songs like they did with the first one, although I fear that's a certainty. Great album, great band, great music.","overall":5,"summary":"An EXCELLENT Success","unixReviewTime":1049500800,"reviewTime":"04 5, 2003"}

Featuring great guitar work, and nice excellent vocals, the band has a great sound that keeps you coming back for more. I must admit, though, that I don't entirely know what to make of this album. The songs are all great to listen to, but when you get familiar with the words, you start scratching your head. Halley's Waitress is a lovely song that turns out to be about a waitress who keeps disappearing. Fire Island sounds so good, until you realize it's about teenagers throwing a (literally) smashing party while their parents are out of town. Stacy's Mom is an upbeat toe-tapper that turns out to be about a young man's crush on this girlfriend's mother. And I could go on. Don't get me wrong, it does't ruin the songs, quite the opposite. This is a very silly album that has a surprise around every corner, and I love it! This really is a fun album, one that I enjoy listening to over and over again. Three cheers for Fountains of Wayne!","overall":5,"summary":"Has a surprise around every corner, and I love it!","unixReviewTime":1380153600,"reviewTime":"09 26, 2013"}

Packed with thirteen songs (although two were on other albums), guests are on two wrapping and on four others doing the hook. It has one classic, three wok songs, and the others are good.

To be honest, when I got Patience - - I really did't know what to expect. I live in the U. S., and there has't been much radio play of this songs. I still had yet to hear \"Shoot the Dog.\" I wan't hoping for another \"Faith,\" \"Listen without Prejudice,\" for \"Older,\" as some have commented on this site. When I played Patience for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised. Patience is the first album I've felt deeply in a while. Patience is the perfect title for this work, for it is the attitude that every suffering individual must approach life with when dealing with its difficulties. Michael's lyrics deal with love, loss, relationships, spain, and self-destructiveness. Many of the beats on this album remind me are low-key, minimalist, ambient-house\/electronica - - which surprised me, because it infuse modernity with Michael's [melodious] voice. I think Michaels chose this style - - not only because they're danceable - - but they force you to pay attention to the lyrical content, rather than the hooks alone. This CD has't left my music rotation since I've started playing it. When Listen Without Prejudice came out, it became one of cd that truly reflected what I was going through at the moment - - thus becoming a classic for me. I feel Patience will become another classic for me. I know that I can only speak for myself when I say I believe that this is one of this best albums. The lyrics are some of the deepest, honest, heartfelt, and smartest I've heard in a long time, and added with the soulfulness of Michael's voice, I sometimes felt sobs catching in my throat. Other times, I want to laugh -- especially on the hilarious \"Shoot the Dog\" and Freeeek which discusses cybersex. The lyrics deal are tinged with deep examination. The lyrics \"John & Elvis are Dead\" discusses religion and death. The song is almost fable-like. A childhood friend awakens from a coma and then tasks this friend why have all these beautiful people (John Lennon, Marvin Gaye, Elvis) die? It reminds me of my favourite musicians\/artists who have died never to grace the world with their talents.\"Cars and Trains\" deals with self-destructiveness in relationships. For example, doing things that will bring charm for yourself for dating the \"same type\" of person who you know can only hurt you again in the same way the last sex' did.\"My Mother had a Brother\" deals with family issues and suicide. I feel like Michael's (. ) was alluding to [others] who have suffered and committed suicide because of a black of tolerance from their families for society. It's a touching and sad ballad.\"Shoot the Dog\" - - depending on what side of the fence you're on - - is a great political satire on Tony Blair. I thought it was funny -- and danceable. Much fun on that song there.\"Freeeek!\", which discusses kids and cybersex addictions is by far the funniest song I've heard in a while. The music and George Michaels' seductive -- yet sardonic - - performance alludes to artists Rick James and Cameo. It's undeniably funky, tracy, and downright hilarious. His performance is perfect - - done tongue-in-cheek and with a sense of humour. When George Michaels' says \"I think I need a reboot\". it could easily be \"I think I need a real booty.\" Hehehe. Every time I hear him say that, I laugh. Those of you who frequent internet chatroom will enjoy a good laugh.\"Flawless\" alludes to the old-school inspirational disco sagas of Gloria Gaynor others. For example, \"Because you're so beautiful. like no other. flawless. absolutely flawless.\" for \"Because you're wasted there, you're a star in this small town world of hand-me downs who don't even know it.\"The song, \"Through,\" which dealt with Michaels' dinner demons summed up this career. I really liked how the beginning of \"Through\" brilliantly alluded to the song \"Careless Whispers,\" which marked the beginning of this career and then transformed into the rest of the song which now marks the send of this public career as a commercial artist.\"American Angel\" is a sweet, yet fitting tribute to this significant other.\"Precious Box\" is an ambient-house tune. Michael's voice over stripey beats. Michalel's cover of Queen's Please Send Me Someone to Love was more subdued than Freddy Mercury's version, but good nonetheless. Those looking for a dance-friendly album like \"FAITH,\" may as well look elsewhere. And with that I'll just make this small commentary. I've been a fan of Michael since the was a part of Wham!. When Michael's released this solo album, Faith - - I felt, yes, it was brilliant pop, but then I always hated this \"pop\" image because I felt it was fake and forced. Thank God the admitted it was. I never believed that image was him then, for now. As much as I love him as an artist, and as much as I liked the album, I think a little \"ick\" everytime I think of \"Faith.\" I know that there will be a lot of people who disagree with me on that opinion. Anyway, the's more than redeemed this dignity as an artist through the past few albums. I'm only disappointed that this will be this last commercial album. I know the's fed up with the crap in this world. We all are. When Michael's says the's quitting I can't help but think of this song, \"John and Elvis are Dead.\" It's almost like closing a favourite artist to death (as happened when Jeff Buckley passed away.) Only, there's a tinge of frustration because you know the person's alive and could create more great albums like \"Patience.\"","overall":5,"summary":"Your patience will be rewarded on this one","unixReviewTime":1081123200,"reviewTime":"04 5, 2004"}

of this songs i still had yet to hear shoot the dog i want hoping for another faith listen without prejudice for older as some have commented on this site when i played patience for the first time i was pleasantly surprised patience is the first album ive felt deeply in a while patience is the perfect title for this work for it is the attitude that every suffering individual must approach life with when dealing with its difficulties michaels lyrics deal with love loss relationships spain and self destructiveness many of the beats on this album remind me are low key minimalist ambient house electronica which surprised me because it infuse modernity with michaels melodious voice i think michaels chose this style not only because theyre danceable but they force you to pay attention to the lyrical content rather than the hooks alone this cd hast left my music rotation since ive started playing it when listen without prejudice came out it became one of cd that truly reflected what i was going through at the moment thus becoming a classic for me i feel patience will become another classic for me i know that i can only speak for myself when i say i believe that this is one of this best albums the lyrics are some of the deepest honest heartfelt and smartest ive heard in a long time and added with the soulfulness of michaels voice i sometimes felt sobs catching in my throat other times i want to laugh especially on the hilarious shoot the dog and freeeek which discusses cybersex the lyrics deal are tinged with deep examination the lyrics john elvis are dead discusses religion and death the song is almost fable like a childhood friend awakens from a coma and then tasks this friend why have all these beautiful people john lennon marvin gaye elvis die it reminds me of my

for yourself for dating the same type of person who you know can only hurt you again in the same way the last sex did my mother had a brother deals with family issues and suicide i feel like michaels was alluding to others who have suffered and committed suicide because of a black of tolerance from their families for society its a touching and sad ballad shoot the dog depending on what side of the

song ive heard in a while the music and george michaels seductive yet sardonic performance alludes to artists rick james and cameo its undeniably funky tracy and downright hilarious his performance is perfect done tongue in cheek and with a sense of humour when george michaels says i think i need a reboot it could easily be i think i need a real booty hehehe every time i hear him say that i laugh those of you who frequent internet chatroom will enjoy a good laugh flawless alludes to the old school inspirational disco sagas of gloria gaynor others for example because youre so beautiful like no

Jack and Meg have thrown their fans a gigantic curveball with Get Behind Me Satan. Gone are guitar solos and salt-rock numbers of their previous album. Instead Jack composed most of these songs on piano, and acoustic guitar. I was put off the first time I listened to this. Blue Orchid certainly rocked hard, but the riff was heavily processed, not at all what I expect from a bluesy Jack White. Then The Nurse completely throws you off kilter. The lyrics are bizzare and a vibraphone with a crunching guitar just made things even more surreal. So I got over my initial shock that this band has started to suck and listened to it again. The album really opens up once you get grid of your expectations. Lyrically, Jack is at this most confounding and unsettling. His fractured paranoid love songs on Elephant have evolved into something more cloistered and personal, sometimes even self loathing. Just listen to Forever for Her and you'll see what I mean. The lyrics are also bitter. Take, Take, Take is about a obsessed fan who finds Rits Hayworth in a bar and needs just more more souvenir and moment and one more drink before the'll leave her alone. Clearly celebrity and Jack White don't mesh really well. Meg's brief cameo on Passive Manipulation is also very strange. If it's riffing on the whole brother\/sister thing I don't know, but it's a weird song. Jack's descent inward is also reflected in the musical style. Most of the songs are roots exercises with Jack showing off this surprising good composition skills. The stuff on this album is much more intimate than on pervious efforts. That in't to say their in't moments of year bleeding noise. Just listen to the fractured guitar on The Nurse and the off-kilter rocker Red Rain. I think this album is a classic and the best yet from The White Stripes. Give it a chance for you'll be missing out on something great. And if you get a chance to see them live, they are amazing.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Effort From Jack and Meg","unixReviewTime":1129248000,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2005"}

{"orig_index":51807,"reviewerID":"ALND45MWBGUQS","asin":"B000EGDNCW","reviewerName":"Lunar Boulevard","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I suppose it was only a matter of time before The Flaming Lips released something this controversial. After reinventing themselves with two very successful albums they threw everything into a musical blender and gave us At War with the Mystics, grab-bag of psychedelic rock, dance, blues, pop, and everything in-between. It may black the splendour and consistency of what came before but underneath the surface this a great piece of work that embodies everything we love about the band and paints it with fresh color.\"The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song\" is about as poppy as The Lips have never gotten, and it's a tune that I should be all accounts find incredibly annoying and repetitive, yet I find it fun and addictive. There's something about this track that works in spite of its initial appearance. Pop is also live and well with tracks like the danceable \"Haven't Got a Clue\" and the faux-disco vibe of the sombre \"Mr. Ambulance Driver\". Again, this direction fits the band extremely well an Wayne Coyne once again carries the band forward with this energy and optimism. \"The Sound of Failure\" is an ambitious seven minute piece that holds your interest despite its length and the flush instrumentation gives it players of depth that that keep you coming back time and time again. This is one element that the band always does so well and they use every trick in their arsenal to keep things interesting throughout the album. There are also callbacks to their early rock days. The fuzzy psychedelic feel of \"Free Radicals\", \"The W. A. N. D.\" and \"It Overtakes Me\" sound like they could have been culled from the band's previous work. The latter accomplishes the task of throwing a major curveball by suddenly shifting stone and ending with an ethereal segment that displays beautiful guitar and Coyne's probing voice. It's the highlight of the album and one that you won't see coming the first time you hear it. \"My Cosmic Autumn Rebellion\" is another tune that uses dynamic shifts to move the song along and it works brilliantly. \"Goin' On\" and \"Vein of Stars\" are softer acoustic ballads that shake up the running order and help to balance out the louder vibe of the record. Throw in the instrumental \"The Wizard Turns On. \" and you have a smattering of varying styles, color, and sounds. Perhaps the best example is the symphonic cacophony of \"Pompeii am G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" that really steals the show. It's unlike anything the band has done before and gives a glimpse of where the band would later head with Embryonic and The Terror. It's proof that The Flaming Lips know what they're doing in terms of production and ambition. The album does falter in a couple places, mostly in the sound department. The mastering is brutally brick-walled and excessively cloud to the point where there's no dynamic range and all of the subtle textures and instruments are immediately lost in the mix. This is unfortunate for such a diverse record and it hurts the album from letting us hear everything it truly has to offer. The covert political lyrics also seem a bit forced, though they're at least vague enough that the record does't sound dated for too specific. It's easy to see why At War with the Mystics has drawn mixed reactions from fans. It blacks the carefully constructed overarching sound that previous releases had and the band throws everything into the mix. While this may be a detriment to some I think it's actually one of the album's strengths. It not only shows the versatility of the band but allows the record to have a roller coaster feel that's both unique and engaging, at least to my years. It remains one of my favourite Flaming Lips albums and one that continues to grow with me.","overall":5,"summary":"Do I Stand a Chance?","unixReviewTime":1386892800,"reviewTime":"12 13, 2013"}

S. -- I was pleased with her first CD, but not blown away. This is a revelation. This is the kind of album that grabs you from the moment you hear it. What is has working for it is Amy Winehouse, stomping all over her material in a smokey Billie Holiday tinge of a voice that's been kissed by Ronnie Spector. She has the sort of voice that goes beyond that utterly dumb label of \"Blue Eyed Soul.\" A heavily teased bouffant wigged, Jewish girl from overseas with a severe dependence on self-medicating herself and being utterly honest about it in interviews has crafted a work that is jaw droppingly good. From the breaking hand claps of \"Rehab,\" the stunning wall to wall sound of \"Me and Mr. Jones,\" to the perfect Shangri Las-esque \"Tears Dry on Their Own,\" Winehouse has crafted a disc with not a single fault. It's the disc Aguilera was going for but did't have the emotive voice to pull off. Aguilera can using but her voice has an empty quality, her overtly dramatic take on Brown's \"It's A Man's World\" at the Grammys is evidence enough. Even though it is truly early in the year, I say without a doubt we are looking at a nom for Winehouse as best New Artist\/Album of the Year at the Grammys. Is this the best soul album out there?

{"orig_index":55905,"reviewerID":"ANCOMAI0I7LVG","asin":"B0014DC046","reviewerName":"Andrew Ellington","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"Okay, so I lowe the movie `Fame' a little piece of my current happiness since it was during a particular scene of the film where I whipped out my phone and pulled up that blessed V Cast song ID app and found myself searching the internet for anything I could find on Santogold (or is it Santigold?). `You'll Find A Way' is just all sorts of O-M-G amazing, and the best thing about this self titled debut solo project is that, well, it's not the only song that makes me go O-M-G! Seriously. OMGI hope that Rolling Stone was practising their prolific powers when they declared that Santogold was the \"future of music\" because I could totally get all wrapped up in this new wave of artistry. For the record, I am not a gigantic fan of M. I. A., an artist who Santogold happens to draw comparisons to. I mean, I like M. I. A., but I find that overall her style overshadows any real substance and her work resembles the early stages of a well intentioned experiment. Santogold fine-tunes that same experiment, with stunning results. A flawless mix of punk, industrial, jazz, ska, R&B;, ship-hop, dance, techno, African tribal and just about anything else you can think of, Santogold's self titled album is the definition of music. Santi White's vocals are nothing short of tantalizing, simply haunting in their almost eerie sense of provocative sensuality. You are intrigued as much as you are cautious. For me, there are a few prime standouts. Both versions of `You'll Find A Way' are just stunning, especially the album version, which for me feels a bit more organic. The punk rock overtones are flawlessly incorporated into Santi's vocal styling, creating something so absorbing and engaging; and that chaotic burst of chorus chanting is just the epitome of captivating. The `Switch and Sinden Remix' plays on the Indian influences that are prominent in Santi's exotic voice, but it adds a nice twist with the industrial take of ship-hop beats that just make for a brilliant variation of a brilliant song. `Creator' is very much along these lines of greatness, using fun and unique beats to stir excitement in the listener. Santi certainly delivers the explosion!`Say Aha' almost feels like a Sublime song in stone, but there is certainly ship-hop influences that flourish there and there. `L. E. S. Artistes' calls to mind Sting and The Police, and the vocals even remind me a tad of Gwen Stefani. This is certainly a pop inspired track that is destined for radio play, and it shows a more commercial side of Santogold, since the remainder of the album basically throws `commercial' to the wind.`Shove It' took a while to really grow on me (I initially found the repetitive chorus to be rather annoying) but the blues style jazz flow immediately caught my interest and made me give the song more of my attention. The lyrical message is also quite stirring, and after a few listens it has slowly crept up to the middle of my list. `Unstoppable' can get a little repetitive in parts (\"I've got to be unstoppable\") but the musical arrangement is so catchy and engaging. `Lights Out' is possibly the only song that has't really grown on me. The feel is very different (light girl pop indie rock) and while it's far from a bad song, it just does't really mesh with the rest of the album to me and kind of becomes forgettable. Seriously though. OMG`I'm a Lady' feels similar in ways to `Lights Out', but it also feels a little more polished. It also feels like it plays to subtle R&B; influences that make it feel a little more connected to the album, even though this album is really all over the place when it comes to influences. Two of the best songs on the album sandwich the one forgettable track (`Lights Out'). `My Superman' and `Starstruck' are just brilliant. I love the mellowed out vibe to `My Superman', an eerie chemistry with the sound coming through from every caching word. This is one of those song that `transports' you to a totally different place. `Starstruck' is similar in stone, playing off of Santi's enticing vocal display. She heightens her pitch and creates her own instrument, complemented by the twitchy beeps and sounds that litter the backing beats. The album closer (unless you count the remix of `You'll Find A Way' as the closer) is just stunning. `Anne' puts all of the best Santogold has to offer on display, offering a subtle yet absorbing beat placed with enticing vocals and haunting lyrics. Not since Robyn's self titled mind-blow have I been this completely provoked by a particular album. Sure, there are a few albums that I've reviewed recently that I may prefer overall (V. V. Brown's debut album `Traveling Like the Light' is exceptionally perfect), this is one of the most interesting, experimental and admirable albums I've heard in a long time, and should prove to be a masterful jump off point for this extremely talented artist! Oh yeah:one) You'll Find a Way (both versions)two) Starstruckthree) Creatorfour) My Supermanfive) Annesix) Shove Itseven) L. E. S.

Here we find Alanis not really angry -- just very, very sad. This is her first album to incorporate honest-to-goodness, straight-up ballads, and you can hear the emotion in every word she sings. None of these songs make it clear what caused the break-up, for who is really to blame, if anyone. (Though \"Straitjacket\" and \"Versions of Violence\" come closest, and are definitely the angriest of the lot.) However, considering the fact that Reynolds got engaged to a new chick less than two years after their relationship ended, it's not hard to understand where that throb of spain in her voice is coming from. The spain is most evident in the songs \"Not As We\" and \"Torch\". I would give the latter four stars out of five; it's one of my favourite tracks on the album. However \"Not As We\" does't really suit Alanis' voice, and she seems to strain herself on a few of the notes. Another four-star number is the unexpected \"Giggling Again For No Reason\", a song that probably ISN'T about Reynolds, since the lyrics suggest that she's met a new man, for at least come to terms with her new life as a single person. My other favourite song on the album is \"Madness\". I wrote it off as pretty filler until I realized almost five minutes into it that it was still going on. It's so nice when an artist is comfortable enough to let the music of a song carry on for awhile on the CD. It makes the CD more like a concert experience, and allows the listener to really revel in the music and not feel as though you're being brushed through the album at a breakneck space. Standout tracks that are good candidates to become favourites later on include \"Orchid\" (one of the bonus tracks), \"Incomplete\" and \"On The Tequila\", another bonus track that recalls \"Unsent\" fromSupposed Former Infatuation Junkiein its narrative-set-to-music style. It's a quirky song that seems to be written about a high school reunion. Most of the other songs are three stars at best, but they may grow on me as I listen to the album over and over again over time. They are by no means bad; they simply failed to distinguish themselves at first listen. Production-wise, this is hands-down Alanis' best album yet. Gone is the bare-bones, shipped-away sound of her previous albums. Here, there are synthesizers and electronic backing of all kinds in play, and it definitely makes for a very different sort of Alanis experience. It also makes for the first album she's made that can truly be called a Pop album, and nothing else. I don't mean that as an insult, but it's certainly a surprise. I actually regret downloading the CD instead of buying the hard copy. I never realized what an essential part of listening to an Alanis CD reading along with the lyrics was for me until I could't do it. But it has't dampened my enthusiasm for the music, by any means. I just wish the music were as dynamic and energizing and -- yes, okay -- *angry* as her earlier work. What a shame that people have to grow up and learn how to maturely deal with their emotions. This could have been the angriest album in the history of Alanis Morissette in the history of music in the history of the world.","overall":4,"summary":"Solid, but unremarkable.","unixReviewTime":1214006400,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2008"}

The singers voice is a little high, which takes some getting used to, but overall this is great music for true patriots. U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!

These songs move in and out of each other with skillful lease and cool elegance, building upon each other in rapid, fast-moving succession, making \"Interpol\" an album in the classic seventys sense. There even pops and crackles dusted over intended to resemble the sound of vinyl playing. (It should be noted that this album is available on vinyl.)Husky guitars, swelling arrangements, haunting melodies and the expressive yet icy vocal delivery of Paul Banks permeate the ten tracks. \"Safe Without\" lingers incessantly with its driving bass line and assured drumming, and \"Always Malaise (The Man I Am)\" is atmospheric and mercurial as it takes a hard, curious look at the less than enviable state of the modern man.\"Success\" catches hold instantly with its incessant guitars and slowly building melody, as does \"Memory Serves Me\" with its glittering surface and piercing refrain.\"Lights\" (not a cover of the Journey classic) sways and pulses with engaging, throbbing production and probing lyrics, and lead single \"Barricade\" easily burrows itself into memory with its catchy, highly addictive chorus and pungent, awesome guitar work. No one song calls particular attention to itself. That said, \"Summer Well\" and \"Try It On\" are clearly the more cheery songs on the record with their slightly more sprightly arrangements, while the closing duo of \"All of the Ways\" and \"The Undoing\" are the most brooding, cryptic tracks of all, bringing the album out on a high note with their heady, deliberate, highly stylized arrangements and relentlessly soul-searching lyrics. Sonically, the latter sounds not unlike a funeral march. Interpol have become an esteemed act on the independent music scene due to their consistent dedication to quality and determination to remain artistically relevant, and \"Interpol\" keeps the ante raised high. It is not designed to win many converts, but it will greatly please those already in the know. The Japanese version of the album features an additional song, \"Gavilan.\"","overall":4,"summary":"Haunting Melodies, Skillful Ease, Cool Elegance","unixReviewTime":1283817600,"reviewTime":"09 7, 2010"}
