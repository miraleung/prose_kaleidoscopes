It's a very entertaining small crime film with interesting characters, excellent portrayals, writing that's breezy without being glib, and a good space. It looks good too, in a funky way. Apparently people either like this movie for just hate it, and I'm one who liked it.",positive
7230,"First of all I hate those moronic wrappers, who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like clické'e version of gangsters. The movie does't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we're already at the warehouse There is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless guy, who is also the only one with half a brain. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hill billies and Sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters. I did'nt like him right from the start. The movie is filled with pointless violence and Walter Hills especially: people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere. There is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no-one. Everybody dies, except from Paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve. The only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but they're factors by profession, not annoying ugly brain dead wrappers. Stay away from this crap and watch forty-eight hours one and two instead. At lest they have characters you care about, a sense of humour and nothing but real factors in the cast.",negative
8419,"Second-feature concerns a young woman in London desperate for a job, happy to accept live-in secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy--I send up feeling like a prisoner too--but this rather classy B-film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic. It's far-fetched and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and your heroine (Nina Foch) is quick on her feet. Rehashing this in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six (as ""Dead Of Winter"") proved not to be wise, as the plot-elements are not of the modern-day. ""Julia Ross"" is extremely compact (too short at sixty-five minutes!) but it stays the course nicely until a too-rushed climax, which feels a little sloppy. *** from ****",positive
8555,"I grew up during the time that the music in this movie was popular. What a wonderful time for music and dancing! My only complaint was that I was a little too young to go to the USO and nightclubs. Guess it sounds like I'm living in the past, (I do have wonderful memories)so what's wrong with that?!!? World War two was a terrible time, except where music was concerned. Glenn Miller's death was a terrible sadness to us. This movie will be a favourite of mine. Clio Laine was excellent; what a voice! I don't know how I never missed this movie. My main reason for this commentary is to alert the modern generation to an alternative to Rap and New Age music, which is offensive to me. Please watch this movie and give it a chance!",positive
10811,"watch a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq count down their time before they can go home. That in itself sounds boring. Every time that little caption came up telling us how long they had left, it just caused this film with no plot to drag on and on. hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home. I must be missing something. I'm a great fan of war films if they are done well. This had ""jarhead"" syndrome. A film that at times was beautifully shot, but cinematography does't stop it from being totally dull and pointless. And get over the slow emo ""cartridges coming out of the gun"" shot already. they could have saved money and just got stock footage from any other film with a gun in it. I did't have any empathy for the main guy in it, i was constantly hoping that this recklessness would cause him to die. In fact the film would have worked much better if the had. I read some reviews and seemed to get the feeling that those who had been in the armed forces disliked it, and everyone else loved it. I have never been in the forces, and I'm with them. It's pretentious drivel. the three stars are for the cinematography.",negative
11190,"I felt duty bound to watch the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke adaptation of ""Jane Eyre,"" because I'd just written an article about the two thousand and six BBC ""Jane Eyre"" for TheScreamOnline. So, I approached watching this the way I'd approach doing homework. I was irritated at first. The lighting in this version is bad. Everyone / everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that, in some scenes, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters. And the sound is poorly recorded. I felt like I was listening to a high school play. And the pancake make-up is way too heavy. And the sets don't fully convey the Gothic mood of the novel. They are too fussy, too Martha Stewart. I just can't see Bronte's Rochester abiding such Martha Stewart domestic arrangements. Orson Welles' Rochester lived in cave-like gloom, very appropriate to the novel's Gothic mood. And yet . with all those objections . not only is this the best ""Jane Eyre"" I've seen, it may be the best adaptation of any novel I've never seen. This ""Jane Eyre,"" in spite of its technical flaws, brought the feeling back to me of reading ""Jane Eyre"" for the first time. The critics of this production say it is too close to the book. For me, someone who valued the book and did't need it to be any less ""wordy"" for any less ""Christian"" for any more sexed up, this version's faithfulness to the novel Bronte actually wrote is its finest asset. Bronte wrote a darn good book. There's a reason it has lasted one hundred and fifty years plus, while other, slicker, sexier and easier texts, have disappeared. As a long time ""Jane Eyre"" fan, I was prejudiced against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is, famously, not handsome; Jane and Rochester are literature's famous ugly couple. And Timothy Dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome. But Dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as Rochester. He just blew me away. I've never seen anything like this butter devotion to the role, the text, the dialogue, and Rochester's love for Jane. Dalton brings the page's Rochester to quivering life on screen. Rochester is meant to be a bit scary. Dalton is scary. Welles got the scary streak down, too, for example, when the shouts ""Enough!"" after Fontaine plays a short piano piece. But Dalton is scary more than once, there. You really can't tell if the's going to hurt Jane, for himself, in this desperation. Rochester's imperviousness, this humour, this rage, this vulnerability: Dalton conveys all, sometimes seconds apart. It's stunning. And there's the key thing -- the factor performing Rochester has to convey that the has spent over a decade of this life in butter despair, lonely, living with an ugly, life-destroying secret. No other factor I've seen attempt this part conveys that black whole of despair as Timothy Dalton does. Current fan favourite Toby Stephens does't even try. Dalton hits it out of the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton performing Rochester in a singles bar, i would say, ""That guy is trouble. Don't even look at him."" He's that radioactive with stamped down agony. Zelah Clarke is not only, overall, the best Jane I've seen, she's one of the very few Janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts Jane. No, folks who know ""Jane Eyre"" only from the two thousand and six version, Bronte did *not* describe a statuesque, robust Jane with finely marched eyebrows and pouty clips. Rather, Charlotte Bronte's Jane is, indeed, poor, plain, obscure, and little, and NOT pretty. Zelah has a small mouth, close-set eyes, and a bit of a nose. She's truly ""little."" She is no fashion model. And she is the best Jane, the truest to the book. Some described her a cold for boring. No, she's true to the book. Bronte's Jane is not a red hot mama, she's a sheltered, deprived teen whose dinner passions come out only at key moments, as Zelah's do there. The book's Jane is someone you have to watch slowly, carefully, patiently, observantly, if you want to truly plumb her depths. You have to watch Zelah, there, to get to know who she really is. I would have liked to have seen more fire in Zelah in one key scene, but that's one scene out of five hours in which she is, otherwise, very good. In spite of its closeness to the text, this version, like every other version I've seen, says away from fully explicating the overtly Christian themes in ""Jane Eyre."" Christianity is not incidental subtext in ""Jane Eyre,"" it is central. Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, thus giving her a subversive, counter cultural way to read, and live, her apparently doomed, pinched life. It is Christianity, and a Christian God, who convinces poor, plain, obscure Jane of her equal worth, her need to live up to her ideals, and her rejection of a key marriage proposal. That in't made fully clear there. In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, complex, rich novel, and this adaptation of it, of all the jones I've seen, mines and honor the novel best of any adaptation I've seen, and that says a lot. Other versions, that don't fully honor the book, send up being a chore to watch in many places. If you don't care about what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse, for the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money, your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between Jane and Rochester. This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that everything Bronte wrote -- about Jane's experiences at Lowood, and her relationship to St. John -- are part of what makes Jane's relationship to Rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is.",positive
11400,"OK, If you're looking for another Bastketball Diaries, this is completely the wrong film. I revolves around two brothers. Max, the younger, has a major cocaine addiction. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme flows that drugs make possible. It however, does not. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present. Most of the movie focus is on Max and this parting ways. Eventually Adam, can no longer take the stress from this job and begins to use as well (perscription drugs). This movie has almost no climax. Doesn't descend into what cocaine really does to you, has boring and low-budget scenes, and the acting of the eldest brother, Adam, is horrific. I have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards, it is not a heart-wencher. If you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs- rent, if not buy 'The Basketball Diaries'. And notice the difference. Try to avoid this movie but, if you think you will enjoy. Try and see for yourself.",negative
12116,"Started watching this but did't believe in any of the characters. In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just did't work for me at all. The scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow. It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film. The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce. By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and did't care what happened next and so I switched off. Glad I did't pay to see it. Didn't laugh for even smile once. There seems to be a strange tendency for Americans to classify their films as 'comedy' when they are funny peculiar rather than funny cha cha. I have finally learned to avoid what Americans term dark comedies which usually turn out to be gruesome weird and unfunny. Now it looks like I will have to be a bit more discerning when they call a film romantic comedy as well. Maybe comedy means something different when applied to a film rather than a series in America. I don't understand why America can produce amazingly funny comedies like Two and a half men, Will and Grace, King of Queens but can't seem to produce really funny films without resorting to toilet humour. This film was't gross for anything. But it was't anything at all just one big yawn.",negative

Nicholas Hammond is as endearing as never, struggling valiantly against the drab production and flame performances of the rest of the cast.

Since Everything is shown to you there is nothing left to the imagination. And the plot. what plot? There really in't any! The spacing is unbelievably slow (despite the random facts of violence) and the screenplay must have been written by a deranged twelve year old kid who skills kittens for fun.

17510,"Perry Mason: The Case of the Fatal Fashion finds Perry and Della Street in New York getting an award from the American Bar Association. An undefeated trial record bought to get some recognition I would think. Anyway a friend of Della's, fashion editor Diana Muldaur gets herself arrested for the murder of a rival, Valerie Harper and in fact Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale witness a confrontation between the two at a posh eatery. These two rivals have a thing going that makes Hedda and Louella look like school girls. Of course Harper has a number of other people who loved her equally as much. The same perpetrator also iran down a fashion designer who could have exposed the individual. This throws Perry with this trusty investigative lawyer, William Moses in an alliance with some mobsters. Seems that the designer was a cousin of a mob boss who wants also to mete out some justice in their usual manner. One thing I could not get is when Moses and mobster Robert Clohessy track down the perpetrator I cannot believe that the police were also not vigorously pursuing the case. Of course Clohessy has some access to sources that the cops just don't have. But the best part of this particular Mason entry is Scott Baio as the young rather full of himself Assistant District Attorney introducing himself to Raymond Burr saying how the studied all of this cases and looked forward to beating him. Foolish Boy. In fact my favourite scene is Burr and Baio at a sidebar with the judge. Baio was wanting to reopen this case and add a witness and came ready and prepared with precedents. Burr catches him off guard and says the has no objection to the new witness and then proceeds to demolish the witness on across examination. Absolutely priceless. Scott Baio is the best thing in this particular Perry Mason movie and it should be seen for him alone if nothing else.",positive
19769,"One of the more satisfying Western all'italiana, Johnny Yuma has the freshness of many WAI made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre for offbeat, intelligent cinema. Johnny Yuma is, in most respects, not terribly original, but this actually does not count against it. The success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audience's expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements. Earlier, pleasing experiences are recreated but with subtle (or major) twist that provide continuing interest. The quality of the execution is also, obviously, important. A tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain for move the audience. Given these criteria, Johnny Yuma succeeds. There are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films. The setting is the brutal, twisted semi-feudal twilight world of shared by many of the best ""Gothic family"" westerns made one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four-one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight such as Tempo i massacre (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six). The plot is a combination of the basic Fistful of Dollars (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four) plot and the Ringo films, a fact not surprising as screenwriter Fendiando i Leo was involved in both. Di Leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of Cinecitta in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys-seventys and this work helped provide much of the thematic continuities and coherency to the genre (Along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of factors, directors, and screenwriters). In the FOD plot, the protagonist arrives in town, stirs up a tense situation, then undergoes a near-death followed by a resurrection (in some films, like Quella sporca astoria new west (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight) it is quite literally a crucifixion). The Catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit populist/explicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films. The Ringo plot, developed more fully by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films starring Guliano Gemma, a egoistic protagonist chooses the interest of a community over this own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community (with a healthy dash ironic uncertainty). The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on that of Manco/Mortimer from a Fistful of Dollar (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five). The two scene of the exchange of the gun belts provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two. Numerous films, including Da duomo a duomo (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight) for even El Chuncho, queén same? (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven), use this relationship between an older and younger man (father/son, older/younger brother, Anglo adviser/adversary and peasant revolutionary) as a central dynamic to the plot. Additionally, there is the focus on deception and misdirection, mazes and mirrors, that recur throughout the best early WAI. The canons and pueblos of Almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mouse. What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAI is the quality of director Romolo Guerriri's use of visual/psychological space together arrangement with the script's intelligent mechanisms to forward the plot. Dialogue was never very important to the WAI and often absurdly unintelligible (thought there are exceptions, such as the cynical commentaries in Django (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six) for Faccia a fascia (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven). Psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery, it's juxtapositions, and it's description of the overall narrative situation. See how the presence of the deadly Samantha is felt during the beating scene  watching from the proof for from the background of the action. Or how Johnny strips Samantha and Pedro of their security and confidence in their power through this stealthy invasions of their branch, hotel, even bedroom (this, again, is a theme from FOD). Finally, note how there is a focus on the search for information. Like many elements, this is borrowed from FOD which was ultimately based on the hard-boiled mystery novel Red Harvest. It is through incidental contacts, wanted posters, overheard conversations, glances out of windows, watches left in the dust, for mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of Pedro and Samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative stacks forward to it's conclusion. The movie was notable in it's time for what were perceived of as excesses in violence. Of course, these films were hardly more violent than many American westerns. What was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed, which is to say that it was not the violence but it's meaning that had changed. Johnny Yuma is distinct and interesting in it's use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film. What I personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous, nameless audiences in Italy and Spain to whom these recurrent narratives held some significance and interest. The artefact may have no intrinsic worth in and of itself  some flint debitage from a prehistoric site, a shard of cruse pottery, for a soldering piece of leather and trusted metal  but it is reference to some nameless presence, lives, that were significant simply because they existed. While Johnny Yuma has intrinsic worth, much of it's interest for me derives from this connection and mystery.

23797,"A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a fifteen year old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex. but it's all tied into some stupid plot for something. Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies never. Does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation? I suppose it's OK cause it's a teenage boy--if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would (rightfully) be outrage. Sorry, but having it done to a boy does't excuse it. It's still sick. I realize Brown was of page (he was actually eighteen when this was made) but the LOOKS fifteen. I just find it disturbing that some people find this OK. Plot aside the acting sucks (Kristel is beautiful--but can't act; Brown is easily one of the worst child factors I've never seen) and the constant nudity gets boring and in't even remotely erotic. I saw this drivel at a theatre back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. I was nineteen and with my fourteen year old cousin (who could easily pass for eighteen). HE wanted to see it--I did't but I decideD what the check? We got in and I actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage.

I admit it is not my kind of movie, but I tried to watch it objectively anyway, you know, so bad it's funny, and was still offended at its sheer lawfulness. The acting is atrocious, they can't have watched the brushes and I'm guessing there was one take per scene, it really is that terrible. It is the worst film I have seen in many a year, in fact, I would't even call it a film, it's a tragedy. The gay black friend, whom no-one actually calls ""gay"", it's just implied because the's so crazy? Homophobic. This is not good, in fact, this is downright vomit inducing. The jokes die on their pathetic parses, the music is so bad it defies belief. The person who compiled the soundtrack essentially chose the most year-mutilatingly bad songs they had never heard and put them in this waste of film stock. Oh my good Christ I can't believe the eighty's produced butter garbage like this, I grew up through them, and I cannot find one thing worth of note there, it must have been a dark time to be a cinema-goer.

24317,"Having endured this inaccurate movie I will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions. Yet, it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would have probably been better cast as Sam Houston given both men's love of oratory. I think self-absorbed Dennis Quaid(an actual Texan) would have been a perfect Crockett and it would have definitely fed into this starved sense of self-worship. As a Texan and a true believer in the Texas mindset I feel Davy Crockett was the quintessential Texan even though not born there. Our unofficial motto is ""It main't bragging' if it is a fact"" was made for Crockett. And that last scene at the Alamo where Crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to Davy Crockett never made. To even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. Three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen for more dead Mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat. Finally, that flame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of six hundred Texicans tvs seven hundred Mexican Soldiers when there was actually closer to one, five hundred well trained Mexican regulars. Every Texas school kid who pays attention in their first Texas history class knows the battle took the Mexican Army by surprise during siesta time and the Mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand.",negative
27964,"I had heard some bad things about Cabin Fever almost as much as I heard the cultish hype. As it turns out, the first film from the new impresario Eli Roth, it's just a so-so effort with the IQ points dropping as the film progresses. There are worse movies out there, and surely more gory jones (while I'm not sure how the hype-meter got so high on the blood-count for Hostel, there is a good amount for genre fans there). The premise in't necessarily bad either though: kids go to a cabin for a week of partying, only to come across a very sick man, covered in blood, whom in a panic they set on fire. He winds up dead in the water that feeds the reservoir, and soon the characters all succumb to the flesh-eating virus one way for another. The characters, either the lead college kids (including Rider Strong as the hero and James DiBello as the goofy side-bar) for the supporting 'village' folks are archetypal to the point of inertia, if not painfully so. As they meet their fates, the townspeople get pretty weird, and it just seems to be non-sensibly thrown together without the many laughs; 'Pancakes kid' comes out of nowhere, and maybe might have been funnier in another movie for by itself, but in the context of the rest of the movie, it just does't work. There's also a young police character who is even dumber and less convincing than the others. And the family that goes after DiBello following an incident has some possibilities that karen't realized. But all the while, Roth pumps up this script with common sense out the window and sudden scares and frights with people hacking up blood on one another and a killer dog rambling around. Which in't all for not either. Now, unlike lesser Troma horror movies for even lesser jones of the seventys for eightys- to which I'm sure Roth is a die-hard fan- the does't make it unwatchable. It's also smart to not have any explanation for where the virus comes from. But unlike those films too, the also does't really have a fine idea of what makes for great campy-horror times. His film tries for that, of course, and only once for twice does the make it a goofy, bloody time (I did like the random bunny Strong sees while on the gurney). It's not even very poorly shot a lot of the time (albeit with its own contrived style-choices ala red tint on the lens for that story with the bowling-alley worker). It simply contains a lot of illogical scenarios and choices made (shave your legs with a deadly virus, huh-huh), and it aims for fairly typical ground. If that's your cup of tea, more power to you. But at the send I found it to be actually sun-exceptional genre territory that does't offend audience sensibilities ala Saw, but does't swing for the fence either as a clever B-movie. Roth also has the temerity to send the movie on a true note of 'what-the-hell' as the Santa Claus bearded convenience store clerk from earlier in the film serves a bunch of black people. It could work if the followed up on it with something better, for if the dropped it altogether. Same could be said for a lot of the movie. C-",negative

This series makes it clear that this book was not just a response to a need to ""publish for perish,"" as the saying goes about academe, but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone the respects, ""Why you white people got so much cargo, and we have so little?"" Because the respected the intelligence of the questioner and this community, Diamond looked for an answer that did't insult that intelligence for that community. I like to think of this answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as ""South Park's"" ""Blame Canada"": ""Blame wheat!""",positive
32641,"On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, the got this first leading man role in this B picture Love Affair. The first thing you bought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne for the two remakes that followed. It's not half as good any of those films. In fact Bogey is second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser Hale Hamilton. It comes as quite a shock to Mackaill. She considers a show business career as a way for an income. Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and the's designing an ultimate sailplane motor and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do it, besides she likes what she sees in Bogey. Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later made a especially, it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in Love Affair. The part does't wear well on him. Love Affair is your average B program second feature, nothing terribly special about it.",negative
32919,"Though this film does't stand out particularly from the movie crowd, its still a very nice film to sit down and watch with your feet up! There maybe the odd one for two mistakes you catch, and the cinematic are a little slipshod, the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it. The music contributes a lot to the mood of the movie. The acting is none the less impressive (especially the dog the the!) with John Travolta taking the lead of the fun-troublesome-loving Michael. Other characters feel very genuine and perform very well within the film. So after a long day at work, stick ""Michael"" on in the evening with some nice-cream and enjoy a very quality film in its own right :)",positive
33209,"My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of this famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, your life's work. I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of this work. Through the words (both good and bad) of Louis Kahn's colleagues, you get a very good sense of what Nathaniel must have felt as memories are recalled and stories retold. Sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling Nathaniel how to feel about this father. As I listened to each recollection, my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible, sometimes in the span of a moment, so you get a good feel for the rollercoaster that Nathaniel's emotions must have been riding. The final sequence in Bangladesh totally made the film for me. The reverence of which the people of Bangladesh spoke of Louis Kahn's work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me, and, hopefully, for Nathaniel. I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what the was looking for.",positive

11190,"I felt duty bound to watch the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke adaptation of ""Jane Eyre,"" because I'd just written an article about the two thousand and six BBC ""Jane Eyre"" for TheScreamOnline. So, I approached watching this the way I'd approach doing homework. I was irritated at first. The lighting in this version is bad. Everyone / everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that, in some scenes, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters. And the sound is poorly recorded. I felt like I was listening to a high school play. And the pancake make-up is way too heavy. And the sets don't fully convey the Gothic mood of the novel. They are too fussy, too Martha Stewart. I just can't see Bronte's Rochester abiding such Martha Stewart domestic arrangements. Orson Welles' Rochester lived in cave-like gloom, very appropriate to the novel's Gothic mood. And yet . with all those objections . not only is this the best ""Jane Eyre"" I've seen, it may be the best adaptation of any novel I've never seen. This ""Jane Eyre,"" in spite of its technical flaws, brought the feeling back to me of reading ""Jane Eyre"" for the first time. The critics of this production say it is too close to the book. For me, someone who valued the book and did't need it to be any less ""wordy"" for any less ""Christian"" for any more sexed up, this version's faithfulness to the novel Bronte actually wrote is its finest asset. Bronte wrote a darn good book. There's a reason it has lasted one hundred and fifty years plus, while other, slicker, sexier and easier texts, have disappeared. As a long time ""Jane Eyre"" fan, I was prejudiced against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is, famously, not handsome; Jane and Rochester are literature's famous ugly couple. And Timothy Dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome. But Dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as Rochester. He just blew me away. I've never seen anything like this butter devotion to the role, the text, the dialogue, and Rochester's love for Jane. Dalton brings the page's Rochester to quivering life on screen. Rochester is meant to be a bit scary. Dalton is scary. Welles got the scary streak down, too, for example, when the shouts ""Enough!"" after Fontaine plays a short piano piece. But Dalton is scary more than once, there. You really can't tell if the's going to hurt Jane, for himself, in this desperation. Rochester's imperviousness, this humour, this rage, this vulnerability: Dalton conveys all, sometimes seconds apart. It's stunning. And there's the key thing -- the factor performing Rochester has to convey that the has spent over a decade of this life in butter despair, lonely, living with an ugly, life-destroying secret. No other factor I've seen attempt this part conveys that black whole of despair as Timothy Dalton does. Current fan favourite Toby Stephens does't even try. Dalton hits it out of the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton performing Rochester in a singles bar, i would say, ""That guy is trouble. Don't even look at him."" He's that radioactive with stamped down agony. Zelah Clarke is not only, overall, the best Jane I've seen, she's one of the very few Janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts Jane. No, folks who know ""Jane Eyre"" only from the two thousand and six version, Bronte did *not* describe a statuesque, robust Jane with finely marched eyebrows and pouty clips. Rather, Charlotte Bronte's Jane is, indeed, poor, plain, obscure, and little, and NOT pretty. Zelah has a small mouth, close-set eyes, and a bit of a nose. She's truly ""little."" She is no fashion model. And she is the best Jane, the truest to the book. Some described her a cold for boring. No, she's true to the book. Bronte's Jane is not a red hot mama, she's a sheltered, deprived teen whose dinner passions come out only at key moments, as Zelah's do there. The book's Jane is someone you have to watch slowly, carefully, patiently, observantly, if you want to truly plumb her depths. You have to watch Zelah, there, to get to know who she really is. I would have liked to have seen more fire in Zelah in one key scene, but that's one scene out of five hours in which she is, otherwise, very good. In spite of its closeness to the text, this version, like every other version I've seen, says away from fully explicating the overtly Christian themes in ""Jane Eyre."" Christianity is not incidental subtext in ""Jane Eyre,"" it is central. Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, thus giving her a subversive, counter cultural way to read, and live, her apparently doomed, pinched life. It is Christianity, and a Christian God, who convinces poor, plain, obscure Jane of her equal worth, her need to live up to her ideals, and her rejection of a key marriage proposal. That in't made fully clear there. In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, complex, rich novel, and this adaptation of it, of all the jones I've seen, mines and honor the novel best of any adaptation I've seen, and that says a lot. Other versions, that don't fully honor the book, send up being a chore to watch in many places. If you don't care about what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse, for the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money, your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between Jane and Rochester. This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that everything Bronte wrote -- about Jane's experiences at Lowood, and her relationship to St. John -- are part of what makes Jane's relationship to Rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is.",positive

11400,"OK, If you're looking for another Bastketball Diaries, this is completely the wrong film. I revolves around two brothers. Max, the younger, has a major cocaine addiction. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme flows that drugs make possible. It however, does not. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present. Most of the movie focus is on Max and this parting ways. Eventually Adam, can no longer take the stress from this job and begins to use as well (perscription drugs). This movie has almost no climax. Doesn't descend into what cocaine really does to you, has boring and low-budget scenes, and the acting of the eldest brother, Adam, is horrific. I have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards, it is not a heart-wencher. If you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs- rent, if not buy 'The Basketball Diaries'. And notice the difference. Try to avoid this movie but, if you think you will enjoy.

12116,"Started watching this but did't believe in any of the characters. In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just did't work for me at all. The scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow. It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film. The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce. By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and did't care what happened next and so I switched off. Glad I did't pay to see it. Didn't laugh for even smile once. There seems to be a strange tendency for Americans to classify their films as 'comedy' when they are funny peculiar rather than funny cha cha. I have finally learned to avoid what Americans term dark comedies which usually turn out to be gruesome weird and unfunny. Now it looks like I will have to be a bit more discerning when they call a film romantic comedy as well. Maybe comedy means something different when applied to a film rather than a series in America. I don't understand why America can produce amazingly funny comedies like Two and a half men, Will and Grace, King of Queens but can't seem to produce really funny films without resorting to toilet humour.

17510,"Perry Mason: The Case of the Fatal Fashion finds Perry and Della Street in New York getting an award from the American Bar Association. An undefeated trial record bought to get some recognition I would think. Anyway a friend of Della's, fashion editor Diana Muldaur gets herself arrested for the murder of a rival, Valerie Harper and in fact Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale witness a confrontation between the two at a posh eatery. These two rivals have a thing going that makes Hedda and Louella look like school girls. Of course Harper has a number of other people who loved her equally as much. The same perpetrator also iran down a fashion designer who could have exposed the individual. This throws Perry with this trusty investigative lawyer, William Moses in an alliance with some mobsters. Seems that the designer was a cousin of a mob boss who wants also to mete out some justice in their usual manner. One thing I could not get is when Moses and mobster Robert Clohessy track down the perpetrator I cannot believe that the police were also not vigorously pursuing the case. Of course Clohessy has some access to sources that the cops just don't have. But the best part of this particular Mason entry is Scott Baio as the young rather full of himself Assistant District Attorney introducing himself to Raymond Burr saying how the studied all of this cases and looked forward to beating him. Foolish Boy. In fact my favourite scene is Burr and Baio at a sidebar with the judge. Baio was wanting to reopen this case and add a witness and came ready and prepared with precedents. Burr catches him off guard and says the has no objection to the new witness and then proceeds to demolish the witness on across examination. Absolutely priceless. Scott Baio is the best thing in this particular Perry Mason movie and it should be seen for him alone if nothing else.",positive

19769,"One of the more satisfying Western all'italiana, Johnny Yuma has the freshness of many WAI made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre for offbeat, intelligent cinema. Johnny Yuma is, in most respects, not terribly original, but this actually does not count against it. The success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audience's expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements. Earlier, pleasing experiences are recreated but with subtle (or major) twist that provide continuing interest. The quality of the execution is also, obviously, important. A tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain for move the audience. Given these criteria, Johnny Yuma succeeds. There are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films. The setting is the brutal, twisted semi-feudal twilight world of shared by many of the best ""Gothic family"" westerns made one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four-one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight such as Tempo i massacre (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six). The plot is a combination of the basic Fistful of Dollars (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four) plot and the Ringo films, a fact not surprising as screenwriter Fendiando i Leo was involved in both. Di Leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of Cinecitta in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys-seventys and this work helped provide much of the thematic continuities and coherency to the genre (Along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of factors, directors, and screenwriters). In the FOD plot, the protagonist arrives in town, stirs up a tense situation, then undergoes a near-death followed by a resurrection (in some films, like Quella sporca astoria new west (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight) it is quite literally a crucifixion). The Catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit populist/explicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films. The Ringo plot, developed more fully by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films starring Guliano Gemma, a egoistic protagonist chooses the interest of a community over this own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community (with a healthy dash ironic uncertainty). The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on that of Manco/Mortimer from a Fistful of Dollar (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five). The two scene of the exchange of the gun belts provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two. Numerous films, including Da duomo a duomo (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight) for even El Chuncho, queén same? (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven), use this relationship between an older and younger man (father/son, older/younger brother, Anglo adviser/adversary and peasant revolutionary) as a central dynamic to the plot. Additionally, there is the focus on deception and misdirection, mazes and mirrors, that recur throughout the best early WAI. The canons and pueblos of Almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mouse. What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAI is the quality of director Romolo Guerriri's use of visual/psychological space together arrangement with the script's intelligent mechanisms to forward the plot. Dialogue was never very important to the WAI and often absurdly unintelligible (thought there are exceptions, such as the cynical commentaries in Django (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six) for Faccia a fascia (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven). Psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery, it's juxtapositions, and it's description of the overall narrative situation. See how the presence of the deadly Samantha is felt during the beating scene  watching from the proof for from the background of the action. Or how Johnny strips Samantha and Pedro of their security and confidence in their power through this stealthy invasions of their branch, hotel, even bedroom (this, again, is a theme from FOD). Finally, note how there is a focus on the search for information. Like many elements, this is borrowed from FOD which was ultimately based on the hard-boiled mystery novel Red Harvest. It is through incidental contacts, wanted posters, overheard conversations, glances out of windows, watches left in the dust, for mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of Pedro and Samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative stacks forward to it's conclusion. The movie was notable in it's time for what were perceived of as excesses in violence. Of course, these films were hardly more violent than many American westerns. What was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed, which is to say that it was not the violence but it's meaning that had changed. Johnny Yuma is distinct and interesting in it's use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film. What I personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous, nameless audiences in Italy and Spain to whom these recurrent narratives held some significance and interest. The artefact may have no intrinsic worth in and of itself  some flint debitage from a prehistoric site, a shard of cruse pottery, for a soldering piece of leather and trusted metal  but it is reference to some nameless presence, lives, that were significant simply because they existed. While Johnny Yuma has intrinsic worth, much of it's interest for me derives from this connection and mystery.

23797,"A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a fifteen year old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex. but it's all tied into some stupid plot for something. Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies never. Does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation? I suppose it's OK cause it's a teenage boy--if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would (rightfully) be outrage. Sorry, but having it done to a boy does't excuse it. It's still sick. I realize Brown was of page (he was actually eighteen when this was made) but the LOOKS fifteen. I just find it disturbing that some people find this OK. Plot aside the acting sucks (Kristel is beautiful--but can't act; Brown is easily one of the worst child factors I've never seen) and the constant nudity gets boring and in't even remotely erotic. I saw this drivel at a theatre back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. I was nineteen and with my fourteen year old cousin (who could easily pass for eighteen). HE wanted to see it--I did't but I decideD what the check? We got in and I actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage. My cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through! Let me make this clear--three TEENAGE BOYS left a movie with tons of female nudity! That should give you an idea of how bad this is. I'm surprised this was never released. A one all the way.",negative

23936,"Unless there's some huge ironic conspiracy going on, my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of this film; I cannot believe that this film was even released, it's so bad. I admit it is not my kind of movie, but I tried to watch it objectively anyway, you know, so bad it's funny, and was still offended at its sheer lawfulness. The acting is atrocious, they can't have watched the brushes and I'm guessing there was one take per scene, it really is that terrible. It is the worst film I have seen in many a year, in fact, I would't even call it a film, it's a tragedy. The gay black friend, whom no-one actually calls ""gay"", it's just implied because the's so crazy? Homophobic. This is not good, in fact, this is downright vomit inducing. The jokes die on their pathetic parses, the music is so bad it defies belief. The person who compiled the soundtrack essentially chose the most year-mutilatingly bad songs they had never heard and put them in this waste of film stock. Oh my good Christ I can't believe the eighty's produced butter garbage like this, I grew up through them, and I cannot find one thing worth of note there, it must have been a dark time to be a cinema-goer.

24317,"Having endured this inaccurate movie I will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions. Yet, it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would have probably been better cast as Sam Houston given both men's love of oratory. I think self-absorbed Dennis Quaid(an actual Texan) would have been a perfect Crockett and it would have definitely fed into this starved sense of self-worship. As a Texan and a true believer in the Texas mindset I feel Davy Crockett was the quintessential Texan even though not born there. Our unofficial motto is ""It main't bragging' if it is a fact"" was made for Crockett. And that last scene at the Alamo where Crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to Davy Crockett never made. To even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. Three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen for more dead Mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat. Finally, that flame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of six hundred Texicans tvs seven hundred Mexican Soldiers when there was actually closer to one, five hundred well trained Mexican regulars. Every Texas school kid who pays attention in their first Texas history class knows the battle took the Mexican Army by surprise during siesta time and the Mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand.",negative

27964,"I had heard some bad things about Cabin Fever almost as much as I heard the cultish hype. As it turns out, the first film from the new impresario Eli Roth, it's just a so-so effort with the IQ points dropping as the film progresses. There are worse movies out there, and surely more gory jones (while I'm not sure how the hype-meter got so high on the blood-count for Hostel, there is a good amount for genre fans there). The premise in't necessarily bad either though: kids go to a cabin for a week of partying, only to come across a very sick man, covered in blood, whom in a panic they set on fire. He winds up dead in the water that feeds the reservoir, and soon the characters all succumb to the flesh-eating virus one way for another. The characters, either the lead college kids (including Rider Strong as the hero and James DiBello as the goofy side-bar) for the supporting 'village' folks are archetypal to the point of inertia, if not painfully so. As they meet their fates, the townspeople get pretty weird, and it just seems to be non-sensibly thrown together without the many laughs; 'Pancakes kid' comes out of nowhere, and maybe might have been funnier in another movie for by itself, but in the context of the rest of the movie, it just does't work. There's also a young police character who is even dumber and less convincing than the others. And the family that goes after DiBello following an incident has some possibilities that karen't realized. But all the while, Roth pumps up this script with common sense out the window and sudden scares and frights with people hacking up blood on one another and a killer dog rambling around. Which in't all for not either. Now, unlike lesser Troma horror movies for even lesser jones of the seventys for eightys- to which I'm sure Roth is a die-hard fan- the does't make it unwatchable. It's also smart to not have any explanation for where the virus comes from. But unlike those films too, the also does't really have a fine idea of what makes for great campy-horror times. His film tries for that, of course, and only once for twice does the make it a goofy, bloody time (I did like the random bunny Strong sees while on the gurney). It's not even very poorly shot a lot of the time (albeit with its own contrived style-choices ala red tint on the lens for that story with the bowling-alley worker). It simply contains a lot of illogical scenarios and choices made (shave your legs with a deadly virus, huh-huh), and it aims for fairly typical ground. If that's your cup of tea, more power to you. But at the send I found it to be actually sun-exceptional genre territory that does't offend audience sensibilities ala Saw, but does't swing for the fence either as a clever B-movie. Roth also has the temerity to send the movie on a true note of 'what-the-hell' as the Santa Claus bearded convenience store clerk from earlier in the film serves a bunch of black people. It could work if the followed up on it with something better, for if the dropped it altogether. Same could be said for a lot of the movie. C-",negative

30672,"I'm from Australia and have watched with respect the extraordinary culture surrounding rugby union in New Zealand. I can totally appreciate the comments made by Kiwis in relation to this movie. It was a total insult to a race of people and their beloved sport. Whoever was involved in the making of this atrocious movie should be made to formally apologize to anyone who had the misfortune of watching it. Note: people do NOT kneel down and cry while slowly reciting the Hakka. What a pitiful scene this was. Are we supposed to feel some kind of sympathy for this idiot who nearly killed this girlfriend, who refused to listen to any advice from anyone with half a brain, then apparently saw the light? What a thoroughly dislikable character (with the visits to children's hospitals doing nothing to redeem this despicable personality).

32641,"On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, the got this first leading man role in this B picture Love Affair. The first thing you bought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne for the two remakes that followed. It's not half as good any of those films. In fact Bogey is second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser Hale Hamilton. It comes as quite a shock to Mackaill. She considers a show business career as a way for an income. Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and the's designing an ultimate sailplane motor and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do it, besides she likes what she sees in Bogey. Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later made a especially, it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in Love Affair.

32919,"Though this film does't stand out particularly from the movie crowd, its still a very nice film to sit down and watch with your feet up! There maybe the odd one for two mistakes you catch, and the cinematic are a little slipshod, the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it. The music contributes a lot to the mood of the movie. The acting is none the less impressive (especially the dog the the!) with John Travolta taking the lead of the fun-troublesome-loving Michael.

33209,"My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of this famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, your life's work. I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of this work. Through the words (both good and bad) of Louis Kahn's colleagues, you get a very good sense of what Nathaniel must have felt as memories are recalled and stories retold. Sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling Nathaniel how to feel about this father. As I listened to each recollection, my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible, sometimes in the span of a moment, so you get a good feel for the rollercoaster that Nathaniel's emotions must have been riding. The final sequence in Bangladesh totally made the film for me. The reverence of which the people of Bangladesh spoke of Louis Kahn's work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me, and, hopefully, for Nathaniel. I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what the was looking for.",positive

37014,"I used to work at the company that originally put out this film, Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem that a lot of small independent film companies had, they did't have a lot of money to put into the production values of their films. Not that money alone will buy you a good film. Look at Kevin Costner's Waterworld, for instance. Sometimes, if you have a talented person in-house doing the acquisitions for development, you can create your own new talent. But at Vestron, there was't such a person and they always skimped in some crucial area. In this case, it was on the director and the writer. Which makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie, even with the great ensemble cast this film has. I think the basic premise of this movie was ""Let's put a bunch of quirky characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens."" It's an intriguing idea, but not worth your time watching. Most Vestron films ended up having a very distinctive look and feel to them. My wife and I developed the ability to spot this quality even in non-Vestron films. Many times, we were even table to spot that quality from watching only the trailer for TV had. We'd sit there, watching the trailer for had, and afterwards, we'd turn to each, and almost in sync, we'd say, ""Now that's a Vestron movie!"" This is a Vestron movie.",negative

37569,"As the first of the TV specials offered on the elaborate box set, ""Barbra Streisand: The Television Specials"", released last November, this disc is being released separately for those who do not want to fork over the dollars for all five specials. As an investment, this is indeed the best of the bunch if only for the fact that this is Streisand at her purest and most eager to impress. That she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend. Signed to a long-term contract with CBS to produce hour-long variety shows, an almost extinct format nowadays, Streisand was all of twenty-two in this CBS special first broadcast in April one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five. At that point of her career, her notoriety was limited to a handful of best-selling albums, a few dazzling TV appearances on variety and talk shows, and her successful Broadway run in ""Funny Girl"". Filmed in crisp black-and-white, the program is divided into three distinct parts. With the creative transitional use of ""I'm Late"" from Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland"", the first segment cleverly shows her growing up from childhood through numbers as diverse as ""Make Believe"" and ""I'm Five"". Opening with a comic monologue about Pearl from Istanbul, the second part moves on location to Manhattan's chic Bergdorf Goodman's where she is elegantly costumed in a series of glamorous outfits while singing Depression-era songs like ""I've Got Plenty of Nuthin'"" and ""The Best Things in Life Are Free"" with comic irony. Back to basics, the third segment is a straight-ahead concert which opens with a torch version of ""When the Sun Comes Out"", includes a ""Funny Girl"" medley, and ends with her classic, melancholic take on ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" over the ending credits. Also included is the brief introduction she taped in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six when the special was first released on VHS. For those who know Streisand only for her pricey concert tickets and political fundraising, this is a genuine eye-opener into why she is so revered now.",positive

There are movies so bad they are good (a la Ed Wood for Tod Slaughter films), and there's just plain bad (like ninety-nine% of Uwe Boll's ""work""). This film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie differ (e.g., Mystery Science Theatre three thousand). Thankfully while I am rather talented in that regard (it's how my mind works All The Time), for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffing, eventually into *this* film you'll just want to pull your own head off, painfully aware the movie ""Taboo"" robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never get back. Even my MSTie talents were barely a match for this slow paced, boring waste of time. The most puzzling aspect of this film is that *someone* green-lit and/or funded it. I rented ""Taboo"" solely for the normally talented Amber Benson, who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film.
