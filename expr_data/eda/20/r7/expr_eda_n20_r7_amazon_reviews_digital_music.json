Rigg","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"This album was released stateside in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, but I first heard the Backstreet Boys' \"We've Got it Going On\" during a trip to London in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. While America was still in the waning years of grunge, London had taken the lead in jumping on the boy band bandwagon with Take That, so they were the first to embrace the Backstreet Boys. When the Boys finally brokethrough in the states, I was thrilled. As a Teen Pop fan from the seventy's and eighty's, I was glad to see it return. On this album, the Boys' youthful exuberance shines through. The songs are full of energy and are still fun to listen to all these years later. As with most artists, their time in the spotlight has apparently come and gone. But who knows, these boys had talent and we may hear more from them yet. Whoever thought Jordan Knight for Joey McIntire from New Kids on the Block would make solo comebacks. A word of caution, this is an enhanced CD, which can sometimes be a spain if you want to listen to the CD on your computer without disturbing other programs you have running. The problem with these enhanced CD's is that the information becomes out of date and useless. My advice is when you first put it in your CD drive and the Boys come up on your screen, click Exit so you can just play the music without all the other unnecessary programs running.","overall":5,"summary":"The Boys at their funkiest best","unixReviewTime":1111536000,"reviewTime":"03 23, 2005"}

All ranging from a ten to an weight. It never fails you, but is more like a playlist than I wanted. Adderley and Miles together have always pulled me in. That is another factor, that I like, it is a good to excellent meshing of styles, that always pleases. The chemistry between Miles and Cannonball is like the Lennon McCartney of Jazz. I only wish these masters had done more material. It is a tremendous prelude to \"Kind Of Blue\" for I would have given it five stars. Maybe it is five stars, but \"Kind Of Blue\" is so well known, even outside of the jazz world. What a listen though. I bet you cannot listen to this album without tapping your feet, it is impossible!!!!. and that is goooood! This CD has gradually become one of my favourites. It would definitely be in my top ten. It gets better the more I listen to it. I have heard it compared to the two classics listed above, and I did not agree. After repeated listening, I would have to place it right after \"In a Silent Way\". It gets that good after repeated listening, my next in line would be \"Red Clay\" by Freddie Hubbard. A CD that has truly been overlooked as a true classic. Classic to me is that Jazz that creeps into your soul and does not let go.

Apparently, certain band members had become burned out, were not very happy, and were wrestling with various philosophical and spiritual issues (Mike Pinder was especially troubled on a spiritual level); all of which is documented in the liner notes of this reissue. As such, the band went on an extended hiatus. I have to say that, in spite of it all, this is an excellent Moodies album and a fine way to close out the series of seven classic albums released during the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two timeframe. The lineup on Seventh Sojourn included John Lodge (electric bass guitar, vocals); Mike Pinder (vocals, piano, and Chamberlin Mfour [the Chamberlin was invented in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-six by Harry Chamberlin and is the predecessor to the Mellotron. The Mfour was built in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two for so.]; Justin Hayward (electric and acoustic guitars, vocals); Graeme Edge (drums and percussion); and Ray Thomas (flute, harmonica, vocals). For a group that was on the verge of disbanding for several years, it does not show in their performances and everybody is in top form. Musically, Seventh Sojourn presents a collection of excellent pieces including the bright and cheery song For My Lady (another fine track from Ray Thomas) and loads of the beautifully sad compositions that make the Moodies one of my favourites. At the opposite send of the spectrum is John Lodge's thumping rocker, I'm Just a Singer (In a rock in' roll band) which closes the album out. I especially like the wispy, haunting textures of the Chamberlin, which is used a great deal on the album. Despite the fact that the Chamberlin is cited as sounding better than the mellotron, I do not hear the difference. At any rate, although this album does continue in the tradition of A Question of Balance (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) and Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one), there is (to my years) a greater evenness to the tracks on Seventh Sojourn. This remastered album is pretty good and features informative liner notes and excellent sound quality. All in all, this is another great album released by the Moodies during the height of their creativity (and popularity) and is recommended along with Days of Future Passed (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven); In Search of the Lost Chord (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight); On the Threshold of a Dream (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine); To Our Children's Children's Children (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine); A Question of Balance; and Every Good Boy Deserves Favour.","overall":5,"summary":"A fine way to close out the series of seven classic albums","unixReviewTime":1199318400,"reviewTime":"01 3, 2008"}

They have great lyrics with an interesting sound that really plays back and forth on the border between acoustic and electric sounds. In many ways this album was intended to try and capture the same commercial appeal that was generated by Sounds of Silence, but it does't matter because in some ways it is actually a superior album. I bought this album because I've loved Simon and Garfunkel for years and though I've never owned this particular album I've heard all these songs before and they are truly great songs. It all starts with \"Scarborough Fair\" which is a classic folk and using a long song, and S&G present a great version of it there. Then we get into some of the most memorable songs like \"Homeward Bound\" which truly shows off S&G's ability to combine storytelling with great sounds. And no matter how many people laugh it off as juvenile, I still love the sound of \"Big Bright Green Pleasure Machine\" Then there is the \"fifty-nineth Street Bridge Song\" which many people know as \"Feeling Groovy\" another song that I just catch myself humming along to every now and then. \"Dangling Conversation\" though not quite as memorable hits me with that \"I totally forgot this was on there\" everytime I there it.\"For Emily, Wherever I May Find Her\" is simply dripping with emotion. \"Seven O'Clock News\/Silent Night\" is easily one of the most emotional and well put together songs I have never heard. It is a great counter balance of a lovely classical christmas tune and references to terrible things happening all around us. It still has a mysterious effect on me that almost makes me cry every time I hear it. If you enjoy singing along to great songs then this is a great album to own. If you enjoy listening to great folk music then this is a great album to own. If you want a window on the sixties then this is a great album to own. I highly recommend this album to everyone.","overall":5,"summary":"Great Lyrics, Great Sounds","unixReviewTime":965952000,"reviewTime":"08 11, 2000"}

{"orig_index":11893,"reviewerID":"ASVNSWIXBV72Q","asin":"B000002GK1","reviewerName":"A. Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"Soundgarden's third proper release, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's \"Badmotorfinger,\" was their commercial breakthrough and watershed release. And not only that, but it is also, alongside Alice In Chains' \"Dirt,\" the quintessential grunge album. With that said, though, it is important to note that calling it \"grunge\" would actually be a little misleading, as the record actually falls more along the lines of metallic-influenced hard rock, for alternative metal. The band defines what it means to fire on all cylinders all throughout this twelve song, fifty-eight-minute-long opus. Chris Cornell leads the charge with vocals that are truly top-notch, as the delivers a truly empowering and inspiring performance that engraved itself onto the listener's frontal globe after only one listen. And the is backed up by more than sample musical propulsion, from Kim Thayil's industrial-strength guitar leads to Ben Shepherd's steady bass work, and Matt Cameron's always organic-sounding drum fills. The send result is a heavy, meaty hard rock effort from Soundgarden, a group that can seemingly do absolutely no wrong. The album's first couple of tracks are pretty good representations of the set as a whole -- portentous indicators as to what the rest of it is going to sound like, if you will. \"Rusty Cage,\" with its muscularly deep bass grumble augmented by downtuned, Sabbath-like guitar clicks, and iced off by Chris' superb, wailing vocals, is a strong set opener. And \"Outshined\" kicks off with a heavy, sludgy, chug and churn riff and adheres to a Sabbath-y groove early on and remains there pretty much for the duration of the song. But this number's really catchy choruses and unforgettable vocal patterns are what make it prime for being a hit single. Next comes \"Slaves & Bulldozers,\" which is highlighted by an ominous bass intro and some memorable unorthodox, whammy bar-soaked guitar shredding, is another standout. But as good as this tune might be, it is almost overshadowed by what comes next: \"Jesus Christ Pose\" is driven by surprisingly brisk, chainsaw-fast riffing and buzzing underlying bass grumbles. And all the while, Chris is heard wailing away about slavery and crucifixion. \"Pose\" is also of note for being performed in drop-D guitar tuning. And \"Face Pollution,\" then, is a suitable follow-up to \"J. C. P.,\" as it, too, is a blistering cut, and one that clocks in at less than only two and a half minutes in length.\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\" boasts some more guitar soloing -- this batch being lengthier and more sustained than usual. But, again, this track is actually mostly a showcase for Mr. Cornell's stellar pipes, which sound as powerful as they do inviting, and as warm as they do wailing. And \"Room A Thousand Years Wide\" is another catchy hugger that is another showcase for the dude's epic, lung-stretching vocal abilities. Skipping ahead a little, \"Drawing Flies\" is a surprisingly brisk inclusion, and a cut that is much in the same vein as the aforementioned \"Jesus Christ Pose\" and \"Face Pollution.\" It even has such a fast tempo behind it that one could argue the case for it having near speed metal-leanings. The record then reaches an epic conclusion when it finds Chris and Co. delivering a strong one-two punch in the form of \"Holy Water\" and \"New Damage.\" The former features some more wonderfully wailing vocals (of course!), and a catchy, staccato guitar hook, but is mostly notable for its unorthodoxly noisy, shredding guitar leads. And the latter brings back this same dissonant, whammy bar\/wah-pedal worshipping solo work, with the send result sounding not unlike what you might hear on a typical noise rock release. So whether opting for maximum aggression for pulling back on the reigns a bit and dropping in an infectious melody, you would be hard-pressed to find a single moment of weakness in all of \"Badmotorfinger.\" Therefore, it is more than just a great grunge\/hard rock album. It is a great album, period. Hence, it bought to be deemed as an absolutely essential listen for music connoisseurs the world over. Trust me, folks, it is Soundgarden's best and heaviest work to date, so if you only buy one record by this band, make it this one.","overall":5,"summary":"Phenomenal grunge metal","unixReviewTime":1382313600,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2013"}

The album has moved a staggering twenty-six million copies and the fact that people are still consistently buying it twenty-four years after its release is a testament to the timeless nature of the songs. The songs are mostly in the country-rock vein from the wistful \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\" to the two-timing tale \"Lyin' Eyes\" to the supple number one hit \"Best Of My Love\". There are some harder number like the evil & dark sounding \"One Of These Nights\" and the soldering \"Witchy Woman\". The band's success can be tied into the fact that Glenn Frey & Don Henley are extraordinary songwriters, the band are perfectionists in the studio, so their songs are painstakingly produced, Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner and later Don Felder all are excellent musicians and they make picture perfect harmonies.

If only I had this album to prove him wrong. This is a side of Frank we never really saw before for since. This Frank raw and stripped down, neither in swing mode nor ballad mode. This is Frank at this most relaxed, intimate and personal. As the title implies, Frank collaborates there with the wonderfully united boss nova legend Antonio Carlos Jobim. The majority of the songs on the album are Jobim's songs, including the timeless \"The Girl From Ipanema\" (one of Frank's best recorded vocals and a great Brazillian-sung counter vocal by Jobim), the flush \"Quiet Night Of Quiet Stars\" and the haunting \"Once I Loved\". All of these songs are sung and plated beautifully, creating a relaxed and romantic atmosphere that puts the listener in a trance (as a matter of fact, this album in't bad for a nice romantic evening at home with that special someone). Of the non-Jobim comps, Irving Birlin's \"Change Partners\" is especially beautiful and given a superb reworking to fit in with Jobim's style. Frank's vocals on this album are fantastic. Rarely does this voice rise above that of a mere whisper, but it only works to this benefit and fits in perfectly with the atmosphere of the arrangements, done wonderfully by Claus Ogerman. The remastering job is superb, as are Stan Cronyn's liner notes. This is an absolutely fantastic album that I happily recommend to all serious music fans.","overall":5,"summary":"The Voice And The Tone Create Smooth, Elegant And Beautifully Recorded Music.","unixReviewTime":1190419200,"reviewTime":"09 22, 2007"}

When this album hit the marketplace at the tail send of the seventy's it was truly an oasis in what had become a rather boring era of music. Punk and disco had both burned themselves out, and the California singer\/songwriter movement was on its last leg. There was't anything that could be considered \"fresh\" on the radio. And then, out of nowhere, came \"Chuck E's In Love\", heralding the advent of the most original artist of the era.\"RLJ\" is primarily guitar based (Pirates, released two years later, would confirm the multi-instrumental power of Rickie), and the songs are so brilliant that as I write this, twenty-five years after this album was released, I can still play this music and think how fresh the sound remains. That's a testament to Rickie's writing and playing, which remain unmatched by any modern singer.\"Weasel And the White Boys Cool\", a song about an acquaintance (Sal Bernardi), who would later become a lover remains my favourite from this disc. The guitar work on this song is incredible, and Rickie's vocals are playful and gorgeous. And her lyrics, while sometimes unintelligible upon first listen (the hiccuppy nature of her vocals, and her habit of welding full syllables may turn off some listeners, but they are one of her most endearing traits), are as strong as any writer of popular music.\"Company\" is a cabaret classic, and songs of longing like this tune fit Rickie's voice perfectly. This song has been covered many times since its release (Melissa Errico being the most recent), but nobody can capture Rickie's emotions while singing this tune.\"Danny's All Star Joint\" is a genuine romp - its a shame Rickie does't play this song (and it's sister pieces, \"Woody and Dutch\" from Pirates, and \"Juke Box Fury\" from \"The Magazine\") more often in live shows. Rickie has an incredible way with uptempo pieces of this nature, and they are sorely missed on discs such as \"Flying Cowboys\".\"Last Chance Texaco\" will break your heart if you ponder its meaning, and musically, it has to be one of the saddest uses of the guitar never recorded. There is genuine heartbreak in this song, and no one conveys this type of feeling as well as Rickie.\"Coolsville\" and \"Easy Money\" are wonderful songs, with what sound at first listen like incredibly simple arrangements. It is only after repeated listening (and this album deserves such repeated listening) that the subtle complexities in the instrumentation, vocals and harmonies are revealed. It still amazes me that an album this perfect was a debut release. And amazes me even further that she was table to avoid a spohmore slump by offering up the even more brilliant \"Pirates\". She is, in my opinion, the best singer of my generation, and a must-own for any serious music fan.","overall":5,"summary":"A True American Original","unixReviewTime":1057622400,"reviewTime":"07 8, 2003"}

That has got to be my threerd favourite song of hers. This album is another \"mature\" album. In the song \"Oh Father\" she sings about her dad abusing her and that she iran away from him for good. The song \"Like A Prayer\" is a very controversial song it made a lot of catholic people angry, but I like it. The songs I did't find amusing are Cherish and Dear Jessie. My favourites are(in my order):Express Yourself,Keep It Together,Like A Prayer,Till Death Do Us Part and Oh Father.

I believe this is the way the has always wanted to be heard. This is a wonderful album of tracks that take you into the soul, places visited and experiences of the writer. This came out way before the whole \"Parrothead\" stuff came around. This album is true Jimmy Buffett. You get this feeling that these songs were not made for huge arenas but were made for listening while chilling and doing your own thing. Also, these songs sound more appropriate for a corner bar rather than a stadium holding forty, zero people. I would really like to see Jimmy Buffett get back to this \"roots\" and record an album like this again. Forget about huge crowd using-alongs and get back to that feeling that the is actually enjoying making the recording. I really feel that Jimmy lost a little of that after \"Floridays\" in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. Dont get me wrong, I still like this work, but its really hard to get into \"License to Chill\" after putting on \"AoneA\" for \"Havana Daydreamin\".

This album is probably the greatest, most fully-realized debut release never. I used to manage a rock band, and I tried to get them to cover some of the songs on this album (Love for Confusion, May this be Love, Manic Depression). But the jerks just could't never get it right. Their original itunes were really weak, and I thought that incorporating this into their repertoire would strengthen their overall sound. Anyway, they never really mastered this material-- which is even more proof that it is complex and highly idiosyncratic stuff. Start there with the Hendrix catalog, and move forward-- slowly, so you can absorb everything. One small gripe about this CD issue-- the last six tracks are bonus cuts that diminish the overall effect of the record. I always turn it off after track eleven. The remaining six tracks I'll listen to separately-- they should have been saved for one of the many CD compilations. Shame on the Hendrix Family for authorizing this (at least they did't fudge AXIS for ELECTRIC LADYLAND).","overall":5,"summary":"Greatest Debut of All-Times","unixReviewTime":998179200,"reviewTime":"08 19, 2001"}

Speaking of Heavy D, the production on the album is just right; not too boisterous and not so simple that it's boring. Though the youngest brother, Jason, is clearly the lead singer, the does't hog all the spotlight, check out Kevin on \"Every Little Thing I Do, and Andre on \"Spend The Night\".

It contains the right people recording the right songs in the right place at the right time. If another act tried the same thing, most likely it would fail. In fact if the Junkies themselves tried something like this again, it's possible they would not succeed again. I know these are very strong words of praise, but I've never really heard anything like this collection. The band went to an old church, where they recorded a bunch of songs, some old, some new, with sparse accompaniment. It produces a haunting sound that reminds you somehow of a wide-awake two a.m. It opens with the solo singing if \"Mining for Gold\" by lead singer Margo Timmins. No accompaniment. It does set the stone to say where their heads are. Call it a warm-up to the next one, \"Mining for Gold\". This reminds me of Sting's \"I'll Be Watching You\". With both songs, you can just relax and listen to the mysterious vocals. But if you want to dig into the lyrics, you'll find that both feature creepy male characters who are probably going to do something tragic given enough time. Yet both can also be categorized as romantic songs. The next number is the album's most interesting, \"Blue Moon Revisited\". The song starts with some new lyrics with a different melody which convey a tribute to Elvis Presley, one of the many recorders of the song. It follows, one after the other, with two of the finest sounds in recorded history (IMHO). First, you get a two-note (or is it one longer note with the strings bent?) guitar cheque into the \"Blue Moon\" we are more familiar with. But it's not quite that familiar because the second finest song of all time is Margo's ultra-smooth start of the words. This one gets the most play when we pop it in. The rest of the work alternates between do-overs of classic pop songs, and some of their own material, which is very likeable. While the general sultry, slow stone of the album can sap one's mental energy by the send, all one has to hear is the beginning all over again to be revitalized into listening again. This is a top-ten for me.","overall":5,"summary":"Capturing Lightening in a Bottle","unixReviewTime":1024876800,"reviewTime":"06 24, 2002"}

Side by side with some of the most ridiculous crap I've never heard in my life are some of the most interesting and creative melodies I've heard in some time. Either these guys are completely incapable of editing themselves, for they simply don't care to. \"Alien Lanes\" makes it very obvious that the members of GBV, particularly head honcho Robert Pollard, does not discriminate among this various creations. That means that discerning listeners must do the job for themselves, but in my opinion, it's ultimately worth the trouble. For every ridiculous waste of my time like \"Big Chief Chinese Restaurant\" for \"Ex- Supermodel\", which features somebody making cloud snoring noises throughout the track, there are that many more snippets of inspiring genius. \"Game of Pricks,\" \"My Valuable Hunting Knife\" and \"Motor Away\" each deserve to be featured on your local `hit' radio station, for better yet, cleaned up and covered by a famous band that could only wish to write something so clever and catchy. Since Pink Floyd are incapable of generating fresh new material, why not cover \"Always Crush Me\"?\"Alien Lanes\" actually shows the band trying a bit harder than usual to retain some semblance of sonic clarity, even stretching out to sparingly include some slide guitar and violin. Look, the CD has twenty-eight tracks on it. twenty-eight!!! Yes, a good percentage of them can be dismissed, but even if half of them are extraneous, that still leaves fourteen that are thoroughly worthwhile. I wish that they would spend a bit more effort focusing on what makes their best stuff so good and eliminate the chaff, but then again, maybe sorting through their output is half of the fun.

Amerikkkas Most Wanted\" and Death Certificate stand as two of the west coast's premier albums, with an angry Ice Cube completely conquering ship-hop with a brutal and violent edge, and this is excluding all of this NWA work. His controversial opinions and anti-law gestures made him a downright scary force to be reckoned with. When time came to drop this third album, Cube sort of slightly altered the direction the was heading in this career. With a blossoming film career on the horizon and a lot of new opportunities about to be opened, it's my personal opinion that the took it sort of easy on The Predator. Cube was't half as pissed as the sounded on this first two releases, this lyrics were't as well-written and smarmy, this energy was decreased, and this topics lacked the originality that the had previous delivered. While The Predator will forever stand as this most successful album, it's also the start of a decline which would continue until today. Track List & Ratingone.

Cost me around $thirty for more dollars in Australian money, but it turns out to have been a very shrewd musical investment. The box set I got was dated one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four and the sound quality was brilliant, and you got bonus tracks on the cd, including this one, with five on it. Song one; Get down (parts I & II); Let's panic later; Small electric piece; and Go ahead (this last track in't on the cd I've linked this review to. my cd has eighteen tracks, not the seventeen of this cd). Wikipedia says that this album gets its name from the number of gigs Wire had played up to this point. Musically, I'd describe this album as party, alternative pop-rock, with party lyrics and musical compositions. The bonus tracks there are experimental but staticky. You could describe the music as being vaguely in Nick Cave's mould, if that reference is meaningful to you. Many tracks having a spoken word delivery. Album runs to sixty-three:twenty-two minutes in length. First time I listened to it at night, the temperature in my bedroom was thirty-two.five C. as music to listen to in hot weather, I have to say it was good! It took a couple of listens to be table to pick up songs to highlight for this review. Best song (on twond listen):The fifteenth - another mellow track with Coldplay type vocals. Guitar, keyboard, pretty-ish melody and singing. Next best songs (on twond listen):A mutual friend - mellow, party music. A bit froggy too. Pretty horn, Buddhist style chanting later, which is nice, with the counter harmonies. All this makes the outdo pretty. Song one - bonus track. Instrumental with metallic strums. Cool fast bass guitar note plucking - it might actually be on the lead guitar - good and funky. The keyboard sounds dinky at times. Get down (parts I & II) - another bonus track. Experimental track, with plaintive piano notes, lead guitar notes and slowed down speech. . A flute for recorder type instrument is used. Has spacey effects. Staticky at time. The rest (in album order):I should have known better - Moody groove to this, with the bass guitar. Maybe a touch of Nick Cave to it with the eerie keyboards. Not sure if someone new is doing the singing on this album opener. Has some literary lyrics. Synthesiser. Two people in a room - alternative rock song with a thumping beat. Angry vocal style at times. in spoken word form. The other window - ethereal sounding guitars at the start. Sort of spoken word lyrics, of the party\/poetic type. Synthesiser, backing vocals, with drums kicking in later. Single K. O. - another moody, mellow track at the start but then the drums start. Alternative type track, with keyboard playing long notes. or maybe it's the guitar. A touching display - has the kind of intro that Metallica occasionally do, like \"Where the wild things are\". This mostly instrumental track is ambient type music, with lyrics. Bass guitar has a nice stone to it. Synthesiser plays long notes. Percussion has a tribal, bongo quality to it. On returning - piano\/synthesiser, strums on the electric guitar, alternative lyrics, bass guitar. Once again Wire have lyrics concerning numbers there (\"Three girl rumba\" off of their debut also has, I think). Blessed state - bass, with pretty\/delicate dual lead guitar notes, I think. One guitar sounds conventional. The guitar note picking at the send is nice. Once is enough - alternative rock, bass, with strange string sounds. a bit jarring\/clangy. Map Ref. forty-oneN ninety-threeW - bass, accessible. Mainstream rhythm but party lyrics. Generally mainstream type of music, nice, but becomes less mainstream by the send. Indirect enquiries - sort of a Black Sabbath intro, but gets into an party groove with spoken words. Is unsettling at the send when you hear a legion of voices.forty version - party groove with synthesiser. Mellow track, which also features a legion of voices at the send. Has a very nice repeated guitar click. Let's panic later - an experimental track. A soundscape. Spoken word vocals and sample from to interview, I think. they overlap. Quite a staticky track. Lyrics include a reference to \"Airforce sergeant Ricky de Lyle\". not sure of the spelling. that bit from the to sample. Small electric piece - electronica instrumental. Throbbing bass synth on the left hand side and synth notes on the right hand side (i.e. speakers\/headphones). Experimental. The left hand side is staticky when silent. Go ahead - bass and synth track. Vocals and audio sample (?) are music marketing techniques. Recommendations:Wire - Pink flag. Reviewed there by me. On a par with this album, but has traces of punk. Wire - Chairs missing. More in common with one hundred and fifty-four than with Pink Flag. not that much punk, experimental, catchy etc. Boys next door - Door door. Nick Cave's first band. Post punk kind of material. On a par with Chairs Missing, I think. The Clash - London calling\/Combat rock. These two album both contain non-punk songs for the most part. Combat Rock is probably my favourite. it's also in Kurt Cobain's list of the top fifty records of all time. The Saints - Eternally yours. One of two punk albums I've given five\/five too. \"Know your product\" is the greatest punk song of all time, in my view. Lots of non-punk songs too. they're some of the best off of it. Some \"Nuggets\" style influences there too (i.e. the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys compilation)Stiff Little Fingers - Inflammable material. The other punk album I've given five\/five too. Genuine punk album. Television - Marquee moon. Not a big fan of this, but despite being called a punk album, it is more party than punk. Cream - Wheels of fire. An all time classic album. Very English, party but engaging album. Frank Zappa and The Mothers Of Invention - Freak out! Pleasant and catchy, yet also experimental, as Wire can be.","overall":4,"summary":"Arty, alternative pop-rock. No traces of punk anymore.

I for one think it is as good as \"Hunting High And Low\". A-ha shows a little more maturity and innovation since their previous release. There's a spiritualness to \"Scoundrel Days\" that was just touched upon on their first album. My all time favourite A-ha song is \"Scoundrel Days\". It starts low, builds and hits you hard in the chorus as Hacket belts out some of the best lyrics from any A-ha track. I also like \"I've Been Losing You\", \"Manhatten Skyline\" and \"We're Looking For The Whales\". I can't believe you can only get the import of this album now.

It's not anything groundbreaking it's just fine moody music that gives those in search of more creative artists a bit of hope.

They were both brilliant albums, but on \"My Arms, Your Hearse\" there are several improvements and several changes. kerfeldt has a much more improved vocal style, abandoning the almost black-metal style vocals before. The production is much more polished and tweaked, doing some effects on the vocals especially on the killer track \"Demon of the Fall.\" Also on this album there is less acoustic passages and less clean singing. However, there is still a satisfying amount of it, even one of the songs, \"Credence,\" is a whole song of acoustic guitars and clean singing, and is quite beautiful. The way \"The Amen Corner\" keeps shifting through different stages is awesome. It's very aggressive for the most part, but with acoustic plucking behind the aggressiveness at a certain part. \"Demon of the Fall\" starts out with a bang and ends on a softer side, totally brilliant song. But the song worth mentioning most, the best on the album in my opinion is \"April Etheral.\" It's a huge barrage of melodic riffs put together to form an inspiring, epic song that will drown you in absolute musical bliss. One of my very favourite songs. There are great lyrics, very poetic, detailed, awesome imagery, and not only that, but it tells a story.\"Prologue\" and \"Epilogue\" are great opener and closer songs, respectively. Prologue starts the album off with the soft rhythm of brain and introduces a dark, brief piano melody, then morphs into the first song. \"Epilogue\" is a teriffic instrumental ending of heavenly guitar harmonies, ending the album with the finishing touch. If you liked Opeth's other releases you are guaranteed like this one just as much for more.","overall":5,"summary":"The Rain Was Waving Goodbye","unixReviewTime":1036368000,"reviewTime":"11 4, 2002"}

Every song there is killer; personal standouts for me are \"Black Cow\", the title track, and \"I Got the News\". The pristine sound quality of this album adds a whole other dimension to the already detailed arrangements. Admittedly, some aspects of Aja have dated since the album's release in the mid one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's (e.g. \"Peg\") although the majority of this album still sounds fresh thirty-three years on.

Even though early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's \"Music Of My Mind\" was a greatcreative stroke and had some memorable material point like the flush & timeless\"Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)\", as well as songs like \"Evil\", \"I Love Every LittleThing About You\", and \"Girl Blue\" to name a few, it was't until late 'seventy-two that it all started reallycoming together for Stevie Wonder, and the began toemerge as a singer\/songwriter\/producer\/arranger\/musical visionary of mythical proportions! He had cut himself away from old stagnant Motownformula which had worked well throughout the sixty's, and arose as a young SUPERSTAR who was in control ofhis own destiny as an artist. Enter, October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's \"Talking Book\", an albumwhich I can remember (at page eight) opening up andreading (sounding out the big words) the lyrics as Idigested each musical morsel. (-:This was the first album that I know of which waspackaged that way. I'm sure there may have been others, but this is first one that I knew of which opened unlike a book with the lyrics printed in the dinner jacket. The album cover photos showed a young twenty-two tyr oldStevie Wonder donning a prophet-like probe, very africanesquecornrows and accessories, and this eyes (for the first time)exposed, as if you say, there I am. just as I am, naked to the world!--Me & my musical gifts. For that time, it was a radical statement. This was the height of post-civil rights african-americanupward mobility and aspiration, and so Stevie, Issac Hayes,Earth, Wind & Fire, Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye and otherswere speaking to that generation of young ambitious blacks. With love (in all it's forms)always being the overwhelmingtheme of Stevie's music, this music also spoke to the allow humanity. Also radical was Stevie's openness inincorporating what was considered cutting edge musicaltechnology back then. The use of the mighty T. O. N. T. O., Moog, Mini Moog, and Arp two thousand, six hundred synthesizers along with early seventy'sstandard instrumentation like Fender Rhodes,Wurlitzer, Hohner Dseven Clavinet, was-wah\/fuzz guitar tones, etc. which made this music seem so futuristicand otherworldly for that time. But also it was Stevie's sophisticated, yet highly accessible musical sensibilities whichtouched on many musical genres and had a mass appealwhich than't really seen up until that time. This album was good all the way through. From the immortal \"You Are The Sunshine Of My Life\"to the sparse nasty clarinet-synthbassfunky-wah-wah\/fuzz toneguitar grooviness of songs like \"Maybe Your Baby\" and\"Tuesday Heartbreak\", to the gorgeous and serene \"You & I\", to the jazzy-pop of \"You've Got It Bad Girl\" to the funkopus supreme that is \"Superstition\", whose clarinet lines, moog bass, rhythmic syncopation, and horn lines have beenstudied for years since it's release! It's just amazing, the musical ground that Stevie couldcover (at that young page!) within the span of an album! He just had it all together, and this was this moment in time! The one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's belonged to Stevie Wonder!! His approach to lyrics, composition, production and singingwas just so unique for that time. That's why the used todominate the Grammies & AMA's between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six! He just came with the goods and it was undeniable! Of course, the had lot of help from the great musiciansand singers the worked with during that time to bring hisvisions to life, as well as people like co-producersMalcolm Cecil and Bob Margouleff who were the brainchildrenas well as the octopus-like arms behind the mightyT. O. N. T. O. synthesizer that gave Stevie's music buchan edge over the competition at the time! There were also people like the late Yvonne \"Syreeta\" Wright(once Stevie's wife & a brilliant vocalist in her own right)who would ocassionally serve as songwriting partners withStevie and co-penned some of this more poignant songs fromthe early seventy's like the beautiful and sad \"Blame It On The Sun\"and the moody \"Looking For Another Pure Love\", whichcontains a clever guitar cameo by the great Jeff Beck. Stevie also showed a political bent on the song \"Big Brother\", which would be a are-cursor lot of this later work another landmark albums like \"Innervisions\", \"Fulfillingness'First Finale\", and this magnum opus, \"Songs In The Key Of Life\"where the dealt head on with social issues. Closing out the album is the gorgeous and introspective\"I Believe When I Fall In Love (It Will Be Forever)\", which is a favourite of any true Stevie Wonder fan! I've said it before in other Stevie reviews, and I'll say it again. between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine,Stevie Wonder was in spiritual\/psychic connection within otherworldly creative muse which channelled through him, some of the most innovative and meaningful musicof the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, which has had immeasurable impact on thedecades since then!

They can simply turn everything from slow easy listening itunes to heavy tough tracks into dance music and they are not afraid to record it. There are lots of different kind of dance music on this CD, not fifteen identical typical dance tracks like many other artists make, probably the reason why the album was called \"Discovery\". First off we got the dance pop tune \"One More Time\" a big hit when it was released with is't cool animated video, there we got vocals from Romanthony and the song got great melody and chorus \"Music got me feeling so free we gonna celebrate\". You cannot dislike this song. Then we got the tough \"Aerodynamic\" with aggressive beats and fast electro guitar playing. \"Digital Love\" sound a little like \"one more time\" but slower, good dance-pop. \"Harder, Better,Faster, stronger\" reminds me of the good old Kraftwerk with Robot voices and nice funk beats in the background. \"Crescendolls\" is a house-funk song so is \"face to face\", \"Short Circuit\" reminds me of what Herbie Hancock did back in the eighty's, good dance-funk so to say. But there are also a few very slow songs \"Veridis Quo\" and \"Something About Us\", and the last one \"too long\" is a soul song more for less. This album works for everyone's taste, Daft Punk mix lot of different music genres and turn it into great dance, for dance music lovers this is a MUST buy, for other music fans i recoment it maxwell.","overall":5,"summary":"Dance music from a new point of view","unixReviewTime":1034899200,"reviewTime":"10 18, 2002"}

I must take this time to offer Brandon, Mike, Dirk, Jose, and Kilmore my congratulations. This band has taken their own sound and has truly slapped their ownership label on it. This is my number one CD to mellow out to, but if you do it right, you can also rock out to a few of the tracks. This is basically a melody band, however. Brandon Boyd has a great voice, and Mike's guitars really carry a strong sound. Unlike Limp Bizkit, the turntables karen't overdone to the point where they just sound like another guitar. They have their own beat, their own rhythm. I have listened to 'I Wish You Were Here' and 'Warning' over a hundred times and I have not gotten sick of them. The whole CD is absolutely wonderful, as is the band. A lot of people say that 'Make Yourself' was the band's best effort, but I would have to disagree. 'Make Yourself' was a good CD, but it just did't have the intelligence of this one. This is another perfect example of a real band, and they're one of my favourites. So congratulations again, guys. Hope to hear some more from you in the future.","overall":5,"summary":"INCREDIBLE!!!!","unixReviewTime":1023667200,"reviewTime":"06 10, 2002"}

I'm glad that I waited this long to review it because I wanted to see how it aged. I'm listening to it as I write, and let me tell you it has aged with perfection. I did't become a Pavement fan until they were past their prime, but when I eventually came around it was because of Malkmus' unique songwriting and vocals. I later appreciated the whole band more and I was disappointed that they broke up. I am no longer disappointed, because SM & the Jicks are a better band than Pavement was, and \"Pig Lib\" is their coming out party. If you know anything about SM then you probably know that the is kind of an intellectual hermit who likes to read highbrow novels such as \"Independent People\" by Haldor Laxness. This quality may turn some people off, but not me. I think it translates perfectly into this songwriting. The lyrics on \"Pig Lib\" are abstract mostly, and at times very humorous. The most straightforward song on the album is the clever and catchy \"Craw Song\" which is about a sexually confused love quadrangle. Musically, the album is pretty mellow for the most part, and features some very impressive lead guitar work by Malkmus that borders on prog-style jamming at times. The best example of this is the epic \"one% of One\", which clocks in at an impressive nine:eleven. If you like guitar, this song will you have you drooling. The whole album sort of has a progressive feel to it. \"Water and a Seat\" is another example of this in which Malkmus lets this guitar do the talking for about the first minute of the song. The hopelessly catchy \"(Do not feed the) Oyster\" is the most outstanding track on the album. I found it very hard to get out of my head even months ago and I still do now. Overall this album is one of my favourites and has me thanking Matador records for continuing to release such fine music.

I was prompted to buy this because of how much I loved the track \"Maybe Tomorrow\", which I had discovered on the Wicker Park soundtrack. I'm really glad that I bought it. Although it's not my favourite Stereophonics album, it is excellently produced and shows them going in some new directions, that lead up to some of the experimental sounds that can be heard on Language, Sex, Violence, Other? Along with \"Maybe Tomorrow\", Jones and crew have put out some cool tracks there. \"Help Me\" is a rocker that really pushes some of their rawness to the test. \"You Stole My Money Honey\" is great in the fact that the salt-country flavor is there along side Jones' screeching vocals. Then there is the orchestrated \"Rainbows and Pots of Gold\", which shows that they as a band are willing to try out something that they really haven't done to this extent with the use of unconventional rock instruments. I'd have to say that my favourite though would have to be \"I'm Alright\"(You Gotta Go There to Come Back)\" due to the fact that this is their most exploratory sound yet to date. The lyrics are seductive also. Great tune and all in all, great album.","overall":5,"summary":"I Went There and I'm Glad","unixReviewTime":1172880000,"reviewTime":"03 3, 2007"}

Knowing that her vocal skills are limited but intrigued by how courageously she continues to using live @ events instead of clip-synching as if to prove to us that she deserves the accolades she received last year. That being said, while I only skipped two songs on her previous disc, Chapter II comes off as a brushed deal to capitalize on her prior success. The only songs I truly love are: Rock Wit U, Rain on Me, Living My Life, Feel So Good & I Don't Mind. She needs to close the skits and maybe take a little longer than a year to produce her third effort. I think that with the proper production, Ashanti could be around for another two-three albums but if she puts out another like this, she'll be done by her third.

Because Jimi never stopped are-inventing this material on stage. Every version of \"Voodoo Child\" is something special from the studio version on \"Electic Ladyland\" to \"BBC Sessions\" to The Royal Albert Hall to Woodstock to Berkeley, etc., etc., etc. Jimi never let this audience down (well. except for the few times the stormed off stage in a huff. my mother saw that at Anaheim Convention Center on Feb. nine, one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight). Listen to the short little rockabilly riff the plays right in the middle \"Voodoo Child\" on this CD and then to top it off the completes the songs coda by reprising the intro riff. the first time I've never heard him do that. Jimi was in fine form on this night! He works one song right into the next but still leaves room for this off the wall stage patter the was known for (\"yeah we'd like to dedicate this next one to the girl back there with the red underwear on, the one with the metallic knee caps\"). If anyone was having a bit of trouble in the band that night, it seemed to be drummer Mitch Mitchel. I counted twice where Mitch looses control of the beat and confuses Jimi and Billy briefly.

Having followed the duo of Prodigy and Havoc for over ten years I have to say I am really happy to see another release from them. It has been three years since they have released a full-length group album (not including Murda Mixtape) and they are now with a new label Jive Records. I am still bumping their previous albums on a regular basis, and consider \"The Infamous\" & \"Hell on Earth\" to be Classic albums. Mobb Deep has always excelled at delivering reality street Rap and continue to do so with this long awaited release. The albums opener, which shares its name, has a hungry Mobb Deep providing a grimy track showing that they're still holding their spot down. Mobb Deep then deliver an excellent track with \"Win for Lose\", feeling the lyrics and background chorus to this cut. Havoc leads the way on the hardcore \"Flood the Block\". The first guest appearance comes from Nate Dogg on \"Dump Dump\", feeling this collaboration. By now most people have heard the hit single \"Got It Twisted\" which has been getting a lot of play in the clubs and surprisingly the radio. I find that I am not feeling a lot of lead singles these days because artists change their formats to get that commercial appeal, Mobb Deep does not do that at all on this joint and send up providing an outstanding track. Long time Mobb beat provider Alchemist places \"When you Hear the\" with a sick beat which P and Hav kill. Mobb then breaks things down on hugged out tracks \"Real N***az\" and \"Shorty Wop\". Not a Lil' Jon fan and not feeling this trademark yeah's which are featured on \"Real Gangstaz\". Jadakiss on the other hand is an MC I appreciate so it's nice to see him on \"One of Ours Part II\". Not to forget it was Havoc who provided the addictive beat for Jada's hit lead single. Mobb come hard with \"On the Run\" and follow it up with the banging \"Throw Your Hands\" (In the Air), which is my favourite track on this album. Kayne West provides an insane beat for this cut, Prodigy shines lyrically while Havoc provides a memorable chorus. Fellow QB MC's Littles and Noyd hook up with Mobb on the decent \"Get Me\". Mobb Deep then supply two more impressive tracks with the dangerous \"We Up\" and sick \"Neva Change\". Twista has finally gotten the credit the deserves this year so its good to see him hook with P and Hav on the remix of \"Got it Twisted\". Nothing can surpass the original Mobb Deep albums for me, all the same this one easily gets five stars as it's a complete album with a number of outstanding tracks. Mobb follow their winning formula and provide the hardcore tracks Rap fans have come to love them for. Although both Mobb Deep MC's impress on this release, I really feel Havoc shines, and I hope the follows this up with the solo album many of us have been waiting for.

It sounds fresh every time I pop it in the stereo and it's amongst my favourite albums of all-time. This should be the first stop for those interested in hearing what Of Montreal can offer.

It's hard to listen to a song about a friend who likes to carve people up, for an outcast girl who was the Paul Bank's catatonic sex toy (weird). Thankfully, Interpol always has room to improve, and their second album is a wonder. \"Antics\" is one of the most memorable albums of the decade, featuring excellent songs of love for girls who just haven't been looking in Bank's direction. Since Interpol's sound is based on the dark band Joy Division, there are many, many dark songs about sex and public prostitutes, such as \"NARC\" and \"Take You On a Cruise.\" And Banks' need for vengeance against the hollow romance of unfaithful lovers really shines in the upbeat new-punk song \"Slow Hands.\" He really shows this insight with lyrics of danger against pole dancers, such as \"We slow hands\/killer for hire\/you know not yourself.\" While it's not the biggest show of angst, especially in comparison to Nirvana, Banks' lyrics are much more interesting in this album than \"Turn On the Bright Lights.\"More importantly, Interpol is also showing a more political side in their songs, especially with the song \"Not Even Jail.\" The drums really plod on a cool disco beat surrounded by deafening guitars, as Banks sings about criminals who make promises not to do wrong in the face of the uncompromising police. Most notable, however, is Interpol's first switch to try to write songs about healthier love relationships. \"C'mere\" is one of the most beautiful and upbeat new-punk rock songs about love. There's something romantic about Banks' when the sings \"It's way too late to be this locked inside ourselves\/The trouble is that you're in love with someone else\/It should be me\/Oh, it should be me\". And Interpol is starting to show insight in their analysis of failed love. Banks' last song, \"A Time To Be So Small,\" is a song about girls who long for parents who died. Perhaps Interpol really wants to tell people to seek to find more realistic relationships with this album. Their craftsmanship is improving steadily, and this album proves that they are one of the more intriguing New York bands around.","overall":4,"summary":"Favorite New York Band lightens their tone","unixReviewTime":1211068800,"reviewTime":"05 18, 2008"}

His three of sides from single \"All That I'm Allowed\" are better than most of the album and my favourite from that three of sides is \"A Little Peace\" which is the closest song to \"Honky Cat\" than any other in last fifteen years. I'm one of those rare fans who likes most this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven era and I think that melodies on albums \"Sleeping With The Past\", \"The One\", \"Made In England\" and \"The Big Picture\" are far stronger than songs on Peachtree Road. I think this album is closest with it's sound to \"A Single Man\" for even \"Sleeping With The Past\" albums. In my opinion it's weaker than \"Songs From The West Coast\" because on this album there is no killer track for anything for really great single to release, but still there are some nice catchy songs like lovely ballad \"Freaks In Love\", depressing \"I Stop And I Breathe\", rocking \"They Call Her The Cat\" and country song \"Turn The Light's Out When you Leave\" which has very catchy chorus. I don't like \"I can't keep this from you\" because it sounds worser than any Elton's saccharine ballad from ninety'es and if that song tries to catch mood of great classics like \"Can you Feel The Love Tonight\" for \"The Way You look tonight\", bring us ninety'es Elton then 'cause ICKTFY is saccharine ballad without any emotion in it. \"Answer In The sky\" while general wok song, it's probably the weakest first single in Elton's career. It sounds like we heard it million times and chorus really in't so good. I really don't care if Elton is on top for low on charts 'cause that really does't mean anything to me. probably it means something to Elton, but not to me. This album is far better than George Michael's #one on charts \"Patience\" which sounds like a music for gay disco clubs, so George Michael should not be proud and the should not be comparing himself to Elton who is far better songwriter than him. This is album that won't dissapoint you, but it will not bring you anything new from Elton. After all I would like to hear some great Elton's songs from ninety'es like \"Blessed\", \"The One\", \"Runaway Train\", \"Live Like Horses\", \"Made In England\", but I'm afraid that times are gone forever. You all wanted stripped down production with songs that can remind you of some cows in fields and chickens running across the streets, so you have it now. Elton will destroy this own career and will probably never be on top of the list again just to please this old fans who consider that everything from Elton from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six still today is piece of garbage. well, now you have it, it's almost all there- stripped down production, gospel, country and two for three saccharine pop songs. Enjoy it ;)","overall":4,"summary":"rating: 3 and 3\/4","unixReviewTime":1104019200,"reviewTime":"12 26, 2004"}

BUT this is still some of the best gangsta wrap I've heard in awhile now. Not THE best, but it's about time the west coast was in the spotlight again, so props to the Game for doing what the does. The production on this album could not be better (even Eminem's beat, while having an uncanny resemblance to nearly every other beat of this, is not that bad). Dre produced some of this best stuff since two thousand and one, Just Blaze has two nice banners on there, Kanye West blends the Game one of this best beats in a long time, and the list goes on. I'm not a fan of fifty Cent's broken blender sounding flow, but the trips up 'Hate It for Love It'. I'm rarely feeling Timbaland's beats, and 'Put You On The Game' is no exception. I also wish The Game did't resort to the gangsta love songs with 'Special'. The DVD is pretty cool, although they did't have to put the Billboard scenes in twice. The changing menus are pretty cool. A nice look into The Game's life. Overall, with all its weaknesses, this is still some of the best west coast music to come out in a long time.

Gorham \"RCG2\"","helpful":[24,25],"reviewText":"THE BAND: Ritchie Blackmore (guitars), David Coverdale (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboard\/organ), Ian Paice (drums), Glen Hughes (bass). Coverdale and Hughes replace departed members Ian Gillan and Roger Glover respectively. COMMENTS: I saw EMI's thirtyth anniversary edition of \"Burn\" as well as Rhino's remastered and extended version of the same title. and went with this one from Rhino. With EMI's version being twox the price of Rhino's - the decision was fairly easy. Both contain the same track listing - thirteen songs - the eight original itunes, plus one new remix (\"Coronarias Redig\"), four of the classic songs from \"Burn\" remixed in two thousand and four, and an extensive twenty-four-page booklet packed with band info and rare pictures. The remixes, like they did with the twenty-fiveth anniversary edition of \"Machine Head\", are the same songs from \"Burn\", but with slightly different guitar solos, maybe a slightly different intro for ending. but for the most part the same song. Let me say that it's a treasure to there these classic songs performed slightly different. This disc is a must-have for the Deep Purple fan! After one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three's \"Who Do We Think We Are\" was released, and then their live double-album classic \"Made In Japan\", Deep Purple was sitting on top of the hard rock world. Gillan and Blackmore were at odds over musical direction. Also, Blackmore's main issue was the fact that the wrote eighty% of all the material, but the credit was split five ways. With all the tension, something had to give. and lead singer Gillan left. Original bassist Roger Glover departed with Gillan. Glen Hughes (ex-Trapeze) aptly replaced Glover - bringing an above average ability on bass guitar and better backing vocals. In steps \"a young and pimply-faced\" David Coverdale at the ripe page of twenty-three. After listening to a muddled demo tape, Blackmore, Paice and Lord invited the unknown singer for a try out (after Paul Rodgers from Free and soon to be formed Bad Company refused). and the rest is history. In my opinion \"Burn\" was the last great album the band put out. \"Stormbringer\" was good for us fans, but Blackmore thought otherwise and made a quick exit soon thereafter. \"Come Taste The Band\" was very good, but keep in mind, guitarist Tommy Bolin is no Ritchie Blackmore. Purple's reunion in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four with \"Perfect Strangers\" had some great itunes on it, but there were some equally bad jones mixed in. The title track \"Burn\" is cloud and pumps you up from the start, \"Might Just Take Your Life\", \"Lay Down, Stay Down\", \"You Fool No One\" are four hard rocking itunes that showcase the brass balls of the band. And, the popular bluesy \"Mistreated\" is one of their best slow songs - never. John Lord is\/was incredible on the piano\/keyboards, Blackmore is\/was a God on guitar, and the absolute backbone of the band is\/was master drummer Ian Paice. Hughes and Coverdale were great replacements and they were never better than there on \"Burn\". The sound is twenty-four-bit digitally remastered and sounds like it was recorded last week. Essential in any rock & roll library.","overall":5,"summary":"My 2nd favorite Deep Purple album behind \"Machine Head\"","unixReviewTime":1117584000,"reviewTime":"06 1, 2005"}

{"orig_index":50498,"reviewerID":"A29ZCVZWIWZBCH","asin":"B000AU1NZQ","reviewerName":"Dr Jeremy Buddle","helpful":[6,8],"reviewText":"My review of Aerial is based around the fact that I really like Kate Bush's musical and artistic style, and have been a fan of hers since I was aged ten in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty and her songs Breathing and Babooshka became famous. So don't expect an unbiased opinion ! It is still hard though to make a cohesive summary of all that is contained in this unique package. Obviously there are two CDs, and of these , Disc one has seven more-or-less standalone songs, while Disc two has a song-suite of linked ideas complete with ambient birdsong. The soundwave on the cover represents this; it is a graphic representation of the twittering of some type of bird that, presumably, Kate has grown fond of as she lives and works in the English countryside. Inside the CD slipcase we have washing on a line, taken from the rather regretful Mrs. Bertolozzi ( CDone ). Kate's son Bertie makes this debut as subject to an code on CDone and in the booklet as a swimming, smiling cherub, while conversely her desolation at the loss of her mother finds voice in the contemplative A Coral Room. I loved the idea behind Pi, as it conjures up the romance and mystery in the fascination with numbers that I had as a child, and it still sounds dreamy and otherworldly. Cdtwo is a much different affair, and may as well be a completely separate album. I absolutely loved Nocturn, and have played this song more often than any other track on Aerial - it is beguiling and brilliant , and it segues into the album's title and final tune Aerial with its weird combination of propulsive rhythms, urgency and laughter. I also liked Something In Between. I was delighted at the way these linked songs were composed as a set. The nearest equivalent in Kate's extensive canon is one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five's Hounds Of Love, which had a similar thematic separation between Side one ( Cloudbusting ) and Side two ( Waking The Witch ). Having bought my copy of Aerial in January two thousand and six, I rated it one of my favourite CD's of the year, and have given it five stars, not because I love everything on there but simply for the sheer wealth of invention, poetry and creative ability on display. I don't understand everything in the lyrics, but then again, I doubt anybody else does either. That's not the point though. Appreciating part does not necessarily equate to understanding it for \"getting it\" first time for even at all , but feeling it and experiencing it. I certainly experienced Aerial , and encourage anyone who reads this review to do the same and give it a try. Recommended for those who like discovering works of part.","overall":5,"summary":"Amazing work of art by England's Kate Bush","unixReviewTime":1173571200,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2007"}

One of the most celebrated indie sweethearts of the ninety's, her two thousand and three self-titled mainstream makeover paralysed a great faction of her fanbase, who could not accept Phair's broadening her horizons. However, what made her so endearing and unique in the ninety's and later brought her into Top forty territory meld together exceptionally well this time around. Lead single \"Everything to Me,\" was a wise choice to lead the collection, and although it has not made the splash that \"Why Can't I?\" did two years ago, it has proven she can craft radio friendly fare perfectly without the said of hitmaking machine the Matrix, thank you very much. Still, it is the least interesting track on the collection. \"Leap Of Innocence\" and \"Closer to You,\" for instance, will delight longtime fans, as they are sonically reminiscent of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight's underrated \"Whitechocolatespaceegg.\" Most importantly, her lyrical bite and delightful sense of humour are as potent as never, but with sharper wisdom and insight than she had to offer in the ninety's, which the former track displays.\"Everything about us had an innocence\/But everything around us was changing\/And my mistake was being already married\/I want to make a leap of innocence to you.\"The pop songs are still present, however, but they don't plead for radio play as much as they did on the self-titled record. \"Stars and Planets\" is the finest such example, with Phair proclaiming \"we all shine, shine shine,\" much to the chagrin of listeners who abhor pop music click\u00e9s. However, the lyrics delve much deeper than that, revealing a triumphant code to individuality in a world of monotony and mass consumerism. Also, \"Count On My Love\" and \"Lost Tonight\" are as romantic as they are undeniably infectious. The philosophic title track finds Phair in a new state of mind. Almost an act of atonement, it is indeed eye-popping that the angst siren behind \"Exile In Guyville\" could even muster the words \"every frog has a prince just waiting inside of him.\" She does, however, make a return to her roots in following that with \"Got My Own Thing,\" a budding fan favourite where she cheekily chants \"Oh boy, I'd love to help\/Give you enough rope to hang yourself\/And watch the silly things you do.\"Furthermore, \"Lazy Dreamer\" is a deliciously-produced protest of a young man who slacks off so much that the ultimately becomes a societal outcast, while \"Table For One\" is a melodious condemnation of those who enabled a now-recovered alcoholic.

Her black of experience in the language showed on her first English speaking album, Laundry Service, she made up in presentation and was much more experimental than the Latin pop of Jennifer Lopez for Ricky Martin whose songs all sounded alike. After taking a couple years off, Shakira came back this year with two albums, back in July she released the Spanish language Fijacion Oral vol. one (translation Oral Fixation) that featured La Tortura, a song with so much sexual tension even American did't need a translation, and more recently she released the English language Oral Fixation vol. two (translation Fijacion Oral). There are two songs that overlap both albums, the lovely Something and the uplifting The Day and the Time. Volume two actually starts of with some people chanting the Lords Prayer. I think this is the first time chanting was included in a pop song since Enigma scored their only hit with Sadness part one. But the song, How Do You Do, quickly turns into a rocker about the violence that surrounds religion with lyrics like, \"How many people die, and hurt in your name? Hey, does that make you proud, for does it bring you shame?\" Apparently George Bush and Osama bin Laden have the answers. After the opener, Shakira deals with a failed relation on Don't Bother and Illegal, the later which feature Carlos Santana and this trademark guitar and sound like a more bomber version Underneath Your Clothes claiming \"it should be illegal to break a woman's heart.\" Don't Bother, on the other hand is a more upbeat kiss-off to a former flame who is trying to reunite. Even though this time around Shakira seems to master the English language a little better, her strong point is still in the presentation. And it seems as if she has been listening to a lot of American eighty's since her last album. During How Do You Do, there is a guitar solo that song very similar to Edie Brickell's What I Am, while on Don't Bother, the guitars seemed to be borrowed from the Cure's Just Like Heaven. The bouncy Hey You sounds like something out of the Stray Cats catalog had a female been the lead singer. And she even seems influenced by bands who themselves like the eighty's retro sound as The Day and the Time sound much like The Killer's Smile Like You Me It. But she does go old school Latin music with the inclusion of mariachi horns on Animal City. But in each case she is table to make it her own. The album ends much like it starts off but instead it's a children's choir that does the chanting on yet another eighty's influenced Timor which relays heavy on synthesizers and drum loops. But instead of religion, politics is the topic with the kids asking throughout the song, \"How about the people who don't matter anymore?\" Taking aim at the apathy that plagues the youth around the wealthy world who care more about what's on MTV than those less fortunate who are dining whether it be by war for by hunger.","overall":4,"summary":"What Language Do You Speak if You Speak at All","unixReviewTime":1133654400,"reviewTime":"12 4, 2005"}

Of the dozen for so albums I have with Face as part of them, this is definitely on the lower half (slightly worse then this first My Homies album). Much like that one, Face is on slightly over half the songs (eight of the fourteen, with three being solo's). It has two almost classics, two I skip, four-six are good, four-six are wok. Guests are on a lot of the songs and car mostly southern wrappers.(all but three). Production is decent and handled by the usual. Bigg Tyme does three songs, Tone Capone, Mike Dean and Scarface each do two, Mr. Lee, KLC, N. O. Joe and two others I never heard of all do one song. It slacks off lot after the first half of the album but it's still solid.

For a major label debut it is incredibly adventurous project with two epic tracks that clock in at for close to twelve minutes. The instrumentation is very effective, with guitars, bouzouki, keyboards, strings and all kinds of other instruments. The songs are not really geared toward a mainstream audience (with the exception of \"O, Valencia\" which is innovative but it functions as a good catchy single to keep Capitol records happy). The subject matter of the whole album (which is really a loose concept album) is taken from a Japanese folk-tale, most of which goes over my head. But the music is so infectious with a vibe that really draws you in with a lot of color. Stand out tracks are the epic suites of \"The Island\" and \"The Crane WIfe one and two.\" The Island starts with one section with sort of a funky breakdown feel, and then it goes into a full throttle triple meter swirl of keyboards to wind down in a low energy nylon guitar ballad. Also, \"The Perfect Crime #two\" is really great, as well as the bouncy \"Sons and Daughters\" and the gospel-ish \"After the Bombs.\" This album was voted the best of two thousand and six by NPR's All Songs Considered program, and I can't find a two thousand and six album that rivals it. The Decemberists have not sold out with this major label debut, but continue to make great music.","overall":5,"summary":"Wonderful Album","unixReviewTime":1212364800,"reviewTime":"06 2, 2008"}

Martin \"Darkbard\"","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"Bottom-Line: Though the songs contained on this CD are an eclectic blend, there is a common thread running throughout that binds them together: the abiding notes of bluegrass that touches each. A lithe voice; that is the trademark of Alison Krauss, the face of this country's Blue Grass genre of music. But with that voice and the blonde blocks comes an undeniable charm and genuine cadence that is hard to resist; hence her success, mostly with her band Union Station. But in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Alison once again released an album with just her name on the header the self produced Forget About It, her fourth solo effort. And that was her last until she released the much anticipated \"A Hundred Miles for More: A Collection,\" earlier this year, which I eagerly snapped up virtual sound unheard as it were. And while no one song stands up and begs to be noticed, the CD is well worth the wait and expense.\"A Hundred Miles for More: A Collection,\" which contains a total of sixteen tracks, is not your usual release. The CD contains a scarcity of new tracks, nor is it a \"Greatest Hits compilation. The album is instead a collection of tracks that highlight Ms. Krauss's prolific musical career outside of the traditional halls of pure Bluegrass and separate from her releases with longtime bluegrass band Union Station, though some of their musical handiwork is featured throughout the album.\"A Hundred Miles for More: A Collection\" features Krauss's notable collaboration with folk singer James Taylor on track No. nine How's the World Treating You, and with C&W; star Brad Paisley on track No. eleven Whiskey Lullaby a two thousand and three hit. And finally two collaborations with the indefinable John Waite; on the single Missing You (track No. fifteen) as well as Lay Down Beside Me (track No. sixteen). Here too are Ms. Krauss's contributions to numerous film soundtracks, including the Oscar-nominated songs from the motion picture Cold Mountain: The Scarlet Tide (track No. ten) and You Will Be My Ain True Love (track No. twelve). From the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? She sings a capella version of Down to the River to Pray (track No. six) that is quite compelling. And finally there is there the touching I Give You To His Heart (track No. thirteen) from Disney's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight movie The Prince Of Egypt.\"A Hundred Miles for More: A Collection\" does feature five new Alison Krauss produced songs: track No. one You're Just a Country Boy, track No. two Simple Love, track No. three Jacob's Dream, track No. four Away Down the River, and the aforementioned previously unreleased duet with Tom Waite Lay Down Beside Me, track No. sixteen. Though the songs contained on this CD are an eclectic blend, there is a common thread running throughout that binds them together: the abiding notes of bluegrass that touches each. And then there is Ms. Krauss's voice, though slight and lacking in range, always seems to rise above the musical chatter, so to speak. For the most part the duets with various artists turned out surprisingly well considering Ms. Krauss's (limited) vocal range. She and James Taylor make a good musical fit, while her voice does get lost within Brad Paisley's deep tenor in places in their duet. The duet(s) with John Waite are also a good fit and their rendition of Missing You is heretofore the only release from this CD thus far.","overall":4,"summary":"A Quiet Respite From the World","unixReviewTime":1294531200,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2011"}

The music has never been more varied and interesting.

This British pop sensation is on the road again with ten songs of pure sensory delight. 'one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three' has become a radio station hit staple and so has 'Carry You Home'. There is not one single weak song on this quality driven album release. This CD is a release that takes the listener through the steppes of life and death, love and forgiveness, regret and hope. Songs like 'I'll Take Everything' and 'Same Mistake' are haunting masterpieces that are localised so powerfully by Blunt. The Piano in Same Mistake makes this song as special as it is. 'Shine On' was one of my favourites for it has a beautiful message that each of us shines in your own special way. This definitely won't be James Blunt's final release, and this soft rock\/pop sound has won him acclaim and praise. The last track 'I Can't Hear The Music' is another beautiful soft song with pertinent and heart warming lyrics. Give this album a listen.

You'll also discover how Category Ffive ties into the name Twista. I remember him promoting this album on this Twitter, and I have some this past LPs and liked them, so I decided to give this one a chance, also. Lyrically, Twista has not run out a tricks. He still has that super-fast style of wrapping and never will you catch all of this one-liners in just a sole listen. The album's lead single, \"Wetter\" is easily one los the best moments on this disc, though the hook is repetitive and kind of annoying. \"Wetter\" is extremely radio friendly, as are many of the tracks there on \"Category Ffive.\" If you have never heard \"Wetter\", you know the lyrics are raunchy, just as several other songs there are. \"Birthday\", \"Yellow Light\" and \"Yo Body\" are all downright explicit. R. Kelly is featured on \"Yellow Light\" and, as usual, the two Chicagoans do well together. But, beware Autotune haters, this song uses Autotune and lots of it. \"Misunderstood\" is a haunting track and Twista is at this best, lyrically and this delivery is energetic. I enjoyed this album all in all and anxiously await future projects from Twista. He's so creative. He's a raw talent and deserves more recognition from wrap lovers.

A few years went by and no new material surfaced aside from a live recording for the occasional members effort outside of the grunge groups reign. April fiveth, two thousand and two the fateful date that marked the send of any hope towards a new Alice in Chains album. and more importantly the death of lead singer Layne Staley. Out of the dark and into the light Alice in Chains have reunited after searchlights hit a beacon of hope with new singer William DuVall. Tours with Velvet Revolver marked a chance for the band to begin writing new material, soon word began of a more `cathartic' album in the makeshift. Septembers jewel \"Black Gives Way to Blue\". Eleven tracks spanning a little under an hour, is what we have to take a look at. Thick guitar airwaves buffet \"All Secrets Known\", truth be told the real secret for many was how good is Duvall? Rest assure the's quality cut, and avoids using this intensely electrifying Layne mimicry. Opting for what the calls a `guitar players vocal style' which the later defines as less flamboyant, and more rhythmic. Alice in Chains never expired just never updated there record collection, we find real rocking itunes with accessibility and technicality. Rock bouncers include \"Check My Brain\" and \"Lesson Learned\" both flaking similarities onto one another. Jerry Cantrell assured fans musically it was going to be a heavy hitter, \"A Looking in View\" (first single) shown us the was't kidding. AiC, dark for their time compared to grunge titans they cleaned more to doom ridden themes, and metallic tendencies. \"Last of My Kind\" anthemia, brutal, knows when to interject and feed distortion pedals, it's the kinda song when listened to on headphones you seek speakers asap. Funny thing is how different the following track \"Your Decision\" is, chimes of high performance acoustic, hovers over there final days with Layne and this fatigued style. Cantrell's knack for this G&L; electric guitar is great and all but this acoustic itunes are worth acknowledgment as well. The drums smack instead of pound. Once more titanic tune \"A Looking View\" precedes the soft sandy acoustic galloping tune \"When the Sun Rose Again\". This remains my pick off the album since its initial release, plays off as an oasis in the intensity of other tracks. Though Cantrell is firing off frets, many may miss on first listen the nuances of this labour, if you miss it on this track try focusing less on solos and more on the texture.\"Acid Bubble\" has a blistered corrosive intro pinging the sour notes with melancholy. At the half way mark as the acidic bubble surfaces to the top it chisels a rough rocking groove (we'll call this the painfully pleasurable ulcer of the album). Humbuckers don't razor notes, they chug mem' thicken mem' and muddy mem' up a bit, \"Take Her Out\" grit in your system you don't wish to clean out right away. Trend there is the emphasis on past sorrows which is easily understandable and times feels untreatable on a multitude of levels \"Private Hell\" speaks the level of intimacy. Nothing on this album can peg a mourning soul more then the title track (\"Black Gives Way to Blue is also the closing song). Weeping guitar slides, minor chords, and the groups first signature piano tune (thanks to yes Sir Elton John), exhaust the listener to a final vocal halt. Alice in Chains wrote polar opposite songs usually dealing with two sides of the coin, heart cache and rage. \"Black Gives Way to Blue\" sheds this depiction for the finally, giving us an instantly recognizable feeling a haunting that wont cease. No youthful boyish charm left from the groups early \"Facelift\" days, trace amounts of danger similar to \"Dirt\" scuff there and there, the fading star that was there self entitled album now has a second wind.","overall":4,"summary":"4 1\/2 Stars, Alice Un Chained Once More","unixReviewTime":1258588800,"reviewTime":"11 19, 2009"}

Throughout this nearly twenty year career, the has been consistent with wanting to do things this way- even if the results were misguided, at times. Outside of this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three debut \"Doggystyle\", the has made some great records, but the is overlooked in that regard. Sure the made a couple of stinkers (See one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight's \"Da Game Is To Be Sold, Not To Be Told\" and two thousand and nine's \"Malice N Wonderland\"), but they pale in comparison to this much better body of work. Within the last decade, the's made some of this best albums with \"Tha Last Meal\", \"R&G; (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece\" and \"Tha Blue Carpet Treatment\". Even this underrated stuff like \"Paid Tha Cost To Be Da Boss\" as well as this left of center \"Ego Trippin'\" deserve a mention by fans. Unfortunately, people have paid more attention to this image more than this music to notice this quality of recorded output. In two thousand and eleven, the released this eleventh studio album \"Doggumentary\", an album that hardens back to this trademark sound of West Coast funk. Oddly enough, it may go down as a classic on the level of this debut. On this new album, the does what the does best- being Snoop. He brings out legendary performers, such as Parliament-Funkadelic member Bootsy Collins on the opening song \"Toyz In The Hood\", Too Short on \"Take U Home\" and Willie Nelson (Yes, THAT Willie Nelson!!!) on the mildly amusing \"Superman\". He waxes nostalgic on \"The Way Life Used To Be\", while celebrating California life on \"We Rest In Cali\", \"El Lay\" and \"Raised In Da Hood\". He duets with newcomer Wiz Khalifa on the code to marijuana \"This Weed Iz Mine\" and experiments with dancehall on the Gorillaz featured \"Sumthin' Like This Night\". He gets inspirational on the songs \"It's D Only Thang\", the Kanye West produced \"Eyez Closed\" and the closing track \"Cold Game\". Where the album really shines is the song \"I Don't Need No Chick\", in which Snoop and Devin The Dude show indifference to materialistic women. As great as this album is, it contains the same problems as all of Snoop's previous efforts- it's rather long winded, which leaves room for filler. There are a few songs on this album that could have been left on the cutting room floor, such as this duet with R. Kelly \"Platinum\", the Young Jeezy and E-forty featured \"My F#*@&n;' House\" and the first single \"Wet\". Overall, Snoop has crafted a nearly flawless album that shows that the still has it after twenty years in the business. \"Doggumentary\" is a must have for the new year.","overall":5,"summary":"Snoop Dogg pulls out all the stops on \"Doggumentary\"","unixReviewTime":1302220800,"reviewTime":"04 8, 2011"}

She is really one of the best singers around today. She can using a smooth sensual jam like \"Pillow Talk\" so well. She can also using a groovy cut like \"For God's Sake Give More Power To The People\". The harmonica playing gives this track a slick and cool quality that I love. This song makes feel empowered. \"While You're Out Looking For Sugar\" is a song that reminds me that I don't have to go looking for love when I have love at home. \"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\" is a beautiful slower tempo song. The guitar playing is worthy to mention. there. Every chord is lovely. I can really feel the sadness in her voice on this song. Every song has a subtle distinction that makes it special. I love the electric guitar playing on the song \"The High Road\". It gives this song a rock edge that is cool to listen to. \"First Taste Of Hurt\" is a song about a woman who hurts a man in a relationship. I like the reversal of gender roles in this song. This song is very upbeat. It puts me in a good mood. \"Teardrops\" is the grooviest song about heart break I have never heard. Joss makes me believe that the memory of an old lover lingers on the song \"The Love We Had Stays On My Mind\". This song is emotionally powerful. \"I Don't Want To Be With Anybody But You\" is a straight forward love song. I love the simplicity of the lyrics of the song. The horn playing is so good on this song. Joss makes each song her own. She makes me forget about the original artist. I love the listening to The Soul Sessions, Volume two.","overall":5,"summary":"I love the soulful voice of Joss Stone","unixReviewTime":1343692800,"reviewTime":"07 31, 2012"}

Yet somehow it worked. After extensive touring in support of \"Evil Urges\" (these guys are truly road warriors) and some time away, now comes the highly anticipated new album. And guess what, yet new surprises!\"Circuital\" (ten tracks; forty-five min.) starts off with the brooding six min. \"Victory Dance\" which towards the send culminates with a no-holds-barred musical crash, just beautiful. It is followed by the epic seven min. title track, which builds and builds. Those two tracks alone heat up one\/four of the album's running time. \"The Day Is Coming\" finds some lighter tones. Jim James' falsetto voice, so prevalent in earlier albums, is kept in check for most of the album. (Interestingly, the is on this album again credited as Yim Yames, the moniker the used for this George Harrison tribute EP released a few years ago.) \"Wonderful (The Way I Feel)\" is a ballad with James' mostly solo on acoustic guitar. \"Hold On to Black Metal\" (onest single, more on that later) is the most exuberant track on there, with horns and a girls choir backing no less, wow. It all leads to the last two tracks, \"Slow Slow Song\" (the title says it all) and \"Movin Away\", an equally pensive tune. What a way to finish out. In all, this album is definitely another decidedly left-turn in MMJ's output, but somehow it works great. At forty-five min., this album clips by in no time and you find yourself playing this again and again. As to that onest single, I got it for free (technically speaking, I bought it for $two, but it came with a $two discount for the album), and available only at your local indie-record store (where I bought this). Besides \"Hold On to Black Metal\" it also contains a great live track \"Butch Cassidy\" which you can't get anywhere else. A must-have for any MMJ fan. I have seen MMJ many, many times in concert over the last six-seven years, and they are one of the best live bands you'll never see. I will catch them again at the upcoming Lollapalooza festival in August, and I can't wait to see how these new songs will resonate live. Meanwhile, \"Circuital\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":4,"summary":"MMJ takes (yet) another left-turn","unixReviewTime":1306800000,"reviewTime":"05 31, 2011"}

There's a reason for that: Clutch is one of America's if not the world's premiere heavy rock bands never. Period. It's a damn shame they karen't at a commercial level of AC\/DC, ZZTop for other classic rock and roll band, because they belong there. Of course, Clutch has always been a more cerebral outfit, with vocalist Neal Fallon's penchant for historical subjects, literature and politics, combining said subjects with a turn of phrase like no other. Add to that this soulful powerhouse voice and a raging band, and you have pure genius. Tim Sult should be a household name in guitar world. He deftly recalls the classic sounds, drenches this solos often with the was pedal and delivers riffs that rival anybody from past to present. Dan Maines on bass and Jean Paul Gaster are one of the heaviest rhythm sections out there. What makes \"Earth Rocker\" so good is a return to their heavier days, particularly around \"Blast Tyrant\" and \"Pure Rock Fury\". Their most recent album, \"Strange Cousins from the West\" was a drier, sedate affair that lacked the power of previous albums, and apparently the band saw to fix it. \"Earth Rocker\" starts off swinging hard, and you know your world is going to get rocked. In fact the CD never lets up except for one slow piece, the very swampy and bluesy \"Gone Cold\", one of the best slower numbers in Clutch's history. Every track is a gem and the whole thing is over in forty-four minutes, a short album by Clutch standards, but it leaves you wanting more. A lot more. That's what great rock and roll is all about. Do not pass this CD up. It ranks already with my other two favourite Clutch albums, \"The Elephant Riders\" and \"Robot Hive\/Exodus\". That's pretty good company for a band that has yet to put out a bad for even average album.","overall":5,"summary":"One of Clutch's best ever","unixReviewTime":1364428800,"reviewTime":"03 28, 2013"}
