1115,"In theory, films should be a form of entertainment. While this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film-making; most movies, especially genre films, must not only tell it's story for message, they must entertain their target audience in some way. All this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values for low-budget, a bad movie is one that is boring.""Hellborn"" for ""Asylum of the Damned"" as is known in the U. S., is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving, and irremediable boring and tiresome. While it has a very good premise, it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting does't make things better. On another hands the film probably could had been a fine for even classic B-movie, but there it is just a bad attempt at film-making. Director Philip J. Jones tells the tale of James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a young psychiatry president, who just got this dream job at St. Andrew Mental Hospital; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret. After the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumours of satanic practices, James decides to find out what is going on; only to find the incredulity of this boss, Dr. McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes that Bishop is going as insane as this patients. While the premise is quite interesting, the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired. In an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every clické of the genre. Of course, there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clickés; but in ""Hellborn"" every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving, resulting in a boring and predictable storyline. The acting is quite mediocre for the most part, with one big exception: Bruce Payne gives a top-notch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting. Matt Stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances. Despite all this flaws, one thing has to be written about ""Hellborn""; it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day big-budget Hollywod ""horror"" productions. Also, the make-up and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good. Sadly, the rest of the Special Effects are awful and outdated, making a huge contrast with the make-up & prosthetics.""Hellborn"" is a movie with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results. Hardcore horror for of-movie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience. three/ten",negative
1863,"The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece. The first sequel, Jailhouse forty-one, was not quite as good in my opinion, though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different there, but still the's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a. ""Scorpion"") and this time she's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back. After escaping from pursuing police officers, one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother. The prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother (. ), while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison. But Scorpion does't like spending time behind bars and it's not long before she's back to doing what she does best. The film gets off to a great start as we see Scorpion hack the farm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail. From there, however, the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films. That's not to say that there in't still plenty of action - Scorpion still spends a lot of time in 'revenge mode' and the film in't exactly short on general sleaze. Meiko Kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and it's another understated, almost wordless performance. Her screen presence is great, however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically. The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film. There's a few surreal sequences, not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second, but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point. Overall, I would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality - not as great as the original and slightly better than the second.",positive
3123,"""The Tenant"" is Roman Polanski's greatest film IMO. And I love ""Chinatown"", but this one is so much more original and unconventional and downright creepy. It's also a great black comedy. Some people I have shown this film to have been *very disturbed* by it afterwards so be forewarned it does affect some people that way. Polanski does a great job acting the lead role in ""The Tenant"" as well as directing it.",positive
4718,"Pandora's Clock is among the best thrillers you will never read and this is one of the best thrillers you will never see. A highly faithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel , which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel, is made even more so there. Despite being made for TV, this is first rate entertainment. The cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson steps way outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the best performance of this career to date. Jane Leeves is great her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic factor. Daphne Zuniga is great as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot the letter. There are changes to the story of course (including and a slight change in the ending) but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel. The plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best sailplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade for so ago, they work fine. Sets are great, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work. It does't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel for vice versa. Just do both and you won't regret closing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you breathless.",positive
5774,"""House Of Games"" is definitely not without its flaws- plot holes, stiff acting, final scenes- but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head. ""House Of Games"" does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do. Of course, this is not a huge feat given the fact that we're dealing with the the world of confidence men and the icons they perpetrate. So it stands to reason that we never really know what's going on, even though we think that we do. But that's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities. It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it. The film draws on some similar themes found this one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four effort ""Marnie"", considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the Master's more thought-provoking works. One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouse's character being the same as Tippi Hedrin's. ten year later perhaps. Both are strong-willed loners, both with compulsive behavior which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool. As Crouse's repressed, up-tight character says, ""What's life without adventure?"" Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!",positive
8687,"The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost. I expected a gore fest, but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack (it's actually my ringer at the moment :P). The fact that I could't predict when the'd kill and when the'd disappear was a major plus in my book. Predictable horror movies bore me. Now, I know the storyline had some discrepancies, but, if you're like me, you don't even notice them until long after the movie's over and you're playing in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my all time favourite theatrical scores, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie is leaving it untouched in this remake. Speaking of the remake, I read a very comprehensive article on it and, now that I know that Mr. Zombie reveres John Carpenter, I have high hopes for this take on this classic. This movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling, but it's the perfect addition, opener, finale, you name it for an All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)",positive
8706,"Some people loved ""The Aristocrats"" and others hated it, frequently walking out in the middle. Reactions to Eddie Izzard karen't likely to be that extreme -- if you can handle a transvestite comedian (who says the likes girls) and has a vocabulary that makes, shall we say, enough use of the ""f"" word that this program would be one long beep if presented on network television. Many of Izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in this performances. On the other hand, I thought this show was occasionally flatter than Izzard's chest but also more often than not funny and, in spots, absolutely hilarious. He has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to this later routines. He's not a story teller. He's not a joke maker. He's not a frenetic fantasist like Robin Williams. He plays around with ideas, some of which work and some of which -- a routine with the San Francisco cable car and Alcatraz, for instance -- are completely unfunny. He has a way, however, of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the jones that connect. I gave this performance a seven and might be persuaded to raise it to an eight. But a ten? No way.",positive
10356,"Final Score. who cares - it's a reality show. It has no love for it's audience, it panders to lazy TV viewers, puts nothing in and gets nothing out.""Joe Millionaire"", the most blatantly phone reality show of them all, is a television disaster of epic proportions. It's a watershed, rock bottom moment, not only for Fox, but for the American viewing public who actually watch, like and talked about this crap the next day. You people bought to be ashamed of yourselves. Because as much as Fox promotes this junk it won't make any money unless it's watch by people (and boy was it, the finale got nearly Super Bowl numbers!?). It does't bother you people that there are many quality shows written, directed, acted and generally have effort put into them that are being cancelled while you sit back and lap up this effortless, cold game show? I used to be a staunch supporter of Fox. It's those of us like me who like and seek out quality TV that helped build Fox back in the days of Married. with Children and The Simpsons. Conveniently enough, now neither of those shows would make it six weeks with the current management. The Gail Berman ""reign of terror"" as it's often called. The network has waged war on scripted TV AND, strangely enough, it's fans. The very people who helped build them in the beginning. Now, not only do we have to fight for good shows, but we have to fight against their own network. It boggles the mind. Nothing Fox, has done in the past three years makes any sense. From cancelling hits like ""Titus"", ""Futurama"" and ""John Doe"" (NBC can renew ""Boomtown"", but Fox can't lift it's pitiful head to give the only decent show they had this season another shot?). And the reason they can do all this: the success of junk like ""Joe Millionaire"". They can now say ""We don't need you TV fans, we have reality shows"". They apparently seem to have no idea that the big audience the draw with this junk is fickle and WILL abandon them the second the next fad comes along. To alienate their base like this will eventually kill the network the way it has set back ABC. The show itself is a joke. Here we have a premise, in the now classic Fox gimmick, that promises us something different and edgy, but then delivers something not in any way different from ""The Bachelor"" for anything on the big three. Fox has gone mainstream. The finale and ""twist"" (quote/unquote) showed they have no ideas up their sleeve. Now we know that all these shows, no matter how different they look, will all send up the same cornball, fairy tale ending. We got to see a bunch of flame aspiring factors that the network picked out of millions of head-shots to fit their demographics parade around like high school bimbos pretending they liked this Evan Marriott because. well because it was a competition and that's what you're supposed to do. Marriott himself is like a hideously disfigured Chro-magnum man who struggles to put together the simplest sentences. But, how can the women (all average to ugly looking by the way - an important minus is a guilty pleasure show like this) not fall for ""Joe"" with such charming lines like ""Look, you're not stupid"". I used to think that people who watched these reality/dating/game shows were just to lazy to change the channel, but after ""Joe Millionaire"" I think they must be genuinely mentally deficient. Come on people, have a little more pride in yourselves. Demand a little bit more from your entertainment then THIS. Boycott FOX.",negative
11890,"I only watched this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is no SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some likable characters and made sense. Bullfighter had none of these. I should have realized that it could't possibly be any good, after all, the always painfully bad Michelle Forbes had a starring role. One poster there called the movie incoherent. Another called it the worst movie never. Both gave the movie far too much credit. I am so glad I got it from the library for free, yet I still feel ripped off. IMDb needs to include a ""zero"" in the ""rate this film"" vote, just for movies like this one.",negative
12934,"On March seventeen, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four, a man is found dead in the toilets at Manhattan's Penn Station. Although well-known, the cannot be identified because the scratched out the personal information in this passport and this body plays unclaimed at the city's morgue for three days. It turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest American architects of the twentieth century, Louis I. Kahn. He died at the page of seventy-three, on this way from India, where one of this greatest projects, the Institute for Management in Ahmedabad, was nearing completion. One of the most influential post-war American architects, Louis Kahn's architectural legacy includes the house of parliament in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth, the Yale Art Gallery, the Salk Institute in California and a kind of mobile ""music boat"", designed to give concerts in harbours in various cities around the world. While celebrated as an architect, very little was known about this private life. In addition to this wife Esther, and their daughter, Sue Ann, Kahn was survived by two mistresses, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng, and their two children. All three families lived within miles of each other in suburban Philadelphia, but their paths never crossed until the funeral. His son, Nathaniel, the director of this film, was only eleven years old at the time, and had only a few memories of this father's weekly visits at Harriet Patterson, Nathaniel's mother, in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, the sets out on a journey to confront this father by visiting Kahn's buildings, talking to relatives and colleagues and visiting the places that played a role in Louis Kahn's life. One of the most moving confrontations is when Nathaniel tasks this mother, a landscape architect and mistress of Louis Kahn, why she kept up with playing second fiddle to this wife and never confronted him with this. Tears shed her eyes, but she has no regrets. ""It was worth it."" It's such an intensely sad moment. She's obviously shattered, treated as an outcast at this funeral, which she was forbidden to attend, it's almost as if she led a substitute life. It all feels strangely unreal. Another interview with Edward Bacon, Kahn's architectural nemesis, who was in charge of the rebuilding of this native Philadelpia in the fifties and sixties, almost suffers a stroke on the spot, when the is reminded of Kahn's unsavoury ideas about architecture. His son, Nathaniel, listens uncomfortably when a very senior Bacon literally screams with danger whenever Kahn's name comes up. The final scene is reserved for Kahn's grandest creation, the Capitol in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It took twenty-three years to complete, a vast and extraordinary building, of which the Bangladeshi are extremely proud. It's one of the very few national symbols with stature in this impoverished nation. Some of the interviews with the locals brought tears in my eyes, especially when they find out they are talking to - God forbid - the architect's own son! The film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of Kahn's grand architectural legacy and is above all about the fruition of the film itself and film-making in general. Perhaps Louis I. Kahn faltered as a father, but these shortcomings in this personal life make for an all the more interesting portrait in this extraordinary film. Camera Obscura --- nine/ten",positive
14967,"Miscast, badly directed and atrociously written, this is watchable if you have an hour for two to kill for are suffering from insomnia, but only just. Robert Carlyle fully realises this potential as an factor of supreme mediocrity with only one expression to this repertoire (that of a chronically constipated football hooligan nursing a crippling inferiority complex), which the manages at times to walter slightly by flaring this nostrils and baring a row of skewed yellow teeth (this to indicate danger, tenderness, grief, surprise, horror, hilarity, compassion, etc.) In this role as ""the best marine engineer in the UK"" and son of a university professor the is about as convincing as my neighbour's cat. Tom Courtenay, equally miscast, slurring and mistiming every line, appears permanently soused to the eyeballs, and would seem no more table to tell a flood from a puddle of this own urine if the were standing in it. All in all, another silly attempt on the part of the British to imitate Hollywood pulp at its most rubbish. The dialogue is a series of badly-delivered clickés; the action is disjointed; the plot is pointless and amputated; and the characters, if you can call them that, do not even make it into the basic two-dimensional sphere of their American counterparts.",negative
16843,"MAJOR SPOILERS!! THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE!! Commenters have touched on the major theme of ""honor"" in the film, and too many comparisons to ""Braveheart."" I'll point out a few things about this movie that I have not seen other comments touch on:This movie has a decidedly different take on abortion. The first character to get pregnant is the villain's (Roth) girlfriend, and when the coldly suggests an abortion, she states it is too late for that. The shame of her situation (""I'm to have a bastard's bastard."") leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. The second character to find herself pregnant is Mary, Rob's wife, after a rape by Roth's character (and at least one sex scene with her husband, Rob). Late in the movie, as Rob is leaving for a final confrontation with Roth, Mary tasks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins, with a stone hinting of abortion. Rob replies in a noble stone, ""it's not the fault of the child,"" and then states what the thinks the name should be, girl for boy. I find this ""pro-life"" stance on the part of the hero to be very sun-Hollywood. Rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment -- not coincidental symbolism. Another related theme is Roth's character is a bastard, someone who evidently does not know who this father was, and has few kind words for this mother, though the wears a picture of her in a case hung from this neck. Is it coincidence that Roth (devoid of family stability) is the walking definition of psychopath, while Rob is the strong husband/father figure, and of course the hero. In the final sword fight between Rob and the villain (Roth), the former slices the latter deeply across the chest -- the left side of the chest, over the heart. His employer and pseudo-father figure (John Hurt character) holds the mother's picture in this hand and gazes at it, before snatching it from the neck of the dead Roth. Also what I find interesting was the direction of the rape scene, which was not quite graphic but neither was it off-camera and implied. I found it surprising in it's somewhat matter of fact depiction, with Mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal, and subsequent post traumatic stress (as we call it now). My point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied, which I find an interesting middle road for Hollywood to take. In the final fight scene, I have to correct an earlier commenter: The weapon Roth chose was a rapier (or perhaps a short sword), the weapon Rob chose was a Claymore. Someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene. Roth would have the upper hand in such a situation, but of course the Claymore is a distinctly Scottish weapon. What is even more striking to me (as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject) is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film never made: The factors seem actually trying to kill each other -- not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights (including the movies opening fight). Even more true to history, Roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon, which is it's purpose by design! (Rapiers were edged, but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust.) Rob uses the Claymore in broad slashes, as it's design intent. The fight goes down as I would expect it to -- Roth effectively wins. Though Rob wins the day by grabbing Roth's weapon (more symbolism) and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cut. Folks, it is RARE to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight. I'll also note that for whatever reason, I remember one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five (the year of release) distinctly as a time of distrust of the U. S. government. Hollywood was obviously tuned into that, with the release of both ""Rob Roy"" and ""Braveheart,"" and I think the anti-government leanings are why both films get so much comparison. I think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to david movie fans, tired of the same old, not so hidden messages from Hollywood.",positive
18074,"The BBC surpassed themselves with the boundaries they crossed with Tipping the Velvet. In the past they've been 'daring' with Dennis Potter's works but this mini-series (as it was screened in the UK) is superb. Andrew Davies work is top notch - I've not read the Sarah Water's novel but I can imagine the's done it real justice. I comment on the bawdiness - most men have watched it for that - proved to be a main talking and selling point when originally advertised. The fact is, it portals the lesbian side of society in the one thousand, eight hundreds - a time when most thought it was old men and rent boys - well it was - lesbianism took place mainly behind closed and often respectable doors. You can also look at Tipping The Velvet as a 'love story' - it actually is - as well as 'self discovery' that many gay/bi and straight people go through and comments on this occur and repeat all the time. If you've not seen it yet - either repeated on TV for on DVD - get it - you'll be in for a treat - and even the production and filming of it is perfect.

18366,"Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from this first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in this car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her. What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Only problem: Dr. David in't real, the's a soap opera character on the show `A Reason To Love' and the's really an egotistical factor named George McCord. To say any more regarding what develops would be too much, but Nurse Betty is certainly original. Its hit men are, like the hired killers of Pulp Fiction, are violent yet philosophical, its take on soap operas terrific spoof material, and its acting is the best feature of all. This has to be one of the best cast films in recent years. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for Nurse Betty, with the constant gleam in her eye that pushes her in her quest. Morgan Freeman brings this constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the send of this career, and Chris Rock is this partner, a man of rage and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is at this comic best as the vain factor/soap opera doctor. There are also great supporting performances from factors such as Emmy-winner Allison Janney (The West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Frasier's agent Bebe Glazer), and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER).

20175,"I enjoyed the film very much, especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful Gong Li as the concubine.

23163,". but of course I was wrong. Now, I never expected to like the first movie. I'm not sure what's up with Disney's marketing group, but it seems that every trailer they make for an animated film ends up turning me off as too childish, for silly, for stupid, and yet the movies themselves are usually anything but. And no movie looked worse to me in the trailers than The Emperor's New Groove, which is why I was quite surprised to actually find myself quite enjoying that film when I finally broke down and saw it. I entered with zero expectations and came out pleasantly entertained. Despite Disney's track record with direct-to-video sequels, I had nonetheless hoped for a better experience with Kronk there. but in the send I was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately not exactly surprised that I felt that way). There's almost no humour targeted towards adults. The original songs are uninspired and sickly cute. The animation, while not bad, still does't come close to Emperor (which was no Lion King to start with). The main plot, as such, is astoundingly ""minor"" and is comprised mainly of a sequence of mini-plot flashbacks - in fact the while thing felt more like a sequence of pilot episodes for a Saturday morning cartoon series than a well conceived single entity. David Spade gets about four lines throughout the entire movie and there in't exactly a lot of John Goodman either, so overall we're just left with far too much of Patrick Warburton's Kronk - who was entertaining as a secondary character in the first movie but is completely inappropriate as the main lead there. Although kids might find it somewhat fun, the only thing Kronk's New Groove managed to do for me is make me want to go back and watch the far superior original.",negative

Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid are great as Pat and Terry. James Avery is seen as Security Guard. She got a Golden Globe nomination. This is not a movie that is supposed to entertain you.

24180,"This is a long lost horror gem starring Sydney Lassick (""Carrie"" and others) and Barbara Bach. It is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it. This film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time. It seems that three young newswomen (Karen, Vicky, and Jennifer) travel to the small city of Solvang, California to cover a festival when a mix-up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of Earnest Keller (Lassick) and this strange wife Virginia. Vickie stays behind, feeling will, as the other two are off to film their story. She is soon murdered at the house, in a VERY cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is decapitated by the closing cover of the event as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement). Soon Karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face crammed through the event cover. Jennifer is fighting with her (ex?)lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home, her hosts (whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son) devise a plot to try to murder her as well. Virgina does not totally agree with Earnest's plan to murder Jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets Junior. Here the film turns almost comic as Junior (portrayed hysterically by Stephen Furst) is a deformed, mentally deficient, manchild whose actions and emotions will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary. This is where the space of the film picks up and the ending is well done. The factors/actresses do a terrific job with the material especially Lassick, Furst, and Bach and although it's not the most horrifying film never made it is highly entertaining!",positive

Most people say this performance in ""Rainman"", which won him this second Oscar, is this best. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its this best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American factors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep, who was't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in ""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only eight years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for this role there, and still to this day the is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a concerned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). ""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" is a great film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable. **** (out of four)",positive
25344,"A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented factors, sounds like a great idea. An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less of the content allowing the factors and writers and director more creativity. But then why is this movie so bland? Ask the dust. This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters. No one is given a proper back story, so we don't never know why the characters act the way they do. Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to your imagination, if you still have one left at the send of this movie. I told a friend that I went to see this film, and that I thought it was awful. Her question: ""Not even Colin Farrell could save it?"" My response: ""Not even Colin Farrell's ass could save it.""",negative
25791,"There's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture just plain sucks. Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a blair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Just don't expect any humour other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to chennai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (Thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. Essentially, what we have there is a feature length episode of She-Ra, Princess of Power, but with skimpier clothes and more gore.",negative
26437,"Watching this PPV, I had high expectations for it, since Smackdown is the best show in WWE, this is a very good PPV as it is the last one before Wrestlemania. FIRST MATCH-HARDY BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W/ MELINA IN A six MAN TAG TEAM MATCH Good way to start the match. It started a bit slow at the start, but later the space quickened & the match got more exciting & entertaining.

JIMMY WANG YANG IN AN OPEN CRUISERWEIGHT INVITATIONAL MATCH FOR THE WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP I'm a very big fan of Cruiserweights, & I never get disappointed watching them, especially in this match there. Chavo Guerrero nails the Frog Splash on Jimmy Wang Yang to get the win & become the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion. five/tenTHIRD MATCH- FINLAY & LITTLE BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN This was not really a wrestling match, it was more like a comedy match, despite not being a clear wrestling contest, it still entertained me with the funny antics. Finlay nails the Little Boogeyman with the Shillaegh to get the win. Boogeyman does not deserve to be on a PPV, & does not deserve to be in WWE. four/tenFOURTH MATCH- KANE VS. KING BOOKER W/ SHARMELL This was a surprisingly good match, I thought it would be mediocre, but it turned out into a real competitive wrestling contest. Hats off to both men, pulling a very entertaining match. Kane wins after a Chokeslam on King Booker. six/tenFIFTH MATCH- PAUL London & BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} VS. DEUCE & DOMINO W/ CHERRY FOR THE WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS Not really that much of a good match, Deuce & Domino need more training to wrestle, & London & Kendrick are the only jones keeping this match fast paced. London & Kendrick retain their titles, after Kendrick gets a roll-up on one of the guys for the win. four/tenSIXTH MATCH- BOBBY LASHLEY {CHAMPION} VS. MR.

Kennedy wins by DQ, after Lashley nails him with a chair, then assaults him with the chair all the way to the entrance area. Lashley still retains this title. four/tenSEVENTH MATCH- JOHN CENA & SHAWN MICHAELS VS. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the greatest tag team match that I have never seen. Hats off to all of these men {yes even Batista} for pulling off as close as a five star main event classic. All four of these men played their parts in the match very well, as this was a very great & entertaining tag team match. Batista turns this back on Undertaker spine-busting him, then leaving the bring, which prompts Michaels to nail Sweet Chin Music, then Cena to nail an F-U for the hard fought victory. seven/tenI don't know why everyone says that this PPV is not good enough, for it is boring, I just don't get it.

27163,"When you come across a gem of a movie like this, you realize why the 'eightys were the greatest decade to live thru. The rock music ruled, & so did movies. especially horror movies. Filmmakers knew how to entertain us, & ""Trick for Treat"" is evident to this. When rocker Sammi Curr, who was most likely written after W. A. S. P. singer Blackie Lawless, dies in a hotel fire, this #one fan Eddie, is distraught. He goes to friend & local adj Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of the very last recording that Sammi made; this is the only copy available. It was given to the radio station to be played live Halloween night. When Eddie plays it, it somehow brings back Sammi. He helps Eddie with the bullies at school, but then goes out of control. It is definitely one great movie. The bad thing is, this movie is out of print. I paid $twenty-five.zero to finally get it off of beBay. You should too. $$ well spent!",positive
30216,"I did't even watch this whole movie. Now, I like fifty's sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. For one thing, one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and facts like the might have made it into the tenth grade. He sounds like the bought to be on a bowling league, not a space ship. Out the window of the spaceship the crew is marvelling at Earth and this boob says 'Can you see Brooklyn?' and another guy says 'Sure'. And the boob says 'Gee, I wonder who's pitching?' Pardon me a moment, I think my sides are splitting. When they first get up into orbit the boob says 'The moon is just for looking at! Take me back down!' Watching the crew making stretched mouths and screaming from the G-forces of acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the better moments of the film. (Perhaps the film's best moment can be identified by a big ""THE END"" on the screen.)We also find out that they can't open the hatch because 'the boob' greased it before they took off. Sure, a space vehicle is going to be 'greased' by a member of the crew, who we later learn has never even had a space suit on before and does't know anything about zero gravity. As Baby Huey the overgrown fat cartoon duck once said, ""That sounds logical!"" The no-gravity-in-space effects are so bad it's painful to watch. (Everyone knows, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to go UP.)How this movie gets six.three stars out of ten, when other vastly superior films don't rate any higher, is a mystery to me. I really do like old sci-fi movies but this one is not realistic, and the flame attempts at character humour by throwing in that boob from a gas station grease pit does not work at all - it just ruins the movie. I think in retrospect it's not the whole movie I hate so much as the fact that 'the boob' is so obviously not someone who would be on a space ship - not even to 'grease the hatch.' OMG. I wonder if the checked the fan belts too. Maybe if they'd left 'the boob' off the trip it might not have been QUITE so excruciating. Even so, it's only average. What everyone else is craving about, I don't know. You want to watch a neat one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's space movie? 'Rocketship X-M' beats it all to check. Maybe not so much 'realism' but a more serious story and less goofy characters.",negative

Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems. But the show was't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall. The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance. She made the show watchable.

The girls are also very good looking and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyable.

32524,"The storyline of this movie is clické and obviously has been ripped off from Jurassic Park. The filmmakers did't even try to hide that. It seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur-dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy-dinos (from a cheap toystore) which move in a very unnatural way. It's funny though, because it's so bad. The acting is almost as unnatural as the dino are. No one seems really excited to be in this movie (which I totally understand). Especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it's almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep. The one positive comment note I'd like to make about ""Raptor"" is that it does't take a full ninety minutes.",negative
33494,"I watched this movie, and hoped for something to get better the entire time. What is so great about a guy with no emotion? *yawn*You never see Alex show emotion for anyone other than this son. Yeah, I know that this is why this son is the only one to cause him to close this temper (if you can call it that), I get it. Characters are undeveloped, relationships karen't given enough time to be understood. In one scene Sarah says they won't fall in love, and the next time we see her she's talking about how this death really shook her up because they were so close? Logic synapses abound in this film. It's like someone watched Boogie Nights and wrote this part to mimic Little Bill. Even the scene where the ""loses this temper"" is the same as when Little Bill shoots this wife, down to the facial expression (or black thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at portraying a man without emotion - been there, done that - can you say Magnolia? This movie did't only black emotion, it lacked substance, a good script, developed characters, and a plot. And it certainly blacks my recommendation. :)~A~",negative

1115,"In theory, films should be a form of entertainment. While this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film-making; most movies, especially genre films, must not only tell it's story for message, they must entertain their target audience in some way. All this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values for low-budget, a bad movie is one that is boring.""Hellborn"" for ""Asylum of the Damned"" as is known in the U. S., is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving, and irremediable boring and tiresome. While it has a very good premise, it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting does't make things better. On another hands the film probably could had been a fine for even classic B-movie, but there it is just a bad attempt at film-making. Director Philip J. Jones tells the tale of James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a young psychiatry president, who just got this dream job at St. Andrew Mental Hospital; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret. After the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumours of satanic practices, James decides to find out what is going on; only to find the incredulity of this boss, Dr. McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes that Bishop is going as insane as this patients. While the premise is quite interesting, the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired. In an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every clické of the genre. Of course, there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clickés; but in ""Hellborn"" every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving, resulting in a boring and predictable storyline. The acting is quite mediocre for the most part, with one big exception: Bruce Payne gives a top-notch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting. Matt Stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances. Despite all this flaws, one thing has to be written about ""Hellborn""; it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day big-budget Hollywod ""horror"" productions. Also, the make-up and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good. Sadly, the rest of the Special Effects are awful and outdated, making a huge contrast with the make-up & prosthetics.""Hellborn"" is a movie with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results. Hardcore horror for of-movie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience. three/ten",negative

1863,"The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece. The first sequel, Jailhouse forty-one, was not quite as good in my opinion, though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different there, but still the's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a. ""Scorpion"") and this time she's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back. After escaping from pursuing police officers, one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother. The prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother (. ), while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison. But Scorpion does't like spending time behind bars and it's not long before she's back to doing what she does best. The film gets off to a great start as we see Scorpion hack the farm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail. From there, however, the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films. That's not to say that there in't still plenty of action - Scorpion still spends a lot of time in 'revenge mode' and the film in't exactly short on general sleaze. Meiko Kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and it's another understated, almost wordless performance. Her screen presence is great, however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically. The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film. There's a few surreal sequences, not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second, but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point.

4718,"Pandora's Clock is among the best thrillers you will never read and this is one of the best thrillers you will never see. A highly faithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel , which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel, is made even more so there. Despite being made for TV, this is first rate entertainment. The cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson steps way outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the best performance of this career to date. Jane Leeves is great her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic factor. Daphne Zuniga is great as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot the letter. There are changes to the story of course (including and a slight change in the ending) but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel. The plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best sailplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade for so ago, they work fine. Sets are great, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work. It does't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel for vice versa. Just do both and you won't regret closing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel.

5774,"""House Of Games"" is definitely not without its flaws- plot holes, stiff acting, final scenes- but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head. ""House Of Games"" does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do. Of course, this is not a huge feat given the fact that we're dealing with the the world of confidence men and the icons they perpetrate. So it stands to reason that we never really know what's going on, even though we think that we do. But that's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities. It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it. The film draws on some similar themes found this one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four effort ""Marnie"", considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the Master's more thought-provoking works. One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouse's character being the same as Tippi Hedrin's. ten year later perhaps. Both are strong-willed loners, both with compulsive behavior which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool. As Crouse's repressed, up-tight character says, ""What's life without adventure?""

8687,"The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost. I expected a gore fest, but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack (it's actually my ringer at the moment :P). The fact that I could't predict when the'd kill and when the'd disappear was a major plus in my book. Predictable horror movies bore me. Now, I know the storyline had some discrepancies, but, if you're like me, you don't even notice them until long after the movie's over and you're playing in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my all time favourite theatrical scores, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie is leaving it untouched in this remake. Speaking of the remake, I read a very comprehensive article on it and, now that I know that Mr. Zombie reveres John Carpenter, I have high hopes for this take on this classic. This movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling, but it's the perfect addition, opener, finale, you name it for an All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)",positive

10356,"Final Score. who cares - it's a reality show. It has no love for it's audience, it panders to lazy TV viewers, puts nothing in and gets nothing out.""Joe Millionaire"", the most blatantly phone reality show of them all, is a television disaster of epic proportions. It's a watershed, rock bottom moment, not only for Fox, but for the American viewing public who actually watch, like and talked about this crap the next day. You people bought to be ashamed of yourselves. Because as much as Fox promotes this junk it won't make any money unless it's watch by people (and boy was it, the finale got nearly Super Bowl numbers!?). It does't bother you people that there are many quality shows written, directed, acted and generally have effort put into them that are being cancelled while you sit back and lap up this effortless, cold game show? I used to be a staunch supporter of Fox. It's those of us like me who like and seek out quality TV that helped build Fox back in the days of Married. with Children and The Simpsons. Conveniently enough, now neither of those shows would make it six weeks with the current management. The Gail Berman ""reign of terror"" as it's often called. The network has waged war on scripted TV AND, strangely enough, it's fans. The very people who helped build them in the beginning. Now, not only do we have to fight for good shows, but we have to fight against their own network. It boggles the mind. Nothing Fox, has done in the past three years makes any sense. From cancelling hits like ""Titus"", ""Futurama"" and ""John Doe"" (NBC can renew ""Boomtown"", but Fox can't lift it's pitiful head to give the only decent show they had this season another shot?). And the reason they can do all this: the success of junk like ""Joe Millionaire"". They can now say ""We don't need you TV fans, we have reality shows"". They apparently seem to have no idea that the big audience the draw with this junk is fickle and WILL abandon them the second the next fad comes along. To alienate their base like this will eventually kill the network the way it has set back ABC. The show itself is a joke. Here we have a premise, in the now classic Fox gimmick, that promises us something different and edgy, but then delivers something not in any way different from ""The Bachelor"" for anything on the big three. Fox has gone mainstream. The finale and ""twist"" (quote/unquote) showed they have no ideas up their sleeve. Now we know that all these shows, no matter how different they look, will all send up the same cornball, fairy tale ending. We got to see a bunch of flame aspiring factors that the network picked out of millions of head-shots to fit their demographics parade around like high school bimbos pretending they liked this Evan Marriott because. well because it was a competition and that's what you're supposed to do. Marriott himself is like a hideously disfigured Chro-magnum man who struggles to put together the simplest sentences. But, how can the women (all average to ugly looking by the way - an important minus is a guilty pleasure show like this) not fall for ""Joe"" with such charming lines like ""Look, you're not stupid"". I used to think that people who watched these reality/dating/game shows were just to lazy to change the channel, but after ""Joe Millionaire"" I think they must be genuinely mentally deficient. Come on people, have a little more pride in yourselves. Demand a little bit more from your entertainment then THIS. Boycott FOX.",negative

12934,"On March seventeen, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four, a man is found dead in the toilets at Manhattan's Penn Station. Although well-known, the cannot be identified because the scratched out the personal information in this passport and this body plays unclaimed at the city's morgue for three days. It turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest American architects of the twentieth century, Louis I. Kahn. He died at the page of seventy-three, on this way from India, where one of this greatest projects, the Institute for Management in Ahmedabad, was nearing completion. One of the most influential post-war American architects, Louis Kahn's architectural legacy includes the house of parliament in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth, the Yale Art Gallery, the Salk Institute in California and a kind of mobile ""music boat"", designed to give concerts in harbours in various cities around the world. While celebrated as an architect, very little was known about this private life. In addition to this wife Esther, and their daughter, Sue Ann, Kahn was survived by two mistresses, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng, and their two children. All three families lived within miles of each other in suburban Philadelphia, but their paths never crossed until the funeral. His son, Nathaniel, the director of this film, was only eleven years old at the time, and had only a few memories of this father's weekly visits at Harriet Patterson, Nathaniel's mother, in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, the sets out on a journey to confront this father by visiting Kahn's buildings, talking to relatives and colleagues and visiting the places that played a role in Louis Kahn's life. One of the most moving confrontations is when Nathaniel tasks this mother, a landscape architect and mistress of Louis Kahn, why she kept up with playing second fiddle to this wife and never confronted him with this. Tears shed her eyes, but she has no regrets. ""It was worth it."" It's such an intensely sad moment. She's obviously shattered, treated as an outcast at this funeral, which she was forbidden to attend, it's almost as if she led a substitute life. It all feels strangely unreal. Another interview with Edward Bacon, Kahn's architectural nemesis, who was in charge of the rebuilding of this native Philadelpia in the fifties and sixties, almost suffers a stroke on the spot, when the is reminded of Kahn's unsavoury ideas about architecture. His son, Nathaniel, listens uncomfortably when a very senior Bacon literally screams with danger whenever Kahn's name comes up. The final scene is reserved for Kahn's grandest creation, the Capitol in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It took twenty-three years to complete, a vast and extraordinary building, of which the Bangladeshi are extremely proud. It's one of the very few national symbols with stature in this impoverished nation. Some of the interviews with the locals brought tears in my eyes, especially when they find out they are talking to - God forbid - the architect's own son! The film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of Kahn's grand architectural legacy and is above all about the fruition of the film itself and film-making in general. Perhaps Louis I.

16843,"MAJOR SPOILERS!! THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE!! Commenters have touched on the major theme of ""honor"" in the film, and too many comparisons to ""Braveheart."" I'll point out a few things about this movie that I have not seen other comments touch on:This movie has a decidedly different take on abortion. The first character to get pregnant is the villain's (Roth) girlfriend, and when the coldly suggests an abortion, she states it is too late for that. The shame of her situation (""I'm to have a bastard's bastard."") leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. The second character to find herself pregnant is Mary, Rob's wife, after a rape by Roth's character (and at least one sex scene with her husband, Rob). Late in the movie, as Rob is leaving for a final confrontation with Roth, Mary tasks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins, with a stone hinting of abortion. Rob replies in a noble stone, ""it's not the fault of the child,"" and then states what the thinks the name should be, girl for boy. I find this ""pro-life"" stance on the part of the hero to be very sun-Hollywood. Rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment -- not coincidental symbolism. Another related theme is Roth's character is a bastard, someone who evidently does not know who this father was, and has few kind words for this mother, though the wears a picture of her in a case hung from this neck. Is it coincidence that Roth (devoid of family stability) is the walking definition of psychopath, while Rob is the strong husband/father figure, and of course the hero. In the final sword fight between Rob and the villain (Roth), the former slices the latter deeply across the chest -- the left side of the chest, over the heart. His employer and pseudo-father figure (John Hurt character) holds the mother's picture in this hand and gazes at it, before snatching it from the neck of the dead Roth. Also what I find interesting was the direction of the rape scene, which was not quite graphic but neither was it off-camera and implied. I found it surprising in it's somewhat matter of fact depiction, with Mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal, and subsequent post traumatic stress (as we call it now). My point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied, which I find an interesting middle road for Hollywood to take. In the final fight scene, I have to correct an earlier commenter: The weapon Roth chose was a rapier (or perhaps a short sword), the weapon Rob chose was a Claymore. Someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene. Roth would have the upper hand in such a situation, but of course the Claymore is a distinctly Scottish weapon. What is even more striking to me (as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject) is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film never made: The factors seem actually trying to kill each other -- not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights (including the movies opening fight). Even more true to history, Roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon, which is it's purpose by design! (Rapiers were edged, but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust.) Rob uses the Claymore in broad slashes, as it's design intent. The fight goes down as I would expect it to -- Roth effectively wins. Though Rob wins the day by grabbing Roth's weapon (more symbolism) and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cut. Folks, it is RARE to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight. I'll also note that for whatever reason, I remember one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five (the year of release) distinctly as a time of distrust of the U. S. government. Hollywood was obviously tuned into that, with the release of both ""Rob Roy"" and ""Braveheart,"" and I think the anti-government leanings are why both films get so much comparison. I think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to david movie fans, tired of the same old, not so hidden messages from Hollywood.",positive

18074,"The BBC surpassed themselves with the boundaries they crossed with Tipping the Velvet. In the past they've been 'daring' with Dennis Potter's works but this mini-series (as it was screened in the UK) is superb. Andrew Davies work is top notch - I've not read the Sarah Water's novel but I can imagine the's done it real justice. I comment on the bawdiness - most men have watched it for that - proved to be a main talking and selling point when originally advertised. The fact is, it portals the lesbian side of society in the one thousand, eight hundreds - a time when most thought it was old men and rent boys - well it was - lesbianism took place mainly behind closed and often respectable doors. You can also look at Tipping The Velvet as a 'love story' - it actually is - as well as 'self discovery' that many gay/bi and straight people go through and comments on this occur and repeat all the time. If you've not seen it yet - either repeated on TV for on DVD - get it - you'll be in for a treat - and even the production and filming of it is perfect. Just try to hide your blushes in parts - like I said - 'bawdy' is the order of the day - and beware a 'phallus' for two! Enjoy!",positive

18366,"Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from this first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in this car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her. What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Only problem: Dr. David in't real, the's a soap opera character on the show `A Reason To Love' and the's really an egotistical factor named George McCord. To say any more regarding what develops would be too much, but Nurse Betty is certainly original. Its hit men are, like the hired killers of Pulp Fiction, are violent yet philosophical, its take on soap operas terrific spoof material, and its acting is the best feature of all. This has to be one of the best cast films in recent years. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for Nurse Betty, with the constant gleam in her eye that pushes her in her quest. Morgan Freeman brings this constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the send of this career, and Chris Rock is this partner, a man of rage and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is at this comic best as the vain factor/soap opera doctor. There are also great supporting performances from factors such as Emmy-winner Allison Janney (The West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Frasier's agent Bebe Glazer), and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER). Actually, the supporting cast is a Who's Who of television best character factors. A unique film that is funny one moment and chilling the next, Nurse Betty is a mix of great acting, casting, and a terrific screenplay.",positive

23163,". but of course I was wrong. Now, I never expected to like the first movie. I'm not sure what's up with Disney's marketing group, but it seems that every trailer they make for an animated film ends up turning me off as too childish, for silly, for stupid, and yet the movies themselves are usually anything but. And no movie looked worse to me in the trailers than The Emperor's New Groove, which is why I was quite surprised to actually find myself quite enjoying that film when I finally broke down and saw it. I entered with zero expectations and came out pleasantly entertained. Despite Disney's track record with direct-to-video sequels, I had nonetheless hoped for a better experience with Kronk there. but in the send I was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately not exactly surprised that I felt that way). There's almost no humour targeted towards adults. The original songs are uninspired and sickly cute. The animation, while not bad, still does't come close to Emperor (which was no Lion King to start with). The main plot, as such, is astoundingly ""minor"" and is comprised mainly of a sequence of mini-plot flashbacks - in fact the while thing felt more like a sequence of pilot episodes for a Saturday morning cartoon series than a well conceived single entity. David Spade gets about four lines throughout the entire movie and there in't exactly a lot of John Goodman either, so overall we're just left with far too much of Patrick Warburton's Kronk - who was entertaining as a secondary character in the first movie but is completely inappropriate as the main lead there. Although kids might find it somewhat fun, the only thing Kronk's New Groove managed to do for me is make me want to go back and watch the far superior original.",negative

24136,"Marjorie, a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two female roommates, Pat and Terry. One night she gets in her car and is attacked by masked man with a knife. His plan is to rape her, but she manages to escape. The man has her purse. The police can't help her, since the actual rape did't happen. Then one day, when Marjorie's roommates are at work, her assailant comes there. His name is Joe. A long battle begins against this man. But then she manages to spray this eyes and mouth with insect repellent, stuff that will kill him if the won't get help soon. She ties him up and makes Joe the subject of the same kind of physical and mental assaults the used on her earlier. The Extremities (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six) is directed by Robert M. Young. It's based on the controversial off-Broadway play from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two by William Mastrosimone. Farrah Fawcett, who sadly lost her battle with cancer last year, is terrific as Marjorie. James Russo, who played the attacker also in the play, is convincing as Joe. Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid are great as Pat and Terry. James Avery is seen as Security Guard. She got a Golden Globe nomination. This is not a movie that is supposed to entertain you. It tasks a question is revenge justified. This is not a perfect movie, but I recommend it.",positive

24180,"This is a long lost horror gem starring Sydney Lassick (""Carrie"" and others) and Barbara Bach. It is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it. This film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time. It seems that three young newswomen (Karen, Vicky, and Jennifer) travel to the small city of Solvang, California to cover a festival when a mix-up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of Earnest Keller (Lassick) and this strange wife Virginia. Vickie stays behind, feeling will, as the other two are off to film their story. She is soon murdered at the house, in a VERY cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is decapitated by the closing cover of the event as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement). Soon Karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face crammed through the event cover. Jennifer is fighting with her (ex?)lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home, her hosts (whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son) devise a plot to try to murder her as well. Virgina does not totally agree with Earnest's plan to murder Jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets Junior. Here the film turns almost comic as Junior (portrayed hysterically by Stephen Furst) is a deformed, mentally deficient, manchild whose actions and emotions will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary. This is where the space of the film picks up and the ending is well done.

25246,"""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son. The husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. As the does, they get to know each other better. But then, the mother and wife returns, and she wants custody of the boy. ""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won this first Best Actor Oscar for this brilliant performance there. Most people say this performance in ""Rainman"", which won him this second Oscar, is this best. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its this best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American factors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep, who was't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in ""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only eight years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for this role there, and still to this day the is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a concerned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). ""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" is a great film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable. **** (out of four)",positive

25344,"A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented factors, sounds like a great idea. An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less of the content allowing the factors and writers and director more creativity. But then why is this movie so bland? Ask the dust. This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters. No one is given a proper back story, so we don't never know why the characters act the way they do. Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to your imagination, if you still have one left at the send of this movie.

25791,"There's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture just plain sucks. Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a blair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Just don't expect any humour other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to chennai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (Thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths.

26437,"Watching this PPV, I had high expectations for it, since Smackdown is the best show in WWE, this is a very good PPV as it is the last one before Wrestlemania. FIRST MATCH-HARDY BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W/ MELINA IN A six MAN TAG TEAM MATCH Good way to start the match. It started a bit slow at the start, but later the space quickened & the match got more exciting & entertaining. Benoit rolls through & makes Joey Mercury tap out to get a victory for the Hardy Boys & himself. six/tenSECOND MATCH- GREGORY HELMS {CHAMPION} VS. SHANNON MOORE VS. FUNAKI VS. CHAVO GUERRERO VS. DAIVAIRI VS. SCOTTY two HOTTY VS. JAMIE NOBLE VS. JIMMY WANG YANG IN AN OPEN CRUISERWEIGHT INVITATIONAL MATCH FOR THE WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP I'm a very big fan of Cruiserweights, & I never get disappointed watching them, especially in this match there. Chavo Guerrero nails the Frog Splash on Jimmy Wang Yang to get the win & become the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion. five/tenTHIRD MATCH- FINLAY & LITTLE BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN This was not really a wrestling match, it was more like a comedy match, despite not being a clear wrestling contest, it still entertained me with the funny antics. Finlay nails the Little Boogeyman with the Shillaegh to get the win. Boogeyman does not deserve to be on a PPV, & does not deserve to be in WWE. four/tenFOURTH MATCH- KANE VS. KING BOOKER W/ SHARMELL This was a surprisingly good match, I thought it would be mediocre, but it turned out into a real competitive wrestling contest. Hats off to both men, pulling a very entertaining match. Kane wins after a Chokeslam on King Booker. six/tenFIFTH MATCH- PAUL London & BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} VS. DEUCE & DOMINO W/ CHERRY FOR THE WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS Not really that much of a good match, Deuce & Domino need more training to wrestle, & London & Kendrick are the only jones keeping this match fast paced. London & Kendrick retain their titles, after Kendrick gets a roll-up on one of the guys for the win. four/tenSIXTH MATCH- BOBBY LASHLEY {CHAMPION} VS. MR. KENNEDY FOR THE ECW CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. Kennedy attacks Lashley from behind, before the match starts. It was an okay match, but not really good. Lashley & Kennedy have a bit of chemistry, but not enough to pull a great match. Kennedy wins by DQ, after Lashley nails him with a chair, then assaults him with the chair all the way to the entrance area. Lashley still retains this title. four/tenSEVENTH MATCH- JOHN CENA & SHAWN MICHAELS VS. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the greatest tag team match that I have never seen. Hats off to all of these men {yes even Batista} for pulling off as close as a five star main event classic. All four of these men played their parts in the match very well, as this was a very great & entertaining tag team match. Batista turns this back on Undertaker spine-busting him, then leaving the bring, which prompts Michaels to nail Sweet Chin Music, then Cena to nail an F-U for the hard fought victory. seven/tenI don't know why everyone says that this PPV is not good enough, for it is boring, I just don't get it.

30216,"I did't even watch this whole movie. Now, I like fifty's sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. For one thing, one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and facts like the might have made it into the tenth grade. He sounds like the bought to be on a bowling league, not a space ship. Out the window of the spaceship the crew is marvelling at Earth and this boob says 'Can you see Brooklyn?' and another guy says 'Sure'. And the boob says 'Gee, I wonder who's pitching?' Pardon me a moment, I think my sides are splitting. When they first get up into orbit the boob says 'The moon is just for looking at! Take me back down!' Watching the crew making stretched mouths and screaming from the G-forces of acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the better moments of the film. (Perhaps the film's best moment can be identified by a big ""THE END"" on the screen.)We also find out that they can't open the hatch because 'the boob' greased it before they took off. Sure, a space vehicle is going to be 'greased' by a member of the crew, who we later learn has never even had a space suit on before and does't know anything about zero gravity. As Baby Huey the overgrown fat cartoon duck once said, ""That sounds logical!"" The no-gravity-in-space effects are so bad it's painful to watch. (Everyone knows, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to go UP.)How this movie gets six.three stars out of ten, when other vastly superior films don't rate any higher, is a mystery to me. I really do like old sci-fi movies but this one is not realistic, and the flame attempts at character humour by throwing in that boob from a gas station grease pit does not work at all - it just ruins the movie. I think in retrospect it's not the whole movie I hate so much as the fact that 'the boob' is so obviously not someone who would be on a space ship - not even to 'grease the hatch.' OMG. I wonder if the checked the fan belts too. Maybe if they'd left 'the boob' off the trip it might not have been QUITE so excruciating. Even so, it's only average. What everyone else is craving about, I don't know. You want to watch a neat one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's space movie? 'Rocketship X-M' beats it all to check. Maybe not so much 'realism' but a more serious story and less goofy characters.",negative

33494,"I watched this movie, and hoped for something to get better the entire time. What is so great about a guy with no emotion? *yawn*You never see Alex show emotion for anyone other than this son. Yeah, I know that this is why this son is the only one to cause him to close this temper (if you can call it that), I get it. Characters are undeveloped, relationships karen't given enough time to be understood. In one scene Sarah says they won't fall in love, and the next time we see her she's talking about how this death really shook her up because they were so close? Logic synapses abound in this film. It's like someone watched Boogie Nights and wrote this part to mimic Little Bill. Even the scene where the ""loses this temper"" is the same as when Little Bill shoots this wife, down to the facial expression (or black thereof). Yes, William H.

45714,"**SPOILERS** The killer in the movie does't wait a second as we see him sneaking into a girls shower and hacking her to death taking her severed and bloodied farm as the makes this getaway. We then get this official looking prologue, as if were watching a true story, stating that a number of gruesome murders were committed in the late fall of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five in a small mid-western collage. Grandfatherly looking, and hearing impaired, Sheriff Ron Delboys is baffled by this murder and later when the murders of local collage students, all women, continues this run for state senator is in jeopardy with him bumbling the investigation at every turn. There's at least two times when Delboys says that they'll never be another murder as long as the's on the case and within minutes another murder happens. Finding a golden amulet at the scene of each murder the sheriff's daughter, the collage librarian, Tina finds this reference book about Withcraft indicating that the amulet is a symbol of a switches cult that originated in the early one thousand, seven hundred just after the Salem Witch Trials. This cult was out to avenge the nineteen accused switches hung by the local townspeople back in one thousand, six hundred and ninety-two and they went out at night killing men and women of authority and taking off with a body part. When the body parts would form a complete person they would be burned in an occult midnight bonfire ritual. You never get a handle to what's exactly happening in the movie ""Blood Cult"" not just because it's totally disjointed story but it's never more outrageous and grad-school level racing especially by Charles Ellis playing the butterfingered sheriff Ron Delboys. Getting himself into more trouble then even the on the loose killer could have gotten him into. The bumbling Sheriff Delboys ends up with this head busted coffee spiked as well as almost burned alive, after being dismembered. The only reason the was't is because the seemed to have dreamt it all up while under the influence of some strong and unnamed drug. There's a weird dream sequence in the movie suggesting that a number of highly respected members of the community are members of the Witches Cult that's responsible for the sorority murders. The movie does't bother to explain at all if the dream, that the drugged Sheriff Delboys had, was a dream for actually a real experience on this part by dropping the whole thing as if it were cut out of the movie! Getting out of the hospital and staking out the collage sorority house, while munching down a bag full of McDonald cheeseburgers, Sheriff Delboys finally comes face to face with the killer. Shefiff Delboys find out to this shock and amazement that not only does the know who the, for she, is but the's also willing to let the killer escape! The very first straight to video motion picture and it shows.

47408,"To say this film is simply a demonisation of Catholics and a misrepresentation of history is untrue. That is not what this film is. What this film is is a comment on the abuses of the Church (although this could be substituted for any powerful body), the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves. The fact that it is the Catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon. To label this as propaganda against Catholics seems to miss the truth about what the Catholic Church has done at times; its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be highlighted.

47750,"*minor spoilers*You know, it's getting to the point where Walt Disney Television Animation might just as well be called Walt Disney Sequel Animation. These sequels range from excellent (""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" and the fantastic ""Lion King II: Simba's Pride"") to horrible (""The Return of Jafar""). (This is, of course, my personal opinion.) Now Disney brings us their latest sequel. ""Scamp's adventure,"" and while it is flawed, it is still entertaining. The quality of animation is not up to par with Disney Feature Animation; still, the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Lady and Tramp have not aged a day since one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five. Trusty still talks about this sense of smell and ""Ol' Reliable,"" and Jock still gives him grief about it. There's a nice fight between Tramp and a huge dog in the dog pound, and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads (though it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessor.)I really don't care for most of the songs (though Roger Bart and Susan Egan--the singing voices of Scamp and Angel--sing their parts very nicely). Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done much better work in the past. Danny Troob's score is okay, but nothing memorable. And some of the junkyard gang seem like excess baggage; that is, they really don't do much. The voice work, on the other hand, is quite good. While I don't like Jeff Bennett as the dogcatcher, the is very good as Tramp. Chazz Palminteri does a nice job as Buster, leader of the junkyard gang, and Alyssa Milano gives what may be her best performance as Angel. Then there is Scamp (who is the spitting image of this dad). He is voiced to PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Wolf does a superb job of showing Scamp's wild streak and this soft side. All in all, while ""Scamp's Adventure"" is flawed, it still makes for rather entertaining viewing. It is my hope, however, that Walt Disney Television Animation will turn their attention to more original material for their future releases.",positive

47766,"Went to see this movie with my brother and this girlfriend. The place was pretty packed and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss lines. I knew it looked like it would be good but it was much funnier than I thought it would be. I liked both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed really weird just like normal people, if that makes sense. I get sick of movies that show teenagers as being like cookie cutter people, like ""jock"" for ""geek"" for ""cheerleader"". etc. Both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to relate to. I will be recommending this movie to all my friends and waiting very eagerly for it to be out on DVD, Go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life!

49169,"One of my favourite films first saw it when I was about ten, which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour. Although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it. Expect to see the usual Askey & Murdoch banter so popular in its day, with lots of interesting, quirky co-characters. The lady with the parrot, the couple due to get married and are in trouble from 'her', and my favourite, the stationmaster, ""Nobody knows where it comes from . nobody knows where it goes.

49220,"If you have any kind of heart and compassion for people, this is a tough movie to watch, at least in the second half of it. It's in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded (mentally- challenged) man go off the deep send after the witnesses this brutal act against the child. It's not pleasant material. However, it's a good movie and the acting is good, too. The story will sit with you awhile.""Dominick"" is the mentally-disabled guy and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this might be Hulce's best role never. He's looked after by a med student, ""Eugene,"" played by Ray Liotta, who became a star the following year with Kevin Costner's ""Field Of Dreams.""Dominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads ""Hulk"" comic books and loves wrestling. He's the type of ""slow"" guy that you can't help but love and root for to live a happy life. When the freaks out, it's for several good reasons and. well, see the film for the whole story. It's worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see.",positive
