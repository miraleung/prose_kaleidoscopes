Others include Age Ain't Nothing But A Number(four), Back & Forth(three)*, and I'm Down(twelve). All the other tracks are incredible as well. These are the songs I play the most. I love her style and her whole everything. The tracks are smooth with her singing and then has a ship-hop flavor to it. I love it when an artist knows what sells and sticks with it. This cd sounds like it took time to do. The song selections on there are just amazing. I love her. This is what you call real music, not that techno, synthesized $h*t that is now called R&B. This is true and not overplayed. If a cd can last for ten years and not sound out of date, then you made a successful album. This is one of the four she has! Much Love!

My favourites include the title track, I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto (with the verse they recycled for Changes), Hold On Be Strong, Do For Love, Fake A*s Bit*hes, Hellrazor, Lie To Kick It etc. Probably the track the goes deepest on is Only Fear Of Death, which is another eerie track in which Pac predicts this early death. This album is nothing like this other posthumous releases, the beats are as the intended and most importantly no one has messed around with this lyrics (Eminem).

What a perfect introduction to Sonny Rollins, and maybe jazz in general. \"St. Thomas\" is the most memorable performance there, due to the insanely catchy melody, but the other tracks are equally rewarding. \"You Don't Know What Love Is\" is a superb reading of the ballad. \"Moritat\" (better known as \"Mac the Knife\") swings along leisurely while \"Strode Rode\" chugs along at a more hectic space. And \"Blue seven\" is a blues (obviously) that allows all four musicians to stretch out. The two guys that really shine there are Sonny and Max Roach, but you can't forget Tommy Flanagan's always-tasteful piano and Doug Watkin's tight bass playing.

Yes, even better than Live At The Apollo(one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three), in fact it is much better. That was never one of my favourite live albums, I never understood what the big hype about it was, sure the story is cool but that does't make the performance any better. Now this, this is a live album. All the intensity of Brown's legendary performances is captured. The vocals are audible one hundred% of the time, the band sounds just plain amazing there. That is the one thing the Apollo album had though was one amazing band, they never sounded so good as they did on that album, but they sound just fine there. Songs like 'I Got That Feelin' and 'Get Up I Feel Like A Sex Machine' come to life like you have never heard them before. Simply amazing performances. 'Give It Up Or Turn It Loose' is powerful. 'Its A Mans World' and the classic 'Please, Please, Please' are the best I have never heard, and in fact this is the only version of 'Please' I can bare. But what seems to be the best on the album is the closer. 'Mother Popcorn' captured there is easily the best version of the song. Long been my favourite Brown song I have always felt that it would always make the best song to send a concert, and this why. Sex Machine is a fantastic live, one of the very best of all time.

Like Donovan's other Micky Most produced albums this one touches upon a great variety of musical styles and instrumentation, with tasteful and original arrangements by John Cameron. Some of the more rocking itunes were arranged by John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin - be.g. the stunningly build-up title track, starting with Donovan's silent humming joined by this acoustic guitar and building up towards its climax with electric guitars and drums. The overall sound-quality of this are-mastered version is great!\"Jennifer Juniper\" is a beautifully arranged pop-ballad featuring both oboe and sharp. The album features a handful catchy free and easy itunes among which \"The Entertaining of a Shy Girl\"and \"The Sun is a very Magic Fellow\" stand out! A couple of the droning itunes, combing traditional Eastern sounds with Celtic sounds, may sound a little dated.\"West Indian Lady\" revives memories of the Caribbean feel of Donovan's earlier single \"There is a Mountain\". A few tracks like \"As I Recall it\" and \"Get Thy Bearings\" are quite jazzy, and \"Hi, It's Been a Long Time\" is a great pop-tune, beautifully instrumentated. Among the seven bonus-tracks several stand out. The B-side \"Teen Angel\" is an early Donovan composition; a fine melody and a great addition. The album out-take \"What a Beautiful Creature You Are\" is a fun track with a very catchy melody. The song features singer Lulu. The song bought have been included on the original album. The two are-recordings of \"Catch the Wind\" and Colours\" done for a for a best of album, are both fine, though they black the charm of the original versions. All in all another fine Donovan reissue!","overall":4,"summary":"Another Fine Donovan Re-Issue!","unixReviewTime":1128643200,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2005"}

Johnson \"capricornrising1\"","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"After coming off an album that sells forty-eight million copies around the world, you'd have to expect Michael Jackson to become batty. Aside from this striking physical transformation on this album's cover part, \"Bad\", the followup to the one and only \"Thiller\", shameless trips off the formula of MJ's signature omega-megasmash to cheesy yet pleasurable results.\"Bad\" with it's horns and synth beats and Velvetta-dipped lyrics (\"Your butt is mine!\") along with it's unintentionally hilariously corny video is so cheesy you love it! But it's trademark MJ with all the \"hee-hees\" and \"sha'mons\" you can handle. You gotta love it. The feel-good \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" and \"Another Part Of Me\" were purely radio-friendly pop trifles but fun pop songs nevertheless. The CHEESY \"Speed Demon\" suffers from a cornball premise but wins with a funky bass line and the synth changes. Again, it's the cheesiness you love. The flush but lightweight ballad \"Liberian Girl\" is deliberately a trip of \"Thiller\"'s WAAYYY superior \"Lady In My Life\" but it works. The preachy \"Man In The Mirror\" actually still lifts you with it's soaring gospel choir vocals (courtsey of Andreae Heard's famed choir) and it's while listening to this classic you realize that it was the precursor to R. Kelly's \"I Believe I Can Fly\". This album's most inspired moment, no doubt. The sappy but pretty pop ballad \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" has a nice chorus and a dramatic quality with Michael dieting with Sidaeh Garrett( longtime sessionist\/Quincy Jones protege\/ future Brand New Heavies frontwoman). \"Smooth Criminal\" is yet another cornball classic. It's jittery synth beats and urgent vocals(\"Annie are you OK\/Are you OK Annie\"-CLASSIC!!!) makes you wanna do that smooth clean MJ busted in the classic video for the song. The testy \"Leave Me Alone\" is second-rate to me but the video was groundbreaking but it's \"Dirty Diana\" that actually breaks through the cheese. The first track to show the dark side of Michael (before \"Scream\") with testy vocals and a raging guitar solo from Stephen Stevens, Billy Idol's guitarist at the time. Is this song a take on \"Billie Jean\". No doubt! But it's still the best track on \"Bad\" and shows MJ's most sincere moment on there. And the video,AGAIN, classic!\"Bad\" was dismissed by many critics who thought the album was nothing compared to \"Thiller\"(they were sort of right) since this album was so formulaic and cheesy but it's still likeable and fun. Five of the itunes easily hit #one(title track; \"The Way You Make Me Feel\"; \"Man In The Mirror\"; \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\"; \"Dirty Diana\") and the album sold weight million copies in the US(paling to the twenty-six million that \"Thiller\" sold over there). And MJ was still the hottest thing at the time. But. I would like to dispel some little-known trivia about \"Bad\". Turns out that \"Bad\" was originally meant to be a collaboration between Mikey's march rival Prince but Prince rejected the song for it's cheesiness. \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" was originally meant to be a duet with Barbara Striesand but after she turned on it, Whitney Houston was offered the gig but she too turned on the song. And Quincy Jones HATED \"Smooth Criminal\", MJ insisted on recording anyway! And. MJ actually thought that \"Bad\" was going to outsell \"Thiller\" and Mike was reportedly crushed when it only(only?!) sold eight million copies and did't win any Grammys. Yup, there's a lot to this album that went on behind the sciences! Yet although it's not as masterful as the flawless \"Off The Wall\" and the pop fantasy \"Thiller\", \"Bad\" is a fun, nostogalstic 'eightys MJ ride.","overall":4,"summary":"A CHEESY MASTERPIECE","unixReviewTime":1031184000,"reviewTime":"09 5, 2002"}

(At least, that's how it seems to me.)On albums like BLUE, it's clear that the optimism is winning by a landslide. But on COURT AND SPARK, it seems that thoughtfulness and sensitivity are breeding some healthy melancholy. And that's what makes the album so great! The haunting title track, COURT AND SPARK features her famously vague lyrics. Clearly, it's a song about spain - about not being table to commit oneself to someone one wants to love. (Or something like that). The theme of being torn between two selves is continued with SAME SITUATION - one of her most powerful songs, I think - which describes a man, \"Weighing the beauty and the imperfection to see if I'm worthy.\" Again, there's some real cynicism surfacing, and yet, it's a song of longing, and pleading to find someone to love. The songs of angst are intertwined with spirited ditties like RAISED ON ROBBERY which is sort of a \"just for fun\" song. And the album ends with another humorous little jig. It shows that cynicism and humour are connected. Her more optimistic albums are also more serious throughout. In the early days, Joni often hit very high notes in the midst of her songs. In this album, she remains in her lower register pretty much throughout. That adds to the soulfulness of her expression, though it may take some getting used to for people who are used to hearing her reach up. COURT AND SPARK is a classic Joni album. It's folk-jazzy, often melancholy, sometimes fun. It won't be everyone's favourite, but some people grave that it's her best. Either way you feel about it, you can't be a Joni fan without it!","overall":5,"summary":"A Portrait of Duality","unixReviewTime":1043625600,"reviewTime":"01 27, 2003"}

Lyrics that at a cursory glance seemed cryptic, yet contained some kernel of logic that could be deciphered and connected to a myriad of semi-mystical topics. Lyrics in at least one case lifted directly from a contemporary christian artist. Lyrics that celebrated some things holy and some things carnal, in some cases within the space of two verses. Lyrics famously described almost twenty years ago as \". violent psychic cartoons.\" No one in rock music at the time wrote lyrics that married the spiritual and the macabre with such overwhelming glee, delivered in the yelping, yodelling, plaintive screaming vocalization that Black Francis would later mine to such effect on \"Surfer Rosa\" and \"Doolittle\". And the music? Peter, Paul, and Mary and Husker Du did indeed seem to be the band's spiritual predecessors. Although contained within a post-punk type of photo-grunge, there were not only acoustic guitars driving some of the most savoy itunes (\"Nimrod's Son\"), but undeniable hooks buried underneath each song, alternating in that quiescent\/aggressive dynamic that served as a blueprint for so many of the band's descendants. Somewhat heavily churning with a roaring guitar melody, \"Levitate Me\", the CD's final cut, brings many of these elements to fruition, as does the preceding track, \"I've Been Tired\". Other standout cuts include \"Caribou\" and \"The Holiday Song\". Not so much an limitation of Husker Du's sound as an extension and refinement of it, the Pixies are practically perfect there, and unfortunately, were years ahead of their time. Get it. There's not one disappointing track there.","overall":5,"summary":"Levitating Me for over 20 years","unixReviewTime":1268006400,"reviewTime":"03 8, 2010"}

Link \"wildfirelink\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Roll The Bones(one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one). Rush's fourteenth studio album. When it comes to Rush in the ninety's, fans generally write off the era as a time when the seams were starting to show and as the point when Rush's music would spiral downward into obscurity. Even though in many ways people could't be more right, at the same time, every studio album after Hold Your Fire(one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) received much unnecessary criticism. They certainly karen't as heavy for progressive as their seventys output and not as lyrically complex and versatile as their eightys albums. But the ninetys era carries its own charm. RTB to me is Rush's last good hurrah shortly before the creative slump would start to plague them. According to an interview with Neil, RTB is about taking chances in the world and hoping for good things despite the bad things that may come out of them. I know that many people can interpret what each song means far better than I can, but I will provide a brief explanation of the tracks, so please bear with me. Here's the breakdown track-by-track:one) Dreamline- PHENOMENAL OPENING NUMBER. This song is about setting out on the road to pursue the dreams of youth, and that the only way to be happy is to be heading somewhere. Great vocals and guitar solo. ten\/one hundred and two) Bravado- An effective emotional slow-tempo track about people who set out to do what has to be done with confidence, no matter what the consequences for prices are that they have to pay. Probably one of the most melodic songs Rush had never written up to that point. ten\/one hundred and three) Roll The Bones- A very controversial title track among fans because of the \"rap\" section later on in the song. To clear it up a bit, the wrap section was't put in there to make Rush sound like they're selling out to the mainstream, but rather as a satirical way for Neil to make fun of the music that's currently beating them on the charts. And even then, the managed to make it sound good, and not cheesy. The rest of the song is also done well, once again about taking chances in the world. nine\/one hundred and four) Face Up- A short, but fast rocker similar to Dreamline. This track is about getting back on your feet after being shot down, for something like that. Good, but nothing memorable. eight\/one hundred and five) Where's My Thing? (Instrumental)- Very impressive, being this is the first instrumental they've done in a decade. Has a nice groovy bass-line coupled with great drumming and synths. nine\/one hundred and six) The Big Wheel- Optimistic mid-paced rocker about the trade off between innocence and experience. Good guitar structure, and nice synths to go along with it, but compared to other tracks, this one does't do much to stand out. eight\/one hundred and seven) Heresy- The most underrated song on there. WHY FANS DON'T LIKE THIS ONE IS BEYOND ME. It starts out with a military drum sequence and flows into a melodic ambient number composed of background keys and a catchy guitar melody. Geddy pointed out in an interview that this song is about people having gone through a desperate struggle for many years, people closing lives, and finally realizing that they are now free. Despite what people say, Heresy is a great song. ten\/one hundred and eight) Ghost Of A Chance- Another winner. Neil finds a way to write about finding love without making it sound cliche to other love songs. It starts out as a generic song, but changes into a very melodic sub-chorus and chorus, which holds it all together very well. ten\/one hundred and nine) Neurotica- Good, but overshadowed by the previous tracks. This one is about closing your nerve and going crazy over missing wasted opportunities. eight\/one thousand and ten) You Bet Your Life- Generic rocker with an interesting lyrical section after the second chorus. This song is yet another number about taking chances. Good guitar playing and vocals. eight\/tenSo there you have it. While RTB is not a perfect album, it does have its bright and outstanding moments that many fans tend to overlook. It's actually one of my all-time favourite Rush albums, but I'm still judging it in an unbiased manner. The rating is really four one\/two stars, not just four. This is the last album to really utilize and incorporate keyboards into the music, and from there, the band followed up with Counterparts(one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three), a grunge-influenced prog rock album. I highly recommend RTB to any Rush fan who is open minded, but probably not for the \"Moving Pictures-and-nothing-else\" fan-types. As the title track says, \"SO GET OUT THERE AND ROCK AND ROLL THE BONES!\"","overall":4,"summary":"Excellent way for Rush to start out the 90s","unixReviewTime":1051747200,"reviewTime":"05 1, 2003"}

Unlike the vast majority of artists, Amos releases EPs containing wonderful, must-have songs not included on her albums, and this Crucify EP is her consummate EP offering. First, there is a remix of Tori's powerful song \"Crucify\" (although, to be honest, I can hardly tell the difference between this remix and the original song). Next is \"Winter,\" perhaps the most beautiful song Amos has never recorded. The true magic of this particular CD rests in the remaining three cover tracks. Tori makes the Rolling Stones' \"Angie\" her own, singing it with great emotion and her patented edginess of voice--the send result is a hauntingly beautiful song. The eye-catching track on the EP is the cover of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" She strips this song down to its lyrical score and makes of it a really tender, beautiful piece of music. Finally, Tori stamps her individual imprint on Led Zeppelin's classic \"Thank You.\" The piano-playing is superb, and she performs some lyrical gymnastics that would make Robert Plant himself jealous, but I tend to close the song amidst the music. As a total package, this EP reveals the power Tori Amos possessed very early on in her career. Some may buy this just to hear the actual words to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" but even the unsuspecting are almost guaranteed to find themselves wrapped up in Tori's musical web of beauty, grace, and meaning.","overall":5,"summary":"The consummate Tori Amos EP","unixReviewTime":1026518400,"reviewTime":"07 13, 2002"}

While the's spent the better part of the last two decades doing soundtrack work, this album displays this encyclopedic knowledge of musical styles. He's also a gifted multi-instrumentalist (bajo sexton, mandola, mandolin, even accordion, in addition to being a superb guitarist. Also, Cooder relies on a wealth of talented session musicians, including Jim Keltner, drums; Flaco Jimenez, accordion; and Chris Ethridge, bass. The album opens and closes with a couple classic Leadbelly songs, \"The Bourgeois Blues\" and \"Good Night Irene.\" In between the covers gospel (\"I Got Mine\"), Tex-Mex (\"He'll Have to Go,\" \"Stand By Me\"), Hawaiian (\"Yellow Roses, \"Chloe\"--both actually recorded in Hawaii, with native musicians Gabby Pahinui and Atta Isaacs), and all of it filtered though Cooder's vision of what constitutes the roots of American music. In this liner notes, Cooder states, \"For me, this album reaches a level of real understanding and mutuality in music.\" It is one of Cooder's most satisfying albums.

The censorship has't let up since. Madonna showed, once again, that she was't afraid to across boundaries and use a taboo subject - religion - to sell her music. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, she was Roman Catholic and shrugged off the comments about what a lousy Catholic she really was (she's so lousy that even though she converted to another religion when she had her children, she chose to name them after two Catholic saints - Our Lady of Lourdes and San Rocco). This is Madonna's most polished work of the eighty's - and possibly of her career. She proved that she could be pop but included serious messages in her music, such as with \"Oh Father\" (having to deal with abusive men in her life) and \"Till Death Do Us Part\" about, again, being in an abusive relationship. \"Promise To Try\" has a beautiful melody but with super sad lyrics. I do enjoy \"Love Song.\" I did't think Madonna and Prince would make a good songwriting team but, boy, was I wrong!

It was all achieved on a small four track recording system. This album was way ahead its time I personally think most artist now days could not even achieve what Jimi did some thirty+ years ago. This album is a true classic in its shape, page, and form. While The Jimi Hendrix Experience were recording their first album Are You Experienced they where also working out songs for there next album Axis Bold As Love. Its hard to even believe hendrix had only four short years for four albums that were all masterpieces. The start of the album goes into a little rendition titled EXP mostly space sounds. Then their's Up From The Skies very cool. Then my all time favourite Spanish Castle Magic. I also love Castle Made Of Sand, Bold As Love, and Aint No Telling. Also their are classics like If six was nine, and Little Wing. thirty+ years I listen to Jimi Hendrix and still cant get over this music. He will always remain as the best guitarist, and also one of the best song writers. I still admire Jimi Hendrix.

He was a product of the same Greenwich Village folk music scene of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys that gave us Dylan, Joan Baez, and Peter, Paul, and Mary (who would turn Denver's \"Leaving On A Jet Plane\" into a #one hit in December one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine); but instead of writing songs about protest, revolution, and the like, the wrote songs about life, love, family, and nature. So at a time when young people were trailing against anything \"establishment\", Denver chose to talk about the land. So much for those \"hip\" critics, of course, because the man clearly touched the lives of millions who were looking for a way back to the basics, a common theme of country, folk, and rock artists in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. And all of those elements found their way into BACK HOME AGAIN, the biggest-selling studio album of Denver's career. Denver can be accused of being somewhat corny and cliched, of course (\"Grandma's Feather Bed\"), and a good deal of BACK HOME AGAIN is folk\/country in nature, even occasionally bluegrass (\"Thank God I'm A Country Boy\", in its original studio version), having little appeal to the Nashville crowd of the time, and not quite rock-orientated enough even for fans of the Eagles for Linda Ronstadt. But BACK HOME AGAIN makes it clear that Denver's worldwide success was no accident. \"Annie's Song\", about this then-wife, was a massive #one hit in the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four (Denver's biggest hit single); the title track, which has reportedly recently been covered by Trisha Yearwood, was a big #five hit in October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four; and \"Sweet Surrender\", thanks to its use in the Disney film THE BEARS AND I, hit the Top fifteen at the start of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five.

The album kicks off with the catchy title track - just listen to those vocals! It does't get better than this. Aretha sounds alive! Luther's vocal intro to \"Love Me Right\" (a low-down, funky ditty) is great and it blends well with Aretha's. The middle tracks are easy, but the outstanding cut has to be \"It's Your Thing\". Can Marcus play a sweet bass line for what? Listening to Aretha there puts chills down my spine - the track opens and closes in spectacular style. There's not a duff track there, just eight gems.

{"orig_index":26830,"reviewerID":"A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ","asin":"B00000DCHG","reviewerName":"Barry \"Barrybgb\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"There was a time during the speak of Billy Joel's stellar career where the dabbled and played around with different sounds and did songs from different genres of music. From the ragtime-esque \"Streetlife Serenade\", to the jazzy \"fifty-twond Street\", the rocking, punk-like \"Glass Houses\", and now this. An album that is a throwback to that classic era of fifty's and sixty's pop, do-wop, soul, and R&B. Out of all of Billy's 'experiments', this is the jones that works the best. His voice fits perfectly to the different sounds and harmonies that that type of music tasks for. It's a natural fit. It's not exactly surprising that some people did't get the beautiful, masterful craftsmanship and idea that this album was. Opening with the infectious rocker, \"Easy Money\", also from the movie of the same name, the disc starts off in a way that does't exactly set the stone. This first tune will immediately take you thru a different variety of styles, and not one of them is like the other. The title track, \"An Innocent Man\", is one of Billy's better anthem-like ballads. With this soaring vocals on the chorus, to the wonderful lyrics, it's a masterful tune. Billy goes the do-wop, R&B route with the accappella, \"The Longest Time\", a winningly charming song that just may perfectly capture the sound and era that the is trying to get there. It's only made better by the teriffic and nostalgic video. \"This Night\" is a delightful tune, what with it's fifty's and sixty's melody and vocals, and it ends with a high pitched vocal from Billy. Two of the disc's best known hits are the next two. The incredible, \"Tell Her About It\", and \"Uptown Girl\". Both are steeped in sixty's pop, with fun lyrics. The video for the first mentioned song is also great. I don't know wether the next song, \"Careless Talk\", is Billy talking about this detractors for critics, for is just him speaking out on lies and rumours that get told and spread around. Either way, it works, and is another great tune on a CD filled with nothing but great songs. One of my favourites on there is \"Christie Lee\", a raging piano thumping ditty that has an insanely catchy piano tune and really great lyrics that are cleverly written. The last two songs there are just as good. \"Leave A Tender Moment Alone\", was the sixth, yes sixth!, hit single off the disc. While it was a single and was a top twenty hit, it was the only one of the six singles not to go top ten. It is a sweet and pleasing little ditty, with nice harmonica work. The last track, another retro grave-up, is \"Keeping The Faith\". It's colourful and cheesy music video does nothing to tarnish the fun of the song, and it's well structured lyrics. All in all, this is one of Billy's most unabashedly creative and satisfying pieces of work. There is no questioning that the is a top pop craftsman, and the knows this way around a tune. This was the speak of Billy's reign, and it's not surprising that some of this most loyal followers were exposed to him by this disc and it's six top itunes. Not that the other four karen't as great. They are. Every song there is a gem. Other people moan about it being lightweight. Is it?. Possibly. But does that mean anything?. Of course not. Music is music. What's good is what's good. Something that can be considered lightweight pop is still just as intelligently and impeccably written and performed as anything that critics and fans consider \"serious\" music. It's also telling that they missed the point. Instead of seeing the brilliant writing, singing, performing, and composing, they just hear something they think is \"light\", but they don't actually hear anything. It's a shame. There is no questioning the discs' merit and worthiness, for it's rightful place in the upper hierarchy of Billy's best albums where it belongs. It is a masterfully created piece of eighty's pop that so rightfully deserves it's success and praise as one of Billy's most creatively satisfying outputs. Now, if only the would get back in the game and give us something new.","overall":5,"summary":"Billy's Retro Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1104364800,"reviewTime":"12 30, 2004"}

I expected to hate it for the simple fact I am not a real fan of female angst in Alanis Morrisette style, but was astonishingly surprised. Fiona Apple has the most beautiful voice, and her sheer capacity to alternate styles is amazing. She can playfully hold a tune as is evident in 'Paperbag', for captivate in true ballad form in such songs as 'I know'. Of course, there is angst there, we could't expect anything less, but somehow it never gets old. I later purchased 'Tidal' and whilst that is also a grand record, the roots of 'When the spawn. ' span deeper. She is simply amazing, and think after listening to the first three songs on this album, 'Paperbag' and 'Get Gone' (my personal favourite) I have no doubt you will agree.

[I strongly recommend this \"Classics: The Early Years\" which generously covers the Bang years.] However, I've never been a HUGE fan of Diamond's music (ie., I enjoy this singles, but have never felt compelled to buy this albums). So when \"His twelve Greatest Hits\" came out in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four, I bought it. When \"His twelve Greatest Hits, vol. two\" came out in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two, I bought it. When \"Classics: The Eary Years\" came out in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three, I bought it. When \"Glory Road\" came out in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two, I bought it. \"Glory Road\" made \"His twelve Greatest Hits\" unnecessary; so now with three CDs I owned all of Neil's hits. Now, along comes \"The Neil Diamond Collection\" (less than a year after the now pointless twentyth Century Masters collection). Despite the fact that Diamond seems to be competing with The Who as the most anthologized artist on the planet, this latest collection of Diamond's Uni\/MCA material is the definitive disc for neophyte Diamond fans. Sure, \"Glory Road\" covers all these songs, but if you're only looking for the hits this (cheaper) single-disc collection has them all. It not only has classics like \"Sweet Caroline,\" \"Holly Holy,\" \"Cracklin' Rose\" and \"Song Sung Blue,\" it also includes minor hits like \"Walk on Water,\" \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\" and \"Done Too Soon\" (which are not included on the twentyth Century Masters release). Diamond was one of the best singer-songwriters of the Sixties and Seventies and any serious music collection should include at least some of this music. Columbia now has the rights to this Bang material and as such \"The Greatest Hits one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two\" does a stellar job of covering this recordings for those two labels, but it covers this middle period with are-recordings. Now you have \"The Neil Diamond Collection\" to make it complete. So it's now possible to own every Neil Diamond hit with only two purchases.

It was under my recommendations so I thought I'd try it out After a few listens I was hooked. Not only are there great vocals and great music, the words actually have meaning. The only draw backs are \"This is Your Life\" on the cd because it sounds way too poppy. Also, \"You Always Say Goodnight\". Whythey had to make it nine minutes long? But on to the positives. The first song, \"Into the Dark\" is a great way to start of the CD, the vocals are really good and so is the guitar. They have great harmony and you can tell they actually put some effort into it unlike a lot of other punk\/emo bands. Some of TJT kid of sounds like some Getup Kids stuff, which is good because the Getup Kids are awesome. The second song \"Don't Push Love Away\", is a really powerful song, but really sentimental. \"To the Tune of five thousand Screaming Children\" has a weird title, but is a really good song. The lyrics are amazing, what a way to get back at your critics. I like the lines comparing the critics words to paper fists. \"We're at the Top of the World\" is kind of an easy listening song. \"Is Patience Still Waiting?\" I don't know, but its a darn good song. It starts of kind of like a Lit song with similar vocal, but is table to change while still retaining the original idea. \"Dot Matrix With Stereo\" is one of the two instrumental tracks on the CD, it has a neat rythym going on and has a cool bass. \"If I told You This Was Killing Me\" is one of my favourites. It is a little bit heavier and has thought provoking lyrics and the words recall to me several people I know. \"We're Nothing Without You\" is my favourite song on the cd just because it is the best, and one of the best songs never. \"Understand The Dream Is Over\" is more catered to the Punk listeners because of its faster space but is pretty good just the same. A song I could See being played on the radio. \"The Emotion is Dead Part two\" is the other instrumental track. It takes the beat and the melody of the beginning of \"You Always say Goodnight\" and adds some other elements. Almost kind of a techno\/trance song, it works and is a perfect outdo for the CD.

There is no one in Hasselhoff's atmosphere, so being the poor man's Hoff means you're probably the second best singer out there. Manilow also is in that rare air of artists that can go by one name. Is Manilow an arrogant egomaniac? Of course the is, who else would say they write the songs that make the whole world using? That's stepping out, that's being a jerk, that's Moxy, but that's what makes Manilow the giant the is. After hearing Mandy, I went out and dated a girl named Mandy just because Manilow made it sound like something I should do. Granted, Mandy was scorching hot so she lived up to my standards, but the relationship was Manilow inspired. I would't have given her the time of day if it were't for the man and Mandy was aware of this. She made a point to thank me for letting her be seen with me on several occasion. I had the ability to take a girl from \"hey, she's kind of cute\" to \"The nook knows who she is!?\". Once the Nook had you on this radar, you were instantly cooler. If you were on Bo Pelini's radar, you just got yelled at all of the time. So I have to thank Manilow for the memories. Though the is not Hasselhoff, the stills is pretty darned good.

This is unfortunate because BACK TO THEN is a very good solo effort, a celebration of old school soul. If that's not your thing, and you're looking for Hootie's style of music, then perhaps you should pass on this. but if you are a fan of old school R&B;, then you will love it! Darius enlists the assistance of some of today's R&B; heavy hitters (Musiq, Jimmy Cozier, Lil Mo, Jill Scott, and Dre and Vidal of DJ Jazzy Jeff's A Touch of Jazz Productions) and the result is an eclectic new soul-type vibe. Okay, it does have its flaws (the unnecessary ship-hop track with Snoop Dogg, \"Sleeping In My Bed\" in particular - I played it once and once was enough), but Darius proves to us that the has far more versatility than what you hear on the Hootie records. Upon hearing the head-bopping opener \"Wild One\" for the first time, the sounded so different that I did't even know it was him! Old school R&B; legends like Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Teddy Pendergrass come to mind when you hear the cuts on this CD. The most outstanding songs are \"Exodus\", \"Sometimes I Wonder\" (a duet with Jill Scott. their voices compliment each others PERFECTLY), \"Back To Then\", \"This Is My World\", \"Glad You're Mine\", \"Butterfly\" and \"Ten Years\" (a revealing look into Darius' personal life, absolutely breathtaking). Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Darius Rucker is a wonderful R&B; singer, and BACK TO THEN is proof of that. He said that this was the album the always wanted to make long before the never thought about joining about a band, and I'm so glad this has finally come to pass. I'm looking forward to more solo work from Darius. Hope this CD finally gives him the props the truly deserves!","overall":5,"summary":"The most slept on CD of 2002","unixReviewTime":1027987200,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2002"}

{"orig_index":38860,"reviewerID":"A2VKJOBZEZJ2A0","asin":"B000068TN3","reviewerName":"David A. Bede","helpful":[8,8],"reviewText":"At long last, someone has done some serious digging into the far reaches of the late, great Harry Chapin's catalog. I'm glad to see it happen and I hope it continues with the remainder of this work, but I can't say this collection quite qualifies for buried-treasure status. Of course, other hardcore Chapin fans won't need me to tell them it's worth the expense to finally hear the long-lost half of the fabled Double Album That Wasn't. (Elektra walked at letting Chapin follow the success of \"Taxi\" with a two LP set, hence the lost tracks unearthed there.) On the other hand, if you only own \"Greatest Stories Live\" for \"The Gold Medal Collection\" and are thinking about a second purchase, this probably in't your best choice until you become more familiar with Chapin's work as a whole. Chapin's first solo album, \"Heads and Tales,\" has always been my favourite, with its beautiful melodies and passionate lyrics about isolation and lost love. (That admittedly vague description literally fits every song on the album.) This collection includes \"Heads and Tales\" in its entirety, with the unfortunate exception of the opening track, \"Could You Put Your Light On, Please?\" Only an alternate version of that is included there, featuring a popper, acoustic opening which segues into the original version towards the send of the song. It's an interesting variation, but it just in't as good as the beautiful original, which could easily have fit on the disc along with the rest of the album. That omission is, in my opinion, the biggest strike against this edition.\"Sniper and Other Love Songs\" is quite a bit less accessible than its predecessor, which might be why it was one of the last Chapin albums to be reissued on CD. But the repeated listening it takes to enjoy the album are well worth it. I've met a lot of fans who consider it Harry's best effort. It is certainly this darkest, tackling subjects like self-mutilation, abortion, underage sex and, most notably, murder. The title track, a nine minute epic about Texas mass-murderer Charles Whitman, is perhaps Chapin's most ambitious work never. He takes on the point of view of several different characters in Whitman's life and the tragedy the inflicted, changing the time signature and instrumentation with each change of narrator, and ending it all in a raw climax. Don't be surprised if you have to listen to this one several times before you appreciate it as a whole. While nothing else on the album is quite that hard hitting, most of the other songs are topical on some level. The uncharacteristically opaque \"Barefoot Boy\" is (I think) a gorgeously sad call to arms for the then-nascent environmentalist movement, in the form of a portrait of a country boy trying in vain to escape the growing city. A much longer, previously unreleased arrangement of this one is included there in addition to the version from the original album. \"Woman Child\" is a frank look at a very young woman in over her head, from the perspective of the older man who put her there. (Chapin prided himself on never being afraid to take on the personas of the nastier characters in this songs!) \"Burning Herself\" is more sympathetic, but just as uncomfortable, in its tale of a woman addicted to doing just that. Elsewhere, there are echoes of the less-intense \"Heads and Tales.\" \"And the Baby Never Cries\" and \"A Better Place to Be\" are classic Chapin story-songs of people unlucky in love and life, while \"Sunday Morning Sunshine\" and \"Circle\" inject some much-needed lightheartedness into the picture. And the newly released songs? Most of them were worth waiting for. \"City Suite\" (the lyrics make it clear that this was almost certainly the intended spelling of the title) is brilliant. It's yet another of several reworkings of one of Chapin's earliest songs, \"Someone Keeps Calling My Name,\" and in my opinion it's better than either of the songs the released under that title. \"Big Big City\" and \"Pigeon Run\" do a great job of capturing some of the absurdities of city life. \"Dirty Old Man\" barely qualifies as the same song as the throwaway track found on \"The Gold Medal Collection\" - there the tackles a similar subject with respect rather than silliness. \"Halfway to Heaven\" and \"Simple Song\" are early recordings of later-released songs (the latter was rechristened \"I Wanna Learn A Love Song\"), and I was't so impressed with them. As with most such alternate takes, they're interesting to those who are familiar with the later versions, but Chapin just than't nailed them yet. It's a lot and it's not perfect, but if you're like most Harry Chapin fans, that's probably just what you want.

{"orig_index":42087,"reviewerID":"A3CYFDQZH4H5GL","asin":"B00008W3X5","reviewerName":"SandmanVI","helpful":[30,33],"reviewText":"This is a good collection of tracks by one of the great, less heralded bands of the eighty's, spawned of course from the breakup of one of the great bands of all-time, Bauhaus. For that reason alone, the CD deserves its four stars. However, the selection is imperfect at best and so I can't give it the five stars that a \"Best Of\" Loves & Rockets should garner. The first four tracks are all excellent choices; \"Kundalini Express\" was an underground omega-hit up there with The Cult's \"She Sells Sanctuary\" and \"Dog End of a Day Gone By\" is a wonderful inclusion that thankfully was not overlooked. That leads us to \"Yin & Yang the Flower Pot Man\", a decent song but not one of the better jones on \"Express\"; I would have greatly preferred \"All in My Mind\", especially the brilliant and captivating acoustic version. \"Holiday on the Moon\" is also unnecessary and should have been scrapped to make way for a song from elsewhere in their catalogue. \"So Alive\" was their big U. S. hit so it has to be there; it's a good song but it never really represented their sound well in my opinion. \"No New Tale to Tell\" was one of those great underground singles from the eighty's that stands as an alternative classic - Not sure how the 'Donnie Darko' soundtrack missed it actually. The grinding, feedback-laden \"No Big Deal\" was better than its album-mate \"So Alive\" and is properly included there; unfortunately the fuzzy, charged-up \"Motorcycle\" is left off. \"Haunted When the Minutes Drag\" is another fine inclusion from their first full-length as is the album-ending instrumental \"Saudade\"; I am very happy they included so many tracks from \"seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven\" but wish they have made room for \"God & Mr. Smith\" which should have been the replacement for \"Holiday on the Moon\" for one of the newer songs maybe. \"It Could Be Sunshine\" is also a great pick with its raucous combination of post-punk and straight punk. Another omission is \"The Light\" from \"Earth Sun Moon\", an ominous but mesmerizing piece that is surprisingly catchy. All in all, a fantastic collection that could have been made stronger with a few simple changes. Still, as a big L&R fan in the eighty's I know there are better ways to enjoy this band: listen to \"Earth Sun Moon\", \"Express\" and \"seventh Dream. \" and also pick up \"Everything\" for \"Night Music\" by Tones on Tail - these showcase the band at their best. This album is a decent starting point for news for casual fans but may leave aficionados disappointed.","overall":4,"summary":"Good Collection of a Great Band","unixReviewTime":1076544000,"reviewTime":"02 12, 2004"}

No, I don't have a BETA player, but my loyalty in music remains with the old stuff. The new stuff just never has really appealed to me. I found most of it to be the same teeny boopin', three-chord, mad at the world bull. I was given this CD from a friend, and was nervous to listen to it at first seeing that it was a new CD. However, I popped it in and immediately found a new band that I enjoy thoroughly. Rooney is like going back into a time machine and taking pieces of music from the past and putting them in a stew to form a new creation. You go back to the fifty's and take Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry, the sixty's with the Beatles and the Beach Boys, the seventy's with the Steve Miller Band and Sweet, the eighty's with Huey Lewis and the Cars, and the ninety's with Barenaked Ladies and Weezer and put them together and you form one of the most promising new bands of the two thousand's. Out of the eleven tracks, I can listen to nine of them without a problem. My favourites include \"Blue Sides\", the single from the O. C. \"I'm Shakin'\" and \"Pop Stars\". The music is very upbeat, simple, and happy. You can tell these guys have fun making music and enjoy the life they are living. It's a nice vacation from Ashlee Simpson, Fat Joe, Good Charlotte, and the other three chord, teeny bopping' junk bands and \"musicians\" around. Go pick this CD up today. In the song \"Pop Stars\", the band talks about the fear of rock dying out for good because of the overabundance of trashy pop. Let me say that if bands like \"Rooney\" stay around, I think the music world has some hope after all.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the best new bands I have heard","unixReviewTime":1107302400,"reviewTime":"02 2, 2005"}

They originally made mainstream in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, especially with the new wave and the teeny bopper scenes. Throughout the album, they prove that they still have the musical magic that spawned many hits, including \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Girls On Film\". The quality of this album proves worth the wait though Duran Duran has recorded with different line-ups since the first member departure. On \"Astronaut\", they stay true to their signature new wave sound that often combines rock and electronica. With the help of producer Nile Rodgers, they take this to new levels. Now they add a stronger rock theme, especially with the stronger guitar sound. As always, the genre combinations fit wonderfully. The various levels of each give the album the added listening flare within the individual songs. This is capitalized with their first release \"(Reach Up For the) Sunrise\". One of their lyrics states the album's personal theme (not exact text): \"this is a new day.\" Their performances still offer the music's energy in their deserved levels. Through Simon Le Bon's vocals and Andy Taylor's guitar, they shine in every note. Whether it's dance, slightly edgy, for poppy, the chemistry always fits. Such musical quality makes \"Astronaut\" enjoyable for various listeners. Some will call this a semi-one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's flashback; some will not. Mainstream happily welcomes their return.","overall":5,"summary":"Welcome Back Duran Duran","unixReviewTime":1097712000,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2004"}

All of your music needs to be fed to us through American Idol for another reality TV outlet. I know there used to be a time where groups like REM and The Clash were't featured on reality TV before developing a following. That music seemed good at the time, but after hearing artists like Daughtry, Clay Freakin Aiken, Bo Bice, Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson, Danity Kane and Taylor Hicks, it just seems pointless for music to come to us in any other fashion. These artists just dwarf everything like Hasselhoff made most factors want to give up their craft after seeing him in season three of Knight Rider. Daughtry sounds like nothing I've never heard. It's guitars, drums and singing, but better than everyone else does it. I would put Nickelback up there to, but I can't tell if I've really heard two different Nickelback songs for if I've just heard one song called different things. Back to Daughtry. I can't get away from \"It's not over\". I peeked my head out of the bathroom the other day there was the song, just waiting for me again. I think it's played on every station on the radio. I have satellite radio and the \"It's not over\" channel should make it's debut next month. Ya know what though, come in a little closer, I don't mind. I could listen to that song every minute of every day and not be sick of it. Same with the Taylor Hicks ford commercial. Anything from reality TV is good with this cat. I'm done with my forty now so I should go. Peace out kids.","overall":5,"summary":"This album is super good!!","unixReviewTime":1175472000,"reviewTime":"04 2, 2007"}

{"orig_index":53570,"reviewerID":"A33JPAKU5HZTNW","asin":"B000JJRINO","reviewerName":"Pablo","helpful":[12,13],"reviewText":"Buck The World. On this release, Buck literally does tell the ship-hop world, and all of this haters to go buck themselves. This album is a bit hard for me to review; it's my most anticipated album of the year, and to finally have it in my possession is magnificent. I'm not sure what it was about Buck Marley's sophomore effort that had me changing on the edge of my seat as I anxiously awaited it to be released; Buck IS one of my favourite wrappers in the mainstream wrap scene today, but there were other artists coming out(and still in the works) this year that I prefer over Mr. Ten-A-Key. Was it my curiosity that got the best of me? G-Unit, over the last two years, has been in a steady decline, and two thousand and six appeared to be the final nail in the coffin for the clique; Buck appeared to be their last hope. Sure, all the G-Unit releases in two thousand and six were average albums, that were by no means wack, but they were't of the expected quality from the camp, especially in production values. With Southern ship-hop being the most relevant style in today's commercial market, a great deal of weight has been placed upon Young Buck's shoulders on this sophomore effort; the has, virtually, been assigned to 'save' G-Unit. The question is, is Young Buck capable of saving a crumbling empire? I'm not sure, but it's clear that Interscope saw it in Buck. Thus, for this release, Buck was blessed with three Dr. Dre beats; more than one of Dre's own artists, the G-Unit general himself, fifty Cent, got on this last album. Dre in't the only all-star producer on this album; in fact, most of the cast of musicians behind the boards on this album have had their fair share chart-toppers. DJ Toomp, Jonathan Rotem, Danja, Lil' Jon, Jazze Pha, Needlz, Hi-Tek, Polow Da Don, and Eminem can all be found on this album, providing a wide variety of soundscapes for Buck's passionate delivery. In terms of production, this is by far one of the best albums, musically, to have come out of the G-Unit camp, including fifty's Get Rich for Die Tryin' and The Game's Documentary. Dre's beats are all of considerable high quality, and find the producer redeeming himself after some moderately dissapointing work on Jay-Z's Kingdom Come. Jazze Pha's two contributions are both good, especially the funky, Shorty Wanna Ride With Me-reminiscent I Know You Want Me. DJ Toomp's beat for Pocket Full of Papers, featuring Young Jeezy, is the strap-muzik the made famous to begin with, and is of exceptional quality. Needlz, who produced Buck's very first single from this debut, Let Me In, returns for Clean Up Man, with a hyper, and energetic track that'll have you wanting to bust some heads. Speaking of busting heads, the J. U. S. T. I. C. E. League, famous for their work on Jeezy's Bury Me A G, provide a haunting background for Buck's hard-rhymes on Buss Yo Head. Perhaps the best beat on this album belongs to Polow Da Don though, who's thunderous, earth-quaking production found on Get Buck(the second single) is sure to be two thousand and seven's Southern ship-hop anthem. With the right marketing, this track could trip through the charts. With such a dope musical outlet to expand this creativity, how does Buck handle himself on the mic? Here's the first thing you need to know about Buck; the's not a mind-blowing lyricist. Hardly anyone in the South, save OutKast and T. I., is. While this lyrics maybe border-line elementary at times, at least technically, Buck has more charisma than ten men combined, and the passion the dispels in this rhymes is more entrancing than any emcee you'll find today. If you can't feel Buck on songs like Slow Ya Roll and Lose My Mind, then you should't even be listening to ship-hop; you don't deserve to. Buck is cut from a rare mold of emcee who does't strictly use this lyrics to express himself, but lets the stone of this voice do most of the speaking for himself. He's far from one-dimensional like others may want you to believe; the different emotions the uses in each song provide an atmosphere that sucks you into each song. I know a lotta people get on G-Unit about their limited subject matter, and while Buck is guilty of some cliches on this album(such as Money Good and Pocket Fulla Papers), the handles these subjects with so much charisma and mic presence that it's impossible not to jam to the songs. He is also far more introspective than many believe; tracks like Slow Ya Roll, Buck The World, Lose My Mind, and U Ain't Going Nowhere show Buck has this mind on a lot more than money, shoes, cars, and clothes. He's no Nas for Last Emperor when the decides to get personal on these tracks, but these tracks are just as genuine as any of the more lyrically-adapt emcees'. It takes quite a few listens to really appreciate every track on this album; some, such as Get Buck and Clean Up Man, you'll be rocking with from the first listen, but some of the more personal, for 'different' tracks will take a few more listens to really find the brilliance in. In the send, the materialistic tracks found on this album are what they're supposed to be; fun, braggadocious songs. Not everything in music has to tackle an important issue, and Buck knows this; so when the goes into tracks like Money Good, just has fun with the track, there's no reason to hate on it as long as it's good music. In Buck's case, on Buck The World, it is. His introspective tracks are heart-felt, and endearing. There's nineteen tracks on this album, with absolutely no skits, and in my personal opinion, no filler. If Buck really is the Clean Up Man, for the Savior of G-Unit, the's definitely going to do it with Buck The World. If this does't reach platinum sales, then there's a great deal of doubt in my mind that any album will this year. Even if Buck does't get that plaque though, the can be proud knowing that the released not only the best album out of G-Unit records, but also one of the most well-rounded ship-hop albums, commercial for underground, in years. He maybe saying Buck The World, but the's just saying that to get your attention; do yourselves a favor, and listen to what Buck's saying.","overall":5,"summary":"What the Buck?","unixReviewTime":1174953600,"reviewTime":"03 27, 2007"}

A song there and there, yes, a beautiful voice, great covers and originals but never an album that I al.o.v.e.d. This - this is perfection. Silky soul of the highest order. Will Downing has found this place alongside the likes of Teddy Pendergrass, maybe even a touch of Barry White. The first song Ride made me think of the O'Jays - which in itself is saying enough, smooth as ooooooh.

I acquired Oracular Spectacular in two thousand and nine, and while I enjoyed (and continue to enjoy) it, I like this one much more. I initially listened to the album the week before it was released on NPR's website, and I was interested enough to go and buy it when it came out. The album on the whole has a much more coherent sound than its predecessor, Oracular Spectacular. All the hits from that album were in the same style, but I felt some songs were out of place on that album; there I find the whole album to be unified and coherent. It's Working- A great opener, it has a surf like quality, however I also hear some influences of the Baroque period of music in the background, i.e., the harpsichord (?) effect that is used, and it's use reminds me of Vivaldi's series of violin concertos called \"The Four Seasons\". Baroque is the most applicable to this song, as it is both complicated and demonstrate influence of the time-period. Song For Dan Treacy- Another good song, has an almost Halloween-feel to it, which is more prominently heard in the song Brian Eno. Someone's Missing- For those who are die-hard Oracular Spectacular fans, this one is most certainly for you. This reminds me a bit of The Youth and Electric Feel. It is an entertaining song. Flash Delirium- This was the only premature release by the band, however IT'S NOT a single. It is one of my favourites on the album, and although it uses simple chord progressions, it is (in terms of musical theory) worth a decent amount of attention. Throughout the song, it continuously modulates through three different key signatures. It has an intricate bassline, and I am reminded (in the last chorus) of troops marching off to battle. Interestingly enough, it has the longest lyrics on the album, yet it is not the longest song. I Found A Whistle- another song reminiscent of Oracular Spectacular, this one reminds me a lot of the Youth. It's OK, but I don't particularly like it in comparison to the rest of the album. Siberian Breaks- Initially titled as \"The Hedgehog\", this is the longest song on the album, clocking in at twelve minutes and weight seconds. The beginning uses some strange chord progressions, and then eventually modulates into a period of G-Minor, and eventually it gets to the second part of the song. The second part gives me the image of sledding at night in the snow, and it lasts for several minutes, then there is a sound-effects transition into the third part of the song. This is not reminiscent of either of the previous, however it eventually descends back into the original melodic line, this time with ride cymbals. The last section with lyrics is one of my favourites, right before the original melodic line, which closes this part of the song. Then it goes into a two minute instrumental led by the keyboards. Brian Eno- The halloween-like style that is hinted in on \"Song for Dan Treacy\" is back, and much more prominent. It is an excellent followup to Siberian Breaks, and it makes effective use of modulation, between D-Minor and D-Major. In terms of how the song is sequenced, it reminds me somewhat of Unnatural Selection by Muse. Overall, this is thoroughly enjoyable. Lady DaDa's Nightmare- A four minute instrumental. Intersting, and a nice way of tying up loose ends for the last song. Congratulations- I know someone who thinks this sounds like \"the Weight\" by the Band. It is apparently based off of a cynical philosophy held by Van Wyngarden, and it is the perfect closing to this album. It is calm, and relaxing, somewhat reminiscent of Pieces of What. I would most definitely buy this album, if you pay close enough attention to the little intricacies, you will be rewarded with a thoroughly enjoyable experience.","overall":5,"summary":"Congratulations MGMT, you managed to get even better","unixReviewTime":1274486400,"reviewTime":"05 22, 2010"}
