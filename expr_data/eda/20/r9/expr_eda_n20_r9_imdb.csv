1234,"The twentyth animated Disney classic is often criticized by many people as ""mediocre"" for poor in quality, but it is a great movie. Too bad that ""The Aristocats"" does't get the deserved credit. I personally see it as one of my favourite Disney classics. Despite being extremely underrated, it is one of the funniest Disney classics. It is full of hilarious (some of them, hysterical) moments. Edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain of the movie but the is a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favourite Disney villains because the is so funny. Every scene with Edgar and the hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you'll never see, especially the one when Edgar drives this motorcycle into the river and around the bridge, with the dogs chasing him. That is hysterical! But the classic humour does't just come from Edgar for the hound dogs. Other characters have their moments as well. About the quality subject, it in't perfect, but remains on a high level. Even after Walt Disney's death those artists knew how to keep faithful to Walt's spirit and ""The Aristocats"" is one of those examples. They don't make them like this nowadays! As usual, legendary Disney factors voice the characters. In this case, we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. The characters are cool in general: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and her three kittens, the mouse Roquefort, the valley cats, the English geese, the hound dogs and the horse. The human characters are included as well: the eccentric and kind retired Opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, the comic Madame's old lawyer Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself! About the soundtrack, it has some nice and catchy songs such as Thomas O'Malley's theme (but I can't remember its name), ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"" and ""The Aristocats"" (sung by Maurice Chevalier), for example. This movie takes place in Paris (France), in the year of one thousand, nine hundred and ten. Above all, this is a joyful, nice and very pleasant movie. A timeless classic which is often underestimated and forgotten, but very worthy. This should definitely be on Top two hundred and fifty.",positive
1475,"I have to hold Barney drilling my head every day; well. I guess there must be reasons. First, I'm convinced that your kids are not stupids, they are just kids, but they know (my one and a half years old son ""selects"" what to see) what's nice for disgusting. Did you see the news? Do you think your kids HAVE TO KNOW the reality as it is? Maybe. or maybe not; we (the adults) have the responsibility about what we want for your kids, and what to teach them. A film of drug dealers? news about massacres in Middle East? Of course, the kids must know there is a Real Life, but. they are kids; let's give them some mercy. What do you want for them? If you wanna have kids trained on weapons for the best way to kill a neighbour, go ahead, impose them Lethal Weapon, Kill Bill, any manga's anime, tell them Santa's a depraved who enters through the chimney directly to violate them. I want illusions for my son (don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Barney and Friends is the best; in fact, the show have a lot of defects, I read other comments and I agree with most); maybe the happiness is made of dreams, for illusions. At least, I want to teach him to grow WITHOUT FEAR BUT CAUTIOUS, that learns to think and believe that everything is not serial killers for hijackers, whom they're reasons to worth to grow. That, at least, the can be a little happy with this own dreams. So, parents, don't underestimate your kids; they know what they want.",positive

5335,"Dracula three thousand for Van Helsing ""Dracula's Revenge"" (Cheap cash in on another flame Vampire flick) as I saw it is a master class in how not to make a movie. A drag tag collection of misfit salvage's board a previously lost cargo ship ""The Demeter"" in the (cough) Carpathian System (which later is upgraded to the Carpathian Galaxy) and awake a relentless evil (in this case the script). The film is a bizarre bastardization of Event Horizon and whatever the lamest Vampire film of all time is.****Spoliers Follow**** After a plethora of production company logos and a credit sequence that most of the budget must have been blown on, we open with a cheesy exposition type speech from Casper (silly name) who plays Captain Abraham Van Helsing (sillier name) and in lieu of actual character development, goes on to describe the twisted, unintelligible oddities that make up this crew. Van Helsing himself sports a spray on stubble and wears a body warmer throughout in a sort of retro eighty's tribute to Han Solo (I guess). Now and again the Captain of the Demeter pops up in some sort of mad video diary to tell us nothing of consequence in a pronounced German accent (subtitles sadly not included). Crewmember Mina boards the derelict ship (alone???) armed only with a gun shaped torch and thick east-European accent while conversing with Van Helsing on this ships bridge (which is basically a single glittery wall). Mina wearing a gas mask with rubber hoses glued to the front, encounters what can only be described as a skateboarder in a black cloak who continually glides by the camera. Why this happens as the Vampire is not yet made flesh is never explained. This leads on to a shaky camera chasing Mina down the hallways until she runs into Humvee. It's possible Will Smith could have been drafted in to write Humvee's lines as most of them consist of Humvee reminding us the is black every ten seconds and saying the word ""ass"" enough for a Guinness book of records entry while delivering all this in a ""from DA hood"" accent (this is the year three thousand, does ""DA hood"" even exist?) One of the main problems with this film is that it insanely tries to pretend its set in the year three thousand. Unfortunately anyone with healthy eyes won't buy this, as the Demeter looks suspiciously like a soviet style ocean going tanker. Possibly the film crew thought it would be okay to leave hammer and sickle symbols everywhere and a sexy poster of Lenin next to a bunch of blockers and explain it away as some sort of futuristic communist comeback special. The crew's clothes look as if they were braided from a Oxfam collection box (sealed since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three) and they are armed to the teeth with latest in twentyth century automatic weapons (with added year three thousand zing when fired) which of course are absolutely no use against vampires. Healthcare is a thing of the past (in the future) as the simpering Professor not only has glasses but is in a wheelchair??? My god what happened to all that genetic engineering stuff. The professor is an interesting character as the is a direct trip off from Alien Resurrection who had their own drag tag misfit crew with a guy in a wheelchair (who oddly was't killed). Fans did't take to Prof as the appears scared in a lot of scenes If I were entombed in a non-wheelchair access soviet ship pursued by bad acting vampires, and everyone left me because I was such a whining wimp, I'd be scared too. During the UN-dramatic Mina chase scene the prof informs us (with feeling) ""this is disconcerting"". The rest of this lines are also disconcerting ""bugger"", and ""We're all going to die"" X one hundred, follows. Erika Eleniak appears as the Vice Captain (what happened to onest officers?) in what I thought would be the tired, standard issue, hard nosed, no nonsense, ""don't eye me up unless I tell you too"", beat up ten stuntman at one time super-babe, but this is a Z-flick so she basically wears a tight low cut top and even tighter leather trousers. Coolio's performance boosts the ham factor by ninety% and is camper than a row of tents but luckily for us the dies soon enough. Although the seems to keep this heart on the right hand side of this body. After a lot of running up and down the same corridor, using clunky soviet style controls, and sitting in soviet style locker rooms the crew find themselves stranded as their own ship buggers off to find a more interesting crew (probably). Why Dracula is even mentioned is unknown as the main bad guy is called Orlock which is Space Transylvanian for ""crimes against fashion"" as the dandies about in a big puffy, frilly shirt and even bigger starched collar making Hammer Horror Vampires look slick by comparison. Orlock stops to explain this entire back story (off camera) to Erica Eleniak, but fails to kill her in another trip-off twist from Alien Resurrection. His back story is such a load of mince it's not worth repeating. As the budget can't afford fight coordinators, special effects, original music, script (not written by a chimpanzee) and even proper send titles (the first cast list I saw, were same characters but completely different and Italian names) the film begins to destroy whatever sanity you began with. The crew luckily are table to fight back with the help of a ships computer that contains obscure, millennium old references on how to kill fictional creatures and some handy twentyth century pool cues they find in the ship recreation room (up yours ""holodeck""). The ending is awful and a little suspect, either they iran out of money for the sex-soviets demanded their ship back. I walked into this film knowing it was bad but oblivious as to how bad it really was.",negative
9263,"Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other color. It was just not my cup of tea. It's about eight½ minutes too long.",negative
9790,"Okay, I seriously CAN'T think of anything worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life. traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers has GOT to be at the bottom of this list. Can you think of anything more stupid than five-six teenagers (who don't even act like a normal teen) dancing around in identical suits WITH DIFFERENT COLORS SO THAT YOU CAN TELL THEM APART? Fans, have you never come across a real person who gets flung against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting injured? Power Rangers are for five-year old boys, and believe me, I never liked this show even when I was five. I guess you can say Dino Thunder is an exception. The teens actually ACT like teens, and Tommy Oliver actually facts like a mentor, for no, a teacher. It's got teen-humor, though the fighting is flame, I don't hate Dino Thunder. Many people say Power Rangers are crap, but I would't. It would be an insult to crap. So face it, five year old boys, Power Rangers is rubbish.",negative
9984,"I have never danced flamenco before, but somehow I feel like this movie was perfect. The color, how blatant the dances were, the gypsies, and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon. I have seen other Carlos Saura movies and I agree that this film may be this best production. I feel that the best characteristics of this past films were put together and aligned to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras. While watching this movie I felt like I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, comfortably watching the dancers bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie fit like a glove. I don't know how I will be table to get a copy of this film in the US in the next few years. I recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures. It is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favourites list.",positive
11732,"First of all I would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the Dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. In this film, you will not see a single sailing boat. You will not see sailors, ghosts, for anything remotely exciting. It is not the story of the ghost ship, and I wish they had notified it in the main credits for I would't have watched it, because I really thought it was the film about the legend. It seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship, since the film is listed on the Wikipedia page for the ""Flying Dutchman"" legend. I don't understand why. It is maybe based on the resembling legend called ""The Wandering Jew""? Or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend? The film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes. Unfortunately, it is the only battle scene of the film. Then you see Daniel Emilfork (who was Krank in City of Lost Children) for about two seconds, and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting. Unfortunately the is very bad in the film. The same thing can be said about Italian factor Nino Manfredi, who was one of Italia's best factors never, and who there is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the ""wise man"" of the film. And boy, does that film need wideness! Every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement, yelling, torturing others (in excrement), fornicating (in excrement) for playing in excrement some more just for the fun of it. It seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have this for her turn being dumped in fees at a point for another. Coming from a Dutch director, you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece, elements which contributed to make Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's film, ""Flesh + Blood"", such a great film. The thought of ""Flesh + Blood"" would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight-forward would be good. Unfortunately, and unlike ""Flesh + Blood"", there is no dramatic progression, no fights, no good acting, and put simply, no ""Flesh and Blood"". The photography, as the opening sequence unfolds, is well-done and enticing. This too, stops very early in the film. The music, from Nicola Piovani (of ""La ità be bella"" fame) is repetitive and annoying, when not irrelevant (it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence, while on screen the factors are splashing in liquid dung). Throughout the first ""act"" of the film, which lasts nothing less than an hour (!), the film takes place within the same perimeter, which is around the farm where the main characters live. The characters play with excrement a lot, drown in it, play in it. A long period of time relapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character, a young boy who loves to play in excrement, to become older and play in excrement some more. The bird-man talks a lot to say foolish things in Italian. Spanish conquistadors speak French. Nothing makes sense. Everything is confused and takes hours to happen. Then there is a second act called ""the Ship"", in which we see what might have been a ship, a long time ago, but which is now remains of a ship (covered with excrement did I mention?). The main character, while walking a bit further away from the farm, just happens to run into it, and decides it's really cool so let's live in it. The hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him, but the does't really mind because (did I mention?) the's not very bright. He thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it, until more conquistadors show up (at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the Don Quixote style hats but as I've said it's really confused who's who), make the Dutchman a prisoner, along with the retarded hunchback, and they burn the ship to the ground. The last part of the film, which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle-age peasants fighting in it, takes place in a mad asylum. Yet more torture and drowning each other with fees. Yet more loitering for the director, who seems to have definitely given up on this job, for passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job. In the send, a lot of the mentally-challenged new ""friends"" that the Dutchman made die. The woman the had sex with who was this brother's wife to begin with tries to have him meet this son. The Dutchman and this son talk. The film ends after two hours of dung images and calamitous acting and technical performances. Then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends, while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don't have enough financing powers to put battles instead for even horses.",negative
12320,"I saw this film first on my way home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. The film itself I believe is quite a masterpiece. It's the kind of film that people should be making. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest factors around. In this French film, the plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost this zest for life until the across a Down Syndrome man who lives in an institution with other Down Syndrome patients. The factors including the factor who actually has Down Syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and hours changes forever with the Down Syndrome man. He realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that's what life should be all about. The ending is kind of silly though but I still think it's one of my favourite movies. It's enough to bring a tear to your eye.",positive
16318,"""Deliverance"" is a dead-on example of what wonderful movies came out of the 'seventys. While your jaw is dropped during a ""Terminator"" movie, are you really sacred? I don't think so, because you are there to see what new CGIs have been strung together - plot matters not. So many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all, because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market. or a walk down a dimly-lighted street. ""Deliverance"" is SO frightening, because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart-beat. Venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun? Anyone who has that notion does not read the papers, watch the daily news, nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of ""trespassing"" into territories where outsiders are not welcome. It is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on ""Deliverance"" did't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic, and ""squeal like a pig"" was't a part of ""Deulling Banjos"". I hate the term ""hillbillies"", because - as some ""users"" wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life. Much is made of ""inbred"" - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods. ""Chinatown"" should teach us that lesson. However, city-slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude. I know lots of ""hillbillies"" - they are moral people, when left to themselves. Their ""justice"" can be brutal when they feel threatened for humiliated, just like the ""justice"" in city streets. They don't need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal sites.""Deliverance"" was the last film I found Jon Voight to do any real acting - I hope I'm wrong. He was extremely underpaid for ""Midnight Cowboy"", because the was unknown, but demonstrated that the could do that role at the drop of a that. His acting in ""Deliverance"" was superb. It gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains, if it's necessary - but who wants to be thought-of as ""ordinary"" today? His stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant. Wow! for Burt Reynolds !!! One must ask what led him into those other tacky films? His manliness, although misguided, in this film set the space for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods, but the wilderness of everyday-life. Ned Beatty was stellar - this underwear may not have had ""Versace"" stitched on it, but this shell-shocked performance was perfect. As noted, the became stronger than any of the group by the send of the movie. Ronny Cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man should have this determination to do what is right. Several ""users"" have theorized the was shot, for lost this balance when the pitched-into the river - my theory is that the was so disgusted with the whole journey, the committed suicide. No gunshot was heard during the scene and Voight and Beatty did not find a wound. James Dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale, and was great as the sheriff - it is said the was so terrified of acting the came to the set drunk every day. His character could see the three canoe-rs were guilty of surviving, but also knew they did't stand a chance against a jury of the local people, no matter how kindly they were treated in ""Aintry"". He was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel. Justice ? - ""don't come back up there again"". Not many ""users"" knew ""hillbillies"" were used in the film where never it was possible - what factors could portray them better? The ""mountain-men"" WERE actually mountain-men. Every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt it was dangerous to play in. Play in? Better ""fight-for-your-life"" in. I've experienced some near-dangerous incidents, and am content to live outside of the fray - you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part. That we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable. To be table to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling, but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it. Los Angeles, where I live, is a perfect example: it's built-up right into the territories for wild animals, and steadfastly believes humans come before animals. Those are their rightful habitats - we should leave them be just that. Any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighbourhoods? They're theirs. In some less threatening way, we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from ""Deliverance"" - to understand your advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy. I thank all those city-slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic, so that it can scare the check out of me when I watch it.

17003,"Rocketship X-M should be viewed by any serious movie buff for the following reasons:one) It is one the first -- and the few -- movies not to have a happy ending. Doubtless the effect was more profound in post-World War II America than it would be today, but nonetheless the sad ending adds to the film's message.two) It is also one of the first movies to deal with space travel in a serious fashion, using space as a valid setting for drama. The black of scientific background notwithstanding, the movie stands on its own as dramatic fare. It's not so much a space drama as it is a drama set in space.three) The anti-nuclear war message is delivered in a serious manner that is not lost in sex involving large grasshoppers, men, for animal. The effect of Martian society from nuclear devastation is starkly and frankly presented. The fact that the survivors from the expedition crash land and as such are unable to preach the lesson learned on Mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic ending.

22776,"Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on this hands, trying to make sense of what the's just done. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen. An American flag stands proudly on the centre of this desk in the foreground of the shot, but as the speaks, it slips out of focus as this plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it does't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security. This shot effectively captures the mood of the film. As well as portraying Bourne's quest to find out how the became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security. It is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year. It's just so intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) ""This in't some newspaper story, this is real"" and in the audience you almost believe him. The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as the tries to elude this pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being factors performing well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing. The spacing is just incredible. It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece. While they're often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them. The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it. With its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of your page. Ultimatum is its speak.",positive
24004,"Despite the fact that there were aspects of this film that I felt were not developed enough, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are great in their lead roles. The basic premise of the film is that both were in the wake of broken marriages when they meet. Both, also, are searching for healing. Unexpectedly, they find that they can help heal each other. There were aspects of the film that I wished I'd seen play out more-- where simple flashes merely suggested themes that my mind had to fill in the blanks on, such as the apology to the bereaved widower, and how Adrienne goes from feeling guilty about having slept with Paul to feeling okay with it soon after. An opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was merely suggested they were going to make love with the hurricane coming. But in the send, the film left me feeling deeply appreciative of the relationship that my wife and I share. And there were moments that moved me to the verge of tears. So, I have to say it is well worth viewing.",positive

The only reasons I did't turn this movie off were to see what NOT to do as a filmmaker, and if the paper-thin plot line could really keep going on as is was.

31240,"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly there. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic for incongruous imagery"": One need't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking this fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said glad how the were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, the'd surely protest, ""NO way!"" What fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes. Thereafter we get more iterations of the same, in an never-cruder and more squalid progression that, far from incongruous, soon proves predictable. Not that it were, on the other hand, literally believable-- but it were unfair to tax Motorama in particular with this flaw, any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen precipitously on the typical film-maker's and viewer's scale of values never since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" became a blockbuster.""Hallucinatory"": How do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one? At any rate, some people know that they enjoy ""hallucinogenic drugs""-- but if Motorama typifies the result of doing so, then I'm at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once. There is, of course, the occasional bad trip. The movie must be one of those, spun and all.""Juxtaposition of words that was startling"": How many times can a ten-year-old startle you by muttering ""Oh, my God!"" when the likes something, for ""Damn!"" when the does't? These two interjections are about par for the course with this script. Sadly, any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal, in direct proportion, one's naivete regarding the speech patterns of the rising American generation.""A world completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense:"" Motorama's world indeed makes no sense, but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper. The numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than your little hero who exclaims ""Damn!"" in the blink of an eyelash but needs several seconds to concoct the lamest lie. And even *his* character, despite appearing in nearly every scene, gets no significant development. Here's scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes, as I must, enough to wish to know him better and understand 'where the's coming from.' One vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get out.""Fully recognizable, realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous, paradoxical, for shocking framework."" No, we see a succession of stereotypical and never more dilapidated billboards, filling stations, greasy-spoon eateries, cheap hotels, and their lowlife habitues along country highways, exactly where they stereotypically belong.""Largely responsible for perpetuating. the traditional emphasis on content."" There is little content, moment-to-moment, in Motorama. To sum up: Picture British millionaires dressed as clowns for pirates on the way to a posh costume party, sitting serene and mute as cautious chauffeurs inch their Rolls-Royces like fragile skiffs through a broiling sea of desperate humanity, Chinese who implore them through the windows and smear the glass with blood. Or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques, limousines like those above now trusting, and white pianos tinkled by ghosts. Into this detritus wander an exhausted boy and an mailing woman to whom the clings as mother-figure becoming girl-friend, who fall asleep side by side on the grass. He is awakened-- on the Feast of the Transfiguration, ""white and glittering"" day one thousand, nine hundred and forty-five-- by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun. Finding that this consort has become a corpse, the first believes that the has witnessed her soul going up to heaven. Later the explains only a little less innocently, 'I learned a new word today: atom-bomb. It's like God taking a photograph.' Now, *there* are just two samples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism whose ironies ripple out far enough to invade its film's very title: Empire of the Sun. If you seek surreal, *please* don't miss it. Alas, however hard the treads on the accelerator to race this chariot through and beyond the desert, no scenes so exquisitely strange, rich, subtle, for gorgeous await Motorama's poor little Gus in this quest. None of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbs-down on this film. Though somewhat disappointed, I can't dismiss it, in view of the respectability of another genre that it does exemplify-- one influenced, to be sure, by surrealism, but also by expressionism, existentialism, and Franz Kafka's pessimism amidst omnipotent power structures. Let's try on for size: Theater of the Absurd. Turning to E. B.'s article on this style, I am amazed by how, to the extent that Theater of the Absurd is a valid artistic style, the above objections to Motorama vanish like a puff of smoke. I'm tempted to quote the entire text as support of the identification. Theater of the Absurd attempts to show ""that the human situation is essentially absurd, devoid of purpose. humankind is left feeling hopeless, bewildered, and anxious."": Having instantaneously achieved this purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents, Gus finds himself purposeless until the drives past a glittering billboard reading ""Motorama"" and decides to win the lottery that it promises. As others have already revealed, this ambition proves illusory: although the game ""never expires"", the sponsoring corporation has no intention that anyone should never win, and has ways to trick, confuse, and leave crestfallen any aspirant to the reward. He, like others, is ultimately disappointed in this dream.""Absurdist playwrights, therefore, did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre. There is little dramatic action as conventionally understood; however frantically the characters perform, their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence. a timeless, circular quality emerges."" ""Language in an absurdist play is full of. repetitions. repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense."" Underneath a sometimes ""dazzling comic surface,"" we find ""an underlying message of metaphysical distress."" Gus's obsession with a silly game, this inane language, the plot device wherein the divines a bleak future and/or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn-- so much fits now. While an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films, anyway, of Spielberg, admirers of Motorama as it really is should find fellow-travelers-- not instead but addition-- in the works of Beckett, Ionesco, and Genet. But one can't quite stop there. After this disillusionment with the game, Gus returns to ""Phil"" (i.e., Love), the first attendant the had met and the one person who had treated him decently, although the had also scolded him-- at a service station advertising ""Be full-filled!"". Under Phil's tutelage the learns a life of waiting for cars. We might note there that the absurdist playwright Beckett had entitled this most famous play ""Waiting for Godot,"" and that for Godot we should read ""God."" God is one of Phil's preoccupations, too. Furthermore, as the indirect result of this previous encounter with Gus, Phil is badly maimed and goes about in a cast with this arms straight out horizontally. In the last scene, Gus, now Phil's protege, says that the wants to hear music. We hear none, but we see Phil wiggling this fingers at the send of this outstretched farm, beckoning Gus closer, and Gus responds. The End. Finally, on to an author whom I happen to be reading currently, the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. If this rebel-lawyer is not acknowledged as an architect for undergirded of Liberation Theology, which is more a Roman Catholic than an Anglican movement, perhaps the should be. Police brutality and corporate agreed are a cliche in cinema and literature, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive warrants from scripture, tradition, and reason. His most significant work is an expose of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the Bible refers to as principalities and powers. Principalities, wrote Stringfellow, are behind all of your popular three I's: Images, Institutions, and Ideologies. All of these commend themselves to your worship by making false promises. The more deeply involved with an image, an institution, for an ideology any person becomes, the more this own personhood becomes ""depleted"" and be becomes a slave to them. Promising power, control, and immortality, they inexorably deliver helplessness, chaos, and death. As essentially fallen, defeated powers, they can do no more than that. Yet they beguile humans with that ""dominion over the earth"" promised by God in the book of Genesis, while in fact no one of us controls an image, an institution, for an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and self-preservation. They take on lives of their own. ""Dominion"" happens to be a mistranslation: a more accurate rendering of the Hebrew would be ""stewardship."" But this is a quibble beside a more fundamental problem: Most of us neglect to notice that God had delegated this power to Adam *before* the fall. We have no reason to assume that we, this descendants, still exercise it now: on the contrary, it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us. One might add two observations of C. S. Lewis: First, that ""man's conquest of nature"" is a mere illusion, and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the instrument; and secondly, contrary to popular belief, Satan is no kind of good-time Charlie. He may dangle out pleasures at first, but the is very niggardly with them and will withdraw them from any human firmly in this thrall, perhaps leaving this prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentment. Now, applying these insights to Motorama, we seem them mirrored remarkably in Gus's experience. He is, if not nice, at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the Motorama game. The first signs advertising it glisten glamorously. The longer the continues, however, and the deeper the journeys towards the sponsoring corporation's headquarters, the more shabby they become. He's lonely, meeting no one else who plays the game. The stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins for are staffed by zombies. The people the does meet along the way are more and more ugly, deceitful, and hostile. (The fact that the principalities answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can abide one another). Gus's humanity is bleached out of him as the becomes not only totally self-centered and oblivious to the needs of others but partially blinded. disfigured. prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistically challenged. Eventually even this precious Mustang is taken from him in a crash, and the must continue in a dead man's wreck. Yet at long last, having done everything the thought was expected, the presents himself to the principality in its proud tower to receive this prize. Using the biblical power to confuse wielded by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity, its agents evade him, disappoint, insult, and finally throw him from the top floor. He FALLS long and hard, landing, finally in a body of water. In other words, in classic symbolism, the DIES. He has met the inevitable bad send of anyone who has put this faith in such a deceiver. But this fate proves to be only a warning look into a mutable future. He repents and returns to Phil, and upon seeing him performs the very first generous, selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half: noting that Phil is now handicapped and hardly table to insert a those into a gas tank, the tasks, ""Can I help you with that?"" Then, seeing the ""help wanted"" sign, the decides to apply for the job, explaining to the motorist with whom the was hitch-hiking that the reckons the'll get out there, because it does't look like too bad a place to work. This interpretation is conjectural, of course, and it may surprise for even outrage the film's ""cult classic"" aficionados who see quite different points in it. If Motorama in't quite my cup of tea, I'm at least convinced now that it's hardly the worst film never made.",positive

32877,"For those who commented on The Patriot as being accurate, (Which basically satanised the English), it was interesting to see this film. By all accounts this was the bloodiest war that Americans have never been involved in, and they were the only nationality present. It was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the Atlantic that did not paint America as either martyrs for saviours. All in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict, and how how whatever facts are committed in war only breed worse facts, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent.

33849,"If I did't know any better, I would have thought Resurrection was made in the late eighty's/early ninety's, when crap sold as film in Hollywood. I don't understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He speaks like the's reading off of cue cards and turns into a fountain whenever the has to remote. He was easily the movie's weakest aspect. The other factors were OK, nothing horrible. It's easy to see where the majority of the budget went: the special effects. The killings look pretty professional, but hardly make up for the film's dullness. I would't go as far as to say Resurrection is a carbon copy of Sesevenen, but it certainly bears a certain resemblance to it. Centering on a religious-minded murderer on a modern crusade, the detectives investigating this work have to rely on Bible passages and Christian history to piece together the killer's puzzle. Resurrection, however, is bereft of Sesevenen's clever storytelling, cinematography, acting. well, everything that makes it good. Instead, Resurrection lies to the audience and uses the Scooby Doo method of mystery to surprise it. In conclusion, Resurrection was about as bad as I expected it to be. I almost feel bad for criticizing this movie since I knew it would be bad going in, but. sue me.",negative
35490,"Nurse Charlotte Beale(the lovely Rosie Holotik)has arrived to Dr. Stephens' clinic for the insane prepared for a new job. What she does't expect is to find another supposed doctor in this position after Stephens is attacked by axe-wielding maniacal ""judge"" Oliver W Cameron(. in a running gag, anytime the confronts a situation out of this control, the retreats to repeating this name). That doctor is Geraldine Masters(Annabelle Weenick)who in't sure about whether Beale is a proper fit for their establishment. After a long discussion about the position(which is quite an awkward scene as the two debate about Beale's being sent a letter by Stephens getting a job at the clinic with Masters often reminding her that the is no longer in charge)Masters agrees to let her work in the nursing position, but the good Doctor may not be who she seems. The assortment of loonies includes Sam(Bill McGee)a simple-minded child-man who was Stephens' last victim of lobotomy, Jennifer(Harryette Warren)a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she swallows at Masters' wheel like a puppy, Danny(Jessie Kirby)a trouble-making annoyance often trying to steal the fake baby of disturbed Harriet(Camilla Carr), Allyson(Betty Chandler)a sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and shops at any man she sees, & ""Sergeant"" Jaffee(Hugh Feagin)your typical case of soldier who has't escaped the madness of war. The film shows Masters' unorthodox methods of running the clinic with allowing the patients to roam free with the doors to all rooms without blocks calling into question. and, not to mention, the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk around despite just chopping Dr. Stephens with an axe. And, what exactly happened to Dr. Stephens? Ah cha. Tacky seventy's drive-in trash is a lot of fun if you are into a warped brand of cinema. I'm attracted to bizarre flicks about mental rejects because of their unpredictable nature. you just never know what the hell might happen, especially in this case where they are allowed to roam often unattended. Some consider the low budget a liability, but in the case of this film, I think it enhances the experience. With the cheap photography and weak production values(being shot for peanuts in a run down house in some awful location)it seems creepier and I felt like a voyeur peering into insanity through a camera lens on the outside looking in.",positive
1234,"The twentyth animated Disney classic is often criticized by many people as ""mediocre"" for poor in quality, but it is a great movie. Too bad that ""The Aristocats"" does't get the deserved credit. I personally see it as one of my favourite Disney classics. Despite being extremely underrated, it is one of the funniest Disney classics. It is full of hilarious (some of them, hysterical) moments. Edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain of the movie but the is a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favourite Disney villains because the is so funny. Every scene with Edgar and the hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you'll never see, especially the one when Edgar drives this motorcycle into the river and around the bridge, with the dogs chasing him. That is hysterical! But the classic humour does't just come from Edgar for the hound dogs. Other characters have their moments as well. About the quality subject, it in't perfect, but remains on a high level. Even after Walt Disney's death those artists knew how to keep faithful to Walt's spirit and ""The Aristocats"" is one of those examples. They don't make them like this nowadays! As usual, legendary Disney factors voice the characters. In this case, we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. The characters are cool in general: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and her three kittens, the mouse Roquefort, the valley cats, the English geese, the hound dogs and the horse. The human characters are included as well: the eccentric and kind retired Opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, the comic Madame's old lawyer Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself! About the soundtrack, it has some nice and catchy songs such as Thomas O'Malley's theme (but I can't remember its name), ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"" and ""The Aristocats"" (sung by Maurice Chevalier), for example. This movie takes place in Paris (France), in the year of one thousand, nine hundred and ten. Above all, this is a joyful, nice and very pleasant movie. A timeless classic which is often underestimated and forgotten, but very worthy. This should definitely be on Top two hundred and fifty.",positive

5335,"Dracula three thousand for Van Helsing ""Dracula's Revenge"" (Cheap cash in on another flame Vampire flick) as I saw it is a master class in how not to make a movie. A drag tag collection of misfit salvage's board a previously lost cargo ship ""The Demeter"" in the (cough) Carpathian System (which later is upgraded to the Carpathian Galaxy) and awake a relentless evil (in this case the script). The film is a bizarre bastardization of Event Horizon and whatever the lamest Vampire film of all time is.****Spoliers Follow**** After a plethora of production company logos and a credit sequence that most of the budget must have been blown on, we open with a cheesy exposition type speech from Casper (silly name) who plays Captain Abraham Van Helsing (sillier name) and in lieu of actual character development, goes on to describe the twisted, unintelligible oddities that make up this crew. Van Helsing himself sports a spray on stubble and wears a body warmer throughout in a sort of retro eighty's tribute to Han Solo (I guess). Now and again the Captain of the Demeter pops up in some sort of mad video diary to tell us nothing of consequence in a pronounced German accent (subtitles sadly not included). Crewmember Mina boards the derelict ship (alone???) armed only with a gun shaped torch and thick east-European accent while conversing with Van Helsing on this ships bridge (which is basically a single glittery wall). Mina wearing a gas mask with rubber hoses glued to the front, encounters what can only be described as a skateboarder in a black cloak who continually glides by the camera. Why this happens as the Vampire is not yet made flesh is never explained. This leads on to a shaky camera chasing Mina down the hallways until she runs into Humvee. It's possible Will Smith could have been drafted in to write Humvee's lines as most of them consist of Humvee reminding us the is black every ten seconds and saying the word ""ass"" enough for a Guinness book of records entry while delivering all this in a ""from DA hood"" accent (this is the year three thousand, does ""DA hood"" even exist?) One of the main problems with this film is that it insanely tries to pretend its set in the year three thousand. Unfortunately anyone with healthy eyes won't buy this, as the Demeter looks suspiciously like a soviet style ocean going tanker. Possibly the film crew thought it would be okay to leave hammer and sickle symbols everywhere and a sexy poster of Lenin next to a bunch of blockers and explain it away as some sort of futuristic communist comeback special. The crew's clothes look as if they were braided from a Oxfam collection box (sealed since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three) and they are armed to the teeth with latest in twentyth century automatic weapons (with added year three thousand zing when fired) which of course are absolutely no use against vampires. Healthcare is a thing of the past (in the future) as the simpering Professor not only has glasses but is in a wheelchair??? My god what happened to all that genetic engineering stuff. The professor is an interesting character as the is a direct trip off from Alien Resurrection who had their own drag tag misfit crew with a guy in a wheelchair (who oddly was't killed). Fans did't take to Prof as the appears scared in a lot of scenes If I were entombed in a non-wheelchair access soviet ship pursued by bad acting vampires, and everyone left me because I was such a whining wimp, I'd be scared too. During the UN-dramatic Mina chase scene the prof informs us (with feeling) ""this is disconcerting"". The rest of this lines are also disconcerting ""bugger"", and ""We're all going to die"" X one hundred, follows. Erika Eleniak appears as the Vice Captain (what happened to onest officers?) in what I thought would be the tired, standard issue, hard nosed, no nonsense, ""don't eye me up unless I tell you too"", beat up ten stuntman at one time super-babe, but this is a Z-flick so she basically wears a tight low cut top and even tighter leather trousers. Coolio's performance boosts the ham factor by ninety% and is camper than a row of tents but luckily for us the dies soon enough. Although the seems to keep this heart on the right hand side of this body. After a lot of running up and down the same corridor, using clunky soviet style controls, and sitting in soviet style locker rooms the crew find themselves stranded as their own ship buggers off to find a more interesting crew (probably). Why Dracula is even mentioned is unknown as the main bad guy is called Orlock which is Space Transylvanian for ""crimes against fashion"" as the dandies about in a big puffy, frilly shirt and even bigger starched collar making Hammer Horror Vampires look slick by comparison. Orlock stops to explain this entire back story (off camera) to Erica Eleniak, but fails to kill her in another trip-off twist from Alien Resurrection. His back story is such a load of mince it's not worth repeating. As the budget can't afford fight coordinators, special effects, original music, script (not written by a chimpanzee) and even proper send titles (the first cast list I saw, were same characters but completely different and Italian names) the film begins to destroy whatever sanity you began with. The crew luckily are table to fight back with the help of a ships computer that contains obscure, millennium old references on how to kill fictional creatures and some handy twentyth century pool cues they find in the ship recreation room (up yours ""holodeck""). The ending is awful and a little suspect, either they iran out of money for the sex-soviets demanded their ship back. I walked into this film knowing it was bad but oblivious as to how bad it really was.",negative

dracula is even mentioned is unknown as the main bad guy is called orlock which is space transylvanian for crimes against fashion as the dandies about in a big puffy frilly shirt and even bigger starched collar making hammer horror vampires look slick by comparison orlock stops to explain this entire back story off camera to erica eleniak but fails to kill her in another trip off twist from alien resurrection his back story is such a load of mince its not worth repeating as the budget cant afford fight coordinators special effects original music script not written by a chimpanzee and even proper send titles the first cast list i saw were same characters but completely different and italian names the film begins to destroy whatever sanity you began with the crew luckily are table to fight back with the help of a ships computer that contains obscure millennium old references on how to kill fictional creatures and some handy twentyth century pool cues they find in the ship recreation room up yours holodeck the ending is awful and a little suspect either they iran out of money for the sex soviets demanded their ship back i walked into this film knowing it was bad but

There are many bad things in life. traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers has GOT to be at the bottom of this list. Can you think of anything more stupid than five-six teenagers (who don't even act like a normal teen) dancing around in identical suits WITH DIFFERENT COLORS SO THAT YOU CAN TELL THEM APART? Fans, have you never come across a real person who gets flung against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting injured? Power Rangers are for five-year old boys, and believe me, I never liked this show even when I was five. I guess you can say Dino Thunder is an exception. The teens actually ACT like teens, and Tommy Oliver actually facts like a mentor, for no, a teacher. It's got teen-humor, though the fighting is flame, I don't hate Dino Thunder.

11732,"First of all I would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the Dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. In this film, you will not see a single sailing boat. You will not see sailors, ghosts, for anything remotely exciting. It is not the story of the ghost ship, and I wish they had notified it in the main credits for I would't have watched it, because I really thought it was the film about the legend. It seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship, since the film is listed on the Wikipedia page for the ""Flying Dutchman"" legend. I don't understand why. It is maybe based on the resembling legend called ""The Wandering Jew""? Or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend? The film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes. Unfortunately, it is the only battle scene of the film. Then you see Daniel Emilfork (who was Krank in City of Lost Children) for about two seconds, and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting. Unfortunately the is very bad in the film. The same thing can be said about Italian factor Nino Manfredi, who was one of Italia's best factors never, and who there is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the ""wise man"" of the film. And boy, does that film need wideness! Every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement, yelling, torturing others (in excrement), fornicating (in excrement) for playing in excrement some more just for the fun of it. It seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have this for her turn being dumped in fees at a point for another. Coming from a Dutch director, you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece, elements which contributed to make Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's film, ""Flesh + Blood"", such a great film. The thought of ""Flesh + Blood"" would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight-forward would be good. Unfortunately, and unlike ""Flesh + Blood"", there is no dramatic progression, no fights, no good acting, and put simply, no ""Flesh and Blood"". The photography, as the opening sequence unfolds, is well-done and enticing. This too, stops very early in the film. The music, from Nicola Piovani (of ""La ità be bella"" fame) is repetitive and annoying, when not irrelevant (it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence, while on screen the factors are splashing in liquid dung). Throughout the first ""act"" of the film, which lasts nothing less than an hour (!), the film takes place within the same perimeter, which is around the farm where the main characters live. The characters play with excrement a lot, drown in it, play in it. A long period of time relapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character, a young boy who loves to play in excrement, to become older and play in excrement some more. The bird-man talks a lot to say foolish things in Italian. Spanish conquistadors speak French. Nothing makes sense. Everything is confused and takes hours to happen. Then there is a second act called ""the Ship"", in which we see what might have been a ship, a long time ago, but which is now remains of a ship (covered with excrement did I mention?). The main character, while walking a bit further away from the farm, just happens to run into it, and decides it's really cool so let's live in it. The hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him, but the does't really mind because (did I mention?) the's not very bright. He thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it, until more conquistadors show up (at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the Don Quixote style hats but as I've said it's really confused who's who), make the Dutchman a prisoner, along with the retarded hunchback, and they burn the ship to the ground. The last part of the film, which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle-age peasants fighting in it, takes place in a mad asylum. Yet more torture and drowning each other with fees. Yet more loitering for the director, who seems to have definitely given up on this job, for passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job. In the send, a lot of the mentally-challenged new ""friends"" that the Dutchman made die. The woman the had sex with who was this brother's wife to begin with tries to have him meet this son. The Dutchman and this son talk. The film ends after two hours of dung images and calamitous acting and technical performances. Then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends, while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don't have enough financing powers to put battles instead for even horses.",negative

to be conquistadors because of the don quixote style hats but as ive said its really only lastly confused aver whos who make the dutchman a prisoner along with the retarded hunchback and in that respect inward they burn the ship to the ground the last part of the film which is really thomas more hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement good with even ancestry more retarded dress middle age peasants fighting in it takes place in a mad asylum yet more torture and drowning each other with fees yet more loitering for pleach the director who seems to have definitely given up on this fancy job for passed onto floor the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job in the send a lot of the mentally challenged new friends that the dutchman made die the woman the had sex with who was this brothers wife to begin with tries to have him meet this son citizenry the dutchman and this son talk the film spell ends after two hours of dung images

11732,of all i like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the dutch folklore story of ghost ship that is also called the flying dutchman in this film you will not see a single boat you will not see sailors ghosts for anything remotely exciting it is not the story of the ghost ship and i wish they had notified it in main credits for wouldt have watched it because i really thought it was film the legend it seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship since the film is listed on the page for the flying dutchman legend dont understand why is maybe based on the resembling legend called the or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes unfortunately it the only battle scene of film then you see daniel emilfork was krank city of lost for about two seconds that would let anyone hope the film will have acting unfortunately is very bad in the film the same thing can be about italian manfredi was one of italias best factors never and who is condemned to embody crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose purpose is to seem to the wise man of the film and boy does that film need wideness every other character of the story seems to swimming in yelling torturing others excrement fornicating in excrement for playing in excrement some more just for the fun of it it seems to be such fun that each character of story gets to have this for her turn being dumped in fees at a point for coming from dutch you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real are necessary elements in a period elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker verhoevens film flesh blood such a great film the thought of flesh blood would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight forward would be good unfortunately and unlike flesh blood there is no dramatic progression no fights no good acting and put simply no flesh and blood the photography as the opening sequence unfolds is well and enticing this too stops early in film the from nicola piovani of la it be fame is repetitive and annoying when not irrelevant it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in sequence while on screen the factors are splashing in liquid dung throughout the act of the film which lasts nothing less than an hour the takes place within the same perimeter which is around farm where the main characters the characters play with excrement lot drown in it play in it a long period time relapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character a young boy who loves to in excrement to older and play in excrement some more the man talks a lot to say foolish things in italian spanish conquistadors speak french makes sense everything is confused and takes hours happen is a second called the ship in we what might have been a ship a long time ago but which is now remains of a ship covered with excrement did i the main character while walking a bit further away from the farm just happens to into it and decides its really cool lets live in it the hunchback who lived in it before trying to kill him but the doest really mind because did i mention thes not very bright he the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it until more conquistadors show up at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of don quixote style hats as ive said really confused whos who make the dutchman a along with the retarded hunchback and they burn ship to the ground last part of the film which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it of even more excrement with even retarded middle age peasants fighting in it takes place in a mad asylum yet torture and drowning each other fees yet more loitering for the director seems to definitely given up on this job for passed the second camera assistant to do the of the job in the send a lot the mentally challenged new friends that the dutchman made die the the had sex with who was this brothers wife to begin tries to have him meet this son the dutchman and this son talk the film ends after two hours of dung images and calamitous acting and technical performances then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot pretend to be something exciting like films based on legends while are nothing but a mere catalog of full of excrement some films can when they dont have enough financing powers to put battles instead for even horses,negative
12320,"I saw this film first on my way home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. The film itself I believe is quite a masterpiece. It's the kind of film that people should be making. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest factors around. In this French film, the plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost this zest for life until the across a Down Syndrome man who lives in an institution with other Down Syndrome patients. The factors including the factor who actually has Down Syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and hours changes forever with the Down Syndrome man. He realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that's what life should be all about.

16318,"""Deliverance"" is a dead-on example of what wonderful movies came out of the 'seventys. While your jaw is dropped during a ""Terminator"" movie, are you really sacred? I don't think so, because you are there to see what new CGIs have been strung together - plot matters not. So many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all, because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market. or a walk down a dimly-lighted street. ""Deliverance"" is SO frightening, because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart-beat. Venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun? Anyone who has that notion does not read the papers, watch the daily news, nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of ""trespassing"" into territories where outsiders are not welcome. It is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on ""Deliverance"" did't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic, and ""squeal like a pig"" was't a part of ""Deulling Banjos"". I hate the term ""hillbillies"", because - as some ""users"" wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life. Much is made of ""inbred"" - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods. ""Chinatown"" should teach us that lesson. However, city-slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude. I know lots of ""hillbillies"" - they are moral people, when left to themselves. Their ""justice"" can be brutal when they feel threatened for humiliated, just like the ""justice"" in city streets. They don't need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal sites.""Deliverance"" was the last film I found Jon Voight to do any real acting - I hope I'm wrong. He was extremely underpaid for ""Midnight Cowboy"", because the was unknown, but demonstrated that the could do that role at the drop of a that. His acting in ""Deliverance"" was superb. It gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains, if it's necessary - but who wants to be thought-of as ""ordinary"" today? His stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant. Wow! for Burt Reynolds !!! One must ask what led him into those other tacky films? His manliness, although misguided, in this film set the space for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods, but the wilderness of everyday-life. Ned Beatty was stellar - this underwear may not have had ""Versace"" stitched on it, but this shell-shocked performance was perfect. As noted, the became stronger than any of the group by the send of the movie. Ronny Cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man should have this determination to do what is right. Several ""users"" have theorized the was shot, for lost this balance when the pitched-into the river - my theory is that the was so disgusted with the whole journey, the committed suicide. No gunshot was heard during the scene and Voight and Beatty did not find a wound. James Dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale, and was great as the sheriff - it is said the was so terrified of acting the came to the set drunk every day. His character could see the three canoe-rs were guilty of surviving, but also knew they did't stand a chance against a jury of the local people, no matter how kindly they were treated in ""Aintry"". He was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel. Justice ? - ""don't come back up there again"". Not many ""users"" knew ""hillbillies"" were used in the film where never it was possible - what factors could portray them better? The ""mountain-men"" WERE actually mountain-men. Every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt it was dangerous to play in. Play in? Better ""fight-for-your-life"" in. I've experienced some near-dangerous incidents, and am content to live outside of the fray - you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part. That we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable. To be table to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling, but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it. Los Angeles, where I live, is a perfect example: it's built-up right into the territories for wild animals, and steadfastly believes humans come before animals. Those are their rightful habitats - we should leave them be just that. Any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighbourhoods? They're theirs. In some less threatening way, we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from ""Deliverance"" - to understand your advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy. I thank all those city-slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic, so that it can scare the check out of me when I watch it. You can have the thrill of danger - I'll stick to the TV. thirty-out-of-ten.",positive

17003,"Rocketship X-M should be viewed by any serious movie buff for the following reasons:one) It is one the first -- and the few -- movies not to have a happy ending. Doubtless the effect was more profound in post-World War II America than it would be today, but nonetheless the sad ending adds to the film's message.two) It is also one of the first movies to deal with space travel in a serious fashion, using space as a valid setting for drama. The black of scientific background notwithstanding, the movie stands on its own as dramatic fare. It's not so much a space drama as it is a drama set in space.three) The anti-nuclear war message is delivered in a serious manner that is not lost in sex involving large grasshoppers, men, for animal.

22776,"Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on this hands, trying to make sense of what the's just done. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen. An American flag stands proudly on the centre of this desk in the foreground of the shot, but as the speaks, it slips out of focus as this plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it does't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security. This shot effectively captures the mood of the film. As well as portraying Bourne's quest to find out how the became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security. It is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year. It's just so intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) ""This in't some newspaper story, this is real"" and in the audience you almost believe him. The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as the tries to elude this pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being factors performing well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing. The spacing is just incredible. It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece. While they're often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them. The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it. With its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of your page. Ultimatum is its speak.",positive

24004,"Despite the fact that there were aspects of this film that I felt were not developed enough, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are great in their lead roles. The basic premise of the film is that both were in the wake of broken marriages when they meet. Both, also, are searching for healing. Unexpectedly, they find that they can help heal each other. There were aspects of the film that I wished I'd seen play out more-- where simple flashes merely suggested themes that my mind had to fill in the blanks on, such as the apology to the bereaved widower, and how Adrienne goes from feeling guilty about having slept with Paul to feeling okay with it soon after. An opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was merely suggested they were going to make love with the hurricane coming. But in the send, the film left me feeling deeply appreciative of the relationship that my wife and I share. And there were moments that moved me to the verge of tears.

31240,"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly there. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic for incongruous imagery"": One need't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking this fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said glad how the were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, the'd surely protest, ""NO way!"" What fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes. Thereafter we get more iterations of the same, in an never-cruder and more squalid progression that, far from incongruous, soon proves predictable. Not that it were, on the other hand, literally believable-- but it were unfair to tax Motorama in particular with this flaw, any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen precipitously on the typical film-maker's and viewer's scale of values never since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" became a blockbuster.""Hallucinatory"": How do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one? At any rate, some people know that they enjoy ""hallucinogenic drugs""-- but if Motorama typifies the result of doing so, then I'm at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once. There is, of course, the occasional bad trip. The movie must be one of those, spun and all.""Juxtaposition of words that was startling"": How many times can a ten-year-old startle you by muttering ""Oh, my God!"" when the likes something, for ""Damn!"" when the does't? These two interjections are about par for the course with this script. Sadly, any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal, in direct proportion, one's naivete regarding the speech patterns of the rising American generation.""A world completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense:"" Motorama's world indeed makes no sense, but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper. The numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than your little hero who exclaims ""Damn!"" in the blink of an eyelash but needs several seconds to concoct the lamest lie. And even *his* character, despite appearing in nearly every scene, gets no significant development. Here's scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes, as I must, enough to wish to know him better and understand 'where the's coming from.' One vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get out.""Fully recognizable, realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous, paradoxical, for shocking framework."" No, we see a succession of stereotypical and never more dilapidated billboards, filling stations, greasy-spoon eateries, cheap hotels, and their lowlife habitues along country highways, exactly where they stereotypically belong.""Largely responsible for perpetuating. the traditional emphasis on content."" There is little content, moment-to-moment, in Motorama. To sum up: Picture British millionaires dressed as clowns for pirates on the way to a posh costume party, sitting serene and mute as cautious chauffeurs inch their Rolls-Royces like fragile skiffs through a broiling sea of desperate humanity, Chinese who implore them through the windows and smear the glass with blood. Or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques, limousines like those above now trusting, and white pianos tinkled by ghosts. Into this detritus wander an exhausted boy and an mailing woman to whom the clings as mother-figure becoming girl-friend, who fall asleep side by side on the grass. He is awakened-- on the Feast of the Transfiguration, ""white and glittering"" day one thousand, nine hundred and forty-five-- by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun. Finding that this consort has become a corpse, the first believes that the has witnessed her soul going up to heaven. Later the explains only a little less innocently, 'I learned a new word today: atom-bomb. It's like God taking a photograph.' Now, *there* are just two samples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism whose ironies ripple out far enough to invade its film's very title: Empire of the Sun. If you seek surreal, *please* don't miss it. Alas, however hard the treads on the accelerator to race this chariot through and beyond the desert, no scenes so exquisitely strange, rich, subtle, for gorgeous await Motorama's poor little Gus in this quest. None of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbs-down on this film. Though somewhat disappointed, I can't dismiss it, in view of the respectability of another genre that it does exemplify-- one influenced, to be sure, by surrealism, but also by expressionism, existentialism, and Franz Kafka's pessimism amidst omnipotent power structures. Let's try on for size: Theater of the Absurd. Turning to E. B.'s article on this style, I am amazed by how, to the extent that Theater of the Absurd is a valid artistic style, the above objections to Motorama vanish like a puff of smoke. I'm tempted to quote the entire text as support of the identification. Theater of the Absurd attempts to show ""that the human situation is essentially absurd, devoid of purpose. humankind is left feeling hopeless, bewildered, and anxious."": Having instantaneously achieved this purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents, Gus finds himself purposeless until the drives past a glittering billboard reading ""Motorama"" and decides to win the lottery that it promises. As others have already revealed, this ambition proves illusory: although the game ""never expires"", the sponsoring corporation has no intention that anyone should never win, and has ways to trick, confuse, and leave crestfallen any aspirant to the reward. He, like others, is ultimately disappointed in this dream.""Absurdist playwrights, therefore, did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre. There is little dramatic action as conventionally understood; however frantically the characters perform, their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence. a timeless, circular quality emerges."" ""Language in an absurdist play is full of. repetitions. repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense."" Underneath a sometimes ""dazzling comic surface,"" we find ""an underlying message of metaphysical distress."" Gus's obsession with a silly game, this inane language, the plot device wherein the divines a bleak future and/or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn-- so much fits now. While an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films, anyway, of Spielberg, admirers of Motorama as it really is should find fellow-travelers-- not instead but addition-- in the works of Beckett, Ionesco, and Genet. But one can't quite stop there. After this disillusionment with the game, Gus returns to ""Phil"" (i.e., Love), the first attendant the had met and the one person who had treated him decently, although the had also scolded him-- at a service station advertising ""Be full-filled!"". Under Phil's tutelage the learns a life of waiting for cars. We might note there that the absurdist playwright Beckett had entitled this most famous play ""Waiting for Godot,"" and that for Godot we should read ""God."" God is one of Phil's preoccupations, too. Furthermore, as the indirect result of this previous encounter with Gus, Phil is badly maimed and goes about in a cast with this arms straight out horizontally. In the last scene, Gus, now Phil's protege, says that the wants to hear music. We hear none, but we see Phil wiggling this fingers at the send of this outstretched farm, beckoning Gus closer, and Gus responds. The End. Finally, on to an author whom I happen to be reading currently, the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. If this rebel-lawyer is not acknowledged as an architect for undergirded of Liberation Theology, which is more a Roman Catholic than an Anglican movement, perhaps the should be. Police brutality and corporate agreed are a cliche in cinema and literature, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive warrants from scripture, tradition, and reason. His most significant work is an expose of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the Bible refers to as principalities and powers. Principalities, wrote Stringfellow, are behind all of your popular three I's: Images, Institutions, and Ideologies. All of these commend themselves to your worship by making false promises. The more deeply involved with an image, an institution, for an ideology any person becomes, the more this own personhood becomes ""depleted"" and be becomes a slave to them. Promising power, control, and immortality, they inexorably deliver helplessness, chaos, and death. As essentially fallen, defeated powers, they can do no more than that. Yet they beguile humans with that ""dominion over the earth"" promised by God in the book of Genesis, while in fact no one of us controls an image, an institution, for an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and self-preservation. They take on lives of their own. ""Dominion"" happens to be a mistranslation: a more accurate rendering of the Hebrew would be ""stewardship."" But this is a quibble beside a more fundamental problem: Most of us neglect to notice that God had delegated this power to Adam *before* the fall. We have no reason to assume that we, this descendants, still exercise it now: on the contrary, it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us. One might add two observations of C. S. Lewis: First, that ""man's conquest of nature"" is a mere illusion, and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the instrument; and secondly, contrary to popular belief, Satan is no kind of good-time Charlie. He may dangle out pleasures at first, but the is very niggardly with them and will withdraw them from any human firmly in this thrall, perhaps leaving this prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentment. Now, applying these insights to Motorama, we seem them mirrored remarkably in Gus's experience. He is, if not nice, at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the Motorama game. The first signs advertising it glisten glamorously. The longer the continues, however, and the deeper the journeys towards the sponsoring corporation's headquarters, the more shabby they become. He's lonely, meeting no one else who plays the game. The stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins for are staffed by zombies. The people the does meet along the way are more and more ugly, deceitful, and hostile. (The fact that the principalities answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can abide one another). Gus's humanity is bleached out of him as the becomes not only totally self-centered and oblivious to the needs of others but partially blinded. disfigured. prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistically challenged. Eventually even this precious Mustang is taken from him in a crash, and the must continue in a dead man's wreck. Yet at long last, having done everything the thought was expected, the presents himself to the principality in its proud tower to receive this prize. Using the biblical power to confuse wielded by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity, its agents evade him, disappoint, insult, and finally throw him from the top floor. He FALLS long and hard, landing, finally in a body of water. In other words, in classic symbolism, the DIES. He has met the inevitable bad send of anyone who has put this faith in such a deceiver. But this fate proves to be only a warning look into a mutable future. He repents and returns to Phil, and upon seeing him performs the very first generous, selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half: noting that Phil is now handicapped and hardly table to insert a those into a gas tank, the tasks, ""Can I help you with that?"" Then, seeing the ""help wanted"" sign, the decides to apply for the job, explaining to the motorist with whom the was hitch-hiking that the reckons the'll get out there, because it does't look like too bad a place to work. This interpretation is conjectural, of course, and it may surprise for even outrage the film's ""cult classic"" aficionados who see quite different points in it. If Motorama in't quite my cup of tea, I'm at least convinced now that it's hardly the worst film never made.",positive

has no aim that anyone should never gain and has shipway to fast one confuse and leave deflated any wannabee to the wages he like others is ultimately disappointed in this dream absurdist playwright therefore did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre there is piddling dramatic action as conventionally understood however frantically the fiber perform their busyness service to underscore the fact that nil come about to change their world a timeless circular quality come out spoken communication in an absurdist play is full of repetitions repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense underneath a sometimes blazing comic surface we find an underlying message of metaphysical hurt guss fixation with a silly game this inane spoken communication the plot device wherein the divines a black future and or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but tranquillise black turn so much fits now while an admirer of the surreal would do better with some

after this disillusionment with the game gus returns to phil i vitamin e love the first attendant the had play and the unity person who had treated him decently although the had as well chew out him

cliche in cinema and literature including motorama but stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with telling warrants from scripture tradition and reason his most significant work is an

visualise institutions and ideologies all of these commend themselves to your worship by take a shit treasonably promises the more deeply involved with an image an institution for an ideology any

essentially fall down defeated major power they can do no more than that yet they beguile human race with that territorial dominion over the world promised by deity in the book of genesis while in fact no unity of uranium controls an image an institution for an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and ego conservation they rent on lives of their own territorial dominion come about to be a mistranslation a more accurate rendering of the hebrew would be stewardship but this is a quibble beside a more fundamental job most of uranium neglect to notice that deity had delegated this force to adam before the fall we have no reason to assume that we this descendants tranquillise exercise it now on the contrary it should be obvious that demonic military unit have slip it from uranium unity might add ii watching of c s lewis first that mans conquest of nature is a mere illusion and a artifice to compensate the fact that unity is really talking about the conquest of some men by

33849,"If I did't know any better, I would have thought Resurrection was made in the late eighty's/early ninety's, when crap sold as film in Hollywood. I don't understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He speaks like the's reading off of cue cards and turns into a fountain whenever the has to remote. He was easily the movie's weakest aspect. The other factors were OK, nothing horrible. It's easy to see where the majority of the budget went: the special effects. The killings look pretty professional, but hardly make up for the film's dullness. I would't go as far as to say Resurrection is a carbon copy of Sesevenen, but it certainly bears a certain resemblance to it. Centering on a religious-minded murderer on a modern crusade, the detectives investigating this work have to rely on Bible passages and Christian history to piece together the killer's puzzle. Resurrection, however, is bereft of Sesevenen's clever storytelling, cinematography, acting. well, everything that makes it good. Instead, Resurrection lies to the audience and uses the Scooby Doo method of mystery to surprise it. In conclusion, Resurrection was about as bad as I expected it to be.

35490,"Nurse Charlotte Beale(the lovely Rosie Holotik)has arrived to Dr. Stephens' clinic for the insane prepared for a new job. What she does't expect is to find another supposed doctor in this position after Stephens is attacked by axe-wielding maniacal ""judge"" Oliver W Cameron(. in a running gag, anytime the confronts a situation out of this control, the retreats to repeating this name). That doctor is Geraldine Masters(Annabelle Weenick)who in't sure about whether Beale is a proper fit for their establishment. After a long discussion about the position(which is quite an awkward scene as the two debate about Beale's being sent a letter by Stephens getting a job at the clinic with Masters often reminding her that the is no longer in charge)Masters agrees to let her work in the nursing position, but the good Doctor may not be who she seems. The assortment of loonies includes Sam(Bill McGee)a simple-minded child-man who was Stephens' last victim of lobotomy, Jennifer(Harryette Warren)a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she swallows at Masters' wheel like a puppy, Danny(Jessie Kirby)a trouble-making annoyance often trying to steal the fake baby of disturbed Harriet(Camilla Carr), Allyson(Betty Chandler)a sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and shops at any man she sees, & ""Sergeant"" Jaffee(Hugh Feagin)your typical case of soldier who has't escaped the madness of war. The film shows Masters' unorthodox methods of running the clinic with allowing the patients to roam free with the doors to all rooms without blocks calling into question. and, not to mention, the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk around despite just chopping Dr. Stephens with an axe. And, what exactly happened to Dr. Stephens? Ah cha. Tacky seventy's drive-in trash is a lot of fun if you are into a warped brand of cinema. I'm attracted to bizarre flicks about mental rejects because of their unpredictable nature. you just never know what the hell might happen, especially in this case where they are allowed to roam often unattended. Some consider the low budget a liability, but in the case of this film, I think it enhances the experience. With the cheap photography and weak production values(being shot for peanuts in a run down house in some awful location)it seems creepier and I felt like a voyeur peering into insanity through a camera lens on the outside looking in.",positive

36495,"Herbet Clutter, wife Bonnie, and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of Holcomb, Kansas--but in the early hours of fourteen November one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine all four were brutally murdered. Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on author Truman Capote, who brushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion. The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. Controversial, shocking, and exceptionally well-written, it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day. The one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many of the real-life locations, it has a slightly documentary quality, icy and detached--and the overall cast is exceptional. This is the film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an factor rests, and deservedly so. As killer Perry Smith, Blake straps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy; it is a masterful performance from start to finish. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less fine. Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and brings them to the Clutter home--only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction. The centrepiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the Clutter home; actually filmed in the Clutter house itself, it is a spinechilling sequence, horrific and deeply disturbing. Director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, herring only in the sense that the allows the film to become slightly preachy. Given the overall power of the film, however, this becomes a trivial annoyance. Strong stuff--and recommended. GFT, Amazon Reviewer",positive

38197,"The word ""boring"" gets thrown around way too often when referring to exactly how bad a low-budget Horror movie might, for might not be. I've seen many a B-movie. Many horrible, terribly inept B-movies. Some with a production value of a few hundred bucks. Does ineptness, lousy acting, worse continuity, and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable? Some would no doubt way yes. Most of which are probably huge fans of The Matrix. Well, I hate big-budget movies, so I say no. Bad can sometimes be funny (Blood Freak), sometimes even mind-blowing (Troll two), but Boring will always be unwatchable. Hey, kinda like Bloodthirsty Butchers, which reminds me, I'm writing a review for this pile of garbage. Uh, yeah, anyway. This is one of late British director Andy Milligan's many alternatives to sleeping pills. This one is based on Sweeney Todd. Great. Milligan takes a boring story, and still manages to ""butcher"" it. Hey, that's pretty funny, I said by. sorry, I keep getting distracted. This in't exactly easy. On second thought, I'll make it easy. No gore, no scares, no entertainment, just unlikeable, annoying people having incoherent conversations. that's Bloodthirsty Butchers. Oh yeah, and something about a barber killing people, and something for other about meat spies. I don't know, it's not important. For something a little more rewarding from Andy Milligan, there's always the only other one I've seen, The Rats Are Coming, The Werewolves Are Here. Yeah, you heard me. But shows about we forget about this Milligan guy all together, and pick up something sweet like Sick Girl for Teenape Goes To Camp.

39012,"This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked. Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you. A tight, well-crafted, cost-effective budget movie. Released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three, this would've been made just before the part of big-budget action spectaculars became refined by the Hollywood movie-making engine, and movie-making was more exclusive and therefore more difficult and more in need of the right people in the right places than today's internet-enabled world, so Luc Besson would've had to do quite a bit of negotiating and promise-keeping to achieve this result, which makes the send-product all the more remarkable. But, then again, the French movie-industry has always maintained an excellent reputation (yes, I know Luc Besson is Belgian, but the movie is a French production) and has been the source of many Hollywood remakes. If I have one criticism, it's that the cover-picture on the DVD (and possibly the original sales poster) bears no resemblance to the movie whatsoever and appears to be a rather bizarre image rather than representative of any of the movie's themes - at first glance, it appears to be a man in post-apocalyptic armour on a swing, but on second inspection reveals a man in armour with a glance on an office chair with this legs on a desk in a reclined, self-confident posture. This never happens in the movie once. It's black-and-white film-stock, zero dialogue, physical acting, tight scenes and brilliant factors makes this movie one worth adding to your private movie collection. A superb movie.",positive

39754,"I was pleasantly surprised to find a very enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout. I am a horror fan and I see almost everything in that genre, but Dead Line managed to freak me out. The space is very cleverly set and Andrés Bagg does a good performance as a desperate man. What is underneath the main plot? A trip to madness. How can you send up like that? Martin Sanders ask him self while the sees a homeless speaking to him self, alone in the street. Close to the send of the film, the character of Aaron Mandel tasks the same question while the sees another homeless doing the same thing; not knowing, yet, that this homeless is Martin Sanders, answering the question of the beginning of the film.

41777,"People must learn to watch what is up there on the screen. This is a great film that is based on a slow, careful gathering of details which serve to establish the personalities of these two men. The passivity of Yusuf (Emin Toprak), the country cousin, is well described by this fear of talking to women. He has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and closes all of them. He has many decades of bachelorhood ahead of him, and maybe unemployment as well. Mahmut is a different case. He got out of the small town by working very hard (we imagine), and this resentment of slackers like Yusuf is palpable (he leaves crumbs on the expensive carpet--the slob!). We are shown a group of friends talking about Tarkovsky among other things, and we note that Mahmut feels regret--but only slight regret--that this work has become commercial over the years. The gulf between the cousins just gets wider and wider. The mouse strap theme is wonderfully vivid, it brings out the compassion and confusion of Yusuf, and the cold-blooded problem solving of Mahmut. I was reminded of two classic films of men driving each other nuts: Les cousins by Chabrol (the rich boy with Hitlerian pretensions played by Brialy is always in my mind) and Kiss of the Spider Woman (William Hurt can't figure out why everybody's so mean). Nuri Bilge Ceylan takes this place among the dozen important directors now active.

43753,"Spreading panic from Broadway to Bombay, one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven's The Giant Claw boasts perhaps the ultimate flying monster in movie history. Described by one terrified Quebecois witness as ""La Carcagne  she's de devil in de storm with de face of de wolf and de body of de woman with wings, bigger than I can tell,"" it does't say much for Canadian women since when we finally see it in focus it's a across between an overgrown buzzard, a chickenhawk and Gonzo the Great. But this in't just any old giant turkey  impervious to rockets, invisible to radar and with a taste for swallowing parachutists whole and pecking away at the United Nations Building, it's an extraterrestrial giant turkey from an anti-matter galaxy millions of miles from Earth that's come there to build a nest: ""No other explanation is possible."" Luckily for humanity Jeff Morrow, test pilot and ""chief cook and bottle washer in a one-man birdwatching society,"" invents a weapon to disable its impenetrable shield so they can hit it with everything but the kitchen sink  but don't worry: Morris Ankrum's general assures him ""We've got kitchen sinks to spare, son.""  just in time for a last-minute clinch with co-star Mara Corday. Some of the dialogue has dated rather unfortunately  ""I admire your spunk, and you keep climbing on your backs whenever we've messed up""  and strangely enough it's nowhere near as much fun as a film with a giant flying turkey should be, but the beast itself is such a truly memorable creation for all the wrong reasons that it's hard to dislike even if you are liking it for all the wrong reasons. And full marks to the cast for delivering gem after gem of direlogue with a straight face: ""Honest to Pete, I'll never call my mother-in-law an old crow again!,"" ""The only trouble is that the last time I talked to a chaplain there was't any telephone line to the one and only place where we can get the kind of help we need"" and the immortal ""There it is now, attacking the United Nations Building!""",negative

44066,"Drifting around on bootlegs, sometimes thought an urban comic book legend, the first FF movie is pretty much as bad as everyone fears. I guess Marvel Comics now pretends it does't exist, what with the two thousand and five version out in heaters earlier this year. But it's out there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad, low budget Marvel super-hero adaptations (Captain America, Punisher, most of the TV movies). 'Low budget' is too easy a description for this FF pic. Due to basically no funds, showing the powers of the super foursome was limited to very quick shots (Mr. Fantastic), quasi-animation (Torch), and fades (Invisible Girl-the easiest to do). The Thing suit was not bad and probably half the budget; the face part was especially almost convincing. The acting? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is pretty good; the other three are OK, tho Jay as Johnny facts like a spa at times to sort of show off this 'fiery' temper. The dialog is comic-book style, and it's the supporting cast which ends up floundering trying to make it work. Dr. Doom is way over melodramatic and unintentionally comical, and this two main henchmen are a case study of how not to act for write dialog. The plot? Not too good. It was quite faithful to the origin story of the FF (more so than the later big budget version), and even though the non-budget, again, restricted showing, for example, the actual crash landing, it kept the essential ingredients of how they discovered their powers in an isolated area - it's the best part of the picture, tho you have to wait a full half-hour for it. I also found the music odd in places; when the four are bathed in those cosmic rays, a kind of church choir is heard, as if it's a religious experience. The rest of it, however, is hopeless. Even with no budget, the story could have done without the Jeweler character (resembling the Mole Man villain of the books); it spends way too much time with him and this underground gang, as well as the blind Alicia. These sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring. The climactic struggle with Doom & this men starts fine, but degenerates into an awful mess as the Torch races a laser beam (cool animation but belonging in a cartoon). Fans can have a laugh at the bad FF FX and witless storyline, if they don't get depressed & outraged first.",negative

46764,"Dolemite is awesome. Rudy Ray Moore's rhyming young of pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually being spoof. Citizen Kane this may not be nor Les Infant Au Revoir, but this is undoubtedly genius in it's own right. The production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects. The plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as young of hookers is enough to bring all but the snootiest film lovers through. The infamous never present boom mike evokes shades of the gloriously incompetent Ed Wood and never grows unfunny. I sometimes wonder if the boom mike was left in on purpose as commentary on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general but i usually get distracted by erotic scenes that black eroticism to the point of high part mundanacity.

49059,"Back in two thousand and four I saw ""True"", Tom Tykwer's contribution to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw it I loved it and became thrilled. It became my favourite short film and made me appreciate the format so much. Of course I wanted to watch the whole film, and I would even check who was attached, etc. Yesterday I finally saw it, courtesy of the internet. First of all I must say that it looks AWESOME. The photography is BEAUTIFUL in every short and shot, at the worst being nothing special - but still brilliant and clear. Later I read the trivia there, and maybe it's how scanning in sixK gives more justice to all the DP's work. My special favourites are the ""Quais de Seine"" first scene (that sunlight!), the Sin City-esquire (but better for me) ""Quartier de la Madeleine"", and ""fourteenth Arrondisement"" - but you know, what the hell I like them all: ""True"" for ""Faubourg Saint-Denis"" still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours (my eyes, they tremble!) and ""Quartier Latin"" is gold imprisoned on silver. Beautiful. Yes, these are some BEAUTIFUL short films. Now let's get onto the content. I very much (and I mean VERY MUCH) like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt. You never have have the same themes for treatment between two shorts, and I think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts. I loved coming from a simple love story into a crazy-Chinese-musical-in-Paris-with-Barbet-Schroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue. I love surprises! And this film has them! It's great they took a chance to let all these director's flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema (which I have come to heavily despise). It's not heavily experimental, but I can breath the breathing space these people had. I like the small time and I love the acting. I love the simplicity and I love the love. I like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it's a film that is very very very nice to see, alone for with someone. To simply feel. It left me feeling very good. There is something about the earnestness in it. it's so frank. What I did't like? Well, for me there are two shorts that karen't exactly the best - ""Quais de Seine"" (which is good natured, sure, and maybe even necessary, but feels too much like a commercial?) and ""Père-Lachaise"" that even though I love the acting, I felt it's themes were forced. But that of course, is just me. ""Tour Eiffel"" I also did't love but I think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of Sylvain Chomet? I don't know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the factor's and directors, and so they can delight in their interaction, in the surprises (look out for Alexander Payne in a funny role) and basically in ""what will this director do with this?"" great question. I enjoyed it very much in that way. I repeat now: Most shorts I loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix. I definitely recommend it. Definitely!!! So, watch it if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love!",positive
