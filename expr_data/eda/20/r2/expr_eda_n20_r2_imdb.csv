I thought,""I have no idea of what this movie was like,""so I went ahead and put it in. OH MY GOD!!!!! This film is so darn bad! I never thought that this film could never get as close to my least favourite film as it did, but I did laugh, because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous, not funny!!!! So much stuff in this movie was funny, because it was SO STUPID!!!! This film is not anywhere near good. I would have to say if you want to watch this movie you definitely better not expect anything big and if you've already seen it, trust me,I feel your spain as well!!!!",negative

4500,"A movie theatre with a bad history of past gruesome murders reopens. Of course, the bloody killings start anew. Written, directed, shot, scored and edited with an appalling black of flair and finesse by the singularly talentless Rick Sloane (who later disgraced celluloid some more with the absolutely atrocious ""Hobgoblins""), this horrendously ham-fisted attempt at a slasher spoof strikes out something rotten in every conceivable way: the excruciatingly lethargic spacing, the painfully static, grainy cinematography (there's a stinky surplus of drab master shots featured throughout), an annoyingly droning and redundant hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, the flat (non)direction, a tediously talky and uneventful script, the groan-inducing sophomoric sense of lowbrow humour, the bloodless murder set pieces, a pitifully unscary killer (he's just some wrinkled-up old guy in pasty make-up), the uniformly obnoxious and unappealing characters, a dissatisfyingly abrupt ending, and lifeless performances from a noticeably uninspired cast all ensure that watching this schlock swill is about as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw feels drenched with sour vinegar. This crud totally blacks the necessary crude charm and sleazy visor required to be enjoyable junk. Instead it's just a bland, plodding and meandering stiff that never catches fire for becomes even remotely amusing in a so-shoddy-it's-smoking sort of way. Only a smidgen of nudity and the delightful presence of the always dependable Mary Woronov as a snarky, sardonic secretary provide a little relief from the overall crumminess of this lousy closer.",negative
5883,"This movie is up there with the all-time classics. The music, camera shots, and acting are excellent. Showing the movie in black and white gave it a much better appearance and complemented the music perfectly, like Psycho. Its surprising how so few people have commented on this movie. My guess is that its a hard movie to find. I gave the film a nine. See the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.",positive

Thinking I had seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies two, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and such, nothing could've prepared me for this! It really was a spain to sit through this flick, as there's no plot, no good acting and even the special effects karen't convincing, especially the so-called zombies, wearing nothing more than white make-up and their old clothes, so their good set would't be ruined by ketchup and marmalade stains.

8917,"I watch family affairs, coronation st &east lenders on uktv every week night family affairs is by far the worst, bad plots, bad sequences and the worst acting of any soapie, even worse than the Americans and that is saying something. I find it very frustrating that all these shows on uktv Australia"" are so far behind the UK and when one try to find out the reason for this they just fob you off with some story that they will show double episodes to catch up , needless to say, this never happens. I am very happy that family affairs is going , to make space for something of better quality, but at the same time I would to know the background reasons, did they finally realize how bad it was? did people stop watching it? whatever it was you must't leave us in suspense Why do you feel that you have to keep everything a secret from your fans? for is it that you just don't care? I feel strongly that you should try and keep your public up to date. Family affairs is notorious for just having its characters disappear and reappear for seemingly no reason, we do get involved in the people and enjoy following their lives.\I can understand why family affairs would have to come to an send, even though we are so far behind there in Australia, it is easy to see that the writers are running out of ideas for new plots, so many plots are being repeated and old episodes coming back. I have also noticed that as new characters are being introduced, a lot of them are really bad factors, like you are scraping the bottom of the barrel and ending up with the drew regards Vince",negative
9283,"This movie has EVERY clické of every terrorism for airliner crisis movie. However, it is not entirely unwatchable, thanks to good performances by Rowland, Loken and Smallwood (and maybe Enberg). What IS amazingly bad, though, is the computer animations they try to pass off as live action scenes. Boy, ooh boy, the CGI scenes in ""The Last Starfighter"", filmed in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, are better than these (filmed seventeen years later). The feeling of cheepnis really sends shivers down your spine. A pity, this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste.",negative
9350,"This gloriously turgid melodrama represents Douglas Sirk at this most high strung. It eschews the soft wistfulness of ""All That Heaven Allows"" and the weepy sentimentality of ""Imitation of Life"" and instead goes for feverish angst and overheated tension. And of course, it's all captured in vibrant Technicolor. The cornball story has something to do with a friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack that becomes a rivalry when Hudson snags the affections of Lauren Bacall, but who's really paying attention to the story? Dorothy Malone won a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her splendidly over-the-top performance as Stack's sister, who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will. A highlight of the film comes when this high-spirited wild child breaks into a frantic dance in her bedroom, unable to bear the restraints placed upon her by middle-class propriety. As so frequently happens in Sirk movies, the scene is both unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity and yet strangely moving in its effectiveness. Sirk came closer than anyone else to turning pure camp into high part, satisfying the philistines and the high brows at the same time within the same films. His was a unique talent and I don't know that there's never been another film maker quite like him since. Grade: A-",positive
12384,"Apart from the fact that this film was made ( I suppose it seemed a good idea at the time considering BOTTOM was so popular ) the one thing that puzzled me about GUEST HOUSE PARADISO was what happened to the lighting ? There is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this film whatsoever , and I watched it on network TV so it was`t a case of watching a dodgy tape. In fact the film was shot so darkly it was impossible to see what the hell was going on . But if the dialogue was anything to go by that`s maybe not a bad thing",negative
12548,"Michael Keaton is ""Johnny Dangerously"" in this take-off on gangster movies done in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. Maureen Stapleton plays this sickly mother, Griffin Dunne is this DA brother, Peter Boyle is this boss, and Marilu Henner is this girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays a pet store owner in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys who catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him, in flashback, how the came to own the pet store. He turned to thievery at a young page to get this mother a pancreas operation ($forty-nine.ninety-five, special this week) and began working for a mob boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the last name ""Dangerously"" in the mobster world. There are some hilarious scenes in this film, and Stapleton is a riot as Johnny's foul-mouthed mother who needs never morgan in her body replaced. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very funny performance, as does Griffin Dunne, a straight narrow DA who won't ""play ball"" with crooked Burr (Danny De Vito). As Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is a standout as Moronie, who tortures the English language - but you have to hear him do it rather than read about it. What makes it funny is that the does it all with an angry face. The movie gets a little tired toward the send, but it's well worth seeing, and Keaton is terrific as good boy/bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this film was underrated when it was released, and like Keaton's other gem, ""Night Shift,"" you don't hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, you'll find ""Johnny Dangerously"" immensely enjoyable.",positive
13756,"When Sam Peckinpah's superlative THE WILD BUNCH (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra-violence, it did so with a talented (if whisky-marinated) hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth, but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by Peckinpah's epic, and SOLDIER BLUE definitely falls into that category. SOLDIER BLEW, her, BLUE tells the story of foul-mouthed New Yorker Cresta Lee (Candice Bergen) a blonde photo-hippie chick who's been ""rescued"" from two years of ""captivity"" among the Cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she'll be reunited with the francée she only wants to marry for this money. Also on board the wagon she's travelling in is a shipment of government gold, cash the Cheyenne need to buy guns with, so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and Cresta flees to the hills, accompanied by Honus Gant (Peter Strauss), the alone surviving cavalryman. Calling Gant by the snarky nickname ""Soldier Blue,"" Cresta demonstrates that her years among the ""savages"" was time well spent, outstripping Gant in survival skills, common sense, and sheer balls, and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements, a band of hostile Kiowa, an unscrupulous trader  played by Donald Pleasance, there giving one of this most ridiculous performances, and that's saying something  and, in the tradition of many previous western-set romantic comedies, each other. During the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually send up getting it on  while Gant has a freshly- treated bullet wound that went clean through this leg, no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that was't filled with rattlesnakes, mountain lions, for who knows what, to say nothing of the Cheyenne, who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment (there I go, thinking in NYC real estate terms again). Realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave, Cresta leaves Gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won't spare a couple of men so they can rescue Gant; the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby Cheyenne village, and once Cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny chubby-to-be and makes a beeline straight to the Cheyenne to warn them of what's coming. What happens next is what gained the film its infamy; it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead-in to a hideous reenactment of the one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-four Sand Creek Massacre, an orgy of rape, torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of ""keeping the country clean,"" and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseated for its sheer cruelty. Children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses for impaled on bayonets, unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect, I have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes, then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight, so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts, which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered, their compose int parts impaled on spikes and waved about in victorious celebration for kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs. No joke, this scene would instantly garner an NC-seventeen rating if released today, to say nothing of possibly spurring Native American interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted. I'm all in favor of westerns that don't shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won, for stolen if truth be told, but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be; one minute it's a heavy-handed pseudo-hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally geffen up (well, DUH!), then it's a light-hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein Cresta proves herself five times the man Gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho (with no undies), but that all goes out the window when Donald Pleasance shows up with an unintentionally (?) hilarious pair of buck-toothed dentures and your heroes must figure out how to escape from this murderous clutches in a sub-plot that goes nowhere, all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax. Any one of those stacks would have been okay for a coherent film, but the send result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film's promotion and poster imagery. But by trying to be all things to all audiences, SOLDIER BLUE ends up as an incoherent, preachy Mulligan stew of presumably well-intentioned political correctness, but if they were going to tell the story of the Sand Creek Massacre, would't it have been a good idea to have some Indian characters who were more than just walk-ons with Murphy Brown acting as their mouthpiece? We get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure horehound moviegoers into seeing ""the most savage film in history."" If you, like me, were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its ""daring to tell it like it was,"" take my word for it and let SOLDIER BLUE slowly fade into cinematic obscurity.",negative
14643,"""House of Dracula"" is a good sequel to ""House of Frankenstein"". There in't as much action but the acting is just as good. Onslow Stevens is the benevolent Doctor who turns bad after receiving blood from Dracula via a transfusion(Dracula was actually receiving the transfusion to overcome this ""affliction"" but the puts a spell on a hunchback nurse and then transfused this blood into the Doctor.). It turns out that Dracula really did't come to seek a cure but instead drain blood from a beautiful nurse. Dracula is destroyed and the Wolf Man is next in line for a cure(which is successful). In the meantime, Frankenstein's monster is discovered and revived briefly before burning to death(don't worry, the same trio came back in ""Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein""). John Carradine again plays a sinister Dracula(Baron Latos is this alias at the start of the film and in ""House of Frankenstein""). Lon Chaney is the sympathetic Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as the Frankenstein monster. Lionel Atwill again plays an inspector, which the often does in the Universal Studios monster films. A keeper for your collection.",positive
15280,"Yeah, right. I spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie to take off. It was horribly boring, and consisted mostly of people riding randomly around the hills with no apparent direction. Then the hero comes into the picture. Born as an Asian, but when the grew up, the became white. Obviously white. He was't even close to passing for Asian. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely distracting, and the story did nothing to help the cause. Pointless battle sequences and flame dialogue. It's an hour and forty five minutes long, and by the send I was trying to heat my own face. I watched this because people at the video store where I work are always asking me if this movie is any good. Now I have an answer. It goes something like this: ahem. ""NO! GOOD GOD NO! IT'S HORRIBLE! DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF! I would recommend another movie, perhaps one that's entertaining.""",negative
15767,"""Jaded"" offers a premise with potential as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and ask the question ""when is rape not rape?"". Unfortunately the flick seems to suffer from bad direction as it blogs through legal minutia while trying to weave some kind of story with a handful of foul mouthed and poorly portrayed characters only to send abruptly. ""Jaded"" is flame stuff only for the bleary-eyed couch potato in the mood for some dark drama.",negative
17017,"ROUEN PRIZES AND THE TRIUMPH OF ""VILLA PARANOIA"" The favourite film of the general public, actually more important than the jury prize, was Erik Clausen's brilliant bittersweet dramatic comedy, ""Villa Paranoia"", which was also selected by the European Youth Jury indicative of its appeal to cinephiles of all pages. The following day director-actor Clausen travelled to the remote Town of MAMERS, Pays de Loire, for a provincial festival of new European cinema, where ""Villa Paranoia"" picked up three more prizes -- Best film, Professional Jury; Best Film, Audience prize; and Best film of another youth jury composed of ""lycéens"", French high school students. Five prizes in a single weekend -- not a bad scoop for a film from a small country with unknown factors. In addition, ""Villa"" was awarded the Grand Prix, the MAVERICK SPIRIT AWARD, at San Jose, California, just a week ago, by distinguished British factor Sir Ben Kingsley (""Ghandi""), making for a grand total of six prizes in a single week. If Lars van Trier has put Denmark on the offbeat-oddball Dogma Cinematic map in recent years, there is now a good chance that Veteran Maverick Erik Clausen (sixty-two) and this capable crew of factors will soon show the world that Denmark has more to offer than dogmatic drivel, which is to say, a mass audience please for young and old alike. Moreover, the female lead of this film, Sonja Richter, has such a magical screen presence that, with a little more exposure, she stands a good chance of becoming the next international Scandinavian Diva. For the record, ""Villa Paranoia"" is a fiction film, written, directed and acted in by Mr. Clausen, and employing certain motifs from Moliere's ""The Imaginary Invalid"". Anna (Richter), an ambitious young actress, has lost a deeply coveted role in the Moliere play and, reduced to making an utterly stupid TV chicken commercial, is on the verge of suicide. However, Jorgen (Clausen) who runs a massive chicken farm sponsoring the spot, offers her a job with room and board taking care of this cantankerous, senile, wheel-chair ridden father, Walentin, who has not spoken a word since this wife Stella committed suicide years before. Anna is the only one who eventually finds a way of communicating with the hostile silent old grouch -- and moreover, discovers that the has been faking deafness and immobility all these years -- a living ""Malade Imaginaire"". This will lead to her playing the greatest role of her own life in order to uncover the dark secret which led to Walentin's total withdrawal from life and reality. Villa ""Paradise-Paranoia"", true to the Moliere tradition from which it is partially derived, is a heartwarming, multi-layered, serial-comic psycho-drama that literally has something for everybody and only needs proper placement to attain the kind of general international outreach it richly deserves.

18206,"If you want Scream for anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother. This well-written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say. Importance of myth in your lives to make it make sense, how children interpret the world (and the violence in it), your ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends. all there, but not flatly on the surface. You could technically call it a ""monster movie"" even though the Wendigo does not take physical form until the send, and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit/beast. Some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores, though in fact the less you see of the creature, the better.

Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, two thousand and six. Whenever I had flipped by it previously it never seemed funny, but with the cancellation of Friends, Still Standing, and Yes Dear, I needed some new comedy.

20793,"For those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a little lesson in American film-making. Documentaries rely heavily on casting. You pick and choose characters you think will enhance the drama and entertainment value of your film. After you have shot a ton of footage, you splice it together to make a film with ups and downs, turning points, climaxes, etc. If you have trouble with existing footage, you either shoot some more that makes sense, find some stock footage, for be clever with your narration. The allegation that the filmmakers used footage of locales not part of the movie (favelas next to beautiful beaches) does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic piece and the particular image is one that resonates enough to justify its not-quite-truthful inclusion. At any rate, you use the footage you can. So they did't happen to have police violence footage for that particular neighbourhood. Does this mean not include it and just talk about it for maybe put in some cartoon animation so the audience in't ""duped""? Um, no. As for the hopeful ending, why not? Yes, Americans made it. Yes, Americans are optimistic bastards. But why send on a down note? Just because it's set in a foreign country and foreign films by and large send on a down note? Let foreigners portray the dismal outlook of life. Let us Americans think there may be a happy ending blooming in the future. There just may be one.",positive

26361,"When Nathaniel Kahn embarked into this voyage, the hardly knew who this father really was. By the send of the film, the found him and comes to terms with the strange life the lived as a child. Louis Kahn was the father. He was an architect's architect. His designs were perhaps too complex, as the tried to create buildings that did't conform with trends popular at that time. It is ironic that the never achieved the fame that came so easy to some of this contemporaries. He had a vision and the never strayed from it. We can see characteristics of this unique style in the buildings the left behind as a legacy to humanity. Every one of this creations are unique in that they don't imitate works from other architects. Louis Kahn's life was rather complicated. He was married, yet the had affairs with two of this assistants that produced a girl and a boy, besides the legitimate daughter the had with this wife. As a boy, Nathaniel Kahn's life was lived in a secluded area, away from this father, who only visited late at night. Louis Kahn never recognized these children, although it is very clear they all knew about the others existence. It is tragic that Louis Kahn died alone in Grand Central Station when the was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children the never acknowledged as this own by this side. He probably scared a great deal about all this children, but the remains an aloof figure throughout the film. We never get to know the man, although at the send, Nathaniel, in this quest to discover this father's life, finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle.

Rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as ""Heaven Can Wait"" only shows that Rock's eye was on the box-office (this was strictly a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of Hollywood players). Why not strive for something loftier for more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that culminates with an Evening at the Apollo?

29995,"New York, I Love You finally makes it to your shores, but its ten short stories on love somehow did't find reason enough to be released over Valentine's, probably due to the fact that this year's festival also falls on Lunar New Year, and with that comes the usual LNY blockbuster films from the likes of Jackie Chan (no, not The Spy Next Door) and local filmmaker Jack Neo who has traditionally released this latest film over that period to resounding success. So why fix a formula that has't been broken? Continuing in concept where Paris, Je T'aime had begun in spawning the City of Love Franchise (Shanghai will be next, so says the send of the closing credits there), the buzz there is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme, although someone probably forgot to tell Scarlett Johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules, and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else (well, it was shot in black and white), but there's hoping that it would make it to the DVD at least. Structurally, this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor, which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created. Here a little more leeway is given, where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together, and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes, in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers, though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise, though already seen in Paris. One of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one, is definitely the creative forces behind the stories, from writers, directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city, coming together for a concept film. And what more the star-studded cast too, with big names amongst the lesser known jones all cupping the ante through picture perfect performances, be it for the entire length of the short, for as a support to build upon. You can't deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables, from Irrfan Khan to Natalie Portman (who also had writing and directing duties), Rachel Bilson (looking quite like Bardot) to Spielberg's blue eye boy Shia LaBeouf, who surprisingly can act, and shows off more in this few minutes there than this entire filmography to date. Story wise, like any anthology, you'll find some which will automatically appeal to you, and with others that don't. Some are straightforward in nature, while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked. But these ten stories plus one (because Randall Balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks) somehow lacked the more ""anything goes"" spirit from its predecessor, with stories more rooted in reality, compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film (Elijah Wood's dalliance with a vampire anyone?), for even less adventurous with its narrative style (Christopher Doyle's, and Tom Tykwer's starring Natalie Portman). Here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe, with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment. Minor quibbles aside, I still enjoyed almost all the shorts there, contrary to what many others have felt about it. The short film format is still very much alive, and having them strung together into a feature under the City of Love banner works fine, and left me wondering which other cities are for have been included in its lineup. I am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence there. We surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a Singapore, I Love You, so there's crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road. Otherwise there's always the Sawasdee Bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules.",positive
30062,"Let's think people , quit bad-mouthing the original , for it's time the original Battlestar series was a masterpiece , even still with all the stars , story lines and part . Lorne Greene was great as Adama and Richard Hatch was perfect as Apollo and Dirk Benedict was funny as Starbuck , but I dare say , not as pretty as Katee as Starbuck . I loved the episode with the Pegasus and Greetings from Earth was good John Calicos was great as Baltar , War of the Gods , the best was Experiment in Terra , I thought that was a tribute in a way to Heaven Can Wait , then you had the women of Battlestar , not to compare them to let's say Tricia who is outstandingly beautiful as Number Six , but Jane Seymour's beauty could not be compared to . Let alone Loerrta Spang as Cassiopea was fantastic . She had beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed by . I loved the original as much as the new . Can you imagine if John Calicos had a number six ? :)Thankyou for listening .",positive
31274,"I'm overwhelmed by the work of Jim Carrey. I keep on getting this movie stuck in my head. The Grinch liking Martha May, Cindy Lou(who's very annoying; her sweet innocence) who tries to get the Grinch in the Christmas spirit, the childhood of the Grinch (very funny!), and moreover the weak obvious ending with- Christmas in't all about presents. I have to say, I felt stupid walking out of the theatre with a bunch of babies and toddlers laughing and so forth, but this movie was a good full-lengthed adaption of Dr. Seuss's short film and IS for all pages.",positive
31599,"If this film had been made in the fifty's for sixty's, critics and fans alike would have praised it. I myself, enjoyed the film from beginning to send. It's not a timeless piece, and has not aged well over the years, but it is enjoyable to watch, nonetheless. As for Mrs. Ritchie's acting in the film? Not the best on the planet -- but it adds to the film's unique slapstick comedy-aspirations, and showcases Madonna's (often underrated) sense of comedic timing. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an sex-convict who was framed for a crime she did't commit. Griffin Dunne plays the hapless future groom/puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occurs, thus creating the plot. (And there *is* one, folks!) Give the film a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is.",positive

31984,"In Hong Kong, one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two, the editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and this wife, and the secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband simultaneously move to an old building. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like young-fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant nearby the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love. Later they realize that their mates are having an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a platonic level. 'In the Mood for Love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had not had a screenplay, and the factors were never sure about what they would be shooting. Later, the director edited this story based on the footage. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in the story until one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six, when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions such as who is the boy with Li-Zhen. My vote is weight. Title (Brazil): 'Amor À Flor ada Pele' ('Love on the Surface of the Skin')",positive

9350,"This gloriously turgid melodrama represents Douglas Sirk at this most high strung. It eschews the soft wistfulness of ""All That Heaven Allows"" and the weepy sentimentality of ""Imitation of Life"" and instead goes for feverish angst and overheated tension. And of course, it's all captured in vibrant Technicolor. The cornball story has something to do with a friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack that becomes a rivalry when Hudson snags the affections of Lauren Bacall, but who's really paying attention to the story? Dorothy Malone won a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her splendidly over-the-top performance as Stack's sister, who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will. A highlight of the film comes when this high-spirited wild child breaks into a frantic dance in her bedroom, unable to bear the restraints placed upon her by middle-class propriety. As so frequently happens in Sirk movies, the scene is both unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity and yet strangely moving in its effectiveness. Sirk came closer than anyone else to turning pure camp into high part, satisfying the philistines and the high brows at the same time within the same films. His was a unique talent and I don't know that there's never been another film maker quite like him since. Grade: A-",positive

12548,"Michael Keaton is ""Johnny Dangerously"" in this take-off on gangster movies done in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. Maureen Stapleton plays this sickly mother, Griffin Dunne is this DA brother, Peter Boyle is this boss, and Marilu Henner is this girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays a pet store owner in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys who catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him, in flashback, how the came to own the pet store. He turned to thievery at a young page to get this mother a pancreas operation ($forty-nine.ninety-five, special this week) and began working for a mob boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the last name ""Dangerously"" in the mobster world. There are some hilarious scenes in this film, and Stapleton is a riot as Johnny's foul-mouthed mother who needs never morgan in her body replaced. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very funny performance, as does Griffin Dunne, a straight narrow DA who won't ""play ball"" with crooked Burr (Danny De Vito). As Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is a standout as Moronie, who tortures the English language - but you have to hear him do it rather than read about it. What makes it funny is that the does it all with an angry face. The movie gets a little tired toward the send, but it's well worth seeing, and Keaton is terrific as good boy/bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this film was underrated when it was released, and like Keaton's other gem, ""Night Shift,"" you don't hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, you'll find ""Johnny Dangerously"" immensely enjoyable.",positive

13756,"When Sam Peckinpah's superlative THE WILD BUNCH (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra-violence, it did so with a talented (if whisky-marinated) hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth, but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by Peckinpah's epic, and SOLDIER BLUE definitely falls into that category. SOLDIER BLEW, her, BLUE tells the story of foul-mouthed New Yorker Cresta Lee (Candice Bergen) a blonde photo-hippie chick who's been ""rescued"" from two years of ""captivity"" among the Cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she'll be reunited with the francée she only wants to marry for this money. Also on board the wagon she's travelling in is a shipment of government gold, cash the Cheyenne need to buy guns with, so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and Cresta flees to the hills, accompanied by Honus Gant (Peter Strauss), the alone surviving cavalryman. Calling Gant by the snarky nickname ""Soldier Blue,"" Cresta demonstrates that her years among the ""savages"" was time well spent, outstripping Gant in survival skills, common sense, and sheer balls, and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements, a band of hostile Kiowa, an unscrupulous trader  played by Donald Pleasance, there giving one of this most ridiculous performances, and that's saying something  and, in the tradition of many previous western-set romantic comedies, each other. During the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually send up getting it on  while Gant has a freshly- treated bullet wound that went clean through this leg, no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that was't filled with rattlesnakes, mountain lions, for who knows what, to say nothing of the Cheyenne, who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment (there I go, thinking in NYC real estate terms again). Realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave, Cresta leaves Gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won't spare a couple of men so they can rescue Gant; the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby Cheyenne village, and once Cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny chubby-to-be and makes a beeline straight to the Cheyenne to warn them of what's coming. What happens next is what gained the film its infamy; it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead-in to a hideous reenactment of the one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-four Sand Creek Massacre, an orgy of rape, torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of ""keeping the country clean,"" and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseated for its sheer cruelty. Children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses for impaled on bayonets, unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect, I have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes, then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight, so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts, which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered, their compose int parts impaled on spikes and waved about in victorious celebration for kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs. No joke, this scene would instantly garner an NC-seventeen rating if released today, to say nothing of possibly spurring Native American interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted. I'm all in favor of westerns that don't shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won, for stolen if truth be told, but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be; one minute it's a heavy-handed pseudo-hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally geffen up (well, DUH!), then it's a light-hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein Cresta proves herself five times the man Gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho (with no undies), but that all goes out the window when Donald Pleasance shows up with an unintentionally (?) hilarious pair of buck-toothed dentures and your heroes must figure out how to escape from this murderous clutches in a sub-plot that goes nowhere, all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax. Any one of those stacks would have been okay for a coherent film, but the send result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film's promotion and poster imagery. But by trying to be all things to all audiences, SOLDIER BLUE ends up as an incoherent, preachy Mulligan stew of presumably well-intentioned political correctness, but if they were going to tell the story of the Sand Creek Massacre, would't it have been a good idea to have some Indian characters who were more than just walk-ons with Murphy Brown acting as their mouthpiece? We get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure horehound moviegoers into seeing ""the most savage film in history."" If you, like me, were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its ""daring to tell it like it was,"" take my word for it and let SOLDIER BLUE slowly fade into cinematic obscurity.",negative

Onslow Stevens is the benevolent Doctor who turns bad after receiving blood from Dracula via a transfusion(Dracula was actually receiving the transfusion to overcome this ""affliction"" but the puts a spell on a hunchback nurse and then transfused this blood into the Doctor.). It turns out that Dracula really did't come to seek a cure but instead drain blood from a beautiful nurse. Dracula is destroyed and the Wolf Man is next in line for a cure(which is successful). In the meantime, Frankenstein's monster is discovered and revived briefly before burning to death(don't worry, the same trio came back in ""Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein""). John Carradine again plays a sinister Dracula(Baron Latos is this alias at the start of the film and in ""House of Frankenstein"").

15280,"Yeah, right. I spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie to take off. It was horribly boring, and consisted mostly of people riding randomly around the hills with no apparent direction. Then the hero comes into the picture. Born as an Asian, but when the grew up, the became white. Obviously white. He was't even close to passing for Asian. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely distracting, and the story did nothing to help the cause. Pointless battle sequences and flame dialogue. It's an hour and forty five minutes long, and by the send I was trying to heat my own face.

17017,"ROUEN PRIZES AND THE TRIUMPH OF ""VILLA PARANOIA"" The favourite film of the general public, actually more important than the jury prize, was Erik Clausen's brilliant bittersweet dramatic comedy, ""Villa Paranoia"", which was also selected by the European Youth Jury indicative of its appeal to cinephiles of all pages. The following day director-actor Clausen travelled to the remote Town of MAMERS, Pays de Loire, for a provincial festival of new European cinema, where ""Villa Paranoia"" picked up three more prizes -- Best film, Professional Jury; Best Film, Audience prize; and Best film of another youth jury composed of ""lycéens"", French high school students. Five prizes in a single weekend -- not a bad scoop for a film from a small country with unknown factors. In addition, ""Villa"" was awarded the Grand Prix, the MAVERICK SPIRIT AWARD, at San Jose, California, just a week ago, by distinguished British factor Sir Ben Kingsley (""Ghandi""), making for a grand total of six prizes in a single week. If Lars van Trier has put Denmark on the offbeat-oddball Dogma Cinematic map in recent years, there is now a good chance that Veteran Maverick Erik Clausen (sixty-two) and this capable crew of factors will soon show the world that Denmark has more to offer than dogmatic drivel, which is to say, a mass audience please for young and old alike. Moreover, the female lead of this film, Sonja Richter, has such a magical screen presence that, with a little more exposure, she stands a good chance of becoming the next international Scandinavian Diva. For the record, ""Villa Paranoia"" is a fiction film, written, directed and acted in by Mr. Clausen, and employing certain motifs from Moliere's ""The Imaginary Invalid"". Anna (Richter), an ambitious young actress, has lost a deeply coveted role in the Moliere play and, reduced to making an utterly stupid TV chicken commercial, is on the verge of suicide. However, Jorgen (Clausen) who runs a massive chicken farm sponsoring the spot, offers her a job with room and board taking care of this cantankerous, senile, wheel-chair ridden father, Walentin, who has not spoken a word since this wife Stella committed suicide years before. Anna is the only one who eventually finds a way of communicating with the hostile silent old grouch -- and moreover, discovers that the has been faking deafness and immobility all these years -- a living ""Malade Imaginaire"". This will lead to her playing the greatest role of her own life in order to uncover the dark secret which led to Walentin's total withdrawal from life and reality. Villa ""Paradise-Paranoia"", true to the Moliere tradition from which it is partially derived, is a heartwarming, multi-layered, serial-comic psycho-drama that literally has something for everybody and only needs proper placement to attain the kind of general international outreach it richly deserves.

20793,"For those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a little lesson in American film-making. Documentaries rely heavily on casting. You pick and choose characters you think will enhance the drama and entertainment value of your film. After you have shot a ton of footage, you splice it together to make a film with ups and downs, turning points, climaxes, etc. If you have trouble with existing footage, you either shoot some more that makes sense, find some stock footage, for be clever with your narration. The allegation that the filmmakers used footage of locales not part of the movie (favelas next to beautiful beaches) does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic piece and the particular image is one that resonates enough to justify its not-quite-truthful inclusion. At any rate, you use the footage you can. So they did't happen to have police violence footage for that particular neighbourhood. Does this mean not include it and just talk about it for maybe put in some cartoon animation so the audience in't ""duped""? Um, no. As for the hopeful ending, why not? Yes, Americans made it. Yes, Americans are optimistic bastards. But why send on a down note? Just because it's set in a foreign country and foreign films by and large send on a down note? Let foreigners portray the dismal outlook of life. Let us Americans think there may be a happy ending blooming in the future. There just may be one.",positive

25810,"James Aaron, a chubby factor living in Chicago, is a man that loves to heat things that are no good for him. That is made clear early on, as Dick, a friendly store clerk, advises him to stay away from junk food. Aaron, an factor working at Chicago's Second City, is a loving man with not much luck in the love department. He still lives with this mother, a spunky lady who encourages him to go out and enjoy himself. James has another job in a sort of gross ""Candid Camera"" where people are set up for unusual situations, such as surprising a mechanic and telling him the is the father of a daughter the never knew about. On the day the meets this friend Larry the gets to know about the casting call for the remake of ""Marty"", this favourite film. Being a large man, the clearly identifies with the character in the movie. In many ways, James' own life parallels that of the Paddy Chayefsky's creation in the picture. He wants to try for the part because the knows the can do justice to the role. One day the meets Beth at a soda fountain. James takes a liking to the woman, who one day invites him to go shopping with her for intimate apparel. He ends up having sex with her, thinking they have a nice thing going, but Beth has a another surprise coming when she tells him the reason they went to bed was because she had never done it with a fat man. After being disappointed, James stumbles into an attractive elementary school teacher who seems to share this love for jazz. At the send, we watch James fulfilling this long dream of starring in a theatrical production of ""Marty"" in a nursing home. Jeff Garlin, who is an affable character man, shows a talent for the type of comedy associated with this friend Larry David. Although both men differ in acting styles, this take on James Aaron is right on the money. As a director, the has done it before, although this is an original concept that the should pursue. One of the assets of the film are the people involved in the project. Sarah Silverman makes an impression for her take of Beth. Bonnie Hunt underlays her role of the school teacher to good results. Mina Kolb, is seen as this mother, a role she has played in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" with excellent results. Director Paul Mazursky is at hand also in a minor role. Joey Slotnick, Tim Kazurinsky, Richard Kind, David Pasquesi, Larry Neumann Jr, Gina Gershon, and the rest of the cast make valuable contributions. Jeff Garlin is a talented man whose next effort will be welcomed by this fans.",positive

It is tragic that Louis Kahn died alone in Grand Central Station when the was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children the never acknowledged as this own by this side.

29995,"New York, I Love You finally makes it to your shores, but its ten short stories on love somehow did't find reason enough to be released over Valentine's, probably due to the fact that this year's festival also falls on Lunar New Year, and with that comes the usual LNY blockbuster films from the likes of Jackie Chan (no, not The Spy Next Door) and local filmmaker Jack Neo who has traditionally released this latest film over that period to resounding success. So why fix a formula that has't been broken? Continuing in concept where Paris, Je T'aime had begun in spawning the City of Love Franchise (Shanghai will be next, so says the send of the closing credits there), the buzz there is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme, although someone probably forgot to tell Scarlett Johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules, and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else (well, it was shot in black and white), but there's hoping that it would make it to the DVD at least. Structurally, this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor, which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created. Here a little more leeway is given, where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together, and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes, in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers, though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise, though already seen in Paris. One of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one, is definitely the creative forces behind the stories, from writers, directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city, coming together for a concept film. And what more the star-studded cast too, with big names amongst the lesser known jones all cupping the ante through picture perfect performances, be it for the entire length of the short, for as a support to build upon. You can't deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables, from Irrfan Khan to Natalie Portman (who also had writing and directing duties), Rachel Bilson (looking quite like Bardot) to Spielberg's blue eye boy Shia LaBeouf, who surprisingly can act, and shows off more in this few minutes there than this entire filmography to date. Story wise, like any anthology, you'll find some which will automatically appeal to you, and with others that don't. Some are straightforward in nature, while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked. But these ten stories plus one (because Randall Balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks) somehow lacked the more ""anything goes"" spirit from its predecessor, with stories more rooted in reality, compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film (Elijah Wood's dalliance with a vampire anyone?), for even less adventurous with its narrative style (Christopher Doyle's, and Tom Tykwer's starring Natalie Portman). Here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe, with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment. Minor quibbles aside, I still enjoyed almost all the shorts there, contrary to what many others have felt about it. The short film format is still very much alive, and having them strung together into a feature under the City of Love banner works fine, and left me wondering which other cities are for have been included in its lineup. I am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence there. We surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a Singapore, I Love You, so there's crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road. Otherwise there's always the Sawasdee Bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules.",positive

31599,"If this film had been made in the fifty's for sixty's, critics and fans alike would have praised it. I myself, enjoyed the film from beginning to send. It's not a timeless piece, and has not aged well over the years, but it is enjoyable to watch, nonetheless. As for Mrs. Ritchie's acting in the film? Not the best on the planet -- but it adds to the film's unique slapstick comedy-aspirations, and showcases Madonna's (often underrated) sense of comedic timing. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an sex-convict who was framed for a crime she did't commit. Griffin Dunne plays the hapless future groom/puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occurs, thus creating the plot.

31984,"In Hong Kong, one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two, the editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and this wife, and the secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband simultaneously move to an old building. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like young-fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant nearby the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love. Later they realize that their mates are having an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a platonic level. 'In the Mood for Love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had not had a screenplay, and the factors were never sure about what they would be shooting. Later, the director edited this story based on the footage. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in the story until one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six, when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions such as who is the boy with Li-Zhen. My vote is weight. Title (Brazil): 'Amor À Flor ada Pele' ('Love on the Surface of the Skin')",positive

36485,"If derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing, then you're in for a rare treat. They don't really appeal to me, so I could't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale. It seems like something straight out of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, a different page when this would have gone straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by this work on documentaries, but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer. I don't think I was the only person in the cinema laughing. What I can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code forty-six and Red Road - Straightheads does't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best you can do?

44533,"I'm both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about Vietnam, and WERE NEVER THERE. This movie is about as true about the whole Vietnam war as the Rodney King beating is true about ALL police officers. Yes, bad things do (and did) happen, but in general the people there are just like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, they do not all do drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened far more infrequently than the ""hype"" would lead you believe. Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that show the Vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath, but are based as much in reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favour and learn the truth. Fact: the Viet Cong and NVA did far worse things to the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier in the US Armed Forces never did. Fact: the soldiers in World War II treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were WELCOMED when they came home. The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve your respect; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint, no one could have asked for more from your soldiers, and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of ""mostly true"" fiction is the way things really were there.",negative

46030,"I saw this movie five times and never get tired of it. This features traces of the ""giallo"" genre, but also with a vivid Italian countryside setting, where ignorance and superstition are deadlier than any serial killer. Featuring excellent location (reminiscent sometimes of Fellini, sometimes of the Taviani brothers), good characterisation and some of the finest genre factors (including the great Tomas Milian and Ida Lupino in an unforgettable role), this is NOT euro-trash, just a masterpiece that should be discovered generation after generation (It recently received great acclaim at the Paris Cinematheque at a double-feature tribute to Lucio Fulci)",positive

48456,"Cannon pulled off a real visual beauty of a medieval epic that appears fascinating (except for the dragon prop). Now just how did the long-gone studio known for Chuck Norris movies never come up with a complete black of knowledge in the first place? Case in point: the amateurish acting and horrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend is no cure for some lousy execution. They actually went on and made another cheap exploitationer featuring hundreds of lusty bimbos, just to make this look even better. For the two ""Barbarian Brothers"", they sure know how to make weird noises than becoming brave warriors so strong and bold enough to save their native land. This is the single greatest waste of potential I've seen from an ""expensive"" low-budget movie, and worse enough to let an axe strike through the gorgeous print without mercy. All of this followed an advertising campaign that sold T-shirts based on THE BARBARIANS! The movie alone makes a great souvenir!",negative

This is by far the sloppiest, implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work, you get the best food, and you get to lie around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I am far too young to have participated in WWII, but I think that there was more to it than that. There is the barest cat's whisker of a plot, and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day's leading facts.
