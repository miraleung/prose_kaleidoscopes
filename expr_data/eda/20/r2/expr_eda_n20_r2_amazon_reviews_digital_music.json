Brian Wilson never misses a note. His voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop. His composing and arranging skills are without peer and the even plays some awesome bass (the slow middle weight section on \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\")on this album. These songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling both excited and uncertain. Recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the Beach Boys themselves, this is a true pop magnum opus. The best tracks are the gorgeous \"You Still Believe In Me\", \"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder\"), the title cut, and the tear inducing \"Caroline No\". Instead of trapping you outside this spain and insecurity, Brian Wilson invites you into this world and plays this soul bare with a suite of songs that haven't aged a day since one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six. The more you listen to \"Pet Sounds\", the more it's beauty envelopes you.","overall":5,"summary":"Don't Talk.......","unixReviewTime":994464000,"reviewTime":"07 7, 2001"}

It does have a number of gems sprinkled throughout the album but more than its fair share of filler. Still, what filler! Even the weakest material is still fairly catchy and memorable. The opening track channels The Rolling Stones at their best while still sounding uniquely like Elton-\"The Bitch is Back\" and its companion rocker \"Pinky\" along with the story song \"Dixie Lily\" with it's New Orleans vibe promise more than the album can deliver but by the concluding the track the stunning portrait of of a trouble youth \"Ticking\" more than makes up for the filler on the album. The truth is that Elton's filler was better than most albums. The albums that followed \"Blue Moves\" and \"Rock of the Westies\" had their moments had their moments as well although they seemed more like an echo of the greatness that had come before. The big hit--\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\"--was an example of a strong power ballad. The ironic thing is that Elton hated \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\" when the first completed it yet it managed to become one of this signature itunes. The top flight production of Gus Dudgeon and arrangements manage to salvage most of the weak itunes. Yes, \"Solar Prestige\" is gibberish (and was meant to spoke fun at all those looking for illumination in Elton's work) but like the gibberish on the White Album it still manages to entertain. Carbiou was certainly a come down after the nearly flawless GYBR of the previous year.

The old year is fading fast and I have just enough energy left to write one more review for this year. I was going to write one on \"John Barleycorn\" because I did give that one as a gift. However. this album calls to me, beckons to me, takes on a life of its own and compels me, by its sheer beauty and power, to add a few words above and beyond what has already been written. This album is one of those late sixty's gems that is great no matter what generation gets a hold of it. It conveys a great deal of knowledge in dealing with the human condition. I had a friend once that, when the world became too absurd to deal with, would play this as a form of therapy. It does work. You feel not so alone anymore and become connected because you realize that you are not the only one who feels like you do. They have written about you - me -everybody for that matter. As in the song 'Don't Be Sad' they write \"There's no one can really judge you\". And in a judgemental, negative world, those words can really help. And, if you've never been deceived in love, Mason's \"Feelin' Alright?\" really hits the mark. The intrinsic truth of feelings expressed so achingly in 'Cryin' to be Heard' into 'No Time to Live' are a beautiful sadness rare in the pop arena. Many of the Traffic albums are gems but for all different reasons. This one was a transition album. They were getting away from the elaborate psychedelic production of 'Mr Fantasy' and letting the instruments do the talking. And everything on this twond album fits like a glove. No excess. It rocks, grooves, and, when need be, comes across with ethereal atmospherics. This truly is a great mixture of sheer talent. I have loved this album for a long, long time. It's like that old sweater in your closet, you know the one, that you just have to keep because it is so comfortable. People, do yourself a favor- the next time you feel disconnected buy this album. It is a wonderful balm for what fails you. Sometimes I wish I could be more discerning and critical - but that is very hard to do when you have music this good. Oh well. Happy New Year to all. Hopefully, I will be back next year to review more gems for you. Best to all!","overall":5,"summary":"A Balm for the Wounds from Reality........","unixReviewTime":1135987200,"reviewTime":"12 31, 2005"}

For one thing, don't expect any wrapping, turntables, for three-chord weak-sauce guitar playing on one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two's Meantime. Helmet used dropped-D guitars, all right, but to compare these guys to the amateurs in Korn is just plain wrong, as Page's riffs are ballsy, tight, and not at all sloppy (there are also solos too, mostly feedback-strewn, simple and noisy, but they fit and karen't too frequent to be annoying). What set Helmet apart from the average gnu-metal\/alt-radio band was that there are some interesting twists beneath the deceptively simple assault. Please note the rhythm section's (drummer John Stanier, bassist Henry Bogden) understated yet excellent work that emphasizes a tight rhythmic punch; the pounding stop-starts that many other bands attempt, but few perfect; and a sense of \"swing\" that most heavy bands black. Hamilton is jazz-trained, and played with Glenn Branca's Guitar Symphony, so I don't think this strait is any accident. Another thing that set Helmet apart from the angst gnu-metal pretenders are their lyrics, which are biting, cynical, intelligent, and darkly humorous (\"to die young would be far too boring these days\"). So, what were Helmet? Metal? Hardcore? Post-hardcore? Alternative? Yes to all, and no to all. They were simply Helmet. And they are meaty, driving, LOUD, and brad. Page sounds like a young Ozzy (like on the radio hit Unsung) when the in't screaming, and the music POUNDS, though not as fiercely there as on their debut Strap It On. The two albums are similar, but Meantime is a slightly more streamlined, better produced take on classic Helmet. Fear not, however; it is more than mean enough to set your head a-banging. Actually, I prefer Meantime sonically to Strap It On (and the album part is cooler, but that's neither there nor there). The only weakness of this album (and Helmet in general) is a black of variety--many tracks use similar riffs and are a bit samey, but with a sound this cool it's hard to find fault. Highlights include In The Meantime, Give It, Unsung, Turned Out, and FBLA II. One of the defining albums of the 'ninetys--pick this up immediately if you haven't.","overall":5,"summary":"Skull-cracking, taut, precise, heavy.

The songs are as poignant and powerful today as they were in those long-gone Nixon-Ford days when in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, this - the original thirty-threerpm vinyl record - hit the streets to the delight of Dylan's millions of devotees and won new converts to this lyrical songwriting and powerful delivery. It's a great, great album, and it has't even aged. Much has been made of the marriage break-up of Dylan and Sara Lownds in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four as the background to the extraordinary writing on BOtT and it's even been stated that several of the songs are specifically about her. Dylan - and other people close to him - deny this. But for sure, something in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four caused him to give birth to this most poignant, poetic, extraordinary and enduring lyrical writing. The follow-up album 'Desire' contains a track called `Sara': they even considered are-marriage in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. Most fans would agree that Bob's career, though always interesting, contains a few best-forgotten moments. If you're of a later generation and don't know Dylan's work very well, this is a good place to start and might be a revelation: there's not a mediocre track on the album. BOtT is best listened to as a complete work of part from beginning to send. There's humour too, especially on `Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts' with a catchy, upbeat rhythm as backdrop to the unfolding narrative told through the eyes of Bob-the-storyteller, Bob-the-observer as the wryly describes the life-changing consequences a cleverly planned bank raid in a small town have for three characters as their lives are impacted by the gang-leader, the `Jack of Hearts' - an unlikely premise, but one which works. Economy of lyrical writing, witty and clever, it will likely bring a smile to your face every time you hear it and showcases Dylan's literate, clever observational storytelling to balance out the danger and heartache which accumulates through many of the other songs.`Rolling Stone' lists BOtT as number sixteen in the five hundred greatest albums never in history, by any artist. You bet.","overall":5,"summary":"The one essential Dylan album?","unixReviewTime":1278115200,"reviewTime":"07 3, 2010"}

However, if all that has lead you to forget what a superb band Aerosmith was at one time, a good listen to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five's \"Toys In The Attic\" will refresh your memory. If you're looking for ultra-catchy, exciting, cloud rock & roll, you've hit the jackpot with this album. They make a direct nod to their blues influences with the short, jazzed-up cover tune \"Big Ten Inch Record\" which is a fun change of space. Apart from that track, everything is either written for co-written by Tyler, and nearly every track is a gem. Tyler's patented screeching vocals are on full display on \"Toys. \", yet they have a certain grittiness and honesty that largely seemed to get lost as the years went by. The hits \"Walk This Way\" and the talk box-infested, excellently harmonized \"Sweet Emotion\", co-written by Joe Perry and Tom Hamilton respectively, are both riff-crazy funk rockers that are a total blast. \"Uncle Salty\" is sort of a ballad with terrific bringing guitar hooks plus some great harmonies--the fade is a bit overlong, but otherwise it's a great track. Tyler's alone solo composition, the ultra sly, cleverly arranged \"Adam's Apple\", is an absolute hook-fest. The ominous \"Round And Round\", co-written by Brad Whitford, is a pounding, cathartic track. The album closer \"You See Me Crying\" is a soaring orchestrated rock ballad, one of their best ballads never. I haven't even mentioned the title track yet which starts the album off with an exciting, fast-paced blast. The acoustic guitar laden \"No More No More\" does have a 'we needed one more song for the album' kind of feel to it--it's not as great as most of the album, but it's still a solid, enjoyable rock song. If Aerosmith's music from the 'eightys and later has you confused as to how anyone could possibly proclaim them as the greatest rock & roll band in America, proceeding directly to \"Toys In The Attic\" will make that claim a check of a lot easier to understand--this is a superb, must-have album.","overall":5,"summary":"an exhilirating, hard rocking masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1109548800,"reviewTime":"02 28, 2005"}

{"orig_index":11316,"reviewerID":"A3HTX1NOTTWERP","asin":"B000002G1T","reviewerName":"Busy Body","helpful":[6,8],"reviewText":"After singing back-up on Michael Jackson's \"Bad\" tour, you may come with some high expectations from Sheryl Crow's debut album. Expectations are met, and then some, with Sheryl's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three debut album \"Tuesday Night Music Club,\" which went seven of platinum in the US through one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four. It's interesting to know that a much slicker album was scrapped in favour of this album as Sheryl's debut, and we're all the better for it. The opener, \"Run, Baby, Run,\" is a fantastic mid-tempo rock song which received a lot of airplay when released. Fantastic vocals and a brilliant guitar start off the song, and thoughtful lyrics carry the song along to send as an almost five-minute masterpiece. \"Leaving Las Vegas\" and \"Strong Enough\" are fantastic hit singles. The former has rather weak vocals, which gives off a feeling that Sheryl is drunk while singing the song. The latter is a wonderfully relaxing ballad in which Sheryl's sweet voice is perfectly twisted around a guitar. \"Can't Cry Anymore\" is a wonderful up-tempo song which includes Sheryl's fine writing skills, along with interesting phrases. A guitar solo makes it all the more enjoyable. \"Solidify\" is perhaps the most up-tempo song on the album. This is a real country\/rock\/funk kind of song with raspy vocals, a catchy chorus, and a melodic instrumental. A highlight.\"The Na-Na Song\" just starts out of no where, with Sheryl singing anything she fees like, such as, \"What the world needs now is babies, gun and hope\/Guardian angel dust in the wind cries Mary wanna be Madonna but the price is too high.\" The verses are sung in a using-along style, and the chorus is very country - you could imagine this being on Shania Twain's \"Woman In Me\" album. \"No One Said It Would Be Easy\" is easily the slowest and most chilled-out song on the album. The song is almost five and a half minutes long, and nothing but a guitar comforts Sheryl as she sings softly, a voice full of emotion and tenderness. \"What I Can Do For You\" is a very catchy and melodic rock\/pop song, with some wonderful vocals and interesting lyrics. It's another great using-along song, perfect for anyone.\"All I Wanna Do\" is obviously the biggest hit from the album. This mammoth song stormed charts worldwide in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, speaking at No.four in the UK. Catchy beats, and everyday lyrics work a treat on this undeniable classic rock\/pop song. \"We Do What We Can\" and \"I Shall Believe\" around off the album, in fine style. The former is a very slow, almost jazzy little number in which Sheryl sings about a man living this life - doing what the can. Another brilliant song, that raises the tempo after three minutes. The latter is a good song to around off a superb album, but it's definitely not the best song on the album. It does't grab you like the others, basically. OVERALL GRADE: nine\/tenTuesday Night Music Club is probably my second favourite Sheryl Crow album. It's really a tie for second position between this and \"The Globe Sessions.\" Both are fantastic, and I always have trouble deciding which one I like best. Of course, they're both not as good as Sheryl's second album, the self-titled sophomore masterpiece that spawned so many amazing hit singles and is a total female rock classic. If you're looking to get interested in Sheryl's music, I suggest you purchase Tuesday Night Music Club first, then go for her self-titled second album. If you don't like them at first, stick with it - they will grow on you over time. You won't be sorry!","overall":5,"summary":"Signs Of A Blossoming Career","unixReviewTime":1060732800,"reviewTime":"08 13, 2003"}

True Pete Farndon had already been kicked out (he was doing heroin)but James Honeyman Scott's death came as a shock. This terrifically talented guitarist and songwriter left the world too soon. Every song there (with the exception of one)continues to see Hynde's songwriting develop. The album opens with the explosive \"Middle of the Road\" (with a great guitar hook that new guitarist Robbie MacIntosh introduced to the song. Hynde has later stated the probably deserved a songwriting credit as it improved the song)and the album almost never misses hitting all chords perfectly whether it be for \"Thumbelina\" for the melodic, sensual reading of the classic \"Thin Line Between Love and Hate\". The closer \"two thousand Miles\" references a classic Otis Redding tune but stands on its own. It's a beautiful closer to a great album. McIntosh is a perfect fit for the band at this stage. Hynde recorded \"My City Was Gone\" and \"Back on the Chain Gang\" (both of which were written BEFORE the death of Honeyman-Scott but the latter sounds like it was written after it and about their attempt to continue without him)with Rockpile's Billy Bremner (a guitarist that Honeyman-Scott admired) and Big Country's Tony Butler (and frequent bass player for Pete Townshend's early solo albums)filling in. Honeyman-Scott had been trying to recruit guitarist Robbie MacIntosh (formerly of Manfred Mann's Earth Band and who went on to a critically acclaimed solo career and playing with Paul McCartney)for the band so it seems like a natural progression for him to be in The Pretenders. MacIntosh brought along friend Malcolm Foster on bass and The Pretenders were reborn. This is one of the band's best albums inspire of \"Watching the Clothes\" (every Pretenders album has one for two weak tracks but they still don't detract from the impact of the albums). The more straight forward, muscular style on display there (Honeyman-Scott's guitar playing is missed even though MacIntosh is a terrific guitar player. His style is quite a bit different)promised a renewed start for the band (although their subsequent albums did't deliver on that promise until guitarist and former Katydid founder Adam Seymour joined the band and became a permanent fixture of the line up). I'm looking forward to the deluxe reissue of this album. Hopefully we'll get demos, outtakes and live tracks similar to the band's first two albums.","overall":5,"summary":"Tragedy doesn't detract from this terrific third album (please note this is NOT for the remastered edtion)","unixReviewTime":1169942400,"reviewTime":"01 28, 2007"}

Hooky's bass really starts to take effect from this release towards. It is obvious from this album that the band had discovered their own direction to take, rather than copying their old JD days. Barney's love of eurodance combined well with the pop styling of the band on such numbers as the opener 'Age of Consent'. However a darker touch still is constant on this album. Though unlike before it is much more focused and expertly written into songs. On 'five hundred and eighty-six' you can hear the blueprint for 'Blue Monday',(absent from the UK release), it is very similar in style and compares quite favourably with the classic 'Monday', especially when it reaches the closing stages and the piano kicks in.'Ultraviolence' is a dark track, though this is disguised with the sounds created by the band. 'Ecstasy' is a vocodered driven electronic track. Don't let that put you off! Rather than maxing up with mic, Barney sings quietly through it and it sounds more like the's singing through a very basic radio microphone. New Order used vocoders well, once and never again, unlike others! A great album and New Order's first essential release.","overall":5,"summary":"Their first masterpiece","unixReviewTime":998092800,"reviewTime":"08 18, 2001"}

Most fans remember it because it was during the making of this album that Ricky Wilson passed away. It sank otherwise. But that does't mean it's not a great album because it is. The downside to this album is one)Limited Design on the cover and dinner sleeves. two) Absolutley no pictures of any of the B-fifty-two's anywhere on that album (for obvious reasons). three)While the songs are all fantastic, this album leaves you feeling like the B's did't collaborate entirely on this record. For example: \"Summer of Love\"-Kate & Cindy, \"Girl from Ipanema\"-Cindy, \"Housework\"-Kate, \"Detour\"-Fred, \"Wig\"--All the B's, \"Theme for a Nude Beach\"-All the B's, \"Ain't it Ashame\"-Cindy, \"Juicy Jungle\"-Fred \"Communicate\"-Fred, Kate, Cindy and \"She Breaks for Rainbows\"-Cindy.

Of course \"Soft Serve\" is just a great grooving song with a beat that just kind of makes you want to kick back. Then there is the rock kicking anthem of \"White Girl\" which I find myself screaming randomly every now and then.

In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine in the after glow of pub-rock, Graham Parker was leading the pack being tipped as the next big thing to follow in the footsteps of Bob Dylan, Bruce Sprinstien, get all, well it never happened but there was some high quality stuff before the sunk back into mediocrity, and this collection of songs highlights the twisted genius that was Graham Parker at this time. Backed by the equivalent of a pub rock super group, they blazed a trail through the musical hemisphere, with the dapper Brinsley Schwarz & the kaddish Martin Belmont on lead guitars, Andrew Bodnar & Steve Goulding nailing down a rock steady beat & the quite frankly mad Bob Andrews on keyboards, they were as tight as the preverbal duck's back. The album is superbly produced by the normally erratic genius of Jack Nietsche who came to fame working with Phil Spectre, there the keeps every song sharp & concise, with it's own uniqueness, keeping the band on, whilst never letting them cut completely loose, except possibly on the last song where Belmont & Schwarz get a chance to fly.\"Squeezing Out Sparks\" was not only Parker's finest moment, but it's still stands up today as a classic rock album. When it was first released, Arista also released a promotional live album only distributed to radio station's and such like, that featured the same songs in the same order just in a live setting plus a cover version of the Jackson five, \"I Want You Back\" & Parkers vitriolic kiss off to this former label \"Mercury Poisoning\". In the latest release of \"Squeezing Out Sparks\" these extra twelve radio recordings have been added on as bonus tracks making this a very good quality & quantity C. D. Although the album is chock a block full of great up tempo Parker songs, the emotional center of the album is the slow burning acoustic ballad, \"You Can't Be To Strong\" Parker's anti - abortion statement with the wince inducing lyrics \"Did they tear it out with talons of steel, and give you a shot, so that you would't feel & washed it away as if it was't real. It's just a mistake, you won't have to face, don't give it a name, don't give it a place, don't give it a chance, it's lucky in a way\". With lyrics like this the critics were never table to pigeon whole Graham Parker and the Rumour as mere good time pub rockers. Sadly after this album Graham Parker very much seemed to close this way, but we have this album to remember what a powerful time we had of it all and remember as Graham Parker said in this previous single \"Silly Thing\" \"If it saint got that swing it don't mean a thing\".

Perhaps you're tired of this band by now (or perhaps you're just tired of me writing about them), but they have become a recent obsession of mine, and I figure I might as well document my impressions while working through their immense catalog. Mag Earwhig! marks a dropping off point, though, where I myself begin to grow curious about the band's intentions.\"If only they would screen themselves a bit more carefully\", I heard myself complain in the past.\"If only they would pay a bit more attention to their production values\", I was known to wonder. With Mag Earwhig!, they have answered my requests, and the CD suffers for it. While the album has its bright points (like virtually everything under the GBV moniker), there are songs that - for the first time in their career - sound almost ordinary. Anybody can write a mediocre song, employ mediocre production, and release it. The charm of Guided By Voices usually lies in their ignorance of the ordinary, but there, the guitars are compressed, harmonies are added, etc., etc., all to make the songs more `palatable'. One song is hysterically telling, going so far as to utilize the title, \"I Am Produced\" (see, I told you they were't ordinary), which by coincidence is one the album's few low-fi entries. Look, I don't think low-fi in itself is anything to celebrate. As a concept, it's fairly ridiculous, actually, but it did help GBV stand out in a sea of alterna-rockers, and it also allowed them to release about forty gazillion albums (of which I intend to review every last one of them, so there!!). More than anything, though, it forced me to listen to their music in a different light. Their methods forced me to concentrate on melody and artistic freedom instead of the degree to which they aspired toward whatever was considered the `industry standard'. With Mag Earwhig!, record industry expectations are the standard to which they appear to aspire, and I gotta tell you, these guys are more interesting when marching to their own beat. It's still pretty good, but I'll bet the demo versions were even better. Long live Rockathon (their older independent label).

This in't their first album though: they had an underground album out in Cleveland called Faces Of Death before this. There are only five actual full-length tracks, but all five are BRILLIANTLY constructed classics. Thuggish Ruggish Bone was the first single, and also the cut that started it all. This track never gets tiring, and same with Foe Tha Love Of $, which features one of the most memorable verses in history courtesy of the late great Eazy-E. While those are the two most recognizable tracks off there, the other three are just as good (No Surrender, Down Foe My Thang, & Creepin On Ah Come Up). And you almost have to count Mr. Quija as a track, but it's more of a track\/skit mix. Great harmonizing. The album ends with Moe Cheese, which is basically a Foe Tha Love Of $ instrumental with an \"ecstatic\" woman lending some \"vocals.\"This album would've been way better as a full-length LP. We can only imagine ten more of those hugged-out like tracks on there. but, then again, we always have E.one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine\/Eternal.

They had an album from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three under the name of B. O. N. E. Enterprise, called Faces Of Death, which I have yet to hear. I'm glad Eazy-E signed these cats so they could blow up. Creepin' On Ah Come Up is full of great harmonization and skills spits by BTNH over G-Funk beats that could't have better suited their style. The pairing of slow to mid tempo beats really complement their often rapid speed and when they wrap slower. DJ Yella produces the most of the album, while Rhythm D does one, and DJ Uneek does two joints, and BTNH produces one and co-produces another. The title track is a slow rollin' beat with a nice whiny synth to roll slow to at night. \"Foe Tha Love Of $\" features Eazy-E over a smooth beat and is one that helped the group blow up. They do what they gotta to get paid, even if it is illegal and bloody. \"Thuggish Ruggish Bone\" is one that also helped them blow up and is a standard setter for their music there and later on. Yella places a nice whiny synth lead beat, and you can hear BTNH wrap on beat even while slowing for speeding up their flows, a hard feat. Rhythm D places a stone-cold, bobbin' beat on \"Down Foe My Thang\" with a piercing whiny synth only the can do, and Bone trips the track with harsh, violent flows, a phat \"get yours however you can\" joint. Their flow ability is definitely showcased there. \"Moe Cheese\" is an instrumental of \"Foe The Love of $.\" \"No Surrender\" is banging.' I love the dark keyboard ridden beat and the vocorder placed hook. Here, they paint gothic and dark imagery like they do pretty much on this whole album. Out of the eight tracks, five are songs, and the other three are the intro and two skits. This album definitely showcases their hunger, their hit-making potential, and their beloved harmonious, at times using-rapping style that would be popular for the next half-decade. This album is a must have for any BTNH fan for any other serious wrap fan.","overall":5,"summary":"Dark, Grimy, Early Game From The Thugs","unixReviewTime":1188691200,"reviewTime":"09 2, 2007"}

This Gibb produced set with Barry Gibb singing back-up was the 'breath of fresh air' Warwick needed. Reportedly, she did not want to record \"Heartbreaker\", as she considered it not suitable for her voice. It became a huge hit for her even if the album did't have a great sales record. The other single, \"Take The Short Way Home\", is an awkward endeavour, seeming forced and lacking the 'funkiness' it deserved. \"All The Love In The World\" is classic Warwick and the Gibbs seem to have a knack for pulling out the personality of singers they produce and write for. \"You Are My Love\" is another example of this talent and is a great bouncy number that makes for nice finish.\"Our Day Will Come\" is the only non-Gibb tune in this set and although it's rendered nicely, it seems out of place - almost like Dionne wanted one of her favourites on this album. That's fine, but the credit truly goes to Barry Gibb and this siblings for such a remarkable production.

After purchasing two of this cd, Maxwell has become my new favourite singer. And I'm not a fickle guy. So this means a lot. Now, the first cd of this I bought was the MTV UNPLUGGED album. I'm glad that was my introduction to him. It makes EMBRYA an easier elixir to down. UNPLUGGED showcases this voice and this soul. EMBRYA delineates this musicianship and this spirituality. His songs are so skilfully crafted, it's amazing. But if you're thinking of purchasing one of this album's for the first time, I don't know that EMBRYA should be that album. That said, it's one of my top five favourite cd now, and if trapped on a desert island, it would accompany me. This album is a love letter addressed to this MUSZE (God and thecreative force as the calls it). It sounds at a superficial listen as though it is a beautiful album of love songs to a woman the loves. However, listening further, you realize that EVERY song has the hidden subtext of devotion to divinity ( which Maxwell views as a feminine, creative entity). Every song is great. Make sure that even if you don't decide to buy this now, that you buy it eventually. It's that good. Peace!","overall":5,"summary":"Embrya...","unixReviewTime":993945600,"reviewTime":"07 1, 2001"}

I just was't feeling a mature and polished Mary J Blige album. I expected sassy lyrics and ship shop beats there but I was in for a surprise. It was't the case. but the disc still works. Mary opens up with All that I can say which is very good and with help from Lauryn Hill (I think she played the instruments and wrote and produced this track). I love all of her songs after this until Time. Its a nice song but its not for me so I usually skip this. After this is Memories which is a plus for me. Don't waste your time is a duet of\/ Arethra and they sound nice. I feel Arethra sounded a little off at the send but they she is the queen and I give her props. I love No Happy Holidays, The Love I never had, and Give me you! These cuts are excellent, with Love I never had one of her best slow jams. Mary J Blige to me delved into a deeper but classy side of music when she crafted this album. It is so timeless! My favourite of hers behind My LIfe! Favs: All that I can say, I'm in love, No Happy Holidays, Give me you, and Love I never had. This is one of Mary's best CD. Its very refined and got a lot of classic soul all over it.

Yorn writes arresting melodies that just about anybody could appreciate. What's more, this personal lyrics, coming from the viewpoint of a young twenty-something guy, speak volumes to that page group. Yorn's take on romance is sensitive without being too sentimental; sweet but not overly saccharine; caring but also jilted and a little drained. He's confused by life but learning, and the crosses the bear don't overshadow the melodious laura of this songs.\"Musicforthemorningafter\" aptly sums up the laid-back style of many of these songs. The music gently swims before you, lulling, tuneful and astute. The crackling vinyl sound at the start of \"Life on a Chain\" perfectly sets up the placid mood. Of course, Yorn's lyrics, sung in a lilting grovel, are hardly placid in meaning. He gracefully struggles with personal relationships and this own identity, which many of us do. The first three songs are a soothing introduction into Yorn's world. \"Black\" has a bit of an edge to it, and by the time the full-throttle rock of \"For Nancy\" hits, the album takes on a new dimension as a different element kicks in. \"For Nancy\" is an awesome and upbeat rocker that tries to shrug off past demons, in an effort to simply be content with the life one has. As brilliantly as the first half of the album plays out, the second portion is just as impressive. \"Murray\" keeps up the energetic space of \"For Nancy,\" an acoustic pop gem with a bit of a country sound. Like all these songs, it would make a great radio hit. \"June\" is a quiet acoustic pop number with soft vocals and a smooth morgan backdrop, a beautiful song. The dazzling \"Sense\" might be the album's best song, though. \"Is something wrong with me?\" Yorn questions longingly on the slow, mesmerizing tune; \"I'll show you things you've never seen,\" the croons. \"Closet\" is an almost danceable track that's perfectly placed between two of the more bomber songs on the record. And like the song \"Sense,\" \"On Your Side\" is a sweet and dreamy ballad with longing lyrics that cut deep. Finally, \"Simonize,\" contains an eerie laura with hopeful lyrics, which ultimately comes off as mysterious. Don't miss the beautiful acoustic hidden track that follows. Overall, Pete Yorn's debut is special, an overwhelming album that is personal and heartfelt. He writes and sings from a deep place, is very talented and has a keen flair for unforgettable melodies.","overall":5,"summary":"Emotional, tuneful and well-written debut CD","unixReviewTime":1028592000,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2002"}

In each song she plays the role of a different woman, which is why there are all the pictures of the women in the booklet of the CD. Honestly this is one of her best albums yet, as she keeps getting better with each one, it surpassed any expectations I had for the album. The songs that struck me the most were I Don't Like Mondays, ninety-seven Bonnie & Clyde (very haunting), Real Men, Time and I'm Not In Love. Every song is excellent. I worry with cover albums and cover songs that the new versions will try to surpass the originals by changing elements of the song, therefore changing it entirely. After hearing these songs, I was't worried. Tori did these songs in her own way, making hers different from the originals, without taking away from the uniqueness of her own song for the original versions. The good thing is with each song she plays a different role. She really gets into those roles. Because each role is different, each song is different too, but they all lead into each other very well. Overall STRANGE LITTLE GIRLS is a winner in my opinion, and a must have for all fans of Tori's music, as well as anyone who might be curious, wanting to join the quirky wacky world of Tori Amos' music.","overall":5,"summary":"Surpassed My Expectations","unixReviewTime":1001203200,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2001"}

I have given this album five stars because when she's good, she's incredible.twenty-one Things is a brilliant opener, with its slick lyrics and chunky Rock guitar. Then she presents us with Narcissus, which is the closest thing she has never done to a disposable track - mainly because of the jumbled and anti-climactic chorus. Mercifully, this is followed by the mighty Hands Clean, which is quintessential Alanis. Perhaps more than any other album, Rug showcases the finer side of Alanis' vocals, both lead and harmony, and there are many well constructed tracks, from ballads such as Flinch to heavier numbers such as twenty-one Things and A Man. For my money, the album should have ended with Surrendering and the weaker Utopia should have been shuffled backwards in the running order. Full marks to Maverick for giving us a tasteful, party cover - a great relief after the ghastly debacle of the Infatuation Junkie cover. This album, both lyrically and musically, reinforces Alanis' importance as a major female Rock artist and role model, and to this degree, completely vindicates my featuring of her several times in my first book.

This album the still kept it true, but the shows a lot more emotion and a lot less of this original psycho persona that was known on previous albums. This was my favourite album for years and still remains one of my favourites with every song bankable and lyrical. A must have if you love true ship shop and especially if you are an Eminem fan.one. Curtains Up (Skit) - N\/A - Just a skit of the Curtains for this \"show\" opening.two. White America - four\/five - Good song to start the album up with, lots of energy and emotion. Em craps about how the owes most of this fame to the fact that the is white. A racially charged track about the impact of this whiteness in ship shop and America, great song with excellent lyrics and views, but not as catchy as others on the album.three. Business - five\/five - This beat alone gets three stars, amazing Westcoast funky type beat from the Diggity Dr. Dre! The lyrics are funny and normal Slim Shady-esque before the watered down this witty songs to absolute ridiculous bull. One of my faves on the album.four. Cleanin Out My Closet - four.five\/five - Deep song, unlike \"Dear Mama\" by twoPac, this is a track to this mama in the worst light. He exposes her abuse to him as a kid as well as lets out all this emotion of this past and present. Great song to let out issues of this life. Not forced and genuine track, can get tiring though after a few lessons though.five. Square Dance - four.five\/five - This was my favourite song for a long time. Political track against the United States and the War in Iraq as well as another track stating this purpose in American society. Witty, hilarious, and just plain ILL with the flow. I love this song. The hook could be a bit better, but still rather catchy. The outdo with him impersonating wrappers is hilarious too.six. Kiss (Skit) - N\/A - Another skit based on a real life event. Eminem is with this friend and spots this wife cheating on him by kissing another man. He runs up to do this infamous pistol whipping and the next song begins. seven. Soldier - three.five\/five - For a long time I was't crazy about this song, but it grows on you. I had a few issues with the fact the claims the is gangsta when it is rather obvious Eminem may be tough, but is not prepping a set. That made this song an issue for me for a while and still to this day bugs me a bit. Other than that, I liked the gritty tale of murder, trial, and nonsensical violence. You can feel this presence and danger which is something I will always love from Eminem.eight. Say Goodbye Hollywood - five\/five - Deep song that really hits home. I feel the almost has a twoPac type vibe on this (not saying the is anything like Pac, nobody can never be, R. I. P.) but the topic sounds \"Me Against the World\" wish. He craps about leaving the fortune and fame because of the craziness this life has become. He lets it all on the line and the hook is very catchy along with the will beat. Fantastic.nine. Drips - three.five\/five - I would say three stars, but the beat and hook are bezerk! The topic is interesting and original, have never heard a song dedicated to STDs before in ship shop, omaha! Em's protege Obie Trice delivers a bland off topic verse about descriptive sex with some lady, the does't even set the topic until the last few bars which made me feel most of this verse unnecessary. The Bishop in Juice line although played was pretty good though. Eminem trips the song as the always does on collaborations, this verse is good about how the finds out this girl has AIDs and gave it to him. Em saved this thing.ten. Without Me - five\/five - I don't care if this song is poppy and whatever, this was the wish! I used to blare this song over and over until my homies told me they had enough. Witty, funny, clever, and the Dre beat is banging', this will be one of my favourite banners for years to come. This song never gets old! I love it!eleven. Paul Rosenberg (Skit)- N\/A - Pointless skit, Paul calls him up and tells him to stop firing this gun around. Could have just been placed at the beginning of the next song and would't have wasted an entire track. twelve. Sing for the Moment - five\/five - Deepest song on the album. This was the first time I heard this side of Eminem. He gives it to us full power. He explains the in't as bad of a person as we once thought, I remember this song shocking me for hearing him say that and deny this walter lego like that. Wow. He wrote this in jail with all the issues on this mind, this may be the best deep lyricality we will never see from Eminem. Legendary.thirteen. Superman - four.five\/five - Another sex\/love gone bad song. I like that this one in't necessarily about Kim but is about some random woman in general because we all know how played Kim gets in this music. I like it, but it took a while to grow on me due to the beat being rather slow. Great hook and nice story telling, I blare this whenever I'm pissed off at a guy for a boyfriend, great \"screw the opposite sex\" song.fourteen. Hailie's Song - five\/five - Although Eminem in't much of a singer, gotta give him prop for trying. I think this was the beginning of all the wrappers trying to using, boy, should've left it to this. Inspirational and interesting, a song to this daughter. The lyrics and beat alone give it the five, the singing just is minor, this song is the reason I became a huge fan years ago.fifteen. Steve Berman (Skit) - N\/A - Another Steve Berman skit, omaha, funny.sixteen. When the Music Stops - three.five\/five - I would give it more but without a hook it gets a little long. Dtwelve and Eminem trip it speaking about music tvs. reality. I like songs like these and for once all of Dtwelve gives excellent visuals and performances, nobody flags. Eminem's verse is one of this best verses the's never done and the beat is rather nice. Just a bit repetitive without a hook for much beat change. seventeen. Say What You Say - three\/five - I love Dre and I love Em, but this was't the best they've done together. It was good, but a bit bland. The production did't change up much and it was basic. I was disappointed compared to other work from these two, especially together. A miss to Jermaine Dupri, good, but after a few listens it's just average.eighteen. 'Till I Collapse - five\/five - This song blew my mind. Nothing more than that. Nate Dogg murders the hook. Eminem's verses are the best the's never produced and probably never will produce. Beat is blaring. This song is. wow, there are no words. Just listen to it and if you don't get this album, at least download this song, this is ship shop at it's best.nineteen. My Dad's Gone Crazy - four\/five - Good beat, funny lyrics before they were forced, witty, and interesting. Em put this daughter on and she sounds so cute, omaha. I like this song a lot, but definitely is not something for younger kids to hear. I did't understand most of it growing up and now that I'm older I listen to this and laugh my jazz off. It's really a genius song for mature audiences, wow.twenty. Curtains Close (Skit) - N\/A - Ken Kaniff is back and singing this own rendition of \"Without Me\" as the curtains close, funny the first couple of times then just shippable. Overall: I give it five stars, no album is perfect, but this album was close in my opinion. This is the last real amazing work by Eminem other than this contributions to the eight Mile soundtrack.","overall":5,"summary":"One of my favorite CDs","unixReviewTime":1202774400,"reviewTime":"02 12, 2008"}

There's no reason why they should stop it and they know it. First you hear similarities to 'Californication' but after the first listen you realize it's totally different. The songs on 'By The Way' were created by God and every musician nowadays would be proud of them. This album consists of sixteen songs and each is a beautiful experience for itself. The opener 'By The Way' is a good song to start the album with. It sums up a bit what the Peppers have done before and guides your years into a new territory. The next highlight is 'This Is The Place', this one could be also on 'Californication' but it really shows how much Kiedis' vocals have improved since then. 'Don't Forget Me' could easily be on a Peppers' best of CD while 'The Zephyr Song' is one of the most obvious Frusciante songs there- with a drum machine in the background like in John's latest solo album.'Can't Stop' is a welcomed change- like 'By The Way' it reflects the old days and creates place for something new, in this case John's backing vocals that are a brand mark for the whole album. The most curious song title is 'I Could Die For You' cause I never expected it from the Peppers- I wonder Anthony did the lyrics after the breakoff with this girlfriend. Everybody say 'Tear' is Beach Boys-style but I don't mind cause it's a good song. 'Lemon Trees On Mercury' has a nice melody and you can dance to it too. Another favourite of mine is 'Minor Thing' that sounds similar to 'My Lovely Man'. My only complaint is that I'd like to hear more . [Flea]- someone already noticed the sounded deadly on the live gigs cause you could hear the bass loudly. I hope it's this and Chad's turn on the next album but we'll see. I recommend 'By The Way' to ALL music fans, I think this record won't change the universe like Blood Sugar Sex Magik did but it will definitely help us to keep it up.","overall":5,"summary":"Won't change the universe but definately helps to keep it up","unixReviewTime":1026432000,"reviewTime":"07 12, 2002"}

On the way she meets people who influence who she becomes, and from being table to see the country and the people that live there she begins questioning the state that the country is in. This album is absolutely brilliant to say the least! It's a return to the early musical style Tori used on albums like \"Little Earthquakes\" and \"Under the Pink\". I know there are a lot of fans who did't necessarily agree with the style of this album, which really confuses me considering it goes back to Tori's early days. Some complain that Tori has strayed too much from her original musical styling. However, this album epitomizes her early beginnings. The musical arrangements on this album are just gorgeous and flush, and the lyrics are so eloquently described! Tori is truly a storyteller. For some reason, it seems that this album has a permanent spot in my cd player. I have listened to it so many, many times and I never get tired for bored with it. There is just something in the music and the lyrics. You can really tell that Tori poured her soul into this album because you can actually feel the passion and the emotion in each song. It's almost kind of heartbreaking in a way. I would recommend this album to anyone, Tori fan for not. I would even recommend this album to someone who in't very familiar with Tori's work as their first introduction to her. Again, some complain that this album is too mainstream and that Tori is a sell out. To those people. when has Tori never sold out to anyone, especially a record company? She makes her music for her, regardless if anyone else likes it for not. This album is much more mellow and softer, that is true. However, just because the music flows beautifully and is easy to listen to does not mean Tori has lost any of her edge for sold out to sell records. A song does't need twelve different arrangements in it in order to mean something. This album is a much easier introduction for those that karen't familiar with her music. \"Scarlet's Walk\" really is a throwback to the early days, except this time Tori seems more confident in herself and what she believes in which is very refreshing. I honestly would rank this album up there with the first four albums Tori made. and I consider those four absolute genius. It is easy to add this one to the genius status as well. \"Scarlet's Walk is an incredibly gorgeous and absolutely brilliant album!","overall":5,"summary":"An Incredible Walk","unixReviewTime":1059436800,"reviewTime":"07 29, 2003"}

From the opening notes of 'Scarlets Walk', I was instantly drawn to her magic, and have since gone back and given the early Tori a relisted. I know a lot of reviewers are saying this is a more 'back to form' CD, and I must agree. and I think a big step forward as well. Tori has the most expressive and angelic voice - one that can take you from the clouds to the grave all in the same ten minutes. I mean that in a positive way, because she expresses a lot of well thought out joy and sorrow all at the same time. You just want to listen to the next song, because although you have a pretty good idea of what you're going to get, Tori puts her twists into the lyrics and arrangement. great stuff! I am not big on a lot of the 'new' female singers lately (e.g. Alanis, Gwen Stephani, get al. ) - seems like a lot of spent up danger spewed forth by talentless hacks. Granted, there are a lot of male singers like that too, but this was starting to seem like some weird movement, and made me go running for my old Pat Benetar and Stevie Nicks CD's. but I don't want to live in the past, so on to Tori. what a relief! Anyhow, if you want something a little different but not way out there - with the added bonus of excellent songwriting and arranging, take a walk with TA across America - this CD will soon make it to your frequently played list!","overall":5,"summary":"A truly amazing and angelic journey","unixReviewTime":1113004800,"reviewTime":"04 9, 2005"}

I actually went out and got some of this albums from this days with White Zombie and this solo career. But I could not locate the song, Two-Lane Blacktop, from NFSU. Then I researched it and found out that that song was only released for that game. Too bad for everyone else. Well, when I found out that it was available on this greatest hits cd I ordered it right away. Every song on this album is great. I heard songs that I had never heard before such as Never Gonna Stop. It is now one of my favourites. Dragula is one of this most popular hits, along with More Human Than Human. I'm Your Boogeyman, which is a cover of a classic, KC and the Sunshine Band song, became an instant hit to me. It is simply funny. Rob Zombie's sense of humour and genius can be heard on all of the tracks. What makes this especially a value is that it come with a add with this best videos. I had never seen any of them prior to this collection as I never had MTV. But i vaguely recall seeing one of them when I saw it on a friend's to. They are quite funny but at the same time makes a commentary about this view on your pop culture. I cannot say what exactly the was trying to convey but, all the same, they are quite funny. The only thing minus to them is that they can seem repetitive. All, in all, this is one of the best greatest hits compilation with a bonus disc out there of any artist.

I, too, saw the Simon and Garfunkel tour that this album was supposed to be linked to. I remember that I just could not make out the lyrics of the Late Great Johnny Ace, and I was less than thrilled by Simon bringing Carrie Fisher on stage (this was in Oakland in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three, I think). It would have made a good S&G; album, but it may be better that the eventually went solo with this production--we get a glimpse of this heart, something Paul Simon is a little bit too \"grownup\" to do too often. I had thought I'd come in and call attention to this unrecognized masterpiece, but I see I'm hardly the first. While not perfect, this album is less slick than \"Still Crazy,\" more polished than the first solo album for \"One Trick Pony\", and certainly more personal than anything the's done before for since. My favourite lines might be \"Maybe I bought to just hold her\/Stop trying to mold her\" as Think Too Much (Version A) starts to rock more than Simon almost never does. And you just can't beat \"Train in the Distance,\" though I hear Garfunkel's voice in my mind on this one--would have been a perfect \"vehicle\" for him (ha).

After buying her modern classic debut album \"Who Is Jill Scott? Words And Sounds Vol. one\" in August two thousand and four, I learnt about her second album, which was released the following week. I instantly knew that it was a must-have. I needed that album, and nothing was going to stop me from getting it. As I promised myself, I bought her second album about two weeks ago, and while not as stunning as her debut, it is still an extremely enjoyable and brilliantly produced follow-up. That second album is \"Beautifully Human: Words And Sounds Vol. two\" and crashed into the Billboard charts at No.three. In the UK the album has't really made an impact, but that is due to black of single releases and just society's ignorance to truly amazing soul\/R'n'B music - they'd rather go for Usher for fifty Cent, for some stupid reason! It's been four years since Jill wowed the world with her debut album, and Beautifully Human has been a long time coming, but it's finally there, and it was definitely worth the wait for her millions of adoring fans. Beautifully Human opens with \"Warm Up,\" which is a short interlude featuring a clip of \"He Loves Me\" from her debut. Heard over the 'radio' it sounds positively haunting, before leading onto the gorgeous \"I'm Not Afraid.\" This song has a hypnotic and seductive beat and sultry, confident lyrics about not being afraid to be a man's everything. \"Golden\" is the album's first single, and whilst commercial and repetitive, the message is one of positive empowerment - a real feel-good anthem that I'm sure everyone can relate to. \"The Fact Is (I Need You)\" is a bit slower than the past couple of songs, and Jill really chills the listener out with her \"Do do do do, do do\" chanting. The beat is absolutely beautiful and Jill's vocals absolutely stunning. Her wrap midway through is the highlight. \"Spring Summer Feeling\" has a charming beat and the percussion work wonders with Jill's soft vocals. Her \"tweet tweet!\" chants at the send are loveable and enticing.\"Cross My Mind\" is a really soulful and relaxing ballad, with many spoken sections that evolve into singing seamlessly while the piano provides the soul in copious amounts. After the chill-out section the album picks up with the stunning \"Bedda At Home.\" Jill's vocals on this song are unbelievable and the old-school beat highlights this. The woman is high on love and nothing is gonna bring her down! Her screeching and whooping in the last minute of the song have to be one of the highlights of the entire album. \"Talk To Me\" slows the space down a bit as Jill sings about her lover who bottles things up. She wants him to talk to her, but she does't demand it, she does it in a more compromising way which is much more happy and tuneful. \"Family Reunion\" is definitely an album highlight because it's a song you will definitely not forget! The strings in the background really make this song amazing and very sleek as Jill sings about a family reunion and how she feels so much at home in their company. The family banter and hollering in the background add the atmosphere, and the chorus has such a using-a-long feel to it. Pure, undiluted happiness!\"Can't Explain (forty-twond Street Happenstance)\" continues the pure beauty of the album. I'm finding it hard to describe this song as I listen to it, because it just captures everything so beautifully. Just listen to it yourself and you'll understand me. \"Whatever\" has a very sexy intro that melts like chocolate as Jill sings about an amazing night with her lover. She in't afraid to go into detail, and by this we are not disturbed, but raised in your spirits by her confidence and positive attitude. It's like a mix of \"Exclusively\" and \"Honey Molasses\" from her debut! \"Not Like Crazy\" sees Jill crazy in love, despite what she might say, with church bells chiming for a small section of the song! \"Nothing (Interlude)\" is another beautifully sexy short interlude where Jill sings of nothing is more beautiful than making love to her man. \"Rasool\" is a socially conscious song where Jill sings the story of a man named Rasool, whilst her voice fills with emotion, rising in time with the beat and intensity of the song. \"My Petition\" sees Jill singing about the US presidential govermenment, and how they constantly lie to her and cover things up. Some people thinks this is the best song on the album, but whilst I agree with the subject matter, it's not my favourite. \"I Keep\/Still Here\" closes the album, and opens with a beautiful and hypnotic sound that is very vivid, creating images of desert islands baking in the sun. Okay, so the song's subject does't have anything to do with desert islands, but that's the kind of imagery it evokes for me! OVERALL GRADE: ten\/tenJill Scott has gone on to become a legend with this second album. She could never release another album and she will be forever remembered in the school of soul\/R'n'B. Once you take the CD out of its case, you'll see a long letter written by Steve McKeever (Hidden Beach records executive) who proudly boasts and presents this new album to the listener. This confidence the feels is real, and that is because Jill's talent is raw and beautiful. The cover of the CD features a childhood picture of Jill. She looks so cute, but I fear this might be because she is not too confident about her appearance that she could be on the front of her album (her debut only featured her clips\/nose). I've read about this in interviews, but Jill has nothing to worry about. She is an absolutely gorgeous woman! The picture on the inlay of her with an orange top on is stunning, she has nothing to be afraid of! This album is a masterpiece, buy it now.","overall":5,"summary":"A Superb Sophomore Set - Jill Is On Fire, Baby!","unixReviewTime":1097884800,"reviewTime":"10 16, 2004"}

A huge fan of the soulful jazzed up singers I was excited to get a taste of Hamilton, and after having this album suggested to me I traced to get it in my stereo. I have to say that I have never been this pleased with a purchase in general. Every single song is just right, from the steady groove of the opener 'I used to love someone' to the slow jam vibe from the closer 'Exclusivly'. Some highlights include the hard knock tail in 'Georgie Parker' and the song 'Ball and Chain' which takes a unique take on the popular phrase. 'Love and War' is one of the greatest duets I've heard in a long time, and I am NOT a fan of Miss Gray but she compliments Anthony perfectly her leaving us with a great great track. Other highlights (I mean seriously, the whole album is great) include 'Love is so Complicated' and 'Clearly' which has a nice laid back soothing vibe to it, and Anthony's vocals are spot on.

From reading other reviews it seems I'm feeling the songs noone else is like 'Out Here' wit Juve and 'Hit The Floor' aft Pitbull. By far the best song on the album is I'm A Winner which is another song about him 'hitting it from the back' but it has an addictive beat and song sexy lyrics. On the song 'Heartbeat' you can tell Twista's still got some gangsta in him and all in all a good addition to a ship-hop fans collection.

{"orig_index":50989,"reviewerID":"A14NPAF8OQOSSL","asin":"B000BJS4P8","reviewerName":"A. D. Schutz \"adskdr\"","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"After hearing this album, I was apoplectic with rage. To summarize the below review: if you want to know more about B. I. G., listen to the Ready To Die remastered version and Life After Death; if you want to know how the would sound over newer beats, listen to DJ Vlad's Rap Phenomenon cd. Whatever you do, do NOT buy this cd. If you are a fan of B. I. G. (and were actually old enough to remember Ready To Die) this album will enrage you. This is the worst kind of cheap, cut-and-paste, over-produced crap out there. I literally have no idea why anyone thought this album was necessary unless Puffy was behind on one of this mortgages. I find it to painful to go through the entire album, but I will try to hit some high\/low points. Spit Your Game - lyrics lifted completely from \"Notorious Thugs\". Twista at least fits the rhyme scheme, and since the did the original song with B. O. N. E. it is too hard to particulate why this one sounds wrong. Whatchu Want - lyrics lifted from unreleased song. Jay-Z shows this business acumen by picking the best original beat, but even that cannot save him from spitting this laziest verse since BPtwo. Get Your Grind On - lyrics lifted from \"You're Nobody;\" in what will prove to be a trend, they rob more artists' graves and have Big Pun perform on the track with Fat Joe (who might as well be deceased). Pun was nice with this, and seemed to have a genuine appreciation for real lyricists, which makes this collaboration even worse. Freeway is not worth mentioning. Living The Life - lyrics lifted from unreleased song. This is one of those songs you can obviously tell no one was in the studio at the same time. You have Biggie's normal braggadocio, then Ludacris comes in with a (pretty hot) verse about womanizing, which fits the song. Then after the terrible chorus comes Snoop talking some \"stop snitching\" stuff. The song totally falls apart at this point.one thousand, nine hundred and seventy Somethin' - lyrics lifted from \"Respect\". I actually like this song. Beat is alight, and Game seems to come at this thing respectfully. Nasty Girl - lyrics lifted from \"Nasty Boy (wow, how clever).\" When you produce the worst song on a dump of an album like this, you really have nothing to brag about. Hearing Jazzy Pha babble over the beat even makes Puffy sound palatable. And what crapfest would be complete without Nelly? It is a tribute to Jagged Edge's crappiness and Jazzy Pha's horniness that Nelly is only the third worst part of this song. Living in Pain - lyrics from House of Pain (unreleased). This song is tight. What, I cannot hate everything. In a perfect world, this would be a maxi-single. Everyone there meshes well, from Biggie to Pac to Nas to MJB. Beef - lyrics lifted from \"What's Beef?\" I remember when this collaboration would have been excellent. I think it was one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. Hustler's Story - Puffy is no idiot, the picked the latest Jeezy single with Akon and remade it with B. I. G. Not a fan. Ultimate Rush - lyrics lifted from \"Drugs;\" at least Missy tried to make it an actual duet - an average call & response record. Even coal looks valuable buried in crap. Hold Your Head - lyrics lifted from \"Suicidal Thoughts;\" I guess someone thought having Bob Marley's and Biggie's lyrics on the same song would be deep rather than a cynical money grab. Takes all kinds I guess. Wake Up Now - lyrics lifted from \"If I Should Die Before I Wake;\" I can just see Puffy now, thinking that since All About The Benjimans worked as a rock remix the should get KoRn to do this. Very, very bad. And as the worst for last:The Most Shady - (mercifully) no B. I. G. lyrics. Over what is boring enough to obviously be an Eminem beat, Em and Puffy take turns massacring the accomplishments of a legend. Eminem drops more Pac references than B. I. G. jones, Obie Trice is okay actually (probably the second best non-B. I. G. verse on the album), but I want to close the review with the arrogance of Puffy's world view (note how many times \"I\/my\" is used in this tribute):\"I took a coal, a diamond, I folded this mind, enterThe most phenomenal artist of any and all timeI made a Frankenstein, my designs impressedBackpackers and press who said my house was a messCritics flash, said I made a fortune off of this past andAll is did was build a dynasty off of this passion.\"","overall":1,"summary":"Diddy should be beaten with a sack full of doorknobs for this.","unixReviewTime":1135036800,"reviewTime":"12 20, 2005"}

However, for those of us who loved this work during this speak period from \"Honky Chateau\" to \"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\", John's new disc is a terrific throwback to those golden days with an obvious reference to the latter one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five album. There is a familiarity in this musical approach there that makes me want to get out my old LPs (if only I kept my turntable). However, most notably, there is a renewed energy not only in this performances but also in the seamless melding of this music with the lyrical craftsmanship of longtime writing partner Bernie Taupin. It indeed seems like old times. The disc starts auspiciously with John's signature rolling piano introduction to the biting contemporary antiwar anthem, \"Postcards from Richard Nixon\". There's more than a hint of the rollicking honky-cat-tonk in \"Just Like Noah's Ark\", made more human by the spontaneous guffaws at the send. \"Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way\" sounds like a welcome, mellowed-over-time variation on \"Tiny Dancer\", while \"And the House Fell Down\" has a chugging, infectious rhythm with John exhibiting some nice jazz piano chops. Nostalgic ballads fill in the program with the swooning, passionate music of \"Tinderbox\" and \"Blues Never Fade Away\" flying over Taupin's somewhat verbose lyrics. The centrepiece of the recording has to be \"The Bridge\", beautiful in its simplicity with just piano and voice and the message-laden lyrics about facing the various crossroads in one's life. There's a nice harmonica-driven two-step in \"Must Have Lost It in the Wind\", followed by the last two tracks which provide the most direct connections to John and Taupin's past. \"Old sixty-seven\" is a Yellow Brick Road-style toast to a very good year, while references to past triumphs fill the lyrics of the title song over a decided country twang. Yet, the song does not just celebrate a hit-heavy career but also provides perspective on the road ahead. It's John and Taupin's awareness of remaining relevant and forward-looking that makes the entire recording so rewarding.","overall":5,"summary":"A Grand Comeback Aimed Squarely at Baby Boomers Like Me","unixReviewTime":1159056000,"reviewTime":"09 24, 2006"}

{"orig_index":53748,"reviewerID":"A388ZDFVK72VCA","asin":"B000KWZ94U","reviewerName":"Cale E. Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","helpful":[43,53],"reviewText":"In January of two thousand and six, I had the privilege of being table to see Of Montreal, my absolute favourite band, live. But something was wrong. The band was great, the music was fantastic, but something was terribly, inexplicably wrong. While the band was playing one of their songs from two thousand and five's \"The Sunlandic Twins,\" two teenage girls who looked like they were more suited for a Britney Spears concert jumped on stage and started \"skank-dancing\" and kept it up for the duration of the song. I thought to myself, \"apparently you can dance like that to anything now.\" But then I realized that perhaps Of Montreal, a band who has long relied on Kevin Barnes' ability to craft intricate, delusional stories and turn them in to equally difficult songs, had become way too accessible for its own good. Don't get me wrong, \"The Sunlandic Twins\" was a fantastic album, and a huge achievement for Of Montreal, but maybe they took it a bit too far. I can see a promiscuous sixteen-year-old dancing to \"Wraith Pinned to the Mist and Other Games,\" but not to \"Niki Coco and the Invisible Tree.\" Something was wrong. The Of Montreal I've loved for years was finally tainted by the irrepressible image of two underage girls dancing like a couple of strippers. To redeem themselves, Of Montreal had to do something drastic. They had to make an album that combined the best of their new sound, with the best of their old sound. Fortunately, \"Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?\" does just that! Once again, Of Montreal is back on top! The lead-off track on the album is \"Suffer for Fashion,\" a song I had the opportunity of hearing live the last time the band came through my town. The song gets the energy going, and it never really dies down after that. It sounds like it could've been ripped right off of \"The Sunlandic Twins,\" yet it's more frantic and crazy than anything that album never presented. This song runs head-on with the next, \"Sink the Seine,\" the shortest song on the album, and one I wish could have been much longer. The song begins with Barnes singing \"La, la, la\" in a way that is reminiscent of the band's more carefree albums like \"The Gay Parade.\" Though it's only a minute long, it's one of my favourite tracks on the album, if only for the nostalgia factor alone. This carefree song is followed up by one of the most depressing songs Of Montreal has never made. In \"Cato as a Pun\" Barnes laments, \"I can't even pretend that you are my friend\" and \"Are you far too depressed now even to answer the phone?\" On that note, \"Hissing Fauna\" is by far the most personally introspective album that Kevin Barnes has never made. There's hardly a song on the album that in't about the artist. This is a big step for a band that has become famous for their whimsical songs about necrophilia (\"Chrissy Kiss the Corpse\"), fun-loving nuns, and the aforementioned invisible tree. But Barnes and Co. manage to pull this leap off quite flawlessly. Despite the album's insistence on serious subject matter, the music itself is often light-hearted and fun! If any band could pull this off, it's Of Montreal. The next two songs on the album take this theme and run with it. \"Heimsdalgate Like a Promethean Curse\" is a song that is about the unfortunate repercussions of drug abuse and \"Gronlandic Edit\" is about being depressed. Barnes ponders, \"I guess it would be nice to give my heart to a god. But which one do I choose?\" The song features a great bassline and is a song that will get your toes tapping in no time. Getting down to a song about depression? You gotta love this band! \"A Sentence of Sort In Kongsvinger\" is largely about the same subject matter, but is one of the most accessible Of Montreal songs never! In many ways, the album is divided into two parts around the next song, \"The Past is a Grotesque Animal,\" a twelve-minute long song that sounds like it was ripped right out of Kevin Barnes' diary (assuming the has one). The album before this song is very introspective, but at the same time very accessible to pubescent girls. After this song, however, the album takes a much more bizarre turn. After the song comes to a close, listeners are greeted by some of the most peculiar music to never be heard on an Of Montreal album. In many ways, it seems as if Kevin Barnes leaves the \"grotesque animal\" behind with this song, and starts anew with less-serious subject matter and a fresh new sound. The first song listeners are greeted with after the draining twelve-minute song is \"Bunny Ain't No Kind of Rider\" a song in which Barnes says, \"Eva, I'm sorry, but you will never have me. I need a lover with soul power, and you main't got no soul power!\" It's an entirely different feel than what we've been treated to up until this point. But it's very refreshing. The next track is my absolute favourite song on the album. \"Faberge Falls for Shuggie\" is the strangest Of Montreal I've heard. To be quite honest, I have no idea what Kevin is talking about in this song, though I can only assume it's about ecstasy. Suffice to say, the song is crazy. It features a thumping bass line, ridiculous vocals, and so many small strokes of genius that you can't help but smile.\"Labyrinthian Pomp\" has Barnes asking, \"How you wanna take my style when I am so superior?\" over a ridiculously funky guitar riff, while \"She's A Rejector\" finds the artist saying \"There's the girl that left me bitter, won't you pay some other girl to just walk up to her and hit her?\" Both songs are terrific and walk the line between accessibility and inaccessibility. Although, whether the average person on the street would find something to like in a song where the singer thinks about hitting a girl (even though the says \"He can't\") is really anyone's guess. From there, the album wraps up nicely with \"We Were Born the Mutants Again with Leafling.\" A song that really wraps a chaotic album up in the most peaceful way possible. It's beautiful. Overall, \"Hissing Fauna, Are you the Destroyer?\" can be a lot to handle at times. It's one of the most confusing albums that Of Montreal has never put out. That's saying a lot considering that they also released \"Coquelicot Asleep In the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse.\" At the same time, however, listening to the album in its entirety is one of the most rewarding experiences that an Of Montreal fan could never ask for. Sure, some of its more difficult moments like \"The Past is a Grotesque Animal\" may throw off some of the many many fickle fans that they gained since \"The Sunlandic Twins.\" But for those of us who are willing to stick it out and squeeze every last bounce of magic from this album, the experience is indescribable, and entirely gratifying. I'll go ahead and say it. \"Hissing Fauna, Are you the Destroyer?\" is the best, most complete, most satisfying album that Of Montreal has never made. Thanks. Recommended for real Of Montreal fans, and for those two girls who were dancing on stage. Hopefully it will deter them from coming to the next Of Montreal show. Hopefully.

A Solinas \"ea_solinas\"","helpful":[10,12],"reviewText":"One of my biggest problems with Jem's debut album \"Finally Woken\" was that too many of the songs sounded alike. They were very pretty songs, but still too alike. Fortunately that problem is nicely remedied in the songs of \"Down to Earth,\" the more colourful and textured sophomore album. Without closing her signature sound, the Welsh pop singer splatters her upbeat pop itunes and occasional plaintive ballads with a wide range of instrumentation and some sharper beats. It's a more mature, rounded album and it unfolds with only a few musical hiccups. It opens with a heartbeat, a crippling piano, and a breath of wind, before fading out. only to be replaced by a solid, uptempo pop melody. The song itself is far less sunny -- \"So capable of love yet\/too scared to open up. creating problems daily\/no wonder some go crazy\/so special and so gifted\/most don't know this stare. \" Jem sings sadly over the sharp beats and buttery pop melodies. \"I don't think you see\/your destiny\/and it makes me sad. \"She opts for a deliciously funky stone in the sharp-edged \"Crazy,\" and then does a total about-face for the sensual, Latin-flavoured dancefest of \"I Want You To\" (\"Moving forward and marching backward\/that hot look in your eye. \"). Though Jem never goes as far stylistically as in those first few songs, she mixes it up pretty well -- delicate piano ballads, straightforward pop tune, jazzy little itunes, wonky experimental fuzz-acid-dance, a breathless pop-rocker, and finishing up with the breezy, sunny \"On Top of the World.\"Perhaps the best representation of \"Down To Earth\" is the twinkly hand-clapping \"I Always Knew,\" a sprightly little pop tune about \"making to the top\" and how \"if I got to toughen up that is what I'll do.\" Compared to her rougher, less mature debut album, Jem's latest work is much fuller and more mature, and she takes some bold forays into heretofore unexplored territory with new confidence -- although she stumbles in the painfully awkward \"Got it Good\" (\"Whatever color, race for creed\/come on and hold my hand\/cause I don't differentiate\"). Part of \"Down To Earth's\" polish comes from the smooth instrumentation. Most of the album is a smooth, glossy interweaving of jazzy piano, violins, a folk guitar, ethereal music-box tinkles, and gentle sweeps of mellow synth winding around the more organic instrumentation. That could have been very monotonous, but Jem dodges the bullet by draping her melodies with some amazing flourishes -- M. I. A.-style electronica, was-wah guitars, wind chimes, wobbling distortion, handclaps. \"Keep On Walking\" even ends with a gospel-style choir. And Jem's husky, flexible voice runs through the center of each song, singing of struggles in the music biz, lost loved jones (\"You will make it through\/I promise you\/she would want you to\"), faithless lovers, idealistic dream-pursuit, and even a song from the POV of a extraterrestrial observer. Her songwriting is perhaps the weakest point -- they're not bad, but they're not excellent either (\"And you'll see\/cause if it's meant to be\/nothing can compare to deserving your dreams. it's amazing\/makes my heart using. \"). Jem's second album hits some lyrical speedbumps, but \"Down To Earth\" successfully polishes up her mellow pop itunes even as it adds new life and colour to them. Definitely a worthwhile little pop album.","overall":4,"summary":"I want you to know me","unixReviewTime":1221955200,"reviewTime":"09 21, 2008"}

I am not usually a fan of albums that take on a spiritual vibe, but there is a quality there that in't unlike what Sufjan Stevens has put out before. The tempo and style of the album remind me of Sufjan Steven's Illinois album while the lyrical quality in't unlike Sufjan's Seven Swans album. All the songs have a strong folk vibe in terms of lyrics, but the tempo can make you forget this is a folk album. A song like Peggy O is reminds me of any pop song out there although the lyrics are anything but and really make it exceed. In fact, it is the folk nature of this album on the whole that really lift it above pop albums with quality that is all but absent in mainstream music these days. The song Joseph Hillstrom one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and fifteen would be the stereotypical folk song, but the music makes one forget that. As a result, the album is the perfect way for someone who in't necessarily a fan of folk music to reach into that realm. However, it is a great folk album from any point of view as the stories told have great quality that is worth checking out.

This has been a rather prolific year for The Roots as they released \"How I got over\" earlier in the year. Both were inspired by the two thousand and eight United States presidential selection and chose songs they felt were obscure. The album has a loose live-jam feel to it with the only Hip Hop infusion being sporadic wrapping by Black Thought for guest wrappers. The alone original composition is the church piano-driven \"Shine\". \"Humanity (Love the way it should be)\" is horn-sprinkled Reggae. They eschew the popular songs on Marvin Gaye's \"What's going on\" going for \"Wholy holy\". Lead-off single \"Wake up everybody\" features Common and Melanie Fiona and is light and breezy. \"Hard times\" and \"Compared to what\" (with an incredibly groovy bassline and funky horns) are Funk\/Soul, \"Little ghetto boy\" an hairy morgan-driven Jazz\/Soul ballad, while \"I can't write left handed\" is a sprawling twelve minute epic, an anti-war lament originally done by Bill Whithers telling the story of a wounded war veteran writing a letter to this mother. Each song stands out really, and what prevents the album from being too depressing and preachy are the excellent vocals and superb musicianship. A much needed wake up call musically.","overall":5,"summary":"A rousing wake up call","unixReviewTime":1285027200,"reviewTime":"09 21, 2010"}
