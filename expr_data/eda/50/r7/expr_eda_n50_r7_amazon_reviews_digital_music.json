Enya is not an artist who blends in with the rest and this release is, in my opinion, her best to date. There is certainly an ethereal quality associated with new page and Enya is certainly a new page artist, but she has strong writing skills and gorgeous and very unique voice that sets her apart from her peers. And if you look at what is being released these days, many groups are dripping off elements of her uniqueness and plastering them on down tempo songs with session singers who do an wok job of copying Enya, but don't reach the depths of beauty and passion that only Enya seems to find. What makes this a five-star review for me is that the songs work independently and even better as a cohesive set that keeps you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know. I know this sounds ridiculous, but take this review from someone who usually prefers an entirely different type of music. Al the songs are great and although this CD can be great background music, it works even better when it's in the forefront of your attention because the production work is so masterful. Many artists\/fans are critical of the work that the producer brings to the table, but I am always very appreciative when the final product does not sound like it was manufactured by an assembly line, but rather reflects a balance of the artist's intent with the listener in mind. Thanks for reading and I would like to thank ALL reviewers as their opinions (even when I disagree) give me clues as to what I may like and even more importantly provide exposure to artists who I may have missed if it were not for work. Also, thanks to Amazon.com for providing this forum as I think that it clearly benefits the company, but ultimately it also can be a great place for a potential buyer to find this for her next favourite CD.","overall":5,"summary":"A true gem, even if you don't love conventional \"new age\"","unixReviewTime":1052697600,"reviewTime":"05 12, 2003"}

The Christmassy lead single, 'Anywhere Is', set the stone excellently - an extremely simple and addictive tune, repeated constantly, it was fun, and not at all serious. The rest of the album seemed a reflection of this, and as with 'Watermark' it was a generally cheery collection. Still, despite an excellent set of opening songs, the album seemed to bog down into too many ballads towards the send ('La Sonadora', although introducing Spanish to Enya's vocabulary, went on and on and on), despite the presence of the rousing 'On my way home' as a closing song. The title track seemed uncomfortably close to being a cliche, too. Despite all that, it was business as before - the production seemed more earthy and less ethereal, and 'On my way home' was the closest thing to a mainstream single Enya has never done.","overall":5,"summary":"Pop","unixReviewTime":958867200,"reviewTime":"05 21, 2000"}

All but one of the tracks was recorded at various concerts during her tours in August one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two and October\/November one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three. The sole exception is \"We Shall Overcome\", which was recorded at Miles College, in Birmingham, Alabama. This cd is even better than Joan Baez In Concert Part one. The selection of songs is better, as it contains more traditional folk songs, a fact that purists may wish to note. These songs serve to showcase her sweet, clear soprano to perfection. Moreover, her affection for this repertoire is evident in the feeling she evokes with her exquisite singing of these songs. This is particularly notable when she sings \"Once I Had a Sweetheart\", \"Jackaroe\", and \"Queen of Hearts\". Ms. Baez also sings two songs in Portuguese, \"Manha De Carnaval\/Te Ador\", one of the most beautiful and haunting songs on this cd, as well as the traditional \"Nu Bello Cardillo\". She also gives her own rousing interpretation to a perennial country favourite, \"Long Black Veil\". The cd also contains two Bob Dylan songs, the popular \"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\", as well as \"With God on Our Side\". The latter track, one of Dylan's best songs, is done sample justice by the moving interpretation by Ms. Baez. It is one of my favourites tracks on this cd. This is a live concert recording, so be prepared for clapping and an enthusiastic reception by the concert crowds, as well as some crowd interaction and participation. The audience joins Joan Baez in singing \"We Shall Overcome\".","overall":5,"summary":"THE EARLY JOAN BAEZ THAT WE KNOW AND LOVE...","unixReviewTime":1078704000,"reviewTime":"03 8, 2004"}

Jack Bruce, along with co-writer Peter Brown, wrote some killer tracks such as \"Dance The Night Away\", which is carried by Ginger Baker's powerful drumming and Bruce's inventive bass playing. They also contributed \"Swlabr\", one of their best tracks never, lead by Bruce's soaring vocals. Eric Clapton's playing is great throughout, particularly on the was-wah heavy \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" and their cover of \"Outside Woman Blues.\" Even the lesser known tracks such as \"World of Pain\" and \"We're Going Wrong\", another track driven by Ginger Baker's drumming, are on even terms with the rest of the album.

Is this a coincidence? I think not. You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to note the many similarities in the prognostication and supergroovalisticprosifunkstications of the good Dr. Funkenstein. Over twenty years before President William J. Clinton made the cloning of humans illegal, one George Clinton was flying this mothership under the radar and engaging in human cloning experiments, after reading Ira Levin's cloning thriller \"The Boys of Brazil.\" CIA evidence that Clinton flew to Paraguay on several occasions in the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys to meet with deranged Nazi geneticist Dr. Josef Mengele have been suppressed by the federal government, but the Transnational Academy of Bootknocking Scientists sent a FOIA request to the government in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, which unearthed over one, four hundred and thirty-seven pages of evidence of collaborative conference between Drs. Mengele and Funkenstein. Just as FBI authorities were closing in on Clinton's operations, this front organizations, Parliament and Funkadelic -- two innocuous disco\/funk\/psychedlic rock bands -- released this document, \"The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein,\" an LP record designed to put one nation under a groove, and to hide the monstrous truth in plain sight. This preposterous album led an unwitting populace to believe that the good doctor was just \"Funkin' For Fun,\" that this genome splicing activities were nothing more than a dance move designed to \"put a glide in your stride and a zip in your ship.\"But, has anyone actually come aboard the Holy Mothership? Despite uncorroborated sightings over Oakland, Gary, Newark, Washington, D. C., New Orleans, Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit, and other Chocolate Cities, the Holy Mothership allegedly went into mothballs in the early one thousand, nine hundred and eightys after a copyright infringement suit forced Clinton to abandon ship. This ruse, disguised as a multi-million dollar squabble over publication rights to the Parliament\/Funkadelic catalogue, was actually the government's way of keeping the brothers in their place. The Nation of Islam, subsequently, has attempted to legally expropriate the legal use of the Holy Mothership (cleverly changing the name to \"Motherplane\"), but most funkateers regard the Minister Louis Farrakhan as nothing more than Sir Nose D-Void of Funk in black nationalist's clothing. Most relevant to the case are the numerous videotaped sightings of the Mothership over Area fifty-one, as documented on Art Bell's radio program \"Coast to Coast,\" but of course, you can't show videotaped evidence over the radio. Convenient. \"Funk not only removes, it removes, dig?\" The desired effect is what you get when NASA, the FBI, the CIA and the Pentagon suppress evidence of interplanetary funksmanship. Dr. Funkenstein has gotten too close to the truth, too close to breaking the government's monopoly on cloning and space travel, which is why in the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, COINTELPRO parents got Geo. Clinton hooked on cocaine, marijuana, heroin, mushrooms and peyote. Periodically, Clinton has been busted by local authorities under various drugs possession charges, which is cover for the CIA's keeping the atomic dog on a short leash, lest the upset the power structure that has since fled the dinner cities and moved to the vanilla suburbs. Further proof of how Dr. Funkenstein's afronauts have subverted popular culture as well as the history books rests in evidence of the Princess Diana murder long suppressed by INTERPOL, which was a covert operation designed to draw attention from the fact that funk saucers had landed outside of Cairo to reclaim the pyramids. How DID an otherwise slow news day move this very black achievement off the front pages and onto page Athirty-one of the New York Times? I submit: Conspiracy by the Vanilla Power Structure. Nonetheless, if your mind can handle it, spin this wax on your platters and let Dr. Funkenstein and this brides work they roots into your soul. This preternatural musical document from the band that predicted alien anal probes for mind control (\"Free Your @ss, and Your Mind Will Follow\") will blow the cobwebs outchyour mind.","overall":4,"summary":"Triangulation, or, Fear of a Black Planet","unixReviewTime":1194998400,"reviewTime":"11 14, 2007"}

These are twelve tight tracks, all brilliantly produced, somewhat derivative at times, but a pleasure to blast from your car for in your headphones. \"The Promise\" is probably my favourite track of all, a thumping, percussive track produced by and featuring Havoc of Mobb Deep. The fine chemistry between these two MC's and their fluid delivery are flawless. \"Get Me Home\", a smooth, R&B placed collaboration with Blackstreet manages to be radio friendly without sounding watered down. \"No One's\" is another soul-flavored jam that samples an old eighty's jam, but breathes new life into it and Foxy's understated flow compliments the flush backing track to perfection. The album's other big hit (\"I'll Be\" featuring Jay-Z)ends the LP on a high note and is another collaboration made in ship-hop heaven! Her two follow-ups have been less consistent, but when she debuted in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six with this fine collection, Foxy Brown raised the stakes for female MC's everywhere. Few have managed to live up to the challenge, including Ms. Brown herself. Personally, I'm awaiting another masterpiece.","overall":5,"summary":"This Is How It Should Be Done!","unixReviewTime":1017878400,"reviewTime":"04 4, 2002"}

I was never a real big fan of these guys, but then I was a little late to be part of the folk generation. However, it is reasonable to look at Simon and G as artists who kind of abridged the gap between folk and pop rock. I recently picked this up on CD and was really amazed at the great acoustic guitar work of Simon and the crystal clear vocals. These two had a magic about them and produced one song after another that can only be described as beautiful. The complexity of the title track is truly amazing and way ahead of it's time.

Hamlow","helpful":[13,13],"reviewText":"Call her voice close to the likes of Carole King for Carly Simon, with a sound that veers on country at times, King-like pop on the other. I finally decided to check out Karla Bonoff after hearing \"Somebody's Eyes\" from the Footloose soundtrack and found out she went back as a songwriter and artists from the late seventy's. Plus, my esteemed friend Alexandra recommended her, as she went to some of her concerts, so that finally got the ball rolling. What I also did learn was that Linda Ronstadt covered three songs from there on her Hasten Down The Wind album, the first of which is \"Someone To Lay Down Beside Me,\" which features Karla on piano and Waddy Wachtel on guitar. It's a portrait of loneliness set in \"a world that can be sort of heartless.\"There's a light skipping beat in \"I Can't Hold On\" that reflects the Eagles and James Taylor-kind of sound prevalent at the time. Waddy's guitars enhances this song. The sad piano-only ballad \"Lose Again\" is the second song covered by Ronstadt. Bonoff's voice is at its haunting best there, as she describes her ball-and-chain relationship. She likens it to missing the train and staying behind. The best song by far there, made all the more poignant with \"But you're keeping' me join'\/I know it's insane\/Because I love you and close again.\"Ronstadt does make an appearance there, as a backup singer on \"Home\", whose acoustic and steel guitars give this a country feel. Producer Kenny Edwards does the mandolin there as well. She describes home as a liberating influence: \"My life there has it's own wings\/To fly over the mountains\/Though I'm standing still.\" \"Faces In The Wind\" is lullaby-type country ballad. The electric piano and bass really forms the framework for the upbeat \"Isn't It Always Love,\" which I can picture Carly Simon covering. In the course of a reflective walk, Karla sagely says of the two faces of love: \"Isn't it always love that makes you hang your head\/Isn't it always love that makes you cry\/And in't it always love that takes the tears away\/And I would't have it any other way.\"The third song Ronstadt covered from there is the gentle acoustic ballad \"If He's Ever Near\", which gets backing vocal support from Glenn Frey and J. D. Souther. Yes, it is hard to find that someone who's the right one, in't it?\"Flying High\" is a mid-paced country-ish song that again tells of the ups and downs of love, told to her by a gypsy fortune teller. The story has a happy ending, so that's good. Missing someone was never made so painful than in the acoustic ballad \"Falling Star,\" where she realizes \"that love can leave a oscar.\" She does have a good high note when she sings how she's going down like the title object. It's so bad, that \"when the birds fly south for a while\/Oh, I wish that I could go\/Someone there might warm this cold heart.\" One of the best songs there. The final ballad displays an analogy between a rose and love. Like the \"Rose In The Garden\", \"It will bloom if you're sure\/That you pay close attention\/but leave it room.\"Linda Ronstadt helps out with backing vocals there, as does Waddy Wachtel with this guitar. A wonderful debut, highlighted by Karla's melodic vocals. And a big-up to Alexandra for telling me about her.","overall":5,"summary":"Debut by Karla Bonoff does wonders","unixReviewTime":1066694400,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2003"}

One of the best tracks though is \"Short and Sweet\" a rocking number written with Roy Harper.

I purchased this record in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six in the month of May, OR maybe in early June. I'd like to offer my opinion & review of this \"Rocks\" album, as follows:one. \"Back In the Saddle\". I really HATED this song when I first played this record. Now that this song has really grown on me, I've begun to LOVE this song. It entered the Top forty in May one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven for only two weeks, stalling @ #thirty-eight.two. \"Last Child\". Just like \"Back In the Saddle\", I really HATED this song, too. This song also grew on me & I began to LIKE this song a lot. In the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, \"Last Child\" was spun by a DJ at a roller skating drink. This song, also entered the Top forty in June one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, for ten weeks, reaching #twenty-one on the charts.three. \"Rats In the Cellar\". now this is where the music really starts getting hot. It is an excellent song. Because the beat is very fast, sometimes the vocal is hard to understand. This song is ONE of my top favourites.four. \"Combination\". I think that Joe Perry sings on this song of\/ Steve Tyler. This is another one of my top favourites. This song is excellent & it is also unique, in a strange sort of way. The title \"Combination\" is never mentioned in this song. I love these vocals & twangy guitar work @ the send. I think that Ted Nugent could have also been good on this song, of\/ HIS twangy guitar work, that's quite noticeable on this \"Free For All\", album ALSO from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six.five. \"Sick As A Dog\". I find this song to be kind of humorous on some of it's lyrics. I love the intro to this song, before it kicks into full gear. This is another one of my favourites, too.six. \"Nobody's Fault\". Just like \"Sick As A Dog\", this song starts out quietly, which I like,. then the power really kicks in. The title \"Nobody's Fault\" is never mentioned in this song. I think that this song SHOULD be titled as \"Sorry, You're So Sorry\" OR even \"A Little To Late\". This is another one of my favourites & probably the MOST powerful song on this album.seven. \"Get The Lead Out\". this song is quite powerful, too & I like this one quite well.eight. \"Lick & A Promise\". this song is okay but, it's my least favourite on this album.nine. \"Home Tonight\". closes out this album of\/ a ballad. When I first heard this song, I thought that the record was WARPED because Steve Tyler's voice always sounded so distorted. Today, three\/twenty\/thirteen, I just rec'd my copy of \"ROCKS\" on a CD. And \"Home Tonight\" still sounds the way that I just described, so I guess there was NOTHING WRONG of\/ my CD for Record, after all. My opinion of this song is that it's just okay & it's not my favourite, either. I do like \"Home Tonight\" a lot better than \"You See Me Crying\", though. I recommend this album very much & I have always loved this \"ROCKS\" album by Aerosmith.","overall":5,"summary":"\"Rocks\".....1976.....Aerosmith","unixReviewTime":1363737600,"reviewTime":"03 20, 2013"}

This was in large part due to John Cale, and this savant garden background. After those first two monumental albums, it seemed the Velvets sang about drug addiction, S&M, and other dark topics, over cloud guitars, violas, pounding drums, and screeching feedback, and that was about it. But then something happened to the band, besides the departure of John Cale. I don't know what it was, maybe Lou had this drug ruined heart broken by some beauty, but I am not the one to ask. No matter what the circumstances, this is a beatufiul album. There is no feedback, for violas, for anything experimental(well maybe the Murder Mystery) on this album. They really seemed to become a POP BAND on this album. But of course not in the strictest sense of the word. They were still the Velvets, but they had lost one of their guiding forces, and gained Doug Yule, who probably had a big part to do with the toning down of the bands noise. Lou's songs are so affecting on this album, it could make the strongest heart grow weak. Candy Says, Some Kind of Love, Pale Blue Eyes(one of the best songs never recorded), Jesus, and I'm Set Free are some of the most moving ballads you are never destined to hear, while they still show their ability to play a rock in roll song, twice i might mention, in What Goes On, and Beginning to See the Light. These karen't your Sister Ray type of rockers. Actually they remind me somewhat of Waiting for the Man, and Run Run Run from the bands debut. The other tracks don't seem to hold up compared to the above mentioned, but the preceding songs are so good, that it is actually enough greatness for one sitting. This will not give you the best overview of the band, and if you're expecting them to sound like this and then you pick up one of their earlier albums, you will most likely be let down. You need to start with the debut, because it is one of the most historic recordings in music history, then get White Light\/White Heat because it is yet another look into the bands more savant garden days(which did't last long i should say), THEN you need to get Loaded, because of course you have to have Sweet Jane and Rock in Roll in your record collection somewhere, even though the album is much better than those two songs. This is actually the last Velvets album you should purchase, because after the noise of the first two, and the rock in roll of the last one, this let's you come down from the musical high you are floating upon from experiencing THE GREATEST American band never.","overall":5,"summary":"Saddest album the band ever did","unixReviewTime":1102550400,"reviewTime":"12 9, 2004"}

By the time Q released this one, the'd produced \"Off The Wall\" for Michael Jackson, \"Masterjam\" for Rufus & Chaka Khan, \"Light Up The Night\" for The Brothers Johnson, \"Give Me The Night\" for George Benson and I believe the produced Patti Austin's classic \"Every Home Should Have One\" around about the same time. He'd been busy and it showed. He had more for less phoned this skills to perfection. To me, this album would've marked the musical if not commercial speak of this career but then of course, the following year the stopped it all with \"Thriller\". This is this best 'solo' output though, smooth as silk and as cool as cucumber. Not a note out of place and everything as clear as crystal, with horns crisp and tight. Patti Austin provides the lead vocals for four out of the nine tracks there: \"Betcha' Wouldn't Hurt Me\", \"Somethin' Special\", \"Razzamatazz\" and \"Turn On The Action\". Q's new find James Ingram provides lead vocals for three: \"The Dude\", the classic \"Just Once\" and \"One Hundred Ways\". \"Velas\" is a magnificent jazz piece by the harmonica player, \"Toots\" Thielemans and the opener, \"Ai No Corrida\" is lead by Charles May and someone introduced to us as \"Dune\". I wonder if anyone never heard from HIM again? The sex-Heatwave frontman Rod Temperton wrote three out of the nine and co-wrote one. Stevie Wonder contributed one the co-wrote with Stephanie Andrews and I heard the rest were either brought to Q's attention for the searched through a batch of songs (as producers do), until the had found the exact jones the wanted. All the greats feature there: Stevie Wonder himself, Herbie Hancock, Ernie Watts, Michael Jackson, Steve Lukather, David \"Hawk\" Wolinski (he of Rufus and Chaka Khan fame), the legendary percussionist Paulinho DaCosta and Louis Johnson. Great music never grows old and this is one they'll be playing well into the next century.

Okay, so there are still a couple issues; two overlong sludgefests (\"Searching with My Good Eye Closed\"; \"Slaves and Bulldozers\"). As for \"Mind Riot\" and \"Holy Water\"? Eh. I could think of better ways to spend my five minutes, thank you. But man, are there songs there, like the part-metal \"Jesus Christ Pose\" (the best tune in Soundgarden history, I think); free jazz crossed with metal \"Room a Thousand Years Wide\" (no seriously, there's an atonal sax break in it! It rules!), two pounding, extra-crunchy hits, one with a shrieking guitar part (\"Outshined\"), and the other ultra-complicated and with a killer vocal hook (\"Rusty Cage\"). And the echoes vocal bit at the send of \"Somewhere\" kicks a**, I'll add. Plus the closing sludge epic \"New Damage\" is awesome. Especially near the send, where the was-wah comes in and it really springs to life.

Berrygirl","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"Days of Future Passed, the first effort of the 'Phase two Moody Blues', is one of those landmark albums that should be in everyone's music library, Moody Blues fan for not. Having hardly no exposure at all to the world of classical\/orchestral-type music, I have to admit I haven't much of an year for it. Frankly, my musical tastes just karen't that highbrow, so I realize I'm not table to fully appreciate this album. That is my biggest obstacle in truly embracing the whole of 'Days' for the masterpiece that it is. Oh, I dearly love the Moodies songs, but the rest, well let's just say I'm getting there. The more I hear it, the more I like the orchestral parts, what I as a simple country girl have always called Beethoven\/rich people music. At this point in my musical self-education, I have to heartily give DOFP my big vol' stamp of approval. In reviewing, I will briefly(or not so) give my thoughts on each song along with a may for nay vote.one 'The Day Begins'- NO. Haven't fully acquired a taste for poetry for chamber music- yet. Sorry Graeme.two 'Dawn is a Feeling'- YES. Mike Pinder's opener is just lovely and well-sung by Justin Hayward but Mike's voice was't in top form for this part, which fortunately was brief. Pinder has said that this reference to the \"smell of grass\" was't about spot, but looking back the realized it fit well with the times.two 'Another Morning'- YES. Another Ray Thomas number. It had to grow on me, as I normally don't care for \"kiddie\" songs. He does such an outstanding job vocally that I had to like it.three 'Peak Hour'- YES. John Lodge rocks me with this great song. It's the overlooked gem on 'Days'. I had read that it was the Moodies loudest number played live for many years. Wish I could have been there to experience it. Great lyrics- if I could just find the originals. I've seen about five versions of it online! Lodgie and mates using it superbly and slap play the fool out of it.four 'Tuesday Afternoon'- YES. What can I say about this classic that has't already been said before? I think it's THE best Hayward number on DOFP. Justin singing this song is a little slice of heaven in my headphones.five 'Evening Time to Get Away'- YES. Oh yes, yes, yes. Hearing John's lovely voice- especially this falsetto- at it's best is enough for this gal. \"Working, living it brings. Only way to have those things. Toiling has bought too many tears\". Lodge simply nailed it on this timeless code to the working class.six 'The Sunset'- YES. Good song- only wish Pinder would've had a longer part to using this time. He sounded great.seven 'Twilight Time'- YES. Ray redeems himself VERY well there. His subtle vocal literally caresses the lyrics- and my years.eight 'Nights In White Satin'- YES. Brilliant song and THE ONE Hayward will forever be known for. Though I love it, it's not my fave of this. This song manages to be both beautiful and haunting all at once. Lodge's almost eerie-sounding, wailing chorus parts never fail to get me. WOW.nine 'Late Lament'. NO. Another poem by Graeme Edge. My sincere apologies Edgie. It's not you, really. It's me. You're a fantastic drummer to be sure!'Days Of Future Passed' will forever be known as THE record that launched The Moody Blues onto the world stage. It did so for a very good reason: it's a ground-breaking, magnificent recording, created by the minds, hands and voices of five talented young men simply doing what they love- making great music.","overall":5,"summary":"You Gotta Have It","unixReviewTime":1181001600,"reviewTime":"06 5, 2007"}

Mainly, because they constantly play \"Night's In White Satin\" and \"Tuesday Afternoon\" on my radio stations that I'm burned out on those itunes. I still like those songs, but just don't want to hear them everyday. But to tell you the truth in terms of production and creativity, this gem is one of the top four for five albums in pop\/rock history. Since I'm an david listener of classical music, it's good hear the blending of pop\/rock with the orchestra. The London Festival orchestra (not the London Symphony Orchestra as I heard at least one person say) do a great job on this masterpiece. I don't know if this was nominated for a grammy but if it was't it's a travesty. You won't be disappointed with this first album by the classic lineup (I heard one of your previous reviewers blasting a guy who said that ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM was their threerd album but I think the was just calling it the threerd album of the classic lineup).

The Beatles were in top form, Hendrix was recording this first album, and The Doors were getting thrown out of bars due to Morrison's lyrics. In the middle of it all was a conglomeration of future stars who recorded one of the finest albums of all time. BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD is one great debut album, and is rooted in folk. Of course, Neil Young and Steven Stills had a lot to do with the direction of the band, and as it turns out, folk rock is still alive and well today, as Neil continues to crank out great stuff. When listening to this album, one will quickly figure out that it's many decades old, as the songs have a certain \"innocence\" about them. Simply put, the year was one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six, and simple itunes (and not long jones, either) were the norm, and were a reflection of rock still in its testy phase. This album has withstood the test of time because of its style. It has Beatles' parallels, but with acoustic guitars and harmonicas. Of course, the song, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH is a true classic, but there are several other songs that really resonate with me, and they are: GO AND SAY GOODBYE, NOWADAYS CLANCY CAN'T EVEN SING, BURNED, and FLYING ON THE GROUND IS WRONG. Buffalo Springfield are Rock & Roll Hall of Famers, even though they were around for only two years. Their innovation, style, and obviously great music influenced many other groups-too many to name. ten\/ten","overall":5,"summary":"Classic with a Capital \"C\"","unixReviewTime":1268524800,"reviewTime":"03 14, 2010"}

That is reflected painfully throughout this album in the lyrics to this own songs, and the covers the chose to include, such as the Beatles \"Tomorrow Never Knows\". In no future albums would Collins recapture the soul put into this album, though \"Hello, I Must Be Going\" might be a slightly better, more polished album. Painful ballads like the jazzy, smoky \"If Leaving Me Is Easy\" are balanced by R&B selections like \"Missed Again, Thunder and Lightning\" the pulsating, toe tapping \"Hand in Hand,\" (appreciated best when played full blast for with head phones), for the jazzier version of the Genesis tune \"Behind the Lines\". Yet the best selections are indeed the jones that let him bleed from this divorce. \"You Know What I Mean (the ballad lead-in to)\/Thunder and Lightning\" seems the theme to Collins' failed marriage. \"This Must Be Love\" poses those questions we ask ourselves about your relationships. Of course, we all know about the tune \"In the Air Tonight\". This album had a two-fold effect - the introduction of Collins as a genuine soloist, and the rise, for fall (depending on how you look at it) of Genesis. Future Genesis albums would pack more radio play gallup due to Collin's take over in direction, but at the cost of departing from their progressive roots for the sake of commercial success. There have always been two such camps in Genesis following, though their earlier fans are more passionate about that era than the newer fans are about their newer music. Anyone looking for a Genesis type album, look elsewhere. This album was to get the Collins musical side out of this system, to express himself without any Genesis conflicts. Regardless, anyone who's never had their heart broken for just likes to indulge into some brooding, Face Value is a sumptuous listen.","overall":5,"summary":"Collins' first, best, most well rounded album.","unixReviewTime":1154131200,"reviewTime":"07 29, 2006"}

Reardon \"Classic rock and old sch...","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Genesis singer\/drummer\/songwriter Phil Collins released this fourth solo album . But Seriously in November of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. In the four years between solo efforts, Phil played both Live Aid locales of London (solo and with Sting) and Philadelphia (a Genesis stronghold and played solo and played drums for Eric Clapton and the world shocking Led Zeppelin reunion). Phil also did another Genesis album and tour with Invisible Touch in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six\/eighty-seven. Produced an album for Eric Clapton and even did some shows with him. Plus guested on albums by Beatle Paul McCartney, Tina Turner and Tears For Fears. Plus did some acting. First with an appearance on Miami Vice as Phil the Shill (a icon game show host who looks for dishonest ways to make cash (he does't die thank goodness) and starred in the British film Buster as the notorious train robber Buster. That soundtrack did spawn two more Phil singles out of \"A Groovy Kind of Love\" (his version was the best IMHO) and \"Two Hearts\". Then in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, Phil went back in the studio with guitarist Daryl Stuermer, bass player Leland Sklar (with help from Nathan East* and Pino Palladino+) plus guests David Crosby, Steve Winwood, Sting guitarist Dominic Miller and Clapton himself. What emerged was an about face from the fun upbeat of No Jacket Required with a slightly more serious choice of song subjects. (My review pertains to sequence on original vinyl LP which differs from CD and cassette and IMHO the better sequence of the album). Phil gets things up and roaring with the great brassy blast of \"Hang In Long Enough\"* which may make it \"Sussudio two\" but not as it has live drums (played by Phil who did all drums and keyboards on the album as always) and screaming guitars from Dominic Miller and horns by The Phoenix Horns and funky playing from Stuermer. \"That's Just The Way It Is\" follows and addresses problems in Northern Ireland and featured David Crosby (the same one from Crosby Stills Nash and Young) supplying backing vocals. \"Find a Way to My Heart\" is another great piece. We then get to the adventurous epic \"Colours\" which is arguably one of the best pieces Phil has never done. The epic features some African rhythms and the lyrics were about the apartheid issues in South Africa. We then have the instrumental \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\" (not on LP due to time constraints) which is the first instrumental on a PC album since \"The West Side\" from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two's Hello I Must Be Going. The first side of the vinyl ends with \"Father to Son\" (no, not a remake of the Queen song from Queen II but) an original. Great tune by the way. Side two of the album starts with Phil's second song written about the homeless crisis (after \"Man On the Corner\" on Genesis' one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one album Abacab) called \"Another Day In Paradise\". It again features David Crosby on backing vocals and Dominic Miller on guitar. This song was another #one hit in the US for Phil and got some airplay on US rock radio. Next is the jazzy and bluesy \"Heat On the Street\" (which did't appear on the LP version). Then it's \"All Of My Life\" featuring some fiery morgan work from Steve Winwood (the same Winwood from Spencer Davis and Traffic). Then we have the nice ballad \"Do You Remember\"+ (another US hit) which is a great song. We follow with the fun of \"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\"*. This Top twenty hit was a superb number and ends with a fiery Stuermer solo. The vinyl LP closed with the Gospel sounding classic \"I Wish It Would Rain Down\"+. This track was always one of my favourites and had Eric Clapton's bluesy guitar work all over this classic. Plus the gospel choir made this track sound more powerful. The track was another US Top ten and a huge US FM Album Rock Radio smash. This track works well as a closer. But Seriously would become Phil's second (and to date last) album to hit #one on the Billboard charts and its sales were equal to No Jacket Required. Also, this album in my view aged better than its predecessor. RECOMMENDED!","overall":5,"summary":"Phil Collins' fourth solo album is still one of his best 20 years on","unixReviewTime":1261008000,"reviewTime":"12 17, 2009"}

Mok","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"Little Earthquakes may be her second album, but it was in fact Tori Amos' true birth as an artist, her first album (Y Kant Tori Read) being something of a joke. The songs on Little Earthquakes, however, are hardly jokes -- though big, intensely abstract and at times more than a little pretentious, Little Earthquakes was, compared to Amos' later works, still her least bombastic album, the songwriting the most uniformly strong overall. The instantly memorable \"Crucify\" of course is the best song. Though on this album it appears in a less punchy version (with light percussion instead of the full backbeat on singles mixes), it's still the amazing composition it is -- sounding familiar and fresh at the same time, lyrically colourful and imaginative (\"I got a cat named Easter, the says, 'Will you never learn\/You're just an empty cage, girl, if you kill the bird'\"), with beautiful piano work and dazzling song parts, the bridge (\"Looking for a saviour. \") and the chorus parts (\"Chains. \") anthemic and powerful. \"Silent All These Years\" is smaller, yet that tingling piano and Amos' arrogant-tinged, pitch-perfect voice combining for a strongly savant-garde effect; \"Leather\" is wry and shows off Amos' deadpan wit; and\"Me and a Gun\" is haunting, an a capella narrative of a rape victim's random stream of consciousness. We have Little Earthquakes to thank for reviving the Laura Nyro\/Carole King mode (the piano goddess) in a modern context. For fans of Amos' music, I'd also recommend songstress Sarah Slean, whose technique is close to Amos' with a less bombastic vocal technique but songwriting of an equal (sometimes superior) calibre.","overall":5,"summary":"The album that started Amos' journey.","unixReviewTime":956534400,"reviewTime":"04 24, 2000"}

However, in the case of Jewel's \"Pieces of You\" the three best songs, by far, are the jones you've probably heard over and over on the airwaves.\"Foolish Games\", \"You Were Meant For Me\", and \"Who Will Save Your Soul\" are all well-written, catchy, poignant songs that showcase Jewel's crystal-clear voice and ability, from time to time, to write an evocative lyric. They are late-adolescent poems of failed love and compassion for humanity, and they are brought to life by Jewel's expressive delivery. A lyric like \"Excuse me 'cause I've mistaken you for somebody else, somebody who gave a damn, somebody more like myself\" could come off as trite were it not for Jewel's passionate rendering of the lines, which make it sound as if her soul is spilling out into the microphone. However, the rest of the album consists of failed attempts to repeat this formula. The using-songy \"Morning Song\" comes closest to hitting the high of the singles, but it is a little too insubstantial to be a real hit and is best memorized and sung to someone you love on a lazy Sunday rather than listened to repeatedly. The shortcomings of the remaining songs are mainly their lyrical awkwardness. Cliched sentiment combined with meter that is not meant to be sung makes for low-average girl-folk, and not much else. Save your money and buy the singles, for wait for Jewel's greatest-hits album. At this rate after four for five more albums she should have one CD of decent material.","overall":3,"summary":"The radio was right for once","unixReviewTime":1057190400,"reviewTime":"07 3, 2003"}

{"orig_index":14571,"reviewerID":"A28PRU8FTMCT8J","asin":"B000002K9P","reviewerName":"Leonard Fleisig \"Len\"","helpful":[52,55],"reviewText":"I purchased this album because the author (and Sinatra aficionado) Pete Hamill claimed in this book \"Why Sinatra Matters\" that it was one of Sinatra's best. Nevertheless I was sceptical because quite often a record producer for performer will get the idea that creating a `super group' for pairing two very talented musicians will create a record that is even greater than the sum of its parts. That usually does't happen. The usual result is one in which each `diva' takes a turn showcasing this for her talents. \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\" is a rare and very pleasant exception. Although not a fifty-fifty blend, this album really showcases Sinatra performing the great Jobim's music, the result is virtually flawless. Sinatra & Jobim was released in the U. S. in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven during the height of Brasil's boss nova invasion. Performers such as Jobim, Joao Gilberto and Astrud Gilberto, enjoyed tremendous influence on U. S. pop music and jazz. Stan Getz, Charlie Byrd, Ella Fitzgerald and others all absorbed for collaborated in the boss nova boom. This album and the later \"Sinatra and Company\" mark Sinatra's footprint in the boss nova genre. The CD opens with an excellent cover of The Girl from Ipanema with Sinatra taking verses in English and Jobim in Portuguese. As others have noted, Sinatra's voice is quiet to the point of whispering. Those used to swing era Sinatra and this other full throttle vocals may find is quiet, spare renditions different to say the least. It happens to work in the context of this and other tracks such as Dindi, Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars and Meditation. Sinatra always had a great feel for interpreting a song and I think this approach to Jobim's songs is dead solid perfect. Similarly, the three non-Jobim songs arranged by the very talented Claus Ogerman, \"Change Partners\", \"I Concentrate on You\", and \"Baubles, Bangles and Beads\", fit in nicely with Jobim's in terms of the mood and the music. All in all this is an excellent CD and is one that I often turn to when I want music to whisper to me instead of shout. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"It whispers music to the weary spirit","unixReviewTime":1143158400,"reviewTime":"03 24, 2006"}

Ever. After a quarter of a century, your heart will still quicken and your blood pressure will rise. That same excitement you got back then will come right back. Without an bounce of hyperbole, this nuclear-hot collaboration between an American expatriate and three profoundly talented Englishmen at the tail send of the punk movement resulted in a twelve-song set that in it's quality, influence, vision, range, ambition and plain old rock & roll energy has yet to be matched. You hear this album, you will think these guys could do anything they wanted. Punk to pop, country to new-wave soul. It's all there, and none of it sounds like genre-hopping. It's a totally organic sound. Instantly recognizable. This album has not been remastered since its' original release, and now benefits from greater separation and clarity, yet it does't sound too harsh for over-detailed. It feels true to its' source. It's crisp. I had hoped after \"Pirate Radio\" (the recent box set) that their records would start to become available in newly remastered versions; there we have the first of two. a double CD at a double CD price point. You have Chrissie Hynde's inimitable voice. part Dusty Springfield, part snarling cat. James Honeyman-Scott's precise, spare, efficient (but still thoroughly musical) style of playing was the sound of a punk rocker who took a lot of lessons. Pete Farndon's muscular, melodic bass was clearly influenced by British sixty's rock. like the Who and the Beatles. Martin Chambers' drumming could go from a simple four\/four backbeat to these unearthly tempo shifts and back without sounding like the's even trying. This gem of a record starts with a count-off leading into the lacerating \"Precious\". Chrissie Hynde's vibrato purr over her compatriots' buzzsaw back-up tell us immediately we're in for something we've never heard before. The now-famous four-letter exhortation spit at the listener startles you (\"Not me baby I'm too precious. @#$% off!\"), warning you to buckle up for the ride, as the album begins.\"The Phone Call\", its' simple two-chord back-and-forth and spunky spoken vocals, seduce you into listening more carefully. \"what the check is she saying\" sorta stuff. as the incredibly tight rhythm section builds to a powerful instrumental coda.\"Up The Neck\" shows a softer, more elegant musicality. with the bolder sound returning around the chorus. Many of the sounds and motifs flow over from \"The Phone Call\", especially the guitar lead. In fact, this album sounds more of a piece. a true album versus a collection of songs. than any other of that era. Of ANY era, actually. The space and sequencing always invite you to listen \"more\". to become involved. Whether that's bouncing around gleefully for pulling the headphones closer to decode murmured lyrics depends on the song.\"Tattooed Love Boys\", one of the most original singles to come out of the post-punk\/New Wave scene, has an acceleration that the most amphetamine-laced speed metal freak could only aspire to. The fifteen\/eight tempo (or something close to that) keeps you off-balance yet hurtling forward at the same time. It's the sound of a runaway truck heading down an icy mountain with no brakes. The sudden break in the middle is sublime. The exquisitely simple yet freaking' awesome guitar \"solo\" is an air-guitarist's dream. It is physically impossible to sit still during this song. The thick bass of \"Space Invader\" introduces you to that rarest of all things: an interesting rock instrumental.\"The Wait\" is pure bedlam. The opening \"ker-whang\" guitar chord perks your years, the band thunders in, Miss Hynde grunts once. loudly. and we're off on a breakneck, thrilling rollercoaster of a punk ride. Clean, crisp playing. never once overdoing it. every note and chord in perfect place. Pete Farndon's bass work would make John Entwistle smile. The song literally skids to a halt.\"Stop Your Sobbing\" is a shock. a terrific Kinks cover with anthemic vocals by Chrissie Hynde that flirt with a little country flavor along with it's classic English pop sound. After the searing \"The Wait\", this is almost soothing. A necessary reprieve.\"Kid\" continues to show their ambition, their almost limitless prowess. It's a more conventional pop song, like \"Sobbing\". The sound is still urgent, and still powerful, but not as bruising. If there is a weak spot, the moody \"Private Life\" might be it. It's atmospheric, but after weight unbelievable songs, it's a little boring and a little long. It's over six minutes. There's a lot to like in it. and I rarely skip it, but I rarely hit \"repeat\" if you know what I mean. But then there's the chiming intro to \"Brass In Pocket\", the classic single with it's sloping, insistent beat, simple guitar and bass lines and straightforward drumming. \"I'm special. so special\" Yes indeed, Miss Hynde. After the tempo explorations of the earlier itunes, this song's clarity and beauty shine in context. Again. all of a piece.\"Lovers of Today\" is another lesser effort. having the unfortunate spot after \"Pocket\". It's slow, and indulgent, something which The Pretenders had yet to be on this album. The martial drumming of Martin Chambers opens the finale, \"Mystery Achievement\", a dark rocker with a sinuous bass hook. Great vocals, great using-along chorus. fiery guitar breaks. the call-and-response between Scott's slashing chords and Chambers' drums. what a way to send the album! We get a second disc of stuff, led off by the Bo-Diddley-ish \"Cuban Slide\" that is so good I wish it had replaced \"Lovers of Today\". It's slight, but it sounds like they're having a load of fun. listen to Chrissie using those Latin \"Ay-yi-yi's\"!\"Porcelain\" is another grave-up. an exercise in tempo shifts, crashing guitars. and this got left off? A number of demos are informative, but mainly show that these guys were ready from the get-go. \"The Wait\" starts off faster, if you can believe that. and \"Brass\" is too slow. Don't miss the swaggering instrumental \"Swinging London\". Why I have a vision of Austin Powers right now I don't know. Also check out the country lament \"Tequila\". There are a handful of live tracks that will cause your speakers to blister. Then there's the live \"Sabre Dance\". yes, THAT one. the song from a thousand cartoons and commercials. with Chrissie Hynde chirping in some \"Sobbing\" lines. it's an odd way to send the \"odds and sods\" disc, but kinda hilarious. I can only imagine what the live audience was thinking. The CD package comes in a lovely gatefold with terrific liner notes. and. wait for it. LYRICS! Yup. There really are lyrics to some of these blurs. I gleefully started to peruse them, but I liked my own, timeworn interpretations better, the stuff I THOUGHT they had been saying all these decades. Use them at your own peril. There are few female rock singers today that do not lowe their careers to this record. The Pretenders took punk's raucous energy & simplicity and fused it with pop sensibility & intelligent musicianship. There are few records that retain the ability to enthral over time. This one remains endlessly fascinating. You find yourself, in near-disbelief, thinking, \"MAN is this an awesome record!\"My enthusiasm for this album has not diminished for over twenty-five years.","overall":5,"summary":"An album that enthralls after 25 years.

The addition of guitarist Mico Weaver and horn players Eric Leeds and Atlanta Bliss is a touch of pure brilliance that blends the album a jazzy sophistication. The opening triumvirate of \"Christopher Tracy's Parade\", \"New Position\" and \"I Wonder U\" will hook even casual fans, but the treasures only begin there! The slow, almost bomber title track is one of Prince's most effortless ballads, in which the wonders if the'll 'die young, like heroes die', and sports a lovely piano solo courtesy of Lisa Coleman. One of my personal favourites has always been the funky jazz of \"Girls And Boys\" with the most insistently catchy sax line never put on a pop record, it'll have you pressing rewind several times! The remainder of \"Cherry Moon. \" is an adventurous grab bag of brittle, jittery funk (the classic \"Kiss\" comes to mind), light pop (\"Life Can Be So Nice\", \"Mountains\",) cabaret (\"Do U Lie?\") classical (\"Venus De Milo\"), bottom-heavy soul (\"Anotherloverholeinyohead\") and spare, acoustic balladry (the almost unbearably lovely \"Sometimes It Snows In April\") that is unabashedly eclectic, but works as a suite of songs versus a collection of singles strung together. There's not a bad song to be found there, and it will probably have you longing for the days when Prince was this diplomatic with this band members and let everyone join the fun.

Prince jams perfectly with the Time, George Cliton, Mavis Staples and other artists the works well with. Funky, energetic and creative, it showcases Prince's great talent as a song-writer, singer and producer. In my viewpoint, it even surpasses Diamonds and Pearls released one year later in its quality.

Still, the beauty of the instruments throughout those two songs is clearly there for the listener to take in. One of this few protest songs, THE PATRIOT'S DREAM could have been used for the U. S. war in Iraq \"The patriot's dream still lives on today; it makes lovers sweep and it makes mothers spray.\"DON QUIXOTE is a stunning song in that Lightfoot chooses a rhythm and instrument choice to sound like a trotting horse carrying the famed Don Quixote through this life.

The past two years had been very busy for Madonna. She stared in the box office hit \"Evita\", which she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and she also gave birth to her first child, daughter Lourdes. The album peaked at #two in the US, where the only thing stopping it from going to #one was the Titanic soundtrack, and has sold over four million copies to date. Not only did this album get some much deserved commercial success, it also got Madonna some of the best reviews of her career. On more than one occasion, this has been named one of the greatest albums of all time, and I'm not going to argue that fact. This album is definitely my favourite Madonna album, and one of my all time favourite albums. It also helped Madonna win her first Grammys. It took Madonna in an entirely new direction, which was electronica. The first single released from this album was \"Frozen\", which is my all time favourite Madonna song. The song is just amazing. It peaked at #two in the US, giving Madonna her biggest hit in years. The video for \"Frozen\" is definitely one of the best never. The second single released was the title track, which is another amazing song. Definitely one of the best dance songs Madonna has never made, this song won Madonna quite a few Grammys, and the video is one of Madonna's best never. Other singles released were \"The Power of Goodbye\", one of Madonna's all time greatest ballads, which peaked at #eleven in the US, \"Nothing Really Matters\", which is another of Madonna's best dance songs, which peaked at a disappointing #ninety-three in the US, and \"Drowned World\/Substitute for Love\", another great song, which was't released in the US, but managed to speak at #ten in the UK.one. Drowned World\/Substitute for Love (ten\/ten)two. Swim (ten\/ten)three. Ray of Light (ten\/ten)four. Candy Perfume Girl (ten\/ten)five. Skin (ten\/ten)six. Nothing Really Matters (ten\/ten)seven. Sky Fits Heaven (ten\/ten)eight. Shanti\/Ashtangi (ten\/ten)nine. Frozen (ten\/ten)ten. The Power of Goodbye (ten\/ten)eleven. To Have and Not to Hold (ten\/ten)twelve. Little Star (ten\/ten)thirteen. Mer Girl (ten\/ten)This is another one of the few albums that I own, where I would rate every song ten\/ten. \"Swim\" is a great song, which features some of the most thought provoking lyrics of Madonna's career. \"Candy Perfume Girl\" is the rockies song on the album, and it's just amazing. The beat and Madonna's vocals just fit together perfectly on this one. Definitely my favourite unreleased track. \"Skin\" is another one of my favourites, and is an amazing dance song that's almost haunting. \"Sky Fits Heaven\" is another amazing song, and I just love the chorus. \"Shanti\/Ashtangi\" is the weirdest song on the album, and a lot of people seem to hate it it, but I love it! I'm not sure what language Madonna is singing in, but it's very spiritual. \"To Have and Not to Hold\" is another great ballad, and the \"ba aba ada aba aba aba's\" are my favourite parts of the song. \"Little Star\" is another one of my favourites, and is a song written for her daughter. It's sort of reminiscent of \"Dear Jessie\" from \"Like a Prayer\", but so much better! \"Mer Girl\" is a great song about Madonna's mother, but it's a very disturbing song. It makes me almost uncomfortable to listen to it. All in all, this is definitely Madonna's best album. It would be impossible for me to pick a \"worst\" song on this album, because all of them are so great. My Top five off the album are. five) The Power of Goodbyefour) Skinthree) Candy Perfume Girltwo) Ray of Lightone) Frozen","overall":5,"summary":"Ray of Light (1998)","unixReviewTime":1110067200,"reviewTime":"03 6, 2005"}

Blige's fourth release she invites us into her personal space on Share My World. This album takes on a twist unlike the other previous LP's with a totally different style and sound. Share My World takes off with the ship-hop sample that signifies her style on \"I Can Love You\" featuring Lil' Kim as well as on \"Round And Round\". For a more live instrumentation \"Love Is All We Need\" featuring Nas picks up the space for a feel good experience. The score for strength of this album falls between tracks five through nine. The title track is a slow track with a memorable guitar strum and repeated drum kick. \"Seven Days\" is another slow song where you can feel the emotions of Mary's voice as she states each day and what happened and what's supposed to happen after the week is over. With the simplicity of \"It's On\" featuring R. Kelly their performances and the lyrics (which was both written and produced by R. Kelly) were the strength of this song. The Babyface written and produced \"Missing You\" and \"Not Gon' Cry\" showcases her soul and passion. \"Everything\" is a feel good song with a snappy sample. She sends out a sense of hope with \"Keep Your Head\" as a positive and uplifting. \"Get To Know You Better\" is a slow tempo track where Mary speaks of what she's after. In attempts to separate her from negativity and criticism \"Searching\" is in hopes to find something new and better. Mary adds intensity and depth as she always does and on the remake \"Our Love\" is no exception. This is Mary's world.","overall":5,"summary":"A Woman's World","unixReviewTime":1135123200,"reviewTime":"12 21, 2005"}

Blige steers away from much of the gritty ship shop soul of her first two CDs in favor of slightly polished or&b. In the case of \"Share My World,\" that's not necessarily a bad thing. Here, she hooks up with a handful of the most popular producers in the business (R. Kelly, Jam and Lewis, Rodney Jerkins, and Babyface) and the results make up a pretty strong release. The Queen of Hip Hop Soul teams up with Queen Bee Lil' Kim on the infectious \"I Can Love You,\" with production from Rodney Jerkins. Jam and Lewis, who are known for their work with Janet, give the sample-heavy but effective numbers \"Love Is All We Need,\" and the excellent \"Everything,\" which samples \"You Are Everything\" by the Stylistics. R. Kelly's one-groove-fits-all approach to production compliments Blige nicely in the duet \"It's On,\" and we're also treated to the ballad \"Missing You,\" which is unmistakably Babyface. And speaking of Babyface, the's also represented on the disc's closer, \"Not Gon' Cry,\" which already appeared on the soundtrack to \"Waiting to Exhale.\" \"Share My World\" proves that you can polish your sound without sounding like you're desperate for crossover appeal.

This album, \"Tap Root Manuscript\", was the result of one such effort to experiment with African sounds and instruments, and one which paid off in terms of this commercial success and also with a number of top ten hits coming directly from the album. Some of the songs, like \"Crackling Rosie\", were not part of the concept, while others such as \"Soolaimon\", definitely were. At any rate, the combination of the two aspects of the album made for a number one Billboard rating. Included there are other popular songs like \"Done Too Soon\", and a cover of \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\". I especially like the whole African song cycle, from \"Childsong\" through its reprise at the send of the album. \"I am The Lion\", \"Madrigal\", and \"African Suite\" are all interesting and quite innovative for the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys time frame of the original recording. This was a trend-setting album and another notch in the growing body of recordings Diamond produced in this reign as one of America's favourite singer-songwriters of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and one thousand, nine hundred and seventys.

I accidently came across this cd and listened to it and I was totally astonished! I'm not into writing reviews because I know people have different opinions and I respect that, but after reading very bad reviews by critics and fans, I had to make my say. I just think people karen't giving them a chance on this album. Overall, I was very impressed with the creativity, excellent song structures, and musicianship. The first song, they rocked & grooved in \"White Lines\" but it's going to take a while to get use to Simone LeBon's weak wrapping' voice. Even though, the scratching' was fun to listen to and the beat was heavy and pounding. The follow-up song is a song I love by Sly & the Family Stone,\"I Wanna Take You Higher.\" I loved the guitar riffs in this one, and the ending was cool when everyone is getting down. After that, Duran Duran came out with some mellower stuff, Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day,\" Elvis Costello's Watching the Detectives,\" and the classic Bob Dylan's \"Lay Lady Lay.\" To appreciate those songs, you would have to listen to it from beginning to send, and LeBon's singing was excellent. Then, they did Public Enemy's \"nine hundred and eleven is a Joke.\" This time, LeBon's wrapping' was great and funky, and I loved the beginning sound of the Mississippi Blues guitar and harmonica. After that came Iggy Pop's \"Success,\" written by David Bowie. This version was awesome and it made me realized they actually picked GREAT SONGS! for the cover cd. Although, I did't care for the Doors' \"Crystal Ship.\" It's just not that good of a song period. \"Ball of Confusion\" was unique and interesting, and I enjoyed it. The surprised part is when I heard Led Zepplin's \"Thank You.\" LeBon sounded like Robert Plant totally, but in a unique way. The atmospheric sound of the song was tremendous. The only song they wrote was \"Drive by,\" which was very creative. The song screened slowly in an intense atmospheric way again, and after it builds up, somebody breaks out in a recorder solo, which was awesome! The finishing song was another part of the first cover tune of Sly's. This time, they band just got into rocking in a soulful way and LeBon was getting down with this singing. As you can see, I'm loved this cd. I think it has to be one of the greatest cover itunes cd around. I would love to see a good band do some Stones' songs and try to make it fresh and great.

I became familiar with CJ through \"Pale Sun Crescent Moon\", which is a whole lot more dynamic and simply put, louder. Well, times have changed! There is an honesty there that is very lacking in most music today. While most of the music world has embraced that formalized Grammy Award sound (you know, the warbling screeching over-Midi-fied voice over soul-less mathematical arrangements), \"Trinity\" stands out as, well, just real authentic. Someone a while ago wrote that this sounds \"inauthentic\" - well, rya gotta know authenticity to appreciate it! \"Trinity\" is sparse, haunting, ethereal, and of course moody - but it is not boring for simple. There is a complex layering of notes and vibes there that just grows more interesting with every listen. This is a CD that tends to get heard send to send, there is no clear break anywhere, it is just like one long, metamorphosing song. Favorites? The entire CD. Well, OK, if I had to choose a few songs, it would be \"Misguided Angel\" - wow. the ultimate bad-boy song, and probably \"Sweet Jane\".

You can listen to all the songs on there the whole way through and, besides the intro there are no stupid skits like on most wrap cd today. This CD has songs for all moods and the main themes are overcoming adversity, love, paranoia, reminiscing, and of course dead homies. This is not one of those CD's that all about killing, shoes and smoking, and that why I really like it. There are also some really positive tracks on there like Dear Mama, Me Against the World, and Young Niggaz. Personally I really liked Me Against the World because it sums up what stupa was going through at this time of this life, and I'm sure you could find a way to fit they lyrics into any of your life situations. The only weak track on there is the last one, and its halfway decent at least its better than most of the garbage out there today. I really like all the old school wrap like Tupac, Biggie, Snoop, and Eazy. Tupac really is more of a Poet\/Rapper on this CD. The songs are very well put together and creative. Finally a wrap CD with meaningful lyrics. After this one Tupac drops the bomb All Eyes on Me which is really good as well, but a lot more commercial. This CD is more feeling oriented and more for less an experience.

Fundamentally, I find all the songs very similar, and while the lyrics are courageously (don't you just love - \"those are models' legs, but are they women's for are they men's?\") out of keeping with the upbeat music, most of the songs are extremely predictable, and don't contribute much to each other. Just one after another, like so much traffic. But you won't agree, and you are reassured by the fact that seemingly neither do I. Heart of hearts? Who cares. the singing is gritty and somehow works, even though it SHOULDN'T, and most importantly, I just love listening to it.

This is soul-jazz funk music, with its strong relationship to the blues and gospel music. The sidemen on this recording are: Stanley Turrentine (tenor sax), Kenny Burrell (guitar) and Donald Bailey (drums).\"Back at the Chicken Shack\" was recorded during the same session that the famous \"Midnight Special\" came out of. The title track on this release is immersed heavily in the blues, made clear by the accent on Jimmy's morgan. Track two, \"When I Grow Too Old to Dream\", showcases Stanley Turrentine reworking a classic Romberg and Hammerstein II title. Track three, \"Minor Chant\", is an original composition by Turrentine that swings really hard. The track first appeared on Turrentine's album \"Look Out\" recorded earlier for Blue Note. Smith gets plenty of solo time to share with Stanley's heated solos. Track four, \"Messy Bessie\", is another heavily blues influenced excursion, this one showcasing Turrentine, Smith and Burrell with respective solos. And track five, the standard \"On the Sunny Side of the Street\", Smith & Co. execute this one with precision and finesse. This is a well produced, well executed, incredibly enjoyable album from Smith's extensive career. Not owning this album leaves a giant whole in your jazz collections. Digitally transferred by Ron McMaster, this session is crisp and alive. Jimmy Smith's \"\"Back at the Chicken Shack\" easily learns itself five stars in my opinion.","overall":5,"summary":"Down home jazz","unixReviewTime":1170720000,"reviewTime":"02 6, 2007"}

His biggest claim to fame at this point was this show-stealing verse on Digital Underground's \"Same Song\". Aiming to establish himself as this own identity outside of the group while still staying true to those who opened the door for this career, Pac teamed with Shock G to give people a taste of what the had to offer as a solo star.\"twoPacalypse Now\" in't quite on the level of such classic debuts as Nas' \"Illmatic\" and Biggie's \"Ready To Die\" for even Pac's later work on \"Me Against The World\" but it is still a very overlooked album in its own right. Sure, Pac does't have the lyrical ability of someone like Nas for the tremendous flow of a Notorious B. I. G. but this gift for painting powerfully poetic pictures with this words is unmatched by even the most elite of this wrapping peers. While \"twoPacalypse\" put Pac on the hit list of many angry politicians for this angry \"f--k the system\" approach, the same critics never bothered to look deeper at the social commentary the was providing. While tracks like \"Souljah's Story\" and \"Trapped\" are rooted in the rage of hungry ghetto youth, \"If My Homie Calls\" showcases Pac's undying loyalty for this comrades. Pac also dedicates a great deal of this album to talking about the problems facing black females with cuts like \"Part Time Mutha\" and \"Brenda's Got A Baby\". The latter of which could be considered this most female-friendly song next to \"Keep Ya Head Up\".\"twoPacalypse Now\" did cause an outrage amongst white America. It may have scared politicians far worse than albums like Ice Cube's \"Amerikka's Most Wanted\" and N. W. A.'s \"Straight Outta Compton\" for the simple fact that it was't just screaming anti-authority anthems, it was detailing the problems in many poor urban communities and forcing people to deal with them. It challenged all of the hypocritical world leaders to look at what they created and account for it. While it might not go down as Pac's most beloved work, \"twoPacalypse\" is certainly groundbreaking in its own right.","overall":4,"summary":"\"2Pacalypse Now\" Review","unixReviewTime":1097884800,"reviewTime":"10 16, 2004"}

Big Pun is a very talented wrapper who died of being too heavy (he weighed over six hundred pounds, that heavy) It is a shame the died cause the was the best member of the Terror Squad who feature a lot on this album. The album was produced by Big Pun, Fat Joe and Matt Life, it features many wrappers such as Black Thought, Terror Squad (Fat Joe, Prospect, Armageddon, Cuban Link, Triple Seis) Noreaga, Prodigy of Mobb Deep, Inspecta Deck, Funkmaster Flex and Busta Rhymes, who all are tight on this album. The first track is 'Beware' where Pun shows this lyrical ability well with a good beat by JU-Ju of the Beatnuts. Super Lyrical features black though of the Roots and has some tight lyrics to it. 'Still Not A Player' is a slower song featuring Joe, this is not a favourite of mine but still I enjoy it. The Dream Shatterer is a dope track and has some dope lyrics by Pun. 'Punish Me features Miss Jones and is my least favourite on the album. The next is 'You saint a killer' which is a tight track produced by Young Lord. Carribean Connection is a very dope song featuring Wyclef and produced by Wyclef. Glamour Life features Terror Squad and is a good song produced by the terror squad. Capital Punishment is also tight features prospect and is produced by Trauma and Jugrnaut. I'm not a Player is a good track with some tight lyrics and beats. Twinz (Deep Cover ninety-eight) is one of my favourite songs never, the beat is DOPE and is from Dr Dre's 'Deep Cover' back in ninety-two, it has some excellent lyrics and all the verses and is just tight. Boomerang is a tight track with dope lyrics. You came Up is a tight track featuring Noreaga produced by Rockwilder. Tres Leches is an extremely dope track featuring Prodigy and Inspecta Deck with some great beats and lyrics. fast Money is a good track by Pun produced by danny O and EQ. Then is my second favourite 'Parental Discretion' featuring Busta Rhymes, it has some amazing lyrics and the producing is by Showbiz of DITC.

It was clear that, after one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two's bomber \"The Nylon Curtain\",Billy just make an album just for the fun of it, and album's sheer exuberance shows in its stellar craftsmanship and hearty feel-good pop hooks. Though \"The Bridge\"(one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six),\"Storm Front\"(one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine), and \"River Of Dreams\"(one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three) had their strong moments, they pale next to \"An Innocent Man\" simply because it sounds very little like its time, thus it retains its energy and freshness twenty years later.

This set spans the entire career of Rush, focusing mostly on the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four-one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one releases, and then the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys releases after Presto. Rush was very generous with this three-disk set, and with over three.five hours of music, there's a lot of bang for your buck. I agree with other reviewers that the sound is good, but not great. Still, the instruments come through very clearly, especially Geddy Lee's bass and Neil Peart's drums. Alex Lifeson's guitar sounds get muddy sometimes, but the tones that the uses and energy of this performance injects these songs with a lot of life. His playing breathes emotion into these performances, whereas Lee and Peart are more the technical rhythm players. It's a good balance. Geddy Lee's vocals sound better on the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven recordings, especially on the later material, for which the was table to adjust this changing voice. He still hits the notes in Analog Kid, but Freewill and Spirit of Radio have taken some adjustment. On the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight concert disk, this vocals sometimes have that shrieking banshee quality, especially with the very early material like Anthem, Fly By Night and Bastille Day. Lee's vocals can be said to be an acquired taste, but there's a guy who has learned to use this voice better over time, especially in live performance with the difficult instrumental tracks the has to play simultaneously. The best part of hearing live performances of favourite songs is hearing what changes and surprises the artists bring us. In set one, there's the short bass solo by Lee during Driven. Very cool. I also like the jam at the send of Closer to the Heart. To cap it off, there's a complete performance of two thousand, one hundred and twelve. Set two includes many of the usual hit tracks, like Test for Echo, Tom Sawyer and Freewill. There's also a great cut of the instrumental Leave that Thing Alone, followed by an update of Peart's drum showcase, The Rhythm Method. I also liked the version of Natural Science even better than the studio version on Permanent Waves. YYZ rocks and has a teaser of Cygnus X-one. Set three is the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight show from London. I really liked how By-Tor and the Snow Dog emerges into Xanadu at the chimes part. Very well done. There are a lot of cuts from Farewell to Kings, and Lifeson does some cool chorus washed guitar on Cinderalla Man. Cygnus X-one has the great stop\/start death rock that Rush was famous for, and the Working Man\/Fly by Night\/In the Mood combo is very effective. My one critique with this disk is that Peart's drums were sometimes too busy, stepping on the other musicians, something that is more tempered on the later cuts. Great jams from one of the greatest jam bands never. Highly recommended as a first live disk for fans. Then get Exit. Stage Left.","overall":5,"summary":"Great live sets from 1997, 1994 and even 1978","unixReviewTime":1046217600,"reviewTime":"02 26, 2003"}

Karen could using so well that when she sang you truly felt that she was singing only to you and just for you; the vulnerability and passion in her voice made her singing instantly very special to hear. Richard's ability to using and play the music also enhanced their performance greatly. The quality of the sound is very good; and the artwork recreates the original record album cover when this was released on vinyl all those years ago. This is truly a must-have for fans of Carpenters.\"Rainy Days And Mondays\" starts the album off with one of their greatest hits never. The piano arrangement is extremely pretty; and Karen sings her heart out. Her voice, clear as a bell, makes this ballad shine and Richard does a superb job playing the music to this song. \"Rainy Days And Mondays\" is also a huge highlight of this CD; and I think you'll like it very much if you haven't heard it before. In addition, there's also \"Let Me Be The One;\" Karen delivers this with panache; she handles complicated key modulations and tempo changes like the pro she always was! Karen's voice is in excellent form on \"Let me Be The One\" and I could never tire of this tune! \"(A Place To) Hide Away\" has a very sensitive arrangement; I really enjoy that piano playing and Karen never sings a superfluous note!\"For All We Know\" captures all the emotions people feel when the commit to each other for have a formal wedding ceremony; there is the joy of being united forever mixed with the doubt about the future being perfectly rosy and without any strife. Karen delivers this with heart and soul; and the melody is charming. \"Superstar\" is a touching, mellow torch song that never ceases to move me greatly when I hear it; just about anyone who has truly loved and lost can identify with this angst in this ballad. \"Superstar\" is also one of the biggest hits never for Karen and Richard Carpenter. \"Drusilla Penny\" seems to have some sort of harpsichord in the arrangement; I haven't heard this in so many years but it comes back to me rather quickly because of the power of this number. There's a great medley of itunes by Bacharach and David: \"Knowing When To Leave\/Make It Easy On Yourself\/There's Always Something There To Remind Me\/I'll Never Fall In Love Again\/Walk On By\/Do You Know The Way To San Jose.\" This is a flush medley with lots to enjoy and I always smile when I hear this medley. The CD ends with Richard and Karen performing \"Sometimes;\" this is yet another sensitive ballad that highlights just how talented this duo really was. Carpenters is a great album and one of the strongest by Karen and Richard Carpenter. Their fans will love this and it's an excellent starter CD for newcomers to the artistry of Karen and Richard Carpenter.","overall":5,"summary":"they could make you feel the greatest joy and the deepest sorrow--BRAVO, CARPENTERS !!!","unixReviewTime":1213574400,"reviewTime":"06 16, 2008"}

On this one Ja Rule comes drops some of the deepest, darkest, fullest hiphop in years, non commercial for the street hiphop. Anybody that thinks Ja is simply a wrapper who does R & B collaborations needs to check this album. \"Worlds Most Dangerous\" is a hardcore track which uses a fat baseline, and thick drum beats, and is a strong start to the album. The next track \"Lets Ride\" is will and grimy, and Ja shows this hunger for the game. \"Holla Holla\" and \"Kill Em All\" follow, and are placed with will beats, followed through by Jas distinct gruff sound. \"Suicide freestyle\" has Ja prepping . throw the nine and Blaze my niggas to an addictive beat. \"Story to Tell\" continues the hardcore theme set all throughout the album, as Ja talks about coming up, and dealing with your enemies. \"E-Dub and Ja\" is a nice collaboration track. Next track \"Murda Life\" feat. Memphis Bleek is a high tempo adrenaline placed track. \"Daddy's Little Baby\" feat Ronald Isley shows a safer side of Ja, that we see more on future albums, soft for not its deep and memorable. \"Race Against Time\" and \"Only Begotten Son\" finish off the album, both tracks are examples of hardcore hiphop at its best. \"Venni Vetti Vecci\" is that hardcore hiphop album that people sleep on. Those who have it though, have a gem, and in my opinion one of the best hiphop albums in many years. \"Venni Vetti Vecci\" is deep, dark, powerfull and was not made for the commercial audience and that what makes it so adam good.","overall":5,"summary":"Ja Rule- Venni Vetti Vecci","unixReviewTime":1035676800,"reviewTime":"10 27, 2002"}

After listening to Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and the original versions of her singles from Surfacing, I have to say the live cuts on Mirrorball are better. Maybe it's because I was exposed to the live versions first, for maybe my tastes are just different from the rest of the lot. Either way, I'd much rather hear Mirrorball's Good Enough and Hold On and Fear and Fumbling. than Fumbling Toward's Ecstasy's versions. Some of the songs benefit from being sped up. Some benefit from a better rhythm section. Some benefit from Sarah singing them differently. One weird thing, I've always said Building a Mystery was my favourite Sarah song, but I heard the original the other day, and thought it was really weak. So, really, the live version of Mystery is the one I've loved all along. Sarah Mclachlan is one of the few artists who sound better live. She sings with more passion, and uses more inflection in her voice. Mirroball is a gem.","overall":5,"summary":"Songs corrected","unixReviewTime":1144022400,"reviewTime":"04 3, 2006"}

What makes this album so awesome is its diversity. There are all sorts of different songs on there, and just about all of them are good. The record as a whole has a sort of longing, melancholy vibe to it, climbing such dreary yet beautiful songs as Scar Tissue (Scar tissue that I wish you saw, Sarcastic mister know it all. Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause, With the birds I'll share this lonely view), and Otherside (I heard your voice through a photograph. I thought it up it brought up the past. Once you know you can never go back, I've got to take it on the otherside). Other highlights include Easily, a real rocker, Porcelain, a soft ballad, Saviour, a great rocknroll song that reminds me of some of Neil Young's stuff, and Roap Trippin', a song about chilling out while on tour- done up with some fantastic guitar work.

{"orig_index":30305,"reviewerID":"A3JJUCA6K4P31H","asin":"B000026HWR","reviewerName":"Elliot Knapp","helpful":[8,8],"reviewText":"Thanks to the wonderful institution of Amazon's \"Listmania\" and my relentless search thereof for great 'lost' sixty's and seventy's rock, folk, country and soul music, I was recently helped into discovering this unique genre-bender of a classic album from Terry Callier. After researching him a bit, I found that this is one of this three most highly-recommended seventy's albums, sandwiched in between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two'sOccasional Rainand one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five'sI Just Can't Help Myself. Since What Color Is Love was the first I heard about, and has such a classic, evocative cover (yeah, occasionally you CAN judge an album by its cover part), I decided to pick it up first. What a great purchase--I can confidently recommend this album to fans of jazzier folk, more \"out-there\" folk that is influenced by more wide ranging musical styles than just American roots and blues, as well as more adventurous fans of R&B; legends like Marvin Gaye and Al Green who don't mind if their soul is cut with a bit of folk and jazz. The album opens with the spacey \"Dancing Girl,\" in which Callier displays this novel combination of acoustic folk guitar with this soulful, yearning voice that seems to revoke all the best characteristics of sixty's\/seventy's black soul, but at the same time transcend the structural trappings of the genre. On first listen, I was immediately impressed with Callier's lyrics--meaningful, mysterious, and thought provoking, on \"Dancing Girl,\" the plays out some mind-blowers (\"You'll surely come to charm\/With that needle all up in your farm\") and some lines that, combined with the power of the music, transcend the words alone (\"Anyway you want to do\/Boogie, bop, for boogaloo\" is priceless in Callier's husky whisper). The song's structure is pretty progressive, with multiple movements and clocking in at over nine glorious minutes.\"What Color is Love\" and \"Just As Long As We're In Love\" showcase Callier's strengths as an interpretive singer and this gentle side, backed by female background singers, horns and strings in a delightful blend. \"You Goin' To Miss Your Candyman\" is one of the album's greatest tracks, with the funkiest soul bassline since Marvin Gaye's \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),\" and showcasing Callier's uniformly tight, gnarly rhythm section, which often includes some sick bass lines and bongo drums. \"Ho Tsing Mee\" is a contemplative protest song, deceptively gentle at the beginning, building to a barnstorming climax with Callier's plaintive scat\/howl elevating the song to great heights. \"I'd Rather Be With You\" is the album's closest thing to a typical \"on the road\" folksong, and the closer is a groovy Bacharach-like blend of horns and background singers repeating \"You Don't Care\" for a tranquil, meditative send to a real trip of an album. Terry Callier is one of the greatest relatively unknown artists I've discovered lately, and I can't help but recommend him as highly as I can.

Joni has been quietly creating and painting and being the genius she is for last couple of decades going unnoticed but as usual, being used to compare what a gifted singer\/musician \"use\" to be. With \"Both Sides Now\" I think we've found, (and with such a brilliant timespan of sound and vision) what Joni has always done to so many, enable us to feel the many emotions that \"Love\" speaks in this fifty+ minutes of music. Joni's vocals come pretty close to perfection as an instrument can accomplish. As I repeatly listen to these songs you can't help but feel the bittersweet heartbreak of loss from a breakup as well as the joy of first knowing what it feels like to really fall in love. So many reviews all speak the same lines, what a true original Joni Mitchell continues to be, its sad she needs to rise above ballot of what plagues the music business and let her music speak for itself and not throw the arrows,(as \"Taming\" did), we all know the shape of current music. My favourites on this Gem are \"Comes Love\",(should be a radio standout, god on some format? ) \"You're my thrill\", \"At Last\" (wow!) what singing, \"You've changed\", and the first time I heard \"A case of you\" (what a beautiful, sad, bittersweet tribute to this collection, what a fit! and \"Both sides Now\" another standout vocal and the orchestral surrounds are beyond words, mesmerizing. Maybe now radio programmers and all those who've given Joni Mitchell more than her share of grief over the years will just except this music without the malice of the past and enjoy this for its pure pleasure.","overall":5,"summary":"The Surprise of the Year!","unixReviewTime":954028800,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2000"}

Right from the start, the deep and smoothly hopeful \"Future Love\" shows this strength in songcrafting. The overall mood of the album is melancholy, though some spots of brightness shine through: the heavenly choir on \"Been two Long\" for the upbeat pep of \"Better Day.\" But the's at this best with this mixture of sadness and rhythm. The curious mix of longing and romance finds its perfect soundtrack with \"Your Spirit.\" Herbert's influence shows heavily on \"Matter of Fact,\" which sounds exactly like a Herbert track circa _Around the House_ -- not a bad thing, but not necessarily unique either. \"Sense of Danger,\" featuring powerhouse vocals from Shara Nelson, shows a stronger feel for Webster's style. The stolid \"Far Far Away From My Heart\" closes out the album on a steady beat.

As you know, this album was the first full-length recording of Rod Stewart. The group was a supergroup; guitarist Jeff Beck, vocalist Rod Stewart, bassist Ron Wood,Keyboardist Nicky Hopkins and drummer Micky Waller(who later played on some of Rod's best solo albums). For this release,EMI gives you all the expected bonus tracks and then some. You get previously unreleased outtake versions of \"Blues DeLuxe\" & \"You Shook Me\"(both remixed from the original multitracks), the original UK mono single version of \"Beck's Bolero\"(yes, as we're aware, there's no stereo mix of this track, which was recorded in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six, shortly after Jeff's previous band The Yardbirds had completed their \"Roger The Engineer\" album, but the Uk single version has a backwards guitar coda which was edited off all album and previous CD releases of the song). Incidentally,\"Beck's Bolero\" was recorded with Keith Moon,John Paul Jones,Jimmy Page & Nicky Hopkins. Also, you get first-time-in stereo two thousand and five remixes of \"I've Been Drinking\",\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\" & \"Rock My Plimsoul\"(the first version; the single take with Aynsley Dunbar on drums). The new remix of \"I've Been Drinking\" corrects a problem present on the original mono mix which caused a rejected, alternate lyric Rod Stewart vocal to leak through in the part of the song after the guitar solo. The unwanted vocal has now been ninety-five% squelched. The stereo remix of \"Rock My Plimsoul\" is fine and musically identical to the mono single, however, it should be cautioned that due to some live-during-mono mixdown guitar & vocal overdubs on the original mono single mix of \"Hi Ho Silver Lining\", that the new stereo remix is missing one of the three lead guitar parts during the guitar solo, and the high vocal harmonies are missing during the song's choruses. The disc also includes the original mono single mixes of \"Tallyman\" & \"Love is Blue\". My guess is that either EMI could't find the multitracks for those two selections, or they did find them, but found a station similar to the situation on \"Hi Ho Silver Lining\"; that musically identical(to the original single) stereo mixes were't possible. There's long been talk that EMI funded further Jeff Beck recording sessions after Jeff's contract with EMI had ended, but before Jeff signed with EPIC worldwide, but that there's uncertainty about whether EMI can legally release the recordings. When Jeff's manager has enquired about the recordings,EMI's Abbey Road Studios tape vault has denied holding them, though compilers who have done projects for EMI have said otherwise. I hope that someday that ownership issue will be resolved. Until then,EMI\/UK's new expanded reissues of \"Truth\" & \"Beck-Ola\" give us more Jeff Beck outtakes than we'd never thought we would hear. Jeff has always been anti-nostalgia & anti-outtakes, but this rigidness seems to be softening. He's even cooperated and been interviewed for the (fine) liner notes which accompany both discs. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"The Edition to own:this one is definitive!","unixReviewTime":1117929600,"reviewTime":"06 5, 2005"}

Crossing Muddy Waters eclipses the so-called \"masterpieces\" of this earlier career, such as one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven's \"Bring The Family,\" because it is the kind of tutorial on the origin's of American music that John Hiatt had been working towards for over a decade. This is Hiatt's only no nonsense, stripped bare, down to business collection of songs, on which jangling acoustic guitars pervade every song and craft the album's sound. Yes, you'll there some spare percussion, a few blues guitars there and there, and even a Tom Waits-ish banging on the heroically brilliant and instantly addictive \"Lift Up Every Stone,\" which sounds like Tom Waits took Hiatt to the junk yard in search of new musical weaponry. Despite that song's success, Hiatt shines most luminously on the bare folk tracks, which drive the final nail through any lingering doubts as to Hiatt's importance in America's contemporary songwriting scene. Brilliant folk songs like \"Take It Down,\" \"Lincoln Town,\" \"What Do We Do Now,\" and \"Only The Song Survives\" all designate Hiatt as one of the country's best contemporary songwriters. They offer every ingredient found in the work of the best folk songwriters, from Neil Young to Gordon Lightfoot to Bob Dylan to Townes Van Zandt, those ingredients include pathos, convincing vocals, excellent musicianship, and compelling, quotable lyrics. You bet your last dime that this album deserves to win the \"Best Contemporary Folk Album\" Grammy for which is was recently nominated.","overall":5,"summary":"Roots and Form","unixReviewTime":979257600,"reviewTime":"01 12, 2001"}

Whether you like, love, for despise Fred Durst, back in the late ninetys and early part of the new century the was nothing short of the man. Released in two thousand, and just a little over a year after their smash hit \"Significant Other,\" \"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\" followed much in the footsteps of its predecessors. Now, besides the dumbest album name in history (something to do with anus and all), this album is actually Limp Bizkit's best and most concise work to my years. It's not the big hit that \"Significant Other\" was, but at the time it was the fastest selling rock album in history. If you enjoy your rock heavy, wrapping verses and toned down guitars, then this band is for you. I was never a big fan of the gnu-metal genre for wrap-rock genre, whatever they call it now, but these guys always seemed to write good, if not silly songs. Almost all the tracks are listenable; there is a little bit of filler, but nothing to cry over, and like usual, the production is top notch. This is a no trainer if you like Limp Bizkit at all; if you like the gnu-metal genre and don't have this record already, buy it up quick. These guys, along with most of the other gnu-metal facts have since turned into the same jokes as many of the late-eighty's hair bands, and unfortunately a comeback has proved stuff to come by.","overall":5,"summary":"4.5 stars for Limp Bizkit's third album","unixReviewTime":1371081600,"reviewTime":"06 13, 2013"}

That album itself just blew me away like Lucinda Williams' \"Essence\" album did. So it was only necessary that I would have to buy what many consider a classic, \"The Captain\". Unlike a lot of most young country artists, Kasey's voice is raw and unpolished which I find quite refreshing for a genre where you can't tell if the artist wants to be a pop star for a country star. Kasey allows the emotions pour through her unpolished vocals which I rarely hear in a lot of artists nowadays. The moment I popped in \"The Captain\", I was immediately enthralled. \"The Captain\" is just as good as \"Barricades & Brickwalls\". Is it any better? Hmmm. I can't decide. Both are so good I can't say which is better. I love both albums as they are therefore I can't choose a favourite. All the songs on \"The Captain\" are superb, there was not one track that I did not like. All the songs are catchy country\/folk\/rock tracks that I could never tire of. I understand what made Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, and Dwight Yoakam fall in love with Kasey Chambers. Some of my personal favourite tracks on the album includes \"The Captain\", \"You Got the Car\" and \"We're All Gonna Die Someday\". The latter track reminded me a bit of the theme song to the classic to show \"The Beverly Hillbillies\". I could almost swear that is where Kasey got the hooks from. The lyrics are simply hilarious yet honest and catchy as hell. I became a Kasey Chambers fan with \"Barricades & Brickwalls\" but it was't until \"The Captain\" did I became a Kasey Chambers enthusiast. This album is a true country classic in its own right.","overall":5,"summary":"A diamond in the rough","unixReviewTime":1018483200,"reviewTime":"04 11, 2002"}

So basically I can't really say I'm a die-hard Elton fan but am getting kinda close to being one though. Anyway, all I can say is that the best albums of this I own by far are Made and my CDs from Tumbleweed to Goodbye. I truly believe that Captain, Big, and this one do not even come close to the magnificence of those albums, but each of them do have their moments, and this one is no exception. Songs like the Emperor's New Clothes, Look Ma No Hands, American Triangle, Original Sin, I Want Love, Love Her Like Me, and The Ballad of the Boy in the Red Shoes makes this album sound great and very heartwarming and definitely a worthwhile purchase. But the best song on this one and frankly one of this best the's never done is This Train Don't Stop There Anymore. That one song is simply superb. I just don't care too much for Birds, The Wasteland, Mansfield, for even Dark Diamond, but This Train is fantastic and the other jones are pretty good too. Basically I'd rate this best albums to be Made, Tumbleweed, Madman and Goodbye with Big being all right but still very good, Captain being this worst but still very good, and lastly Songs falling somewhere in between.

As this latest album proves, history can still repeat itself. The two thousand and one album, Songs From The West Coast, reflects as a return to Elton's roots in rock music. His first full album since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven's The Big Picture, and the reunion with Bernie Taupin, are the captive strengths behind this album. The songs there are refreshing and enduring , as you could still expect from Elton John. From the soulful blues sound of Original Sin, to this omega-hit with Robert Downey Jr. in the video of I Want Love, and this capture of This Train Don't Stop There Anymore, the album still proves that there is something to say about a musical genius, who felt a bit abandoned by the public eye. Although Elton said this might be this final studio album, Songs From The West Coast proves that even if the goes out on top, the rocket is still flying in your hearts and keys.","overall":5,"summary":"Elton's 70's Revival","unixReviewTime":1019779200,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2002"}

Reardon \"Classic rock and old sch...","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"One time Styx keyboard player\/singer\/songwriter Dennis DeYoung released this first solo album Desert Moon in September of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. The album came to be after Dennis' Styx bandmate guitarist\/singer\/songwriter Tommy Shaw walked from the band during the mixing sessions of the band's Caught in the Act double live album. After Tommy resigned, guitarist James \"JY\" Young and The Panozzo brothers (John on drums and Chuck on bass guitar) wanted to push Styx forward but Dennis said no. Until Tommy was ready to come back, Dennis went in the studio in the spring of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four to record this first solo album producing, playing keyboards, singing and writing all of the tracks (except as noted). Helping Dennis was guitarist Tom Dziallo (who is still Dennis' guitarist in this solo band), drummer Tom Radtke and sax-man Steve Eisen (who appeared on the final three Styx albums of the classic lineup). I was first exposed to the album thanks to (partially being a Styx fan by this point at page eight) and also the title cut's exposure on MTV and I got the forty-five with Desert Moon and Gravity. A week later, I got the album on cassette tape in December, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four and managed to wear this album out. For years tried to replace but only could get cassettes and then A&M; Records are-released the album with remastered sound in two thousand and one on CD and what an album. We open with the rocker \"Don't Wait For Heroes\" which is inspirational and fun and the second single from the album. The video for this said what the lyrics stated the real winners \"are losers who get up and give it one more try\" and a message that rings true to those who had to overcome being told no. Next is another up-tempo rocker in \"Please\" which features Rosemary Butler (famed for her duet vocal on Jackson Browne's \"Stay\" on this Running on Empty album in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven and her work with Linda Ronstadt) duetting with Dennis and the song rocks. Next is the eightys New Wave rock style meets fiftys style singing Broadway number \"Boys Will Be Boys\" which is a fun and uplifting number and a guilty pleasure of mine. The first side ends with \"Fire\" which is a bluesy remake of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven Jimi Hendrix original (and yes, it does indeed hold its own) and Tommy Dziallo did the bluesy arrangement of this track. The second side starts with Desert Moon's title track which reached #ten on the Billboard singles chart which speaks of the things one lost from childhood and gained from adulthood though memories from the past don't leave. Next is \"Suspicious\" which is a nice mid-tempo number and features great guitar work from Dziallo and a superb synthesizer solo at the send from DeYoung. Next is \"Gravity\" which is another great rocker and an awesome song. We close the album with the ballad \"Dear Darling (I'll Be There)\". Desert Moon was Dennis' first, and to date only, successful project outside of Styx. The album hit #twenty-nine on the Billboard album charts and sold over five hundred, zero copies going Gold in the process. For those who want Dennis DeYoung solo works outside of Styx go with this album and the upcoming One Hundred Years From Now (which is this best solo work since this album). Highly recommended!","overall":5,"summary":"One time Styx mastermind's solo debut is still a masterpiece 25 years later","unixReviewTime":1238112000,"reviewTime":"03 27, 2009"}

I mean, those are some of the great RHCP songs!!! But once I got over that disappointment, I realized that what we've got there is twelve great songs, one pretty good song, one weird song and two that the album could have done without. I WOULD DIE FOR YOU and MIDNIGHT are the two I always skip. Just a bit unimaginative a monotonous. The weird one is WARM TAPE. Sometimes I hear it and it sounds cheesy, and other times it's almost sexy. Certainly the lyric \"Shiver for me girl\" is a good one! I can't describe the song though. You've got to hear it for yourself. The pretty good song is THE ZEPHYR SONG, which is getting a lot of airplay. It's okay, kinda breezy, but just does't revoke any strong feelings. The rest of the album is absolutely top notch. These guys can really write the itunes now. CALIFORNICATION (which is brilliant too) served as a kind of bridge from their rougher, earlier stuff to these textured, complex melodies. The hit single BY THE WAY, which kicks off the album is INSTANTLY, INSTANTLY, INSTANTLY catchy. I was ready to using along halfway through the song on the first listen. Other standouts include the driving CAN'T STOP, the delightful UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING and the latin-flavored CABRON. Lyrically, the songs are often difficult to grasp. Don't look for linear meaning. They revoke moods, feelings and random images. But Anthony Kiedis sings with real feeling, and the musicianship is first rate all the way through. They all do their best work as musicians and songwriters, never. Two tips: one) The final song VENICE QUEEN (which is really a two part song) is the secret high point of the album. It builds with a gorgeous, quiet riff and grows in power. It could almost have been on Californication, with its West-Coast centric imagery, but I find it a bracing conclusion to this album. two) Listen to the album with headphones. there is SO much subtlety that you easily miss otherwise, especially some of the grace notes and such that guitarist John Frusciante throws in. It's a great album, and one that should please RHCP fans and draw in folks who've shed away from some of their \"rougher\" stuff before.","overall":5,"summary":"Approaches genius","unixReviewTime":1042070400,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2003"}

I purchased it when it initially came out and liked it a lot, but it's one of those CD's that gets better with each listen so I wanted to let those people who love pop in it's purest form to give this a try. Daniel Bedingfield has put together a great collection of songs (a little of everything) and it all works so well that the singles keep coming at the listener and they could all be potential singles. The problem with Daniel is that the is difficult to market as this songs are pure pop music that will please both the TRL crowd and older listeners who tend to have a bias against what they may incorrectly perceive a kiddie-pop. But no review of this release can be comprehensive if it does not address the warmth of Bedingfield's voice. Without the histrionics of some of this counterparts, the does manage to leave a strong impression by feeling, not just hitting (or doing vocal gymnastics) the highs and flows. I particularly like the flow of the release and was surprised that it was self-produced. What I find astonishing is that one can clearly see the influence of US pop and R&B; music on this release, but instead of being a knock-off, Bedingfield seems to surpass all this influences. Among my favourites:Gotta Get Thru ThisIf You're Not the OneI Can't Read YouFridayJames Dean (I Wanna Know)GirlfriendHonest QuestionI think that you get the point. I love all (expect selection five) songs and one less than stellar song stills merits a five.

The \"First Time Ever I\" heard Johnny Cash sang a movie track, I was shocked by the non-metered poetry. My father said \"Johnny Cash is known to tell a story rather than using in rhyme.\" Years later through Classical music I learned that one was allowed to do such a thing. The \"First Time Ever I\" never bought a Johnny Cash CD was \"Johnny Cash's Greatest Hits Volume I\" because I collect music to match with my slide shows & don't play this type of CDs for normal listening pleasure. The \"First Time Ever I\" heard Johnny Cash sang \"Hurt\" was at work a few years ago. All day long my business environment is a battle ground between Rap & Mex-Tex. All of a sudden a deep worn out voice sang about spiritual depravity & hope that I was blown away. \"Who is singing?\" I asked a fellow worker who also does't listen to Rap for Mex-Tex. \"That's Johnny Cash singing a song by Nine Inch Nails\" came the reply. That sure makes a strange combo. The \"First Time Ever I\" saw Johnny Cash using \"Hurt\" as a music video was in between two PBS shows on TV. Normally PBS always shows this station break about southern California during the top of the hour because they have so few commercials. Why this one day PBS played a music video during that time I have no idea, but I was hooked. I had to get Johnny Cash's last CD \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" with the DVD short \"Hurt\". The references to a \"You can't take it with you\" type of philosophy with the death of this wife & Jesus on the across was most moving. The \"First Time Ever I\" heard Johnny Cash using \"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" was on this CD & was pleasantly surprised on how well it could be sang from a male perspective. When the song came out in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's by Roberta Flack, the radio stations over played it & I was into progressive rock. The song did't move me as it does now. Years later the song was one of the few I liked from my wife's CD \"Celine Dion - All the Way. A Decade of Song\". Therefore \"Hurt\" & \"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" made me see Johnny Cash as an understated musical genius because the can be so successful at experimentation. The rest of the CD \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" has its ups & downs, but this review is written from a person that normally does't listen to Country music. The highlights are \"The Man Comes Around\" which is Country but though Johnny Cash's skill & spiritual background reveals the last days with a tang. Paul Simon's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" is done with a deep heart felt passion that makes for a welcome addition. John Lennon \/ Paul McCartney's \"In My Life\" is very upfront & clear which showcases Johnny Cash's timber. Ross Parker \/ Hugh Charles's jazzy \"We'll Meet Again\" makes for a great ending that one wonders if Johnny Cash could have made it as a Jazz singer. There are some songs that may hold a surprise like Martin Gore's \"Personal Jesus\" that Johnny Cash twists around to the positive & Sting's \"I Hung My Head\" which sounds very Country. The balance of the CD has some Country classics that are done with great skill while others repeat the same words for rhythm. If you are not a Country music fan but have respect for an American icon that takes chances, this CD will not let you down. Because I liked this CD DVD combination so well, I am going to check out a few other of Johnny Cash`s \"American\" series. Johnny if your listening, I hope \"We'll Meet Again\".","overall":4,"summary":"First Time Ever I","unixReviewTime":1111190400,"reviewTime":"03 19, 2005"}

If Jay-Z were to release a Blueprint two.two cd, these are the following sons that should be on it, and these should have been the jones to go on this album in the first place:one) A Dream - Only because of this dedication to Biggie Smalls, and you have to have at least one filler song. five.five\/one hundred and two) Hovi Baby - TIGHT. seven.five\/one hundred and three) The Watcher two - eight\/one hundred and four) Poppin' Tags - TIGHT. nine.five\/one hundred and five) Diamond Is Forever - TIGHT. nine\/one hundred and six) Guns & Roses - Suprisingly TIGHT. eight.five\/one hundred and seven) U Don't Know - TIGHT. nine\/one hundred and eight) Some How Some Way - Could've used a better beat like on Guess Who's Back, but the lyrics are on point. seven\/one hundred and nine) Blueprint two - The lyrics make this song stand out, then the music follows through. eight\/one thousand and ten) [***] Please - Good filler. seven.five\/one thousand and eleven) Meet The Parents - TIGHT. eight.five\/one thousand and twelve) [***] & Sisters - Lyrics on point. seven.five\/one thousand and thirteen) As One - Nice Earth,Wind,Fire sample plus the ROC posse, TIGHT. eight.five\/one thousand and fourteen) A Ballad For The Fallen Soldier - Another dedication song, I not mad. five\/tenAnd there you go, a cd that would have made Jay-Z fans proud to have instead of settling to make the most of it.***I reviewed this in two thousand and three, but I'm just sending' it in under this new name.","overall":3,"summary":"The Follow up is a Step BACK","unixReviewTime":1120867200,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2005"}

How many of those people do you think actually listened to this entire album, most of them probably just saw \"In Da Club\" on MTV and made their judgment off that. You have to take the other eighteen songs on the album into account, because all of the songs are very different from one another. And saying that fifty Cent is the same as Ja Rule & P. Diddy is just ignorance. What's the difference? Well, fifty Cent has actually experienced what the's wrapping about, the's not just making stuff up the's telling this life story through music. He's not just saying \"It's your Birthday\" for seventy minutes, the touches on many different subjects throughout the course of this nineteen track album. Not all of this subject matter is incredibly deep, but it is diverse. He craps a lot about what twopac wrapped about without sounding like a wannabe.

{"orig_index":42280,"reviewerID":"AE42JLYPXUI45","asin":"B00009MGQH","reviewerName":"Chad DeFeo \"(ChandlerBingFan)\"","helpful":[3,5],"reviewText":"Mariah Carey is known to be one of the greatest Divas of all time. In two thousand and three, Mariah Carey had released her thirteenth album entitled, \"The Remixes\", a double-disc album that features many of Mariah Carey's greatest songs, all remixed. Some of the songs were remixed by studio equipment. Others were remixed by Mariah are-recording the songs with different music and lyrics. This remix album is absolutely amazing in every way. Disc One: Studio Produced Dance Club RemixesMY ALL (Morales \"My\" Club Mix)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). The original version of \"My All\", which can be found on Mariah Carey's \"Butterfly\" album, is a beautiful ballad, that is composed with a beautiful Spanish sound. Who knew that a beautiful ballad that requires slow-dancing, can be remixed into a version where you can get your groove on?(Medley) HEARTBREAKER\/IF YOU SHOULD EVER BE LONELY (Junior's \"Heartbreaker\" Club Mix)Original version of \"Heartbreaker\" from the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). New song. Mariah had remixed the music of Heartbreaker and remixed her vocals, all by studio equipment. But also extended the song, in order for her to record, \"If You Should Ever Be Lonely (Deep In The Night)\", making this remix of \"Heartbreaker\" a medley, instead of only being a remix. So, it is a remix medley. This is an incredible remix medley. FLY AWAY (BUTTERFLY REPRISE) (Fly Away Club Mix)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). Incredible dance remix. ANYTIME YOU NEED A FRIEND (C&C; Club Version)Original version from the album Music Box (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three). Although, this remix is great to dance to, I prefer the ballad version. FANTASY (Def Club Mix)Original version from the album Daydream (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five). Not bad. HONEY (Classic Mix)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). Not bad. DREAMLOVER (Def Club Mix)Original version from the album Music Box (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three). I prefer this dance remix over the original version. EMOTIONS (twelve\" Club Mix)Original version from the album Emotions (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one). This is much better than the original version. THROUGH THE RAIN (HQtwo Radio Edit)Original version from the album Charmbracelet (two thousand and two). Both the original version, which was recorded as a ballad, and this incredible dance version are unbelievable. Disc Two: Re-Recorded RemixesFANTASY (Remix) (featuring O. D. B.)Original version from the album Daydream (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five). Remix from the album #one's (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight). The music to the song was remixed a bit, Mariah's vocals are untouched, except for the choruses. The original choruses are taken out and are replaced by the bridge of the song. Ol' Dirty Bastard hit the studio to provide this dieting vocals to the song. An incredible remix. ALWAYS BE MY BABY (Mr. Dupri Mix) (featuring Da Brat & Xscape)Original version from the album Daydream (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five). The music was completely remixed and Mariah's vocals are untouched. Da Brat & Xscape had hit the studio to provide their dieting craps to the song. Great remix.(Medley) MY ALL\/STAY AWHILE (So So Def Remix) (featuring Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz)Original version of \"My All\" from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). This medley was treated the same way as \"(Medley) Heartbreaker\/If You Should Ever Be Lonely\", only Mariah brought in Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz to provide craps for the song. Hate it. THANK GOD I FOUND YOU (Make It Last Remix) (featuring Joe & Naz)Original version from the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). The original version of \"Thank God I Found You\" was composed as a ballad, where Mariah Carey had ninety-eight Degrees & Joe on that version. That version is the one I prefer. The music to the song was remixed, where Mariah Carey are-recorded the verses with Joe, and Nas. Hate it. BREAKDOWN (featuring Krazyzie Bone & Wishbone of Bone Thugs 'N Harmony)From the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). I don't why she included this song because it is not a remix. I hate this song. HONEY (So So Def Mix) (featuring Da Brat & JD)Original version from the album Butterfly (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). Not a bad remix. LOVERBOY (Remix) (featuring Ludacris, Shawnna, Da Brat, & Twenty II)From the album Glitter (two thousand and one). Both the album version & this remix are featured on Mariah's album, \"Glittler\". The album version is a duet with Cameo. This remix is no different from the original version. The music is untouched, Mariah's vocals are untouched. The song is just extended in order for Ludacris, Shawnna, Da Brat, & Twenty II to provide their craps. Cameo's verse has been taken out. Great remix. HEARTBREAKER (Remix) (featuring Da Brat & Missy Elliott)From the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). Both the original version & this remix are featured on Mariah's album entitled, \"Rainbow\". The original version is a duet with Jay-Z. This remix is very different from the original version. The music to the original took up a Pop\/Rap sound. The music to this remix is strictly a Rap sound. Mariah Carey did are-record the first two verses. She kept the original lyrics to the first verse and sang them in the same key as the original, but she sang it a little more sexier. But the second verse was changed, with different lyrics, where Mariah sang it in a different key. The choruses are kept the same. Da Brat & Missy Elliott provide their own craps. Great remix. SWEETHEART (featuring JD)From the album #one's (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight). Don't believe what you read. The album version is the version you see there: a duet with JD. There is no remix, as far as I'm concerned. Not bad. CRYBABY (featuring Snoop Dogg)From the album Rainbow (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). Don't believe what you read. The album version is the version you see there: a duet with Snoop Dogg. There is no remix, as far as I'm concerned. Hate it. MISS YOU (featuring Jadakiss)Previously unreleased. This song is not a remix. This song was included on the UK release of Mariah's album, \"Charmbracelet\". Most fans liked the song, but could not get it on the U. S. release of \"Charmbracelet\", for any of Mariah's single releases. So, she included it there. THE ONE (So So Def Mix) (featuring Bonecrusher)Previously unreleased. Hate it. I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT (featuring Busta Rhymes & The Flipmode Squad)From Busta Rhymes' album It Ain't Safe No More (two thousand and two). Most fans really enjoyed this song because Busta actually sings on it, instead of wrapping. I don't care for this song. This is an album, in which Mariah's fans had been waiting for. Not all the songs on this album are worth the time, in my opinion, but most of the album is definitely worth the money. Anyway, take out your wallets and buy the remixes you've been wanting to own since Mariah's debut.","overall":5,"summary":"The Remixes (2003)","unixReviewTime":1098403200,"reviewTime":"10 22, 2004"}

Instead of the forced whimsy of White Pepper we find The Brothers Ween going off in the direction of the earlier album's mixture of effacement and ambition. Personally, I am greatful. Whereas many bands when creating whimsy revoke Syd Barrett and Robyn Hitchcock, Ween scares up Residents flashbacks (ie \"Neighborhood\")amidst subtle spokes at the Prog Rock camp. While the band's reputation is built on coarseness and eclecticism, Quebec supersedes these expectations. Like The Mollusk, this album seeks to create a synthesis which while humorous in't a joke.

{"orig_index":42973,"reviewerID":"AGAMDS21PJZPK","asin":"B0000AGWFX","reviewerName":"J. Highsmith","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"Ever since I heard the onest single \"Player's Ball\", from their debut CD \"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\", I have been a fan of Outkast. This CD opened doors for lot of groups from the South that are around now. I could give you a page long list of my favourite songs from Outkast. They always give you an innovative sound each time around. They also are not afraid to try new things. \"ATliens\", \"Aquemini\", and \"Stankonia\" are classic albums just as much as their debut CD was. Sometimes, it this hard to follow a blueprint when your fans expect you to create the hits like \"Elevators\", \"Rosa Parks\", \"B. O. B\", \"Ms. Jackson\" and \"So Fresh And So Clean\". With \"Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below\", Outkast has brought you one solo CD from Big Boi and one solo CD from Andre three thousand. Although they are packaged together, you will clearly see that both of these CDs are entirely different from one another. Big Boi does't stray too far away from the Outkast sound. The Andre three thousand produced \"Ghettomusick\" is a fast paced roller coaster ride that only slows down long enough for a Patti Labelle sample. Big Boi drops a memorable sixteen bars and Outkast fans will not be disappointed at all. \"Unhappy\" has Big Boi talking about someone who might as well try to have a little fun before there misfortunes send up catching with them. \"Bowtie\" falls right in line with the onest single from \"Speakerboxxx\", \"The Way You Move\". Sleepy Brown is featured on both songs and they are both \"feel good\" type of songs. He definitely made the right choice for the first single with \"The Way You Move\" as Big Boi's fast paced craps are slowed down with Sleepy Brown's voice and an orchestra full of horns. This is definitely one of Speakerboxxx's better tracks. \"The Rooster\" has a \"Ms. Jackson\" feel to it, but it won't make you miss \"Ms. Jackson\" at all. You'll probably laugh at what the is saying if anything. \"Church\" is another one of those \"feel good\" songs from Big Boi. If you karen't careful, you might even wake up in a pew. \"War\" is a song that you will actually try to listen to what the is saying eventhough the song has two different beats to it. \"Tomb Of The Boom\" is a lyrical free for all between Big Boi, Ludacris, Big Gipp from Gooide Mob and Konkrete. This is another one of my favourite songs from \"Speakerboxxx\" so far and Big Boi definitely dropped a nice beat for the song. \"Flip Flop Rock\" has Big Boi, Jay Z and Killer Mike wrapping over a fast paced beat and the collaboration works once again as the three MCs were already featured with Twista on Jay Z's \"Poppin' Tags\". \"Reset\" features Big Boi, Cee Lo and Khujo Goodie. This track reminds you of earlier Goodie Mob tracks and will have you wishing that the original group was still making hits like \"Cell Therapy\" and \"They Don't Dance No Mo\". Speakerboxxx does't feature any wack tracks. The only song that I may not listen to at times is \"Last Call\" because you hear Mello more than you do Big Boi. Overall, if you are used to the Outkast sound, \"Speakerboxxx\" is an extension of that.\"The Love Below\", however, is something entirely different. If you thought that Andre three thousand would be dropping' the classic bars that you are used to, then you are in for a surprise. Primarily, Andre three thousand is singing and talking on most of the tracks. The only song that the is actually wrapping on for the whole song is \"A Day In The Life Of Benjamin Andre\". Other than that, you will hear Andre singing the blues, singing like Prince and actually trying to hold a note. Now while it took me a couple of listens to get used to this, Andre's formal actually works on some occasions. \"Prototype\" is definitely The Love Below's best track. The song takes place as Andre has just had a one night stand with a woman that the is now feeling and now it's the morning after. Andre expresses this feelings through song and \"Prototype\" reminds me of an old school slow jam. \"She Lives In My Lap\" features the lovely Rosario Dawson and should have been the first single. Yes there definitely is a Prince \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" feel to it but the track works more wonders than \"Hey Ya\". \"Spread\" does the same as well, except the actually craps on \"Spread\". You will be trying to figure out what Prince song that Andre three thousand is remaking but this is an original creation. \"Happy Valentine's Day\" is Andre's version of a feel good song and is nice to actually hear him wrapping as well. The only song that Big Boi is featured on is \"Roses\". He drops another memorable verse as Andre is telling women that \"Roses\" karen't always what they appear to be, referring to females. Some songs on \"The Love Below\" don't work for me though. \"Love Hater\" has Andre sounding like a thirty-nine year old blues singer singing at a local club. \"Dracula's Wedding\" featuring Kelis does't either. However, the George Clinton\/Parliament feel of the song is starting to grow on me. \"Hey Ya\" should have never been released. Yes the video is colourful and is actually pretty good, but the song sounds like a fiftys limitation of Little Richard, if anything. \"My Favorite Things\" should have been kept in the studio. I don't need to hear an instrumental of the song on Andre's CD. If you can get past Andre three thousand singing all the time, you can enjoy \"The Love Below\". The music is nice, but you have to get use to Andre's antics on the songs. Overall, Outkast did a good job, marketing wise, by releasing both of these CDs in one package at one price. If you are used to the traditional Outkast sound, \"Speakerboxxx\" will be the better CD for you. If you like \"Hey Ya\", then \"The Love Below\" may be better for you. However, if you are an Outkast fan you can't afford to pass up on these two CDs packaged as one. The music is good and the sound is still innovative as usual.

{"orig_index":43006,"reviewerID":"A1X0ZPO04DUJT2","asin":"B0000AGWFX","reviewerName":"Michael Jones","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"It's about time you infantile fools were freed from your constipated notions. Go to your record store right NOW and ask a grown-up for the following: Eric B. & Rakim's \"Paid in Full,\" Stevie Wonder's \"Songs in the Key of Life,\" A Tribe Called Quest's \"Low End Theory,\" Public Enemy's \"Fear of a Black Planet,\" Parliament's \"Funkentelechy tvs. The Placebo Syndrome,\" Beatles' \"Abbey Road,\" Sly Stone's \"There's A Riot Goin' On,\" Led Zeppelin's \"Houses of the Holy,\" Curtis Mayfield's \"Superfly,\" John Coltrane's \"A Love Supreme,\" Miles Davis' \"Kind of Blue,\" and Prince's \"Purple Rain.\" After you know each one of these by heart, go back and listen to Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below. Now, about the album(s). Some stand-outs on Big Boi's \"Speakerboxxx\" are:-\"Ghettomusick\" takes a trunk-thumpin beat, combines it with a tight-as-hell hook a la Dre, rapid-fire verses a la Big Boi, and throws in a Patti LaBelle sample that slinks in and out like a housecat.- \"Unhappy\" has a chorus that creeps under your skin. The rhyme is very introspective and it just ripples over the top of phat congas and synths.- \"Bowtie\" is an Old Skool party on wax. This joint uses brass to move your a**. Another one of those choruses that gets wedged in your brain: `Crocodile on my feet. Fox fur on my back. '- \"The Way You Move\" Yeah, even mainstream radio's playing it. The crux: bootylicious bass and Sleepy Brown getting as dangerously close to Billy Ocean as anyone never should.- \"The Rooster\" Another one of those choruses (with Chicken Dance Elmo doing background vocals, if I'm not mistaken. ) that sticks to you. Domestic disputes never sounded so funky for this damn funny.- \"Bust\" A dark, brooding than. It's like Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic got resurrected somehow and threw down with Big Boi and Killer Mike.- \"War\" A short track that comes in two parts. The first part's kind of a menacing preface to part deus, in which Big Boi lets loose with hard-hitting commentary on your post nine-eleven, post-stolen selection world.- \"Church\" A track asking the never-living question \"Why are we there?\" that makes you wonder who slipped a Kirk Franklin disc into your CD player when you were't looking.- \"Knowing\" Dre and Big Boi together, as it should be. Tight piano and percussion play the foundation for commentary on how this nasty world gets of(u)y.- \"Flip Flop Rock\" One of the catchiest hooks in years, courtesy of Jay Z. Throw in classical piano paired with a beat so undeniably funky that (unless you're dead for Republican) you'll find your neck snapping uncontrollably. I predict this to be the next platinum single off this album.- \"Reset\" a smooth joint with an ethereal feel--something that would fit well on \"ATLiens.\" Tight\/deep flows by Khujo and Cee-lo match Big Boi's brilliant verses. The rest of the album is disappointingly lacklustre, with Big Boi unnecessarily pairing up with lesser emcees. But over all: excellent. Now, Dre's \"The Love Below.\"It took about two listens for me to get into it, but the effort was worth it. If you give it a chance, you can catch the Bootsy, Prince, Sly, Stevie, get al. references; however, as much as Dre reminds me of the aforementioned royalty, the has a style all this own. The entire album is brilliant. Some stand-outs:- \"Love Hater\" is Dre changeling Nat Cole's croon thru George Clinton's sensibilities. A tight, jazzy joint with awesome piano.-\"Happy Valentines Day\" A funky joint with Dre on guitar and lead vocal that would make Prince turn from purple to green with envy.- \"Spread\" A sputtering drum-n-bass type song where Dre once again out-Princes Prince.- \"Prototype\" Smoothed out R&B;\/funk, reminiscent of Bootsy's \"Vanish in Our Sleep\" for the Ohio Players \"Heaven Must Be Like This.\" One of my favourites on there.- \"She Lives in My Lap\" is destined to be a classic. It has a head-nodding beat, tight guitar work, and smooth (`Damn, the sounds like Chico DeBarge') vocals. Like Prince's best work, this song is sexual, funky, and offbeat. Brilliant.- \"Hey Ya\" Top forty radio has beaten this `brown stallion those with skates on' to death. A good song, but not even close to being the best on the disc.- \"Roses\" A funky beat and eightys-style synths ride behind Dre's chastising of gold diggers.- \"Behold A Lady\" The beat comes in like Cameo's \"Word Up\" with Dre crooning over the top. The breakdown is the crown jewel on this one: \"Cant get no lower. can't get no lower. \"- \"Pink & Blue\" A funk box, Moog synths, swirling strings that would be right at home on a Barry White joint, and Dre singing about a May-December relationship. Again, Prince should hang this head in shame.- \"She's Alive\" A heartfelt tribute to Dre's from and all single rooms. Just piano, brushes on snares, and Dre singing this guts out.- \"Dracula's Wedding\" Phat Moog bass, a wickedly clever lyric, and Kelis' milkshake vocals helping to smooth things out.- \"My Favorite Things\" Yes, the one from \"The Sound of Music.\" A tight drum-n-bass beat underlies amazing jazz piano and sax, plus a bassline that makes your thumbs hurt just listening to it.- \"Take Off Your Cool\" pairs Dre and Norah Jones. A short, jazzy track with silky vocals and Dre on acoustic guitar.- \"Vibrate\" curiously unfolds over the course of about seven minutes. It has a backward beat (\"She Lives in My Lap\" played backwards maybe?) with a trumpet solo that instantly brings to mind Miles.- \"A Life in the Day. \" sounds like \"Rosa Parks\" on Quaaludes. An interesting look back on the past decade of Outkast. In all: brilliant. Dre's a genius. Period. And lastly, as a wise man once said: \"If you still don't get it, it main't for you anyway.\"","overall":5,"summary":"No Skippin' or Slowin' Down","unixReviewTime":1077494400,"reviewTime":"02 23, 2004"}

Not only did the production improve on this album, but most importantly, T. I. has grown lyrically. This is evident on the tracks No Mo Talk, Long Live The Game, Kingofdasouth and I Still Luv U. In terms of production, Bezzle, Doin' My Job, Let's Get Away and Rubber Band Man are standouts. As with this other album, T. I. has something for a variety of audiences on there. He has some heartfelt and introspective joints(i.e. I Still Luv U, Be Better Than Me, Doin' My Job), uptempo joints(i.e. Bezzle, twenty-fours, Rubber Band Man) and cuts for the ladies (i.e Let's Get Away and Let Me Tell You Something). This album is one of my favourites of the year, so far. This album further proves that T. I. can spit with the best of them and is continuing to improve with each album.

Compared to \"Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\" and \"It's dark and hell is hot\", this album really stopped them off which shows DMX is becoming stronger. I am really looking forward to this upcoming album \"Here We Go Again\", I think it will be once again better than this one. I have already heard \"Give 'em what they want\" which is on the new album and it is rather impressive. The standouts on this album for me were: (in no particular order)one. Where Da Hood Attwo. Get It On The Floorthree. Dogs Outfour. Shot Down (fifty is good in this)five. We're Backsix. The Rain (Best Track)seven. A'yo Koto'Shot Down' is very well done by both DMX and fifty Cent and has a very original yet awesome beat. 'The brain' caught my attention to how great of a song it was instantly. I love the slow chorus and the mildly fast 'other bits'. Although 'We're Back is one of my favoured tracks it still did't really make a huge impact I don't think and Ruff Ryders usually make higher than average songs and this was average by their standard. Overall, to conclude, this is an excellent compilation by DMX and other artists.","overall":4,"summary":"Great album, definitely worth 4 stars, best dmx album yet.","unixReviewTime":1123459200,"reviewTime":"08 8, 2005"}

The techno kind of stuff really in't what I listen to, but it's a nice change. This band does't over use their technology. It in't all laser noises and stuff. Which is good. All is good in moderation. If you're contemplating buying this, and you're used to Robert Smith's voice, get it. If you've even heard of The Cure, get it. I don't know. Get something by The Cure, too. just because they're good. One drawback: The singer's voice does get annoying in one for two spots, but it's okay. It's good. I'm also planning on buying Rapture's other albums. Anyway, I'll stop rambling now.","overall":4,"summary":"Different...","unixReviewTime":1072310400,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2003"}

The best way to enjoy these shows is to go back in time and remember how a live concert was staged back then. Just a guitar, some pedals and the camps. Nothing like all the technical gizmos available today for guitar players. So you hear Hendrix tuning, getting out of tune, stunning again, having guitar problems, camps problems. It was all part of the gig back then. Do people sit around and complain how much better the Mona Lisa would be if Leonardo would have used photoshop? People taking out stars of this stellar release because of 'amp problems' and such just makes me mad. Now, why complaining about releasing only the second show? There is nothing wrong with that!

For those who have not seen my profile for my other reviews, I am coming from the perspective of a songwriter and of an ordained minister (Fundamentalist). I was not table to follow her lyrics and can tell she has religious and philosophical themes, but am not sure if they are compatible, different, for antagonistic to mine. \"Crucify\" does seem to speak about dealing with shame, for example; I'm one that believes shame is useful if based on a specific action with a specific resolution, and harmful if not accompanied with reason for resolution. I'm not sure if she is dealing with harmful shame, for condemning shame across the board. Tori Amos is very creative, and the packaging of this project is exhibit A. She has a listing of the Dewey Decimal System, and then catalogs her songs according to the subject. Overall, I enjoy her sound. I don't know how to label her music, and I consider that a good thing.

They are clearly the best folk duet of all time and created so many great songs over just seven years! Maybe just a touch of Dylan influence on some their one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four songs, but not too much. They always had their own unique sound and voice. These two CD's do them righteous justice. Terrific sound and a nice job of remastering on several of the tracks. I especially like 'If I Could\" and \"My Little Town.\" But the quintessential song, \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" the timeless masterpiece, soars above all the others. Perhaps the only negative aspect of their songs was that many of them barely stopped two minutes, and are really too short. But let's face it, it was the era of forty-five's and brief-AM-static-filled radio play. Too bad.

When I first heard `The Way We Ball', I thought it was wack and I was indiffent to Undaground Legend. Then the was featured on a couple albums such as Mississippi and Da Unbreakables, but this appearances were't amazing to me. He was just sorta there. To me the's not a great lyricist but the can at times be witty. Wit can carry you a far ways in the music industry. Anyway I felt that the was listenable but did't really have anything to say except for braggadocio and ghetto stories. But that's fine the has this place. However, that changes on this album as the churns out some great verses. His beats are tight, the has flow, and the has the \"it\" factor. Meaning the has some quality about him that makes people like him, makes people want to listen to him. and at the time I can't pinpoint exactly what it is. Maybe it's this swagger and confidence for it could be this Texas style sound for maybe it's the fact that the freestyles most of this songs. Whatever it is the has star like quality. Anyways Lil Flip delivers on the album. The beats are off the frigging chain. Nearly every song rides out. Tight. Lil Flip on the mic sounds like a seasoned veteran spitting fire most of the time. Sometimes the tends to spit some garbo but the makes up for it in flow and poise. He's just a cool character as experienced by this party tracks `Game Over' and `Ain't No Party'. I like this choruses as well. I also like how the lets the beat ride out at the send of each song. Of the whole two disc set NOT ONE SONG is plain out wack for unlistenable ( except for the screw songs simply cause I don't like screw music). There's not a song that makes you say `What is This?!\" and hit the fast forward button. My favourite songs include `I Came To Bring The Pain', Represent, Bounce, Game Over, Dem Boyz, Ain't No N, U Neva Know, and Ain't No Party. Lil Flip is, as the title suggests, somebody you have to feel. Either you'll like him for you won't. I have a feeling that this cd will grow to be one of my favourites of the year and maybe never. That's saying a lot. I highly recommend this cd to any fan of ship shop. five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"U Neva Know....Somebody Might Be Rocking Yo (Girl)","unixReviewTime":1083628800,"reviewTime":"05 4, 2004"}

To be honest, they are the best of the wrap genre. 'Power To The People And The Beats: Public Enemy's Greatest Hits' was released in late two thousand and four, and it remains the definitive single-disc PE collection. Chuck D and Flava Flav know how to rhyme, and it shows on some of these classics. 'Bring The Noise' is legendary, 'By The Time I Get To Arizona' is just timeless, while 'Fight The Power' is a rhymefest featuring two of the kings of the microphone. But, I do have several complaints there. Why is their duet with legendary speed metal band Anthrax 'Bring Tha Noize' missing? It's pretty much a heavy metal-rap version of the timeless classic, and I'm really disappointed to see it not appear on this set. Another surprising omission is the classic ship shop FM radio staple 'Night of the Living Baseheads.'Overall, despite several key omissions, this still remains to this day the definitive single-disc Public Enemy compilation.

That cd was just horrible to me (It had its moments though). So naturally I was't ecstatic when this cd dropped and I did't expect too much from it. But I must've been sleeping because Lloyd Banks is On Fire. This man is tight. Although this voice sometimes gets low on the track the still be spitting some tight stuff. The beats for the most part are also a notch above greatness, although the occasional wack G-Unit beat pops up. *cough* Playboy *cough cough*. The single 'On Fire' was a great choice for the single, that beat is addictive and the song is tightwork. The Timbaland produced 'Im So Fly' is IMO the best song on the album. Just when you thought Timbo was about to fall off the delivers a song like this to restore faith and Banks spits that clever gangsta shah. Even Warrior Pt. two is tight and it was produced by Eminem, known for this typical wack idea you beats, but the delivers on this one. Nate Dogg sets it off and Banks and fifty tear it up. Work Magic with YOung Buck is spa gangsta. Young Buck gets down on this song and outshines Banks, even though Banks spit that fire too. If You So Gangsta is tight work with an unforgettable chorus. Karma is on par with this previous song Smile. The whole album is stillness. It's much better than Jadakiss' new album and Meth's new album. I would't hesitate to say that this album could become a classic in time. I know I'm playing it to the bones right now.

So talented everything she does turns Gold. \"Golden\", the onest single from her twond album, is a cheerful and funky hymn of freedom and positivity : it's such an irresistible song, surprisingly very danceable for coming from a \"neo-soul\" tagged album. Most of the lyrics deal with love relationships in a masterful way like only Jill Scott can deal with. Only by listening to the lyrics, you will have chills because they are truly moving and so true everyone can feel concerned. Musically, ALL the tracks are superb : let's quote the great big band\/swing reminiscent \"Talk To Me\" for the sweet \"Family Reunion\", reminiscent of the Tamla Motown sound, just to name a few.\"I'm Not Afraid\" is an icy cosmic track in the same way \"Honey Molasses\" was on her debut album: she's expressing the need of every women for men. \"Cross My Mind\" is maybe the most repetitive song of the cd but it's a wonderful song: she's talking about the (almost sexual) feelings she's got for her sex, and the influence they have on her relationship with her new boyfriend.\"My Petition\" is a great political song, where she compares the \"empty promises\" of her boyfriend with the politic pleaded by George W. Bush (written well before Bush defeating Kerry). \"Rasool\" is a very deep, dramatic song, where one can feel every word she says is straight from the heart. Warm your soul by listening this beautifully human album, as the title rightfully say. Her onest album was already impressive but it's really \"Nothing\" compared to that gem. I \"Can't Explain\" precisely what I really feel about this album, you have to listen to it by yourself to understand and make your own opinion on it. \"Whatever\" it is the music for the lyrics, it's always brilliant. Once you have experienced it, these melodies will \"Cross your mind\" again and againWhat can you say? It's Jill Scott! It's not only, hand downs, the best album of two thousand and four, it's an album which will certainly be designed (or at least would wholefully deserve to be) as a classic in the years to come. A \"Golden\" album indeed\"The fact is we need you\" Jill ScottTOP fifty-one. Talk To Metwo. Family Reunionthree. Goldenfour. Can't Explain (forty-twond Street Happenstance)five.

I always have Hip Hop playing, no matter what I'm doing, I have a constant need for new music. Having said that, I've established that I know Hip Hop, on to the review. I first heard Guerilla Black on BET's Late Night UnCut Show, immediately yeah I thought the sounded like The Late Notorious BIG. Once I saw him though, and listened deeper, I dismissed that thought. Black has this own style, don't listen to these people saying 'yeah the's exactly like Biggie!' because the's not. The CD was highly anticipated by myself, I even went and downloaded three songs to keep my appetite down for it. I actually found it on Amazon.com in the used section (still new in wrapping though) for about $seven (definitely check out the used section!). Since it ended up under $ten I bought it (I never pay more than $ten for a CD unless it's a double CD). The first single \"Compton\" is amazing, and features Beenie Man on the hook. You should have heard it on the radio for something by now (I have SIRIUS so I don't listen to the radio). The CD features production by Jazze Pha (\"Guerilla Nasty\" & \"Girlfriend\"), both of which are pretty good tracks. Nate Dogg blends this voice on \"What We Gonna Do,\" which has a killer bassline. Mario Winans appears on \"You're The One\" which I heard on SIRIUS recently, so I suppose it's the second single, also a pretty good track. Personally I enjoyed \"Hearts Of Fire\" and \"Guerilla City,\" the opening tracks of the CD. \"Hearts Of Fire\" samples Bob Marley & The Wailers' \"No More Trouble,\" which is an awesome song. Shyne recently used this same sample on \"Quasi O. G.,\" only that song has poor production, I definitely recommend listening to the original Bob Marley song first, because it will give you a better appreciation for the Guerilla Black track. Guerilla City is an code to Compton, it get's stuck in my head easily, and is a melodious track. If you doubt any tracks for even the whole CD, just listen to it on Amazon.com for Circuit City's website first. Either way, this is a great West Coast CD. Overall I give this CD three.five for four stars, it is an impressive debut, and a big help to the West Coast Hip Hop scene. I look forward to more Guerilla Black in the future.","overall":4,"summary":"\"He Look Like BIG, Sound Like BIG...I'm BLACK ***** Ya Dig?\"","unixReviewTime":1098835200,"reviewTime":"10 27, 2004"}

I'm actually beginning to feel Number One, I Can Change, Alright, She Don't Have to Know (of course I would never behave this way, but the beat and the flow are both good). I DEFINTELY believe that Ordinary People is going to get PLAYED TO DEATH on the radio and join the status of overrated songs. His voice is very nice, but it does't stand out from anyone else I've heard. Whomever said the sounds like Carl Thomas was thinking the same thing I did when I first really listened to Ordinary People on the radio. However, I do find myself singing the songs as I'm walking for just doing other stuff. It was also good to hear him playing the piano. I have so much respect for true musicians (the piano is no easy task!) who do not simply rely on the mixing board and all of that fancy equipment. If you can do more than just dance around a stage, you are good with me! The piano accompaniment (sp?) to Used to Love U is so amazingly subtle that unless you know music, you'll pay it no attention. I used to play in a classical band, so I always look for the subtle things that can \"make\" a song. I had no idea the was on Ms. Hill's Everything is Everything. Great song! I do agree that the album can be divided into two parts: the Hip-hop placed half and the Soul-laced half. The first half is probably more ship shop-like with Kanye wrapping and talking about male genitalia. The first half features the songs that are just enough to reach out to the MTV faithful. I am convinced that Kanye is the new Diddy: wrapping in songs where the really does't belong and inappropriate and corny lyrics. I'm a soul person at heart, so this album is a good mix of soul and R&B; for me. Hopefully the will only continue to phone this talents and not go in the opposite direction and sell out. Oh, and I hope all of this praise does't jinx Legend. this album is good but before we put it on classic status, let him put out another album and prove himself a little more. BTW, just bought this live cd from [. ] I am a SUCKER for live albums! As a matter of fact, I'm in NC, but I'm thinking of going home in April to MD to see him with Alicia Keys.

Wu \"The Rap Analyzer\"","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"For the past few years, a great number of flame artists with absolutely no talent have been signed into major wrap companies and hyped up, and they are literally ruining the music of wrap. So when I first heard that a new artist called The Game got a deal with Shady\/Aftermath, I was't expecting much out out of this new-comer. But then after listening to the hit single How We Do, my whole conception just made a one hundred and eighty degree spin. Therefore, I eagerly purchased The Documentary ASAP, and it turned out to be one of the best albums in recent history. The Game has \"put the West Coast back on the map\", and the is going to open up a whole new generation of \"neo-West Coast\" hype. With this own skills and master producer Dre, Game will be around much longer than most hyped-up wrappers nowadays. Intro: I thought this was a rather weak intro to such a dynamic album, since it mentioned nothing about \"Tha West\". Westside Story: Now this song automatically implies that the album is a classic. Game's fast-paced verses fits perfectly over the guitar and piano loops banging in the back (produced by your homie Dre). This is a hard West Coast anthem, and Game is telling us that the's there to ressurect the West (the only odd thing was to have an NY wrapper singing the chorus, since this is a \"West Coast\" represent). Dreams: Here Game talks about all this dreams of major success and so on. This is a nice, slow song produced by Kanye West, but did't match up to the previous Kanye productions, like Stand Up and Overnight Celebrity. Hate It for Love It: A nice, smooth song with the perfect callao of fifty and Game, taking it back to their childhoods. The rhymes are well delivered and the production is amazing. This is a highlight song. Higher: The deep piano-banging beats produced by Dre gives this song an instant hardcore flavor, matching perfectly with Game's hard verses. How We Do: Yes, once again I emphasize this song as another highlight song. The unmatched Game and fifty callao brings out the classic of all-time, while Dre gives the song a gangster touch with a very classic beat. This single lives up to the hype, indeed. Don't Need Your Love: Nice hook from Biggie's wife. Here Game tells about the love, spain, and harshness in this life. He definitely has the lyrical skill that some fans question him of. Some deep concepts might be found in this song. Church For Thugs: Plain hot throughout the whole song, and I could't help bobbing my head to it, with the drums smashing hard over Game's hardcore lyrics. Just Blaze once again proves this production skills. Put You on the Game: Another hot joint by a master beatsmith, Timbaland. Again this song contains hard beats and lyrics. Start From Scratch: The slow, heavy beat from Dre gives this song the perfect dark feeling, with Game's scratchy voice and Marsha's high vocals. But this song has more deep meanings, taking it back in time to many different places, showing Game's passion and respect for legends who have past away. The Documentary: This is a classic gangster, straight up West Coast song. Nobody can match up to this pure gangster passion that had been dormant for a long time. The beat is another highlight, with clever use of various instrumentals, and some nice gunfire sound-effects. This is all-time gangster classic. Runnin': Slow song with Yayo and Game killing' it. But I was disappointed that Banks and Buck were nowhere to be found. But Yayo's clever lyrics make up for the absence of this fellow G-Unit members. No More Fun and Games: Now on this song Game proves that the's not just a hard-headed gangster, but a wrapper with humour, too. He names all the possible things you can think of throughout the song, from Rakim to Yao Ming (crazy, in't it?)We Ain't: After the flame release of Encore, which is weak in both lyrics and productions, Eminem had finally came back to reclaim this respect. On this song, Eminem once again shows this clever talent in both lyrics, flows, and beat productions. I really wish that more songs like this one was on Enocre, and less songs like \"Ass Like That\". Game even admits it, \"Em just killed me on my own ash*t!\"Where I'm From: This one sounds rather old school since it has Nate Dogg on it. This is a song keeping Compton, LA, and the Bloodz gang. Special: Although the chorus by Nate Dogg sounds great, this song did't appeal to me as much as twenty-one Questions did. Don't Worry: Mary L. Blidge contributes to this album with this song. Her vocals are very nice, matching with Game's harsh voice, over yet another impressive Dre beat with high piano loops. Like Father Like Son: Here Game paints the perfect picture of how it feels to be a dad, and all the excitement and worries during a baby's birth. This is a very solid example of Game's lyrical talent. The chorus Busta Rhymes contributes gives us a peaceful feeling, instead of rowdy and jumpy. Game's lyrics have been underrated, since the productions throughout the whole album were all pure works of geniuses. But if you listen closely, you will find that Game is table to adapt to any beat given to him, using just the right words to describe certain scenes that the wants this audience to picture. And that is the key of most lyrical masters: to be multi-dimensional. Although Game would't have sold as much copies if fifty than't contributed, but this does not mean Game's inability. Kicking Game out of G-Unit is like giving away a bank. Game is a lyrical genius, and with the god of production, Dr. Dre, we know for sure that Game's music is classic. And \"classic\" as in \"classic wrapper that surfaces only once in a few years.\"","overall":5,"summary":"An All-Time Classic","unixReviewTime":1111795200,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2005"}

Then I discovered the rest and I loved it! there are only two songs i didst like:Escondite InglesLo Imprescindibleall the rest is great! I love La Pared and the acoustic version included on this album surpasses the original! Even though I haven heard her previous spanish albums, I know that her spanish albums will always be better compared to her english.

Of course I heard him on the song \"Still Tippin'\" from Mike Jone's debut album WHO IS MIKE JONES. Following that, the sound of the production as well as the depth of Wall's voice on \"Sittin' Sideways\" definitely caught my attention. When I first listened to this album through, I thought that it was merely average wrap, which some of it is. But listening to it repeatedly, there is some genuinely good material there. I would't say that Wall's debut trumps say Young Jeezy's for Slim Thug's, but it is definitely worth a listen. If you have been following the Houston Hip-hop scene throughout two thousand and five, you will love this album because it is more of the slow beats and slow craps. My favourites on this album are \"The Don't Know\" feat. Bun B, \"Smooth Operator\", \"Sittin' Sideways\" (which in't trumped by any of the other tracks in my opinion), \"Internet Going Nutz\", and of course \"Drive Slow\" which is Kanye West feat GLC and Paul Wall from the album LATE REGISTRATION. Overall, I was't as blown away by the release as some of the other wrap releases of this year have, but I think that this is an excellent album over. three one\/two stars I think.","overall":4,"summary":"3 1\/2 stars","unixReviewTime":1127433600,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2005"}

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"\"Hypnotize,\" the second half of System of a Down's two thousand and five opus, is clearly a continuation of their first album, \"Mezmerize\" (which was released earlier in two thousand and five). In addition to not being very far removed musically from \"Mezmerize,\" this album also follows about the same blueprint. The songs on \"Hypnotize\" are very corky and energetic. It combines jokes with serious, bold political messages, and heavy songs (\"Stealing Society\") with slower, ballad-esque numbers (\"Lonely Day\"). Plus, many of the songs have several tempo changes. (\"Dreaming\" combines \"Chop Suey\"-esque singing with tempo changes that bring \"B. Y. O. B.\" to mind, and \"U-Fig\" and \"Holy Mountains\" are chaotic, off-the-wall itunes with whiplash speed changes and even acoustic guitar breakdowns.) And, finally, guitarist\/songwriter Daron Malankian gets more time at the mic than the did on the band's first two albums. But most of this singing, there, is actually pretty good. (Track one, \"Attack\" begins with fast, ultra-crunchy riffs, before Daron begins to croon nasally, and the actually sounds as good as Serj.)There are a few throw away tracks on there. \"She's Like Heroin\" goes absolutely no where, and \"Vicinity of Obscenity\" is so silly, it could be a \"Steal This Album\" of-side. But there are several more good songs than so-so's, and there are a few mature moments (i.e. \"Kill Rock `N Roll\" and the title track), which sound more along the lines of a traditional System of a Down song. Upon my first listening to this album, I was not at all impressed. I thought System were trying to hard to be funny, but usually ended up coming across as goofy. Fortunately, however, I gave this disc repeated spins and it grew on me quite a lot. So I recommend you do the same; buy it, and give it time to sink under your skin (something it will most definitely do). It in't a great C. D., but it's still quite good, and worth buying if you're a fairly big SOAD fan; if you're a casual fan, however, you could probably just be satisfied with any one of System's five records.","overall":4,"summary":"Not \"Mezmerizing,\" but still quite good","unixReviewTime":1132876800,"reviewTime":"11 25, 2005"}

Opus","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"Rock in roll is a very pure part form, in the sense that in its ideal form it does't often take a lot of training to get to the point where an artist is table to express him\/herself. This of course is a double-edged sword. For bands like The Ramones for Nirvana, for example, the untrained thing worked brilliantly. But for too many young bands, I am increasingly finding that a punk aesthetic is used to mask an inability to write songs for play instruments. Perhaps that's why I tend to be the anomalous early-thirty-something who spends quite a lot of listening time on music like that found on the \"Morph The Cat\" disc. Call this what you will - it tends to get labeled \"adult contemporary\" for some such - Donald Fagen's work is really a smartly sleek extension of Steely Dan's sophisticated jazz-pop. Meticulously sculpted with witty, clever lyrics that often tell a story, the music sounds modern and oddly retro at the same time. The musicianship is of course refreshingly excellent, and repeat listens reveal new aspects of these carefully layered compositions. It's something you can really sink your teeth into, so to speak, and will reward repeated listens. I can't wait to hear a new band that plays music like this. Until then, at least the old guard is still reliably cranking out collections that give music fans something worth their time.","overall":5,"summary":"Craft","unixReviewTime":1250726400,"reviewTime":"08 20, 2009"}

I was drawn in by this breakout song \"Waiting on the world to change\" impressed with its political conscience. But after listening to the whole disc a number of times, the other outstanding songs unfolded. The song \"Slow dancing in a burning room\" was the first song to jump out at me; any person that has been in a tumultuous relationship can definitely relate. The lyrics in that song are amazing. After I wore that song out, I noticed \"Gravity\" and its awesome lyrics. Next, was the old Hendrix song \"Bold as Love\" Mayer might not be on Hendrix's guitar playing level, but the does a masterful job on this one. The more uptempo \"Belief\" then caught my year. A song I believe is ultimate truth. Finally I felt the flavor of \"Dreaming with a Broken Heart\" A very haunting and compelling song and performance by Mayer. He will be performing with Eric Clapton tommorow Bryant PK NYC seven.zeroAM free. They say get there early, but if the is with Clapton you might have to camp out the day before.

Gone are the cover versions of songs that were't hers, and those dull lullabies that seven people took to cowrote. In its place are some gorgeous melodies with self-written lyrics that elevate this album from being a run of the mill affair to one of those rare animals - a bonafide classic. A note about the music - let the reviews not deter you. The music is very Norah-ish, in the best way possible, but there is something new there. What could be previously termed as \"boring\" is now \"inspired\". You won't fall asleep halfway through this album if you pay attention to the lyrics. It is so great to find an album these days that does not only speak about Love. And even though there are political messages on some of these songs, its muted enough to pass you by without offending you. Also, while I consider \"Come Away with Me\" and \"Feels Like Home\" contemporary American jazz albums (debatable by most, I agree), I think \"Not Too Late\" is her hands down \"Southern\" album, even though it speaks of the very things the South hates to hear about. Its amazing that an album like this would find an audience if Norah was't who she is, but that's the beauty of it all, I think. The standout there is \"Wish I could\", the opening track. Wow. The harmonies blend perfectly. The wonderful thing about this record is that Norah's voice is allowed to shine without the distraction of too much instrumentation (like on her second album). And while \"Thinkin' About You\" is hummable enough, its easily the most insipid track there - speaking of love in the most infantile sense possible. I think that she can afford to move beyond songs like these, pretty as they are. Will \"Not Too Late\" win any awards despite being at least twice as better than her \"Come Away with Me\" album? Probably not. The reason being that Norah is not perceived as \"new\" for \"fresh\" anymore. However, if you listen to this CD, it's the freshest thing out of the Jones stable so far. My favourite little piece other than the opener is \"The Sun Doesn't Like You\" - listen and discover! What makes me really happy about this album is the Repeat Value it carries - I have already played it about six times at work through and through and it just gets better on repeat listening. Do yourself a favor and pick this up, just to discover where American music is headed in general. This is a wonderful time for American music, and it's a testament to her growth and evolution that Norah Jones is the flagbearer for a new music generation. Yes, true talents like Joanna Newsom, Regina Spektor and Fiona Apple still don't get the adulation that they deserve, but if artists like Jones can win acclaim, it proves that there justice after all. Five Stars. Recommended without any reservations!","overall":5,"summary":"An Immediate Masterpiece : The Evolution of Miss Shankar","unixReviewTime":1171497600,"reviewTime":"02 15, 2007"}

Heath \"Gadgets, Music, & Books\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"Ordinary Riches is the debut CD from Company of Thieves. The group is a trio made up of vocalist Genevieve Schatz, guitarist Marc Walloch, and drummer Mike Ortiz. They produce a rock sound that has plenty of variety. Schatz's voice calls to mind a couple of different singers. At times she seems like a smoothed out version of Dolores O'Riordan from the Cranberries. However she is not a simple copycat as she does't always have the British\/Irish edge to her voice. On some of her sustained notes she also calls to mind Linda Perry of four Non Blondes (remember that song, \"What's Up?\"). While this may seem like an odd blend, it works really well. Instrumentally, Walloch does a more than adequate job on guitars. While I it would be premature to equate him with Utwo's The Edge, this playing is in that style. It's a cleaner sound that would you would her from someone like Jimmy Page for Joe Perry. The song arrangements and additional instruments used also provide a lot of variety in style. \"Even In The Dark\" and \"Quiet On The Front\" are slower, more driven rock songs while \"In Passing\" has almost a slight ska sound to it. \"Oskar Wilde\" is more of a mid tempo rocker. \"Quite On The Front\" also mixes in touches of harmonica and Hammond Bthree morgan. \"Past The Sleep\" is another rocker that fades in the send to a string arrangement of violin and cello. With all of these different styles and instruments, the potential is there for Ordinary Riches to come off like a loss collection of unrelated parts. However the result is much more that of a well seasoned stew. The songwriting on Ordinary Riches is in some ways the most interesting aspect of the CD. It tends to be poetic but not opaquely so. Relationships play a part in a few of the songs including the bookend tracks \"Old Letters\" and \"New Letters\". While the former deals with love gone wrong, the latter gives a more hopeful outlook. The military service influenced \"Quiet On The Front\" opens with \"I can't hold a glass of wine yet\/But they think it's fine to have me hold a gun\". More than half of the songs reflect the general trials of life. \"Oscar Wilde\" expresses this with the line \"We are your own devil\/And we make this world your hell\". \"The Fire Song\" and \"The Tornado Song\" both deal with natural disaster. As these would suggest, the general mood of Ordinary Riches is melancholy and reflective. Overall Company of Thieves has produced an excellent CD in Ordinary Riches. They manage to walk the very fine line of sounding familiar yet fresh at the same time. If you like rock music with a variety of styles among the tracks, give Ordinary Riches a chance.

Upon hearing that Beck was working with Danger Mouse on a new album, I was very intrigued. And that hugely anticipated album has finally arrived.\"Modern Guilt\" (ten tracks; thirty-four min.) kicks off with \"Orphans\", which sounds immediately familiar, until I realize it pretty much lifts the tune from Carly Simon's \"You're So Vain\" (not the chorus, but the verses before it), wow! But a fun track, for sure. The first half of the album flows impeccably, with the poppy \"Gamma Ray\", the dark \"Chemtrails\" (with thundering drums), the pensive title track, and the stripey \"Youthless\", as close as a dance track you'll find on there. I rate the first half of the album four.five stars. The second half starts off with an excellent one-two punch of \"Walls\" and \"Replica\", just Beck and Danger Mouse (who is credited with making \"Beats\" and \"Sounds\" throughout the album). Then the album falters with \"Soul of a Man\", followed by an excellent \"Profanity Prayers\", with hard charging electric guitars and drums. The closer \"Volcano\" is for me the weakest track on the album, it just does't seem to go anywhere. I rate the second half of the album three.five stars. In all, \"Modern Guilt\" is MILES better than \"The Information\". While this album is not as good as the seemingly happy-go-lucky album that was \"Guero\", I have nevertheless come to really love this album. It's a darker (think \"Sea Change\", but with GOOD itunes) and at thirty-four min. (joining a late rush of short albums such as REM's Accelerate), it clips by in no time, and I find myself playing this again and again. I've seen Beck a number of times over the years, and can't wait to see the songs from \"Modern Guilt\" in a live setting.","overall":4,"summary":"Strangely mesmerizing album","unixReviewTime":1215475200,"reviewTime":"07 8, 2008"}

With the release of \"Fearless,\" Taylor Swift showed she was a force to be reckoned with, with her combination of relatable lyrics, catchy music, and a sheer crossover appeal in everything she does. The results are an astonishing four million copies sold in its first year, and counting this release, twelve of the nineteen tracks have been top forty hits, which is a record. Not to mention 'You Belong with Me' & 'Love Story' were the biggest country songs in twenty-some years. With all this success, and never-grateful to her fans, Taylor decided to throw in some bonus tracks and a load of DVD content added to the release. Granted, it's always preferable to do bonus content in the form of an EP, but this is Taylor's thank you for the fans. If you're a fan, you should't complain in buying the album again, if you're not, this really won't change your mind, so don't bother. Musically, it's a true extension of the album, as all of the tracks blend in perfectly. 'Jump Then Fall' is a natural follow-up to her other singles, and the song should take off as her singles tend to do. 'Forever & Always' greatly improves on the original in bringing out the heart and emotion of the song in a great performance. But the real reason why you should buy this is because of her cover of 'Untouchable.' When I first heard the song I was absolutely stunned since I was a big fan of the original as done by the alternative rock band, Luna Halo. Taylor takes a high-energy rock song and strips it down to it's emotional score. The results are nothing short of amazing, as the vocals, lyrics, and restrained instrumentation adds up to a beautiful song, which is breathtaking in its chorus. This is how you should do a cover, and Taylor covers the song perfectly adding a great spin to it. I'd even go as far to say that this is her best work. As for the DVD portion, this is where the fan-service is. Not only does it hold the five music videos that have been made for the album thus far, but it contains the thirty-minute making-of special GAC haired. Add in a photo gallery, a tour behind the scenes, and even the Thug Story video, and you have some two hours of bonus material, which is more than some movies give you. And if you got the live performances, you'll enjoy the great work her band does. Overall, if you're a fan, for you don't have the album yet, I highly recommend this release. Not only does its bonus material go far beyond the normal call of duty, but it's all quality bonus content. If you take anything away from this release, take away \"Untouchable\" off iTunes, it's an amazing track, and it's imperative you check it out. If there was any negative there, it'd be the fact there in't any alternative version to \"Love Story\" for \"You Belong With Me.\" I also got to say I'm a huge fan of the album part & the linear notes part. Fearless Score: four.five\/fiveFearless: Platinum Edition Score: four.five\/fiveReal Score: five\/five","overall":5,"summary":"In Case You Were Wondering, Taylor Swift Is Still Untouchable","unixReviewTime":1257638400,"reviewTime":"11 8, 2009"}

I kept seeing clips of her on the VHone channel prior to the debut of her lead single, FROM MY HEART TO YOURS. The song is so catchy & infectious that it heightened my anticipation of the album release and I'm happy to say that I'm not disappointed with this purchase. Because Laura is from another country she does have an affected way of singing and her stone of voice is somewhat similar to Joss Stone. The album is short & sweet at ten tracks but I enjoy listening to most of them so in my book this is a very successful debut - kudos to Laura as another strong singer\/songwriter. On a side note, I hope that as the fall season begins, she will get more national exposure on a few of the talk shows so that more people may become aware of her. It is difficult to pick favourites but the tracks I not only kept on repeat but also put on my ipod are the aforementioned, FROM MY HEART TO YOURS; SHINE; DON'T STAY; PERFECT WORLD; I DON'T WANT YOU BACK & MMM.","overall":4,"summary":"Let The Truth Be Told - 4.5 stars","unixReviewTime":1252195200,"reviewTime":"09 6, 2009"}

From the beginning all its way through the send the music you find there is an unforgettable experience. Before I jump into conclusions with some of the songs let me tell you that this girl is so talented on her own terms. The production of the album is stunning and the arrangements of the instruments flow in such an incredible way and natural form that you might believe that perfection is what you hear. A piano there, an Arp there (such a beautiful inclusion to this record), an electric and acoustic guitar every now and then make the songs come up with their own personality.\"Dogs days are over\", \"I'm not calling you a liar\" and \"Drumming song\" fight against the traditional way of a song structure. there's a point where you don't know what you're listening and yet, you can't stop tapping your foot on the floor at the rhythm of the music. Great songs for sure. \"Rabbit heart (raise it up)\" (of course!!!), \"Kiss with a fist\" and \"You've got the love\" are meant to be the commercial jones??? on the record. not that they're less impressive because of this 'cause once you hear the first one you fall in love with it right away. To point out one of item in particular, I find \"My boy builds coffins\" a masterpiece. For some reason everything falls right in place there.\"Lungs\" is by far one the best records of this year and for sure will be one of the best in the first decade of the two thousand's. Because of projects like Florence + the machine and Bat for flashes (I must say), we know that if this kind of music is coming up from such young girls, we can expect a bright future for music itself. It is wok that we have ALL kinds of music: the bubblegum one (with all the annoying scene in the US), abstract one (a la Radiohead) and commercial-respected one (R. E. M., Utwo, Muse for even Placebo). But if we did't have the independent one and all the UK scene going on, the whole music universe would be so predictable.","overall":5,"summary":"Becuase of projects like Florence + the machine the music industry has still hope of surviving","unixReviewTime":1255824000,"reviewTime":"10 18, 2009"}

{"orig_index":57985,"reviewerID":"A2ULSA0IRUE09E","asin":"B0026NWBY2","reviewerName":"Marc Cabir Davis","helpful":[27,37],"reviewText":"There are two kinds of Beatles fans - those that credit John Lennon & Paul McCartney with being the pillars of the band, and those that appreciate George Harrison for the spiritual, whimsical quality the brought to the team. I fall into the latter category, and those of us who 'get' Harrison, will understand more than anyone what sort of musical genius this man actually was. While McCartney spent years after the bands' breakup making one chorus-y, pop song-filled album after the other, it was Harrison who continually pushed himself to become more and more experimental and creative, and every album of this has been so different, so refreshing, and as a whole, they represent a very diverse catalog of recorded music. Its difficult to imagine that one man could create such varied work, but that remains the wonder that is George. Cut to two thousand and nine, and we have the third officially released compilation of George's greatest hits. I guess we have Dhani Harrison to thank for this, and while I rate this five stars, it should have ideally been a two-CD set, considering the wealth of material that Harrison has behind him. As a listener who considers \"All Things Must Pass\" as the best solo album by a Beatle (nothing by Lennon for McCartney comes close - those Paul did surpass himself with \"Chaos & Creation\" from a few years ago), this album pays fine homage to that three-CD set. The issue is that ALL of Harrisons' solo works are so absolutely essential, that culling tracks from any of them borders on unjustifiable - but of course that needs to be done in the case of a Greatest Hits collection. His second solo album, \"Living in the Material World\" (which sold less than this debut, but is still a classic) should have been given more due. The lead single from that set, \"Give me Love (Give me Peace on Earth)\" has all the strains of this Bangladesh concert - and this is present there, sounding better than never before. The prime omissions come from \"Dark Horse\", which remains one of Harrisons' lowest-charting and most underrated CDs. Any listener should try to track down a copy of that album (just for its stunning cover part, if nothing else), as it contains so many vital Harrison classics, such as \"Far East Man\" and \"Simply Shady\". You will also find that much of George's output from the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys has been neglected there, which is a pity. Some of this best work came on \"thirty-three one\/three\" from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, and this self-titled record from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine (which thankfully is represented on this hits collection). Along the way, there are some oddities. \"Cheer Down\", which previously was only a compilation track, was also a song written with Tom Petty for the \"Lethal Weapon two\" soundtrack - many people have never heard of this song, so this is a great inclusion. Also, this record contains the three songs that George made magical for The Beatles - \"Something\", \"Here Comes the Sun\", and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". While no one can deny the beauty of these songs, it would have been great to see them excluded in favor of some of George's solo works in this later career - there are so many hits that are not represented, especially many of this UK singles that failed to chart in the US. The Beatles songs that are present on this album are in fact from Harrisons' solo Bangladesh concert recording - which is little comfort to those of us expecting tracks from \"Somewhere in England\", for \"Gone Troppo\" (two more vastly underrated solo Harrison records). On a better note, \"When We Was Fab\" from \"Cloud Nine\" is present. Finally, this is not a perfect collection, but certainly the best Harrison collection that is currently available. His first compilation, from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, is clearly not this best effort, considering how much it relied upon this Beatles hits to flesh itself out. The current disc should have indeed been a double disc, but the attention paid to the song selection is satisfying. Still, this is by no means a comprehensive Harrison collection. I doubt anything can be. He is one recording artist whose back-catalog is hardly remembered and always overlooked. I personally consider much of this solo work better and even more listenable than this work with the Beatles.\"Let It Roll\" runs for seventy-eight minutes, which is great because it is indeed 'stuffed' with Harrison hits (technically, all of this Billboard Hot one hundred hits are present there). As an introduction to a quiet and talented songwriter, this is a stellar way to get into this work and life. As a stand-alone disc, this is riveting and vibrant. For Beatles fans and longtime Harrison followers such as myself, this will fall way off the mark, but taken for what it is, this is a loving compilation that deserves all the sales and adoration it can get. Five Stars.","overall":5,"summary":"Vital & Essential : How They (Almost) Got It Right","unixReviewTime":1245110400,"reviewTime":"06 16, 2009"}

Throw in the death of a lead singer, a new record label and other personnel changes, and it stopped being fair long ago. Guns N' Roses had a hard enough time with only half those problems. Yet guitarist \/ singer Jerry Cantrell and 'ninetys rock monster Alice in Chains just could't be bothered with the mire, doom and gloom unless they were writing about it. Black Gives Way to Blue is more than a reunion with Mike Inez and Sean Kinney to produce a return to form. It's also one of the best rock albums of two thousand and nine. To replace a vocalist as tuneful and iconic as Layne Staley has been impossible. Bands influenced by AiC, as diverse as Life of Agony, Staind, Godsmack, Days of the New and a never-ending list have all had competent vocalists that have been jeered at by critics as Staley-derivativea. The only person who could even hope to get away with comparisons was Jerry Cantrell himself, and the sang on half of AiC's original material anyway. Well, this golden touch adds a glow of authenticity to the new record. \"Check My Brain\" feels like it came right off of Dirt for one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five's self-titled album, and \"Your Decision\" and \"When the Sun Rose Again\" recall the band's softer EPs Sap and Jar of Flies. Then you have itunes like the jagged, angularly melodic opener \"All Secrets Known,\" the elephantine, foot-stomping opening grove of \"A Looking in View\" and the piano-tinged quiet exit of a title track, \"Black Gives Way to Blue.\"The haunting, tortured vocals of William DuVall are a spooky echo of Staley, as if the deceased front-man's spirit is being channelled through the songs themselves, but it could also just be the ghost-like nature of AiC's trademarked minor key voice harmonies. Cantrell and DuVall coexist and bring the itunes to life. Never quite an alternative grunge band like the groups they were lumped in with by radio stations over a decade ago, Alice in Chains spew their triumphant new work from speakers with crunch and doom metal fury. Just listen to the of-bombing tunnel-chewing groove of \"Last of My Kind\" and step out of the way as this reanimated corpse barrels through.","overall":5,"summary":"Chains Broken...In A Good Way","unixReviewTime":1268611200,"reviewTime":"03 15, 2010"}

Anyway, this album blew me away. On this one I get the feel they're not trying so hard to prove how erratic and different they can be with their music. It has much more thrash to it, which I am wild about. This, I feel, is a good, solid album that will still be good a few years from now.

I can imagine that the band may close a few fair weather fans with this album, but those who remain will find a wholly enjoyable album that gets better with each listen. Coheed and Cambria are not a band you could never accuse of stagnation. Perhaps `Departure,' is too strong, but this album is certainly different, the album seems to make a conscious effort not to sound too much like two thousand and seven's `No World For Tomorrow,' album, eschewing the slick almost overproduced sound and bright tones for an almost industrial sound, with more electronics, flatter tones and an abundance of samples, electro drums, odd guitar tones and vocal effects. Drummer Chris Pennie is a perfect fit for this band, and fits perfectly with the band's established drum style on songs like `World of Lines,' and `The Broken,' but adds a whole new flavor to the excellent almost drum solo quality `Guns of Summer,' and `In The Flame of Error,' which are at times unlike anything you've never heard on a Coheed album before. The songwriting also seems to be more in line with the band's work before Good Apollo than after, but all the new tones, sounds and Claudio's vocals stop this from sounding like a rehash of new ideas, but rather a new era of Coheed all together. Lyrically, the album seems to be a lot more personal than the previous two albums and features barely any reference to place names, character names, for words like `Prise,' `Mon-Star,' for `Key Frame,' this may please some sections of the fans and upset others, but given the quality of the lyrics and vocal performance few will be disappointed in any serious way. Highlights include the fast potential single `World Of Lines,' the drumming masterpiece `In The Flame of Error,' and the superb semi-ballad `Pearl of the Stars,' which features some brilliant unusual percussion, beautiful guitar work and possibly Claudio's finest vocal performance to date, switching between new low pitched vocals and this traditional style to great effect.

After their third, groundbreaking album - Midnight Boom, I pondered how these two smart musicians would be table to top that incredible feat? Well, I am more than happy to say that Blood Pressures was definitely worth the wait! The opening track, Future Starts Slow is the strongest track hands down. The song has a killer hook and you can't help but using along: \"No longing for the moonlight, no longing for the sun, no longer will I curse the bad I've done. \" And just like their previous album - there is not one song that I skip. This album is more diverse and more traditional rock. On the song, The Last Goodbye we get to hear Alison's sensitive side - such a beautiful and tender ballad. Baby Says sounds like a across between a 'sixtys girl group song and a 'eightys new wave song. Heart is a Beating Drum and Nail in My Coffin are some of the other standout tracks. You Don't Own the Road is just pure, sweaty fun with Jamie rocking out on this distorted, blistering guitars. And then by the last track, Pots and Pans - I was't quite sure if this was a break-up kind of song for a twisted, sick love song? All I know is that quirky song is pure magic with Alison's sexy voice repeating the last lyric over and over: \"These are the days we'll never forget when the dawn, dawns on you.\" So what that in mind, I highly recommend this pitch-perfect album. enjoy!","overall":5,"summary":"\"I love you, just not the way you want...\"","unixReviewTime":1302998400,"reviewTime":"04 17, 2011"}

Listening to this album was like a rush of euphoria. There's so much excitement and exploration on these tracks . it's like listening to a sonic journal of a group of young people travelling the world, experiencing things for the first time. Each track is like taking a trip to a new place. What stands out most of all for me in the album is that each track makes excellent use of percussion, which often evokes various cultures.

It replicates the eightys new wave synth-pop sound mixed in with some Prince-style funk. The aesthetics are exactly like that era, putting little (if any) modern elements into the music. And most of the songs there are very strong. The percussion, keyboards, lyrical content, and the lead singer's falsetto put together create some irresistible rhythms and moods that are very sophisticated. The music is complex at times, but it is also usually infectious. You can be impressed by the album's craft and production, as well as dance along to it. Compared to other indietronica bands like Foster The People for MGMT, there are less guitars and rock elements. It's almost always a dance album. Mostly the songs are mid-tempo, nothing that is `loud' and only about two slow songs. The lyrics are often deep, sometimes quirky, but never that deep and never over the top quirky. While the album is infectious, the songs might be too complex for top forty radio. My favourite tracks on the album are \"Motion Sickness\", \"These Chains\", \"Night and Day\" (the first single), \"Flutes\", and \"Let Me Be Him\".","overall":5,"summary":"Replicates 80s synth-pop well","unixReviewTime":1340236800,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2012"}

Lee \"Constant Listener\"","helpful":[3,5],"reviewText":"Dear Music Appreciators,(At first I found myself giggling a bit at some of the eighty's-movie-friendly, synth-heavy arrangements, but after repeated listening this music seemed to begin to burrow into my mind a bit, as if trying to push its way past my consciousness and into that part of me that does not think, but simply exists. )Silentaria's latest offering WHAT'S REAL? is an intense, solo electronic music extravaganza that probes the nature of reality and the relationship between the dinner and router world of the human experience. A deep subject to be sure, but that is one of the benefits of the virtually wordless approach employed there by Rixa White. Mostly unconstrained from the limited meanings of words, White takes flight with this synthesizer and a host of other instruments and brings us along for the journey. And it does feel like a journey. The music is very cinematic - the tracks all seeming both different and the same in a way - much like a movie score, where one for two recurring themes is woven into a number of other variations on those themes that both advance the story from scene to scene and remind us of the big picture. Notice the eerie sounds of the opening track, the clapping water, the synthesizer refrain that gradually fades in, reproduces itself, and evolves, the short and simple bass notes spaced out like hopscotch footprints in the sand - the spacing and layering of different sounds there is effective and interesting and holds the listener's attention, waiting for what's next.\"Curtains Over Eyes\" is a stunner, and ironically sounds a lot like an Enya song at the beginning - bird sounds, eerie choir, bell tolling, synth-electric guitar flourishes, but things darken and intensify at the one:twenty-five mark with the addition of a slow, fuzzed out, industrial heartbeat - as if to remind listeners that this is not your grandmother's top forty new page musicYou might be interested to know that Silentaria's Rixa White wears a white mask - \"One mask to hide them all\" (check the autobiography on this website) - and while this is effective at giving him a mysterious air (possibly making this music and philosophy seem more fascinating than it is) does it have the intended effect of wiping away the listener's preconceived notions for judgments? Well, yes and no - \"yes\" because we can't judge him for what the looks like if we can't see this face - \"no\" because less high-minded people will judge him for the very fact that they can't see this face - and invite the inevitable comparisons to other famous mask wearers such as Zorro, The Phantom of the Oprah, Jason in the FRIDAY THE thirteenTH movies, and maybe even Tom Cruise's character in VANILLA SKY. and perhaps that's fitting after all for a composer who attempts to express in musical form WHAT'S REAL? - it's a bit of a heroic gesture, and needs a strong character for the task. Mask for no mask, with such a deep idea explored through distinctive electronic tracks this intense and varied, WHAT'S REAL? deserves a large and devoted audience. Sincerely,Constant Listener","overall":5,"summary":"DEAR MUSIC APPRECIATORS","unixReviewTime":1342569600,"reviewTime":"07 18, 2012"}

One bad routing can cause a lot of damage to any band's reputation, but that's something Clutch will never have to worry about. This band is so consistent, coming out of the blocks rocking on the title track a dynamic, vocally bombastic, full blooded banger due to Neil Fallon's characteristic intensity. The next cuts, \"Terminal Velocity\" and \"Mister Freedom\" continue the flow matching the opener step for step. The band has stated that \"Earth Rocker will be a more harder and straight forward rocking album.\" I believe they nailed it. On and on it goes, with every passing track the realization is that there in't going to be a decline in quality, and that they may have produced an album that ranks up there comfortably with the best of their career. Tim Sult is probably better than most band's top basemen on this worst day and JP Gaster's rock drumming makes it look easy, but honorable mention goes to Neil Fallon as usual, for this \"mixture of demented preacher speaking in tongues mixed with no frills blue collar rocker that sets them apart from the competition.\" The man has buckets of personality which overflow into the lyrics and the music. I read. \"Earth Rocker is a rollicking heavy rock ride that showcases Clutch at the top of their game once again. With their 'no-filler, all-killer' logic and a fan-pleasing alteration in style, the outfit have churned out one of the their most widely appealing efforts thus far, not to mention a staple release for salt-rockers in two thousand and thirteen.\"The blues cuts and influences are not missing altogether, \"D. C. Sound Attack!\" is the song that has some of the most obvious blues influences. All the itunes are catchy and there is tons of energy happening there. Yeah, like Clutch is going to be laid back, LOL. So crank it up and blow out your speakers, as Dan Maines quotes. \"I think this record comes closer to really capturing that energy of Clutch live. It's a very balanced album. There's no B-side material. It's an album of A-sides. That sounds pretty bold and confident, but that's the way we feel about Earth Rocker.\"I can't wait to receive my copy to listen to the total album rather than the snippets and you tube videos that are out there. So saddle up and ride this one still the horse packs it in as this rocker is going to wear you down.","overall":5,"summary":"Clutch are still proving that nobody does it better....","unixReviewTime":1362873600,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2013"}
