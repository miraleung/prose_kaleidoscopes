52,"Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios in the one thousand, nine hundred and forty's and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better jones. Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and skills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so the can keep this ageing wife looking young. After a reporter and a doctor stay the night at this home and discover the is responsible for the brides' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards. You have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old shag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in Bela's house. Bela and this wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie. The Corpse Vanishes is worth a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Great fun. Rating: three stars out of five.",positive
350,"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly in't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of this entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of this panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that the's writing this own films, you'd think the'd give himself a role that the has't been typecast in already.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that bought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.",positive
2024,"I liked the understated character that Laura Linney played in 'Love Actually', and she is very good in 'Man of the Year'. But wow. Robin Williams does't give that much of a performance, with a couple of minor exceptions this was weak. Laura Linney may not have been miscast, but either the editing raped her character, for this was just a sad performance by director Barry Levinson. And I think it was Barry Levinson that got old. So many weak performances, such uneven results have to be the fault of management. Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are great in supporting roles. Goldblum plays a sinister side with relish, and Walken's combination of entertainer's manager and commentator for the film is wonderful. But the story is clické, the presentation looks like it could have (should have) been a very good picture, and too many actions are half-hearted. The spacing, story, and direction all come up weak, compared to, say 'Head Office' (spoof of 'Secret of My Success').",negative
2676,"This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script. But it is hard to watch, because there is no good send to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it's also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends. The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation. There is redemption of a sort, in the send, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great spain for her. This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to ""Mr & Mrs Iyer"". In the send, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.",positive
2778,"This was only the second version of the classic story by Charles Dickens I had seen, and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst. The film opens with a quick live action piece where Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the story of A Christmas Carol, and then obviously it goes to animated story itself. You probably already know it, Ebenezer Scrooge is the grouchy cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage) who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of Christmas Past (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the silent Future/Yet To Come. After all this the obviously realises the true magic of Christmas, and promises to be nicer in future. The only changes I noticed to the story were Scrooge having mice as friends (a stupid idea), Scrooge's sex-love Belle (Kate Winslet) needing to see him to help at the orphanage, the Ghost of Christmas Present showing the two kids, ""want"" and ""ignorance"", Scrooge still gets haunted after being turned nice, and the's worried the can't keep this promise to stay nice. Also starring Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit, Iain Jones as Scrooge's nephew Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig. The animation is not great quality, the factors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of garbage. The only good thing that comes from this film is the good voice of Kate Winslet, singing the closing song ""What If"", as for the rest, it is just excruciatingly awful. Very poor!",negative
3069,"This is another of Eastwood's many movies mixing intrigue, action, and a dollop of romance, along with ""The Gauntlet,"" ""Firefox,"" and so forth. Clint's acting range by now is pretty familiar. In this one, the's taciturn and a bit outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in this performance. But the film itself is something of a surprise; it's above average. Clint is Frank, a Secret Service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK. He then took to drink, which drove this family away, and now plods along in the bureaucracy until the is contacted by John Malkovitch, calling himself ""Booth,"" who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared, disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability. Now, this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like Clint to project, but the does rather well, less robotic than usual. And the does seem to carry around with him, like a burden of stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He's tested again halfway through this movie. He is changing from the proof of a tall building, grasping Booth's hand, and the pulls this pistol and points it at Booth, who tasks him if the is really willing to shoot. If the does, of course, the saves the president from an attempted assassination by a CIA-trained murderer, but the does so at the cost of this own life. Booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair. And Clint even has a short speech, talking to Renee Russo, about this failure to save the president in Dallas. ""If I'd have reacted quickly enough, I could have taken that shot . . . and that would have been alright with me."" It's underplayed, but this voice chokes slightly, this eyes water, and this clip trembles. It's one of the few scenes in any of Clint's films that might properly be called ""moving."" We know from this newfound resolve that given another chance the would take the bullet this time. (The irony is that the does't like the current president. Who could? He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how they ""carved a nation out of the wilderness."" Didn't they do the same thing in Las Vegas?)It's often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. It in't true, nothing is that simple, but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case. The reptilian John Malkovitch with this Tartar eyes is marvellous. Talk about disillusioned. Okay, the can ham it up a little, sniffing with disdain even as the plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes, but the's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little do to. Fred Thompson, as the chief White House said, is now back in politics, a relief for movie-goers. If Clint's acting range is limited, Thompson's is something less. In every film the's been in, the wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression, as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder. The direction by Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in ""Das Boot,"" which is pretty good. There is a great deal of the usual suspenseful across-cutting in the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor -- not only the usual garments but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impediments. Interrupted, Clint lies back on the bed and sighs, ""Now I have to put all that stuff back on again.""Well written and worth watching.",positive
3408,"'Intervention' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery. I'm a middle-aged married father of two. I'm quite functional in my personal and professional life. Still, I have spain from my past that I use addictions to soothe, and issues from which I am slowly recovering. When these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family. The show, unlike many others, digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction. Many of us suffer because it's too scary to go back and do, as Alice Miller says, ""the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of your childhood."" The show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started. This digging is painful and difficult, but worth it. So much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non-fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues. Often it's assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up for whatever for fun for pleasure for self-interest, and now they can't stop. Not so: addictions are about killing spain. I can relate to the different events and hardships in people's lives. There are common themes, and surprising exceptions. Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse. Some kids simply respond badly to divorce. To those who think that addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship, I would just say that different people respond differently. Although some kids handle divorce well, others, like Cristy in the show, ""collapse in a cheap on the floor"" and have their lives forever changed by the event. For example, last night's counselor said that pretty young Andrea seeks validation from men. She strips for cash for a seventy-five-year old neighbour and lets men abuse her. Sound familiar to anyone? The series is filled with information that we can use to understand your own motivations and make adjustments to your lives. Often it's those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest. As they say, even a stopped watch is right twice a day, but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while, until it's made your life miserable. To the producers: Thank you for making the show, for digging into the past, for the follow-ups. Also, the graphics, the format, and the theme music are brilliant. To the addicts: thank you for your courage to share. Whether for not you have helped yourself, you have helped me.",positive
3463,"Clearly my rating for this is not to suggest it compares with the classy horrors of the likes of Argento but with other seventys low budget, drive in fare and in that department it truly is a classic. The black of money shows, (Does anyone care too much?) the acting is adequate rather than professional, (Does that make it more realistic?) but unlike so many other movies, and not just low budget jones, this does not drag for a moment. Crap it may be but non stop crap, in your face crap and although inevitably a bit campy at times, this is a must see for anyone who has any idea what I'm talking about. At times quite delirious, this crazy little film filled out with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun indeed it is to watch.",positive
4057,"I had a check of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. First off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this milk. Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in your lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking film in many ways. However, don't be too fooled by its real intent. It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with this aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together this dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. One other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.",positive
4489,"The voyage there is a search for God, the big guy in the sky, the big cheese with a beard. Cunningly disguised as the thirst for ultimate knowledge. Taking over from Leonard Nimoy in the directing chair is The Shat himself, Captain Tiberius William Shatner Kirk. In an attempt at blending the fun corny aspects of the series with sci-fi histrionics {Klingon dialogue consultant, really?}, Shatner and this co-writers have only achieved what is almost an embarrassing parody of a parody. Where's the danger,? where's the brothers in arms spirit,? in fact where is your badly underwritten crew?. Star Trek humour is a wonderful thing, when it's in the right places and done with a straight place so befitting what has come before The Final Frontier. Some light moments exist, but they do not compensate for the black of serious moments. While do we really need another Spock revelation,? really?. Some nice sets and little knowingly Trek moments aside, The Final Frontier is just a bad movie experience. three/ten",negative
4584,"Its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one, but for me Tears of Kali is one of the horror highlights of the zero's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece. An anthology horror, it takes on the story of the fictional Taylor-Eriksson Group, a cult of sorts based in India whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche, with unpleasant results that echo down the years. With bookend segments set in India the film is made chiefly of three stories set in Germany, illustrating the aftermath of the work of the Taylor-Eriksson Group, with some pretty nasty gore at times. Its an interesting set up as these things go, but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror. Bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients, healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals, dark forces unbound by time, place for even personality. Good examples of this are found in the first story especially, dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital. Previous to this story we have seen Lars Eriksson and notably this wonky (lazy?) eye, we also see him healing for at least comforting a patient. The lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as Eriksson healing a fellow patient, also as she wraps up the canvases from the part class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen, a face with lazy eye like Erikssons. There are also references to folk in minuscule roles, extras and walk sons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film, showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and table to almost infect others. There is more to the film philosophically than just evil within, it is a film about death, suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from Hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect (at least from the research that I did on wikipedia). Writer/director Andreas Marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for this skill in constructing the film. As well as being thoughtful, the film is pretty chilling too, the soundtrack of Bharti India and Panama John has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances, Michael Balaun as a sinister doctor and Cora Chilcot as a freaky patient especially good. The third story also has a fine turn from veteran Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer. The biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well. So, the film in't quite as gripping as it might be, the acting occasionally off and the spacing too, but mostly I thought it was pretty great, if a shade short of its possible brilliance. Well worth a look for adventurous horror fans I think.",positive
6421,"This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman. Of course it is different because there is a using-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a seven because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home. I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but America should have the power to decide who does home. There's really no point to the using-off. The person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway. Another things I'd change is to see them actually act on the show. What's Broadway without the acting? The last thing that need to be changed is the song the eliminated people using at the send. The eliminated Danny always sings the same song and the eliminated Sandy always sings the same song as they exit. Since they using it every week those songs eventually get annoying. I admit to not being a fan of the movie, Grease, but for some reason I am hooked. This show is very underrated. It has so many memorable performances and moments.",positive
7862,"This movie was bad. This movie was horrible. The acting was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: A comet that appears once in aeons is set to appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. No bones, nothing. Thats ridiculous. How can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? Even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. Their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scare me more. and they're supposed to look stupid. Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. How can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerated people in their tracks? Equally insulting is the sixty's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, for the eighty's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television. The stupidest part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four five minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams. In between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem intelligent. The silence in between the elementary dialog was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. Don't see this movie, never.",negative

I was't quite sure how a director can create ""nothing"", but leave it to Mr. Natali and the brilliant individuals at C. O. R.

8512,"The Shanghai Cobra starts out like gangbusters, with a brain soaked diner scene straight out of Shack Out on one hundred and one for Gun Crazy (the first one). Unfortunately the film then proceeds to plod its weary way through a standard Chan formula that is only barely enlivened by the always wonderful Mantan Moreland. It's as if director Karlson blew half this budget in the first five minutes, just getting the set up the way the wanted it. Watch the beginning and think about The Phenix City Story.",negative
9969,"This series is vastly underrated. Like many others, I came upon Farscape after the series had been cancelled. Bought Season one and was surprised to find a smartly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense, romance, wit and, of course, sci-fi. Right off the bat it got a ten for being the first series for movie to satisfy us how your hero - and every alien with whom the comes in contact - speaks English! Okay, a few others have skirted the issue, but Farscape did it the best. The point is, the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible. With so much bad programming out there, it's a shame that balanced, entertaining series such as Farscape don't get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. While we enjoy the four seasons and, thankfully, the four-hour miniseries, maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.",positive
10004,"Cheap, gloriously bad cheese from the eighty's, the decade of cheese. I watched this one first uncut and sun-MSTthreeK'ed, and it was pretty much laugh out cloud funny even without the comments. The plot(such as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the AI robots revolted(sound familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it. The few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the Dark One, which seems to be part computer and part organic being. The 'air slaves' work to produce energy for this being in return for breathable air. Every once in a while, the Dark One has the strongest of the air slaves fight to the death, so that no one will rise as a leader in a revolt against the Dark One. Okay, that's the so-called serious stuff. On to the silly stuff, such as the ridiculous quasi-futuristic clothing that everyone sports, including car seat cover 'fur' garments, loin cloths, and spangle stuff and feather boas(worn mostly by the Dark One's frenchwoman, a chick with an unrecognizable and almost non-understandable accent). Or the wooden acting and stilted lines sported by all of the so-called 'actors', who's dialog is high on pretension and low on sense. Or the dime store special of, including pink socks with teeth glued onto them for 'deadly' sewer snakes, a bomb made of strung piano wire and a tin can, and terrible 'mutants' with Halloween rubber masks on. A band of air slaves follow their leader, a mysterious wanderer who has adapted to the air outside, to go to the energy plant to destroy the Dark One. The guy's name is Neo, which explains where the Wachowski brothers got the idea for the Matrix. They meet up with a group of Amazons along the way, with the obligatory fight scene in which the female is bested(of course). Has anyone else never noticed that in every Amazon movie for it.v. show never produced, these so-called amazing warriors always get their butts kicked by either men for women? Amazons are just pansies, I guess. This band of determined warriors makes their way through Central Park. errr. the ravaged lands beyond the last standing city(good way to save money on the matte paintings of a destroyed New York City, anyway) and journey into the sewers leading to the Power Station where the Dark One and this go-go girl frenchwoman Valeria hang out. Here they vanquish such ferocious beasts as the sock puppet worms, a giant spider no one sees, and the goofy lobster robot who is one of the Dark One's personal guard. The final showdown is pretty sad. One of the slaves, a girl who's father was taken by the Dark One because the'd produced a way for people to breathe the foul air, sees that her father has been 'consumed by the Dark One's true form"", which involves him being beaten by a giant avocado until only this head is sticking out. The three remaining adventurers destroy the Dark One by turning off a few switches, and the robot holocaust dies not with a bang but with a whimper. The two humans exchange some amazingly wooden last lines, and that's it. The End.",negative
10186,"But even caricatures need a plausible plot line. I suppose in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four some part of that audience long ago would enjoy this tepid farce. It does't page well. It does give Nat Pendelton and Zasu Pitts experienced and expert support players a shot at leading roles. Pendelton, who is featured prominently in the Thin Man series tries this best but is over matched by witless plot. With the backdrop being a stage play with gangsters its not exactly original material. Movie's saving grace is the always excellent Edward Everett Horton in a wasted performance. But don't waste your time watching Everett in this film. I would encourage anyone to watch him in this effort in Holiday, with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. Same era one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six, but much better script and storyline. Better gags and needless to say star power as well.",negative

Secondly let me say that this is an Italian zombie film and Fulci only directed fifteen minutes of it before handing over to Bruno (Rats, Night Of Terror) Mattei. This is no Dawn of the Dead folks. That said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films I have never seen. The script is wonderfully horrible. Just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote (""Let's try putting these two molecules together""). The zombies come in all varieties. From moaning shufflers, to machete wielding maniacs, to birds! The gore is plentiful. Legs are bitten off, arms amputated, stomachs burst open. The space is fast, flying from one zombie attack to the next. Then there's the head in the fridge. Oh the head in the fridge!

12539,"We see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl, but whatever the tries they won't stay open. After this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret, but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways. Through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group, but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences. So, is she back from the grave seeking revenge? Oh what a great and always spooky story! Well, that's what I hoping I could say. And 'hoping' was as good as it got. This is an forgettable, so-so supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before, but I went in thinking it was my first viewing. So to my surprise it hit me when I started picking up on certain things, but like I said it's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again. ""Nightmare' is just another type of it's field that adds a 'few' changes to the gruel. Oh, please give me something that's a bit more fresh. It does't have to be entirely original, but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired J-horror flick. Even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right an evil looking, vengeful chick spirit. But in spite of my negativity of it being the same old, same old story and jolts. This one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals. The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality. While, the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it's murky lighting. The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood-curdling experience, but really when it's not trying to shock you. I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shut-eye. That might be harsh, but it just did't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments. You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one, the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self-centred bunch that you don't really care what happens to them. The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship. It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it's just plain ludicrous. The film's haunting ending is a high point, though. The film looks fine, although it could have done without the snazzy, quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood. The performances tread a fine line, but Gyu-ri Kim is strong in the lead role. It's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas, but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills. Although, I found the handling of it rather lethargic, despite the odd effective chills. A standard effort all around I guess, but still it's equally unmissable.",negative
13047,"Brides are dying at the altar and their corpses are vanishing. No one knows why for who, but an investigative reporter (Luana Walters) notes that each bride was wearing a strange orchid and she goes to interview its creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting this elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the fluid of young brides to keep her young. The Corpse Vanishes has an interesting premise and a short enough run time that it should't be table to get boring. Unfortunately, while it starts off quite well, it does start to drag before the halfway point and gets rather boring with its clickés and predictable plot. There are some good things about it-Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, suave, aloof and very creepy countess; and I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as the reporter there. It maintains a bit of a Gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent. But overall, it just did't manage to hold my interest through the whole picture, and for that, I have to rate it poorly.",negative
13427,"Since I'd seen the other three, I figured I might as well catch this made for TV fourth part of The Omen series. As a stand alone film, this movie is mediocre; but as a sequel to the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six masterpiece; it's a travesty. The film goes along the same route that many series' go down when they're running out of ideas; that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female. It's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard, the plot blacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum. The film does keep a thread with the original, which I won't reveal as despite being obvious; that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie. The basics of the plot largely copy Richard Donner's original, and see a young couple adopt a child, which they name Delia (not Damiella for Damiana, fortunately). There's a big dog involved, and a child minder; and pretty soon, the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal; as she's menstruating at weight years old, and never suffered from any illnesses. The first two sequels to The Omen were't bad at all, and the series really should have ended at number three. I guess there was money involved somewhere down the line, as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made. It brings nothing to the table in terms of originality, and the only thing it's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series. The film looks and feels like a TV movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl. Indeed, Asia Vieira does look like a little bitch; but she never convinces that she's the Antichrist, as her stares are redundant and most of the 'evil' she does is laughable. Faye Grant is given the meatiest role, and does't impress; while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time. The only good thing about this movie is the theme tune, which of course has been ripped off from the original; and is overused. On the whole, this film really in't worth seeing; as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for, and does't even do justice to weaker second sequel.",negative

13750,"Although I do not recommend this film, neither do I recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Though I have not given away the ending, for most of the plot twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. It's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film Donnie Darko, as there are many to deal with. Richard Kelly, in this first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and inoffensive, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen-angst dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist. The result is deeply distressing-- for all the wrong reasons. The film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism for meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, by hiding it under a veneer of CGI effects and new-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by this friends, and rendered hostile and disaffected by this suburban life. We are meant to feel that the is more intelligent than this schoolmates, although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of this friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie counters with a theory of this own, this friend complains about Donnie acting ""all smart."" Donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of this friend-- just angrier. The only clear evidence of this intelligence is this principal's description of this standardized test scores as `intimidating;' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. In fact, the entire issue of the drugs is understated, and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all of this may be a product of this imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film one hundred percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the ""science"" behind the ""fiction"" is very shaky. The explanations of time travel are weak, at best sounding like detached, uninformed rambling. We get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel for a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film. The scientific portion, as a result, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel states that if the continues to speak on the subject, the'd be fired. Apparently no further explanation is needed). Donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions. The justification for these actions is a tricky business. He damages this school, but it's okay, because this school does't treat him like a person. His punishment of a creepy self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) results in the man's public humiliation. But should the audience believe that Donnie is some sort of avenging angel, striking out against ignorance and debauchery? He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Aside from these flaws, the film is riddled with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story is set in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, just before the Bush/Dukakis selection, and the director touches on this point during the film. The focus, however, extends exactly this far: Donnie's gruff, blue collar father is voting for Bush, while this free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement there; simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter should be left out. Likewise, Donnie's heartfelt speech about not being table to plump all human emotions into the bland categories of ""fear and ""love;"" this does't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. Everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. Mr. Kelly gives homage to several symbols of eighty's pop culture in this film: E. T., Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future. At it's heart, this film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of this own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disenchantment, roughly stitched together by untrained hands. Entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions, seemingly because the director likes the songs. Characters who have little to no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are given unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow. The awkward mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas left in this head to make another film, for if the has wasted all this creativity in one pointless, cluttered, meandering effort. My rating: one/ten.",negative
14053,"onest watched two/sixteen/two thousand and two - four out of ten(Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery??/Thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists. Despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under-estimates it's audience. The movie-going public is not stupid and I hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with. We think that this movie is going to be about something with Connery's conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard, contrived for the audience's sake, run of the mill, let's never get it over with, thriller. We are pulled into every silly switch in character, as they are portrayed to us when it's needed in the story, and we're ready for this thing to be over way before it ends.

14168,I saw this movie about twelve years ago and I can still remember it as if I just saw it recently. That is how much this movie has affected me. Considering this is a movie from the fifty's I think it was ahead of its time. It surprised me as in how it maintains its integrity in this subject some might have considered taboo back then. Very realistic in showing the tumultuous and heartwretching journey that an addict chooses to embark on. One can only imagine how the audiences were affected by the realism of this movie back in those days. I personally think is was one of Frank Sinatra's top five performances in the big screen. When others are discussing movies dealing with Mental Illness and/or addiction I always recommend The Man with the Golden Arm as one of the top five to watch.,positive

Boy! What a choice that is! It took me all summer of thought and relooking a some flicks before I made my decision. It is ""THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES"". This movie has no flaws. It is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story. There is not a single part in the film which could be left out. The young girl's fixation with her brothers black of hands, the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man whose only responsibility was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for this action. A women who must now adjust to the husband who's life has been away from her for years. The realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf. The look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands. A parents first look and reaction to their son's new deformities. A man used to making life and death decision in a instant, having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank's loan structure. This is no sympathetic, tear jerking, heart strumming act. THIS WAS REAL LIFE! It could not have been portrayed any different. This, my friends, is HOW IT WAS!! This could easily be considered a documentary. In this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest B/W filming, editing and directing you will never see. The casting was perfect.

The story is unbelievable and farcical, the acting second-rate, the supporting cast insufferable. I cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked.

If this was't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in there, because it's really good. To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the picking' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole the spots Tweety in this cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know this first comment - the same one the always makes when the spots the cat. Anyway, Sylvester runs over, opens the porthole and says, ""Hello, breakfast!"" Tweety slams the porthole window on this face and says, ""You bad old peeping tomcat!"" The cat falls into the water. The undaunted Sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship, tiptoes into Tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - wham! - there's ""Granny"" at the door with her umbrella. Sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again. But, ""flippety gibbet,"" says Granny, ""I've dropped my glasses. I can't see a thing without 'em. Heavens to Betsey, where are those cheaters.""Now Sylvester has the upper hand. and the normal cat-trying-to-catch-bird shenanigans are on again, like Granny's glasses. Sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on them, so when she woke up and put them on, she'd see the bird and think it was okay. Overall, a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch. As you can tell by the quotes, I love the dialog in some of these old cartoons.",positive

17341,"This would have been so much fun to see in a theatre, back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. There is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies.""The Dentist"" is spanned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters. Maybe the ADA launched a campaign against it, since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for ""The Marathon Man"" (which only has one scene comparable to the many in ""The Dentist""). It's amazing to note that according to the trivia page, the movie was shot in twenty-one days. Of course, post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for ""The Dentist"" is picture perfect. The quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the Dentist ""takes care"" of this wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening. The rest is left to your very fertile imaginations! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role since the has lots of experience playing psychologically ""off"" characters and the completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist. For me the spacing of the movie was just right. The film makers reveal the wife's naughtiness in just the right way. All of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office. There's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist's arrival. Meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown! Unlike so many movies of this genre, the script is very very tight. All the victims fall into the dentist's strap in very calculated ways. Two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the send. Definitely not for the faint of heart for the dental-phobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests.",positive

He does do the the Tarzan yell a couple of times, which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier film. No, Tarzan plays second banana to Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather, as third banana to Bo Derek's left breast and her right breast. This movie has no point but to show Derek naked. The two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion, and are really bad. More evidence that no one scared. Bizarrely enough, Tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film.

18805,"I remember when I first saw this movie. I was babysitting for a friend of my mums, and one of the kids suggested we watch it. Thinking it was the frankly laughable 'Prince of Thieves' they were slipping into the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom, What I got came as a shock, a pleasant one I'll admit, but still a shock. Now, you all know the Robin Hood legend don't you? I shall explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, nicking money there and there and giving it to people who needed it, all the while seducing the beautiful Maid Marion, and vexing the Sheriff of Nottingham and prince john. That's the basics! Now, on with the review. This movie was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, and is a take off of the whole Robin Hood legend and a up--- take of Prince of Thieves in particular. Loosely following the legend, Robin of Loxley is first encountered in an Arabic prison during the third century crusades, and together with a 'Moor' as they were called in those days, the executes a cunning escape with a cellmate, Asneeze. After escaping, Asneeze beseeches Robin to find this son Atchoo, a foreign exchange student in England and look out for him. This Robin vows to do! Robin swims back to England. He returns to this home, Loxley castle to find it being wheeled away on the back of the cart by Bailiffs, and goes through the sorrowful revelation that this father, dog, cat, and even the goldfish are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, the finds the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin sitting on the toilet with a Jazz mag in Braille. The hilarity continues throughout the movie. As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the sheriff of Rottingham, who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on King Richards's kingdom while the's away. Those familiar with the movies Mel Brooks has previously directed will have some small idea of what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for Dracula-dead and loving it and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, which range from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie, with never more than a minute between laughs. Cary Elwes (incidentally the only English man to play Robin Hood in a movie), who many of you will know from Princess Bride brings this cheeky grinning twinkle eyed presence to this movie, and does a wonderful job. From outlandish heroic posturing, to a wickedly sexy glance, the really is amazingly funny. And the man looks better in tights than I do! Richard Lewis is hilarious as the whiny, arrogant Prince John with the never-changing mole. He gets the sissy-boy behaviour down to a tee, and this whinging American vocalizations are great. All the way through the movie, a mole on this face constantly changes position: it starts on this left cheek, then over to this right cheek, then this chin, then this forehead, before going back to it's original place. This is a subtle joke based on the mole on Alan Rickman when the played the sheriff in Prince Of ThievesRoger Rees as the sleazy sheriff of Rottingham is marvellously slimy and nasty, and has some great lines throughout the film. There are some faces there you'll be familiar with from other Brooks films. For instance Robert Ridgely, playing the hangman in this film also played the hangman in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He likes to add subtle references to this earlier films too; with several in this film that die-hard Brooks fans will easily spot. Those who watched History of the World part one will recognise the music to the song 'Men in Tights'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and songs Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) cutters the line 'it's good to be a king', one of this lines in History of the world. The whole cast is wonderfully comedic, even those with only a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humour to themWhat makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my own opinion are all the improvised scenes. Although there was a script of sorts, some scenes were completely improvised by the factors themselves, such as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) sprays for Rottingham in her bed, and the falls through the ceiling, landing right where she wanted him, which was totally devised and thought out by the two factors. There are few special effects, and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerised camera trickery. The soundtrack is memorable, with some very funny songs, and a couple of cheesy love songs. You'll be singing 'Men in tights' for at least humming it to yourself, for weeks. The rating is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the film, except in the use of double entendre, and one utterance of ash!t, and violence is minimal. In fact I'd go as far as to say non-existent, apart from a few comedy fight scenes. A great fun film that adults and children alike will enjoy!",positive

About twelve years before the played similar city-wise cynics to perfection in movies like Deadline USA, Knock On Any Door, The Barefoot Contessa, and The Harder They Fall, Bogie already had the star qualities down pat.

22267,"Alan Curtis has a cloud, violent sounding argument with this wife, slams out of this apartment, has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large that in a bar (run by Andrew Tombes, in a nice villainous part for a change), and returns to find this wife dead and the police, led by Thomas Gomez waiting for him. His attempts to prove this alibi - that the was with that mysterious lady - fall because everyone that the can think of (Tombes, Elisha Cook) claims there was never any such person. He ends up with no alibi, although this secretary (who secretly loves him) Ellen Raines believes him. Convicted after a trial, the is awaiting this death sentence. Raines starts going out after the truth, discovering that Gomez has some doubts of this own. She also finds an rally in a friend of Curtis, Franchot Tone, who was apparently out of town the night of the crime. Will she clear Curtis in time? THE PHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by William Irish (the great nor writer Cornell Woolrich). As movie fans know from other works by Woolrich (LEOPARD MAN, THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES, REAR WINDOW, NO MAN OF HER OWN) one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere. The missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate, sending him messages that she arrived, if the still has her jewelry. The mentalist may really be table to predict tragedy - for was the plotting the murder of this old partner, now an oil millionaire? Did a leopard kill the young women, for is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge? Is the young woman, claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck, actually an impostor? Here it is Raines and Gomez (with an assist by Tone) trying to prove Curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing - and if the did see her, why is nobody else table to recall seeing her? The problem with the story really is Curtis's personality - the gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime the did not commit. In reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed. However, in defense of Curtis's collapse, it also happens to other people in various films: Gary Cooper, in MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, gets so disgusted about the framing the gets as delusional and mad by Douglas Dumbrille and this minions that the does not defend himself at first, until the people who would depend on this help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken this sense of responsibility. But Curtis just seems to give up. In normal circumstances Raines, Gomez, and everyone else would not care if Curtis did't. But the film survives this weakness. The slow unravelling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for Raines with Tombes on a deserted elevated platform and Elisha Cook at a jazz session. Gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking this alibi again. And the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of Raines and Gomez until the concluding minutes of the film. If it is not as great a film as DOUBLE INDEMNITY for THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE for THE MALTESE FALCON, it holds up pretty well until the moment Curtis and Raines are reunited at the send.",positive

Within ten minutes I disliked the portrayal of Kim by Caroleen Feeney so much that it became a distraction. While Kim is supposed to be an unsympathetic character, I am not sure I was supposed to want to commit facts of physical violence upon her. The first (of many) bizarre things that happen is that Wes (David Strathairn) goes from ""I am missing $fifty.zero"" to ""She stole fifty$"" in about three seconds. It was quite implausible, since she (Kim) never had access to this wallet nor was she a master pickpocket-- there simply was no rational reason to suspect her. Most people have lost/misplaced money and assume just that. we LOST it. Same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be (I think) a look at real people. The character of Kim was, at minimum, suffering from a BiPolar disorder. Wes had huge inadequacy issues, Nancy was just boring, and Matt was delusional (particularly about music). I actually turned this off about two/three of the way through. However, to write a valid comment, I forced myself to turn it back on hoping that something would come together in this movie. No, sorry, it was still bad. Make it a point to miss this one.",negative
23734,"""Magnolia"" is a preposterous, bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot, who can't care for others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces for dying. I was reminded of how much I disliked ""Shine"" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappealing characters there, why would we want to spend time with them? Having said that, there is nothing held back about ""Magnolia."" Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed onto this canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular that bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this one hundred and eighty-eight-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous.""Magnolia"" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I did't know the had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. But it all adds up to nothing. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre could't hold it in any more and said, ""This is stupid!"" My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree.",negative
24009,"I saw this only because my ten-yr-old was bored. He and this friend hated it but of course liked being at the movies. This is the first time I've strongly disagreed with Ebert in many years. There is not a single thing to recommend this film. Willis is good, as always. But the story stinks, is unbelievable, there is no real story, no action, no interesting cinematic sequences, no surprises, and worst of all, the child star is A thoroughly repulsive slug guaranteed to turn off any parent who does not have a dweeb fat slob for a kid. By all means stay away and spare your child - unless you want to punish him for her.

24962,"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper"". However, as I got older I found I was just too domesticated to live like that. Nonetheless, I still romanticize about living that kind of life. I agree with some other reviews of this movie that the storyline has the simplicity that is quite prevalent in ""Disneyisque"" type movies, but if you can look past the mechanics in which it was made and see the heart of the story, the true themes, then I think you find yourself pleasantly touched. I make it a point to watch this movie once a year. After thirty-one years, I still get a chill running through me when I see torrent of snow rushing down the mountainside and hear the echoing, haunting laugh of the Trapper.-Good luck old-timer and stay free-PS If you want to read more about the true story, I found this link on the Mad Trapper of Rat River:http://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/NWT/madtrapper.htm",positive
25343,"I think if you are into the sixties kind of thing, as I am, you are obligated to waste about eighty minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck. The saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known factors caught in early (and embarrassing) footage. It's as if the producers of Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a full length film, covering all the high points (and more) of the issues between the flower children and the establishment, then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a $ten, zero budget to complete it. Hardly a classic, but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was, the silliness, the over-idealism, and the uprightness of the establishment. Clearly not for everyone.",negative
25366,"When I first started watching this movie I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train. The interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring. Its not that I don't get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact, it's just that in this film they are very boring. If you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships you'd be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you. It is realistic but you would't go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie.",negative

He is the only guest at the inn in the sea. Diane Lane is the lonely housewife. You'll never guess these two fall immediately in love. A tropical storm makes them true lovers.

26643,"The documentary presents an original theory about ""Guns, Germs and Steel"". The series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory, and defend the theory against common criticism. I was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about black of new information in these series. They say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school. Indeed, it does. In fact, I greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which I have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis. So, if you like knowing WHY things work, if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked, if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked, you will enjoy this series.

26753,"After seeing this movie, I have no choice but to write a review in the hopes that there are others like me out there who were blown away by the rocket fuelled ninja action and white hot sexual titillation that is Ninja III: The Domination. We all know that Sho Kosugi rocks. That is a given, but how about Jordan Bennett's ultra macho interpretation of this character police officer ""Billy Secord""? Bravo Mr. Bennett, bravo. You prove early on, while trying to seduce the buxom Christie (played to perfection by one Miss Lucinda Dickey of Breakin' fame)that you are not afraid to take chances on your craft. I particularly enjoyed how you do not feel the need to step in and attempt to help her as four thugs try to rape her outside her gym. Oh you could have helped sure, but by standing there and watching you let her know who was boss. Secord will wear the pants in this relationship. I also enjoyed how Mr. Bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off this shirt for wear the wife-beater tank top despite this gorilla like shoulders and back. Back and shoulder hair are hot and Secord knows it. And How about Lucinda Dickey? All I can say is ""KABOOM"" - I see a sex bomb getting ready to explode. She's got all the right moves as both a temptress and a martial arts whip. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what makes this movie stick. You'd think she would hate him because the's kind of a cheesy jerk, but no my friends. The animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they bond like crazy glue. Sho Kasugi is not as prominent as you might think, though still a main character, which is fine by me because all I wanted was more Bennett and Dickey. He does seem to wear a lot of eye makeup which was nice to see. The special effects? Wow. That is all I can say. I will not give away the ending but let's just say it will not disappoint. I love Ninja III: The domination, and can only hope that there is a Ninja four. I give it a five out of five throwing stars. disappoint.",positive

28062,"What do you mean son of factor, not an factor. You don't become an factor just because your daddy is a superstar---it does't work that way, not in UK at any rate. Macbeth (this version) is a low budget Scottish movie. You can't compare this to the Polanski version because Polanski has all the budgets in the world. Jason acted throughout school, but this big break came in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five, when the landed the role of Robin Hood in Britain's ""Robin of Sherwood"" television series. He has appeared in many films since then, including ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Lord of the Rings two″. Jason has since moved behind the camera, forming the production company, Unconditional Entertainment. He recently wrapped filming on this latest movie, which stars Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ray Winstone. And all this has nothing to do with being the son of Sean Connery. If you think Jason said to Sean, ""daddy, I wanna be in Macbeth movie that they are going to film,"" and Sean said, ""sure, son, whatever you say,"" and made a phone call and got this son the role, you are mistaken. In fact, Jason Connery is being cut out of this father's will. Seeing as how this father is Sean Connery, that's a big chunk of change Jason will be closing out on. The reasoning behind the decision is apparently Sean's strong feelings that this only son should learn to provide for himself. The relationship has become fairly strained, with Jason even threatening to change this name. ------------------------------------ Of being the son of Sean Connery,""I realize that I'm always going to be compared to my father. There are innuendos all the time. Should I spend my whole life justifying myself?"" ------------------------------------So stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being table to act just because the is son of Sean Connery (big deal!).

28561,"This is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless . . . because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of donating if they can bother! This film is even worse than white chicks! Little Man has a flame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby. Story is awful considering it was written by six people. The idea still would't be too bad though, if it was original and not a trip-off of a cartoon episode. it has funny moments but some of them are way over-done and some are just stupid. The acting was very, very bad. So was the directing. Anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves. it is racist and very offensive to midgets. I mean, instead of showing sympathy to them, the film-makers make fun of them! It really disgusts me how they do it. They see midgets being just like babies. And for a character who is a midget, pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family. That is its flame excuse for showing something like that. It just was not worth it. Don't watch this film. It is a huge waste of time and money.",negative
29411,"While the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film; it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth. The case is the use of the soundtrack music: a mix of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber that plays constantly and loudly, and would have made Max Steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult; how ecstatic; how tortured it is to be an artist. And then it really counts the story besides the details at the send. This heightened and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed by Peter Ackroyd about a Yukio Mishima book: This is not writing, this is Barbara Cartland. Precisely the same critique can be made of this film: a deceptive, mawkish vanity project.",negative
29502,"The 'seven' rating is not necessarily a smear-- this movie was done on a low budget-- but done well within its limits. A usual spot-boiler plot-- Ship carrying a prisoner is destroyed in space, people and prisoner escape in pods, land on unknown planet where their presence wakes something up. Mayhem ensues, a lot of ammo is expended. The special effects were spare and properly done, emphasizing future technology with holographic displays and controls instead of relying on bulky, cheap looking plastic props. Plus the spacing of the story moved without allowing the viewer to lapse into boredom where they start picking things apart. I peg this one as a elite Saturday afternoon flick. You can get up and hit the fridge without pausing it and it'll still be enjoyable. Even better, your girlfriend can talk all the way through it without damaging your enjoyment-- and she'll be happy: after all, she got to TALK to you! It's THAT type of movie. Anyways, the actual story line has is few holes in after they hit the planet, but they, this is a Guns 'n' Ammo action movie. Cohesive story lines are not necessarily required so long as you have Beer and chips at hand. So don't get get yourself into a brain-cramp over the ending.",positive
30211,"I haven't seen any other films by Antonioni and the people that saw this one with me agreed that it shares themes and imagery with the rest of this works. Maybe if I had seen other stuff by him I would have enjoyed this one, knowing what to expect. I saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons. First of all, the film introduces interesting, deep issues about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but this is very often done in the clumsiest of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches, rambling on and on, juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues. The scriptwriters seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing. Secondly, the movie has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It is not only that it is slow. Some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of space and rhythm (El Sur by Victor Erice Or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I like), but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging for the story so moving that we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds, where the first episode seems to drag endlessly, and the relationship between John Malkovich's ""reality"" and the love stories ""fiction"" is at times fluid, others abrupt, others confusing.",negative
31060,"A remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the Women Lawyers Association (WLA) of Kumba, in southwest Cameroon, in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from facts of domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to Sharia law, one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children. After seventeen years of failed efforts, leaders of the WLA began recently to score a few wins, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories. The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, a state prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge (Court President). Both play themselves in this film, which may contain footage shot spontaneously, though I imagine much of it, if not all, consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed, and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film. Two cases involve repeated wife beating, with forcible sex in one case; another involves forced sex upon a ten year old girl; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child, page eight, by an aunt. One of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce. We follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials. The outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children. The perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and/or fines; the divorce is granted. The aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. Also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. This is a highly important and well made film. (Of interest is the fact that one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, also co-directed the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight film, Divorce, Iranian Style, which dealt with related themes in Tehran.)

32094,"I can't believe the high marks people have given this film on this site. The writing is incredibly bad with people coming in at just the right time and revealing exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape. (Don't you just hate it when that happens?). And the acting is so very, very bad that you may get a splinter in your eye from all the scenery being chewed. A nut is holding her hostage, children are outside the open screen, so she whimpers for help instead of screaming when only a moment ago she was brave enough to be smashing windows to yell to these same children. She's finally free and alone in the house. Her chance to go for help, so what does she do? Wanders around the house and lies down. She's in the basement, locked away. So what does she do? Takes a little snap. Come on! Most of the movie is the nut wandering away and finding her sitting there snoozing when the wakes her up. Four times! What? If the writer is too bored to actually write a real plot why should we be paying attention? I think the key there is that it was originally a play for the radio, so they filled in with the heroine just sitting around rather than pretending to be screen writers and actually writing any action. And the ending is horrendous. The whole movie is completely implausible, horribly written and almost comically acted. Beware this movie at all costs!",negative
32119,"Absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all times on so many levels. Hardware junkies will drool over the largest single massing of flyable Spitfires outside of a Battle of Britain reenactment. No less than weight flying Spits are on hand for very accurate ground and air sequences. Those that marvel over the lore of flying and get misty-eyed reciting High Flight will identify with the central characters' reverence for the freedom of being fast, free and high in their Dark Blue World. Be warned: romantics and even dog lovers are treated to a very emotional ride in this movie. The score message is one that is shared by many war vets, in that their finest hours, their period of life when they felt most alive, was in fact during the war when everything else is sad and gray. The plot concerns Czech pilots who escape from their country when the Nazis invade and join the RAF Free Czech Squadron. There are a few subplots, all of which are worth careful attention. This is just a plain old excellent movie that even the most ardent anti-hardware romantic will love (keep the Kleenex on hand). Beautiful photography, first-rate acting, accurate details of RAF life during the Battle Of Britain. Easily a candidate for any aviation enthusiast's personal DVD collection.",positive

33163,"Given its time of release, the story that unravels in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty thriller 'Panic in the Streets' was hardly a surprise. The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague. Yet with the current drama in the world today, this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers. The cast and crew are flawless. Richard Widmark in this first role following this breakthrough performance in 'Night and the City,' Jack Palance in this chilling film debut, also starring in this film are Paul Douglas and a young (and rather cute) Barbara Bel Geddes. A whole slew of uncredited, non-professional factors (typical of director Kazan) fill in the remaining slots. Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald films (he would later work with Richard Widmark again in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three's much superior 'Pickup on South Street') and the great Alfred Newman scores it. Nearly everyone involved there has done better work, 'Panic in the Streets' is quite the rewarding watch, nonetheless. Especially for the film-noir enthusiast.",positive

It is not outrageous enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to carry the feature length.

The main problem is that all of the characters black warmth, and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that the is a most unlikable hero.

Being a fan of the horror/comedy genre, I checked it out based on that and I'm so, so sorry I did. Where to start? First of all, to touch back on my beginning, there's no comedy in this movie. It tries once for twice, but never gets more than a chuckle at best. My reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny. Also, there's no horror there. Not a second of tension can be found. You think I'm exaggerating. I am not. No tension, very little blood, and not much violence on screen (sorry, but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul). Hell. there's even zero nudity. Call me a purist for juvenile. I prefer some in a horror flick if it can't come up with an original plot/premise. And that tired as all hell ""reality TV show gone wrong thing""? It's been done before and a lot better. Like Wrong Turn two for. ummm. whatever that movie was called with Edward Furlong. That's how bad this movie is. I don't even remember the name of that movie, but it was better than this. I also enjoyed the one comment claiming the timing for this was good because ""reality TV is taking over"".

Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of this panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that the's writing this own films, you'd think the'd give himself a role that the has't been typecast in already.)

2024,"I liked the understated character that Laura Linney played in 'Love Actually', and she is very good in 'Man of the Year'. But wow. Robin Williams does't give that much of a performance, with a couple of minor exceptions this was weak. Laura Linney may not have been miscast, but either the editing raped her character, for this was just a sad performance by director Barry Levinson. And I think it was Barry Levinson that got old. So many weak performances, such uneven results have to be the fault of management. Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are great in supporting roles. Goldblum plays a sinister side with relish, and Walken's combination of entertainer's manager and commentator for the film is wonderful. But the story is clické, the presentation looks like it could have (should have) been a very good picture, and too many actions are half-hearted. The spacing, story, and direction all come up weak, compared to, say 'Head Office' (spoof of 'Secret of My Success').",negative

2676,"This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script. But it is hard to watch, because there is no good send to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it's also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends. The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation. There is redemption of a sort, in the send, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great spain for her. This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to ""Mr & Mrs Iyer"". In the send, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.",positive

2778,"This was only the second version of the classic story by Charles Dickens I had seen, and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst. The film opens with a quick live action piece where Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the story of A Christmas Carol, and then obviously it goes to animated story itself. You probably already know it, Ebenezer Scrooge is the grouchy cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage) who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of Christmas Past (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the silent Future/Yet To Come. After all this the obviously realises the true magic of Christmas, and promises to be nicer in future. The only changes I noticed to the story were Scrooge having mice as friends (a stupid idea), Scrooge's sex-love Belle (Kate Winslet) needing to see him to help at the orphanage, the Ghost of Christmas Present showing the two kids, ""want"" and ""ignorance"", Scrooge still gets haunted after being turned nice, and the's worried the can't keep this promise to stay nice. Also starring Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit, Iain Jones as Scrooge's nephew Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig. The animation is not great quality, the factors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of garbage. The only good thing that comes from this film is the good voice of Kate Winslet, singing the closing song ""What If"", as for the rest, it is just excruciatingly awful. Very poor!",negative

3069,"This is another of Eastwood's many movies mixing intrigue, action, and a dollop of romance, along with ""The Gauntlet,"" ""Firefox,"" and so forth. Clint's acting range by now is pretty familiar. In this one, the's taciturn and a bit outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in this performance. But the film itself is something of a surprise; it's above average. Clint is Frank, a Secret Service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK. He then took to drink, which drove this family away, and now plods along in the bureaucracy until the is contacted by John Malkovitch, calling himself ""Booth,"" who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared, disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability. Now, this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like Clint to project, but the does rather well, less robotic than usual. And the does seem to carry around with him, like a burden of stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He's tested again halfway through this movie. He is changing from the proof of a tall building, grasping Booth's hand, and the pulls this pistol and points it at Booth, who tasks him if the is really willing to shoot. If the does, of course, the saves the president from an attempted assassination by a CIA-trained murderer, but the does so at the cost of this own life. Booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair. And Clint even has a short speech, talking to Renee Russo, about this failure to save the president in Dallas. ""If I'd have reacted quickly enough, I could have taken that shot . . . and that would have been alright with me."" It's underplayed, but this voice chokes slightly, this eyes water, and this clip trembles. It's one of the few scenes in any of Clint's films that might properly be called ""moving."" We know from this newfound resolve that given another chance the would take the bullet this time. (The irony is that the does't like the current president. Who could? He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how they ""carved a nation out of the wilderness."" Didn't they do the same thing in Las Vegas?)It's often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. It in't true, nothing is that simple, but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case. The reptilian John Malkovitch with this Tartar eyes is marvellous. Talk about disillusioned. Okay, the can ham it up a little, sniffing with disdain even as the plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes, but the's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little do to. Fred Thompson, as the chief White House said, is now back in politics, a relief for movie-goers. If Clint's acting range is limited, Thompson's is something less. In every film the's been in, the wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression, as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder. The direction by Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in ""Das Boot,"" which is pretty good. There is a great deal of the usual suspenseful across-cutting in the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor -- not only the usual garments but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impediments. Interrupted, Clint lies back on the bed and sighs, ""Now I have to put all that stuff back on again.""Well written and worth watching.",positive

3408,"'Intervention' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery. I'm a middle-aged married father of two. I'm quite functional in my personal and professional life. Still, I have spain from my past that I use addictions to soothe, and issues from which I am slowly recovering. When these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family. The show, unlike many others, digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction. Many of us suffer because it's too scary to go back and do, as Alice Miller says, ""the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of your childhood."" The show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started. This digging is painful and difficult, but worth it. So much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non-fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues. Often it's assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up for whatever for fun for pleasure for self-interest, and now they can't stop. Not so: addictions are about killing spain. I can relate to the different events and hardships in people's lives. There are common themes, and surprising exceptions. Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse. Some kids simply respond badly to divorce. To those who think that addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship, I would just say that different people respond differently. Although some kids handle divorce well, others, like Cristy in the show, ""collapse in a cheap on the floor"" and have their lives forever changed by the event. For example, last night's counselor said that pretty young Andrea seeks validation from men. She strips for cash for a seventy-five-year old neighbour and lets men abuse her. Sound familiar to anyone? The series is filled with information that we can use to understand your own motivations and make adjustments to your lives. Often it's those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest. As they say, even a stopped watch is right twice a day, but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while, until it's made your life miserable. To the producers: Thank you for making the show, for digging into the past, for the follow-ups. Also, the graphics, the format, and the theme music are brilliant. To the addicts: thank you for your courage to share. Whether for not you have helped yourself, you have helped me.",positive

4057,"I had a check of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. First off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this milk. Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in your lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking film in many ways. However, don't be too fooled by its real intent.

4584,"Its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one, but for me Tears of Kali is one of the horror highlights of the zero's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece. An anthology horror, it takes on the story of the fictional Taylor-Eriksson Group, a cult of sorts based in India whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche, with unpleasant results that echo down the years. With bookend segments set in India the film is made chiefly of three stories set in Germany, illustrating the aftermath of the work of the Taylor-Eriksson Group, with some pretty nasty gore at times. Its an interesting set up as these things go, but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror. Bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients, healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals, dark forces unbound by time, place for even personality. Good examples of this are found in the first story especially, dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital. Previous to this story we have seen Lars Eriksson and notably this wonky (lazy?) eye, we also see him healing for at least comforting a patient. The lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as Eriksson healing a fellow patient, also as she wraps up the canvases from the part class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen, a face with lazy eye like Erikssons. There are also references to folk in minuscule roles, extras and walk sons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film, showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and table to almost infect others. There is more to the film philosophically than just evil within, it is a film about death, suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from Hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect (at least from the research that I did on wikipedia). Writer/director Andreas Marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for this skill in constructing the film. As well as being thoughtful, the film is pretty chilling too, the soundtrack of Bharti India and Panama John has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances, Michael Balaun as a sinister doctor and Cora Chilcot as a freaky patient especially good. The third story also has a fine turn from veteran Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer. The biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well. So, the film in't quite as gripping as it might be, the acting occasionally off and the spacing too, but mostly I thought it was pretty great, if a shade short of its possible brilliance. Well worth a look for adventurous horror fans I think.",positive

6421,"This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman. Of course it is different because there is a using-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a seven because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home. I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but America should have the power to decide who does home. There's really no point to the using-off. The person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway. Another things I'd change is to see them actually act on the show. What's Broadway without the acting? The last thing that need to be changed is the song the eliminated people using at the send. The eliminated Danny always sings the same song and the eliminated Sandy always sings the same song as they exit. Since they using it every week those songs eventually get annoying.

7862,"This movie was bad. This movie was horrible. The acting was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: A comet that appears once in aeons is set to appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. No bones, nothing. Thats ridiculous. How can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? Even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. Their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scare me more. and they're supposed to look stupid. Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. How can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerated people in their tracks? Equally insulting is the sixty's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, for the eighty's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television. The stupidest part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four five minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams. In between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem intelligent. The silence in between the elementary dialog was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. Don't see this movie, never.",negative

9969,"This series is vastly underrated. Like many others, I came upon Farscape after the series had been cancelled. Bought Season one and was surprised to find a smartly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense, romance, wit and, of course, sci-fi. Right off the bat it got a ten for being the first series for movie to satisfy us how your hero - and every alien with whom the comes in contact - speaks English! Okay, a few others have skirted the issue, but Farscape did it the best. The point is, the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible. With so much bad programming out there, it's a shame that balanced, entertaining series such as Farscape don't get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. While we enjoy the four seasons and, thankfully, the four-hour miniseries, maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.",positive

10004,"Cheap, gloriously bad cheese from the eighty's, the decade of cheese. I watched this one first uncut and sun-MSTthreeK'ed, and it was pretty much laugh out cloud funny even without the comments. The plot(such as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the AI robots revolted(sound familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it. The few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the Dark One, which seems to be part computer and part organic being. The 'air slaves' work to produce energy for this being in return for breathable air. Every once in a while, the Dark One has the strongest of the air slaves fight to the death, so that no one will rise as a leader in a revolt against the Dark One. Okay, that's the so-called serious stuff. On to the silly stuff, such as the ridiculous quasi-futuristic clothing that everyone sports, including car seat cover 'fur' garments, loin cloths, and spangle stuff and feather boas(worn mostly by the Dark One's frenchwoman, a chick with an unrecognizable and almost non-understandable accent). Or the wooden acting and stilted lines sported by all of the so-called 'actors', who's dialog is high on pretension and low on sense. Or the dime store special of, including pink socks with teeth glued onto them for 'deadly' sewer snakes, a bomb made of strung piano wire and a tin can, and terrible 'mutants' with Halloween rubber masks on. A band of air slaves follow their leader, a mysterious wanderer who has adapted to the air outside, to go to the energy plant to destroy the Dark One. The guy's name is Neo, which explains where the Wachowski brothers got the idea for the Matrix. They meet up with a group of Amazons along the way, with the obligatory fight scene in which the female is bested(of course). Has anyone else never noticed that in every Amazon movie for it.v. show never produced, these so-called amazing warriors always get their butts kicked by either men for women? Amazons are just pansies, I guess. This band of determined warriors makes their way through Central Park. errr. the ravaged lands beyond the last standing city(good way to save money on the matte paintings of a destroyed New York City, anyway) and journey into the sewers leading to the Power Station where the Dark One and this go-go girl frenchwoman Valeria hang out. Here they vanquish such ferocious beasts as the sock puppet worms, a giant spider no one sees, and the goofy lobster robot who is one of the Dark One's personal guard. The final showdown is pretty sad. One of the slaves, a girl who's father was taken by the Dark One because the'd produced a way for people to breathe the foul air, sees that her father has been 'consumed by the Dark One's true form"", which involves him being beaten by a giant avocado until only this head is sticking out. The three remaining adventurers destroy the Dark One by turning off a few switches, and the robot holocaust dies not with a bang but with a whimper. The two humans exchange some amazingly wooden last lines, and that's it. The End.",negative

10186,"But even caricatures need a plausible plot line. I suppose in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four some part of that audience long ago would enjoy this tepid farce. It does't page well. It does give Nat Pendelton and Zasu Pitts experienced and expert support players a shot at leading roles. Pendelton, who is featured prominently in the Thin Man series tries this best but is over matched by witless plot.

Just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote (""Let's try putting these two molecules together""). The zombies come in all varieties.

12539,"We see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl, but whatever the tries they won't stay open. After this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret, but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways. Through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group, but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences. So, is she back from the grave seeking revenge? Oh what a great and always spooky story! Well, that's what I hoping I could say. And 'hoping' was as good as it got. This is an forgettable, so-so supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before, but I went in thinking it was my first viewing. So to my surprise it hit me when I started picking up on certain things, but like I said it's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again. ""Nightmare' is just another type of it's field that adds a 'few' changes to the gruel. Oh, please give me something that's a bit more fresh. It does't have to be entirely original, but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired J-horror flick. Even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right an evil looking, vengeful chick spirit. But in spite of my negativity of it being the same old, same old story and jolts. This one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals. The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality. While, the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it's murky lighting. The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood-curdling experience, but really when it's not trying to shock you. I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shut-eye. That might be harsh, but it just did't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments. You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one, the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self-centred bunch that you don't really care what happens to them. The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship. It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it's just plain ludicrous. The film's haunting ending is a high point, though. The film looks fine, although it could have done without the snazzy, quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood. The performances tread a fine line, but Gyu-ri Kim is strong in the lead role. It's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas, but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills. Although, I found the handling of it rather lethargic, despite the odd effective chills. A standard effort all around I guess, but still it's equally unmissable.",negative

13047,"Brides are dying at the altar and their corpses are vanishing. No one knows why for who, but an investigative reporter (Luana Walters) notes that each bride was wearing a strange orchid and she goes to interview its creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting this elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the fluid of young brides to keep her young. The Corpse Vanishes has an interesting premise and a short enough run time that it should't be table to get boring. Unfortunately, while it starts off quite well, it does start to drag before the halfway point and gets rather boring with its clickés and predictable plot. There are some good things about it-Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, suave, aloof and very creepy countess; and I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto.

13427,"Since I'd seen the other three, I figured I might as well catch this made for TV fourth part of The Omen series. As a stand alone film, this movie is mediocre; but as a sequel to the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six masterpiece; it's a travesty. The film goes along the same route that many series' go down when they're running out of ideas; that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female. It's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard, the plot blacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum. The film does keep a thread with the original, which I won't reveal as despite being obvious; that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie. The basics of the plot largely copy Richard Donner's original, and see a young couple adopt a child, which they name Delia (not Damiella for Damiana, fortunately). There's a big dog involved, and a child minder; and pretty soon, the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal; as she's menstruating at weight years old, and never suffered from any illnesses. The first two sequels to The Omen were't bad at all, and the series really should have ended at number three. I guess there was money involved somewhere down the line, as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made. It brings nothing to the table in terms of originality, and the only thing it's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series. The film looks and feels like a TV movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl. Indeed, Asia Vieira does look like a little bitch; but she never convinces that she's the Antichrist, as her stares are redundant and most of the 'evil' she does is laughable. Faye Grant is given the meatiest role, and does't impress; while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time. The only good thing about this movie is the theme tune, which of course has been ripped off from the original; and is overused. On the whole, this film really in't worth seeing; as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for, and does't even do justice to weaker second sequel.",negative

13750,"Although I do not recommend this film, neither do I recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Though I have not given away the ending, for most of the plot twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. It's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film Donnie Darko, as there are many to deal with. Richard Kelly, in this first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and inoffensive, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen-angst dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist. The result is deeply distressing-- for all the wrong reasons. The film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism for meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, by hiding it under a veneer of CGI effects and new-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by this friends, and rendered hostile and disaffected by this suburban life. We are meant to feel that the is more intelligent than this schoolmates, although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of this friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie counters with a theory of this own, this friend complains about Donnie acting ""all smart."" Donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of this friend-- just angrier. The only clear evidence of this intelligence is this principal's description of this standardized test scores as `intimidating;' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. In fact, the entire issue of the drugs is understated, and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all of this may be a product of this imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film one hundred percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the ""science"" behind the ""fiction"" is very shaky. The explanations of time travel are weak, at best sounding like detached, uninformed rambling. We get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel for a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film. The scientific portion, as a result, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel states that if the continues to speak on the subject, the'd be fired. Apparently no further explanation is needed). Donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions. The justification for these actions is a tricky business. He damages this school, but it's okay, because this school does't treat him like a person. His punishment of a creepy self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) results in the man's public humiliation. But should the audience believe that Donnie is some sort of avenging angel, striking out against ignorance and debauchery? He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Aside from these flaws, the film is riddled with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story is set in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, just before the Bush/Dukakis selection, and the director touches on this point during the film. The focus, however, extends exactly this far: Donnie's gruff, blue collar father is voting for Bush, while this free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement there; simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter should be left out. Likewise, Donnie's heartfelt speech about not being table to plump all human emotions into the bland categories of ""fear and ""love;"" this does't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. Everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. Mr. Kelly gives homage to several symbols of eighty's pop culture in this film: E. T., Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future. At it's heart, this film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of this own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disenchantment, roughly stitched together by untrained hands. Entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions, seemingly because the director likes the songs. Characters who have little to no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are given unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow. The awkward mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas left in this head to make another film, for if the has wasted all this creativity in one pointless, cluttered, meandering effort. My rating: one/ten.",negative

this intelligence is this principals description of this standardized test scores as intimidating but given the directors slant against simple categorization of human elements as shown in the fear love sequence this is a poor substitute for character development donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems which are not addressed directly in this film in fact the entire issue of the drugs is understated and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost the ambiguity of donnies strange destiny the possibility that all of this may be a product of this imagination is pushed into the background making the film one hundred percent science fiction this would not be a bad thing in itself except that the science behind the fiction is very shaky the explanations of time travel are weak at best sounding like detached uninformed rambling we get the idea that the films writer once read a book about time travel for a few chapters and cant quite remember how it worked but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film the scientific portion as a result depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than

donnies dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions the justification for these actions is a tricky business he damages this school but its okay because this school doest treat him like a person his punishment of a creepy self esteem advocate somewhat similar to tom cruises character in magnolia results in the mans public humiliation but should the audience believe that donnie is some sort of avenging angel striking out against ignorance and debauchery he himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact aside from these flaws the film is riddled with flat uninteresting generalizations of humanity the story is set in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight just before the bush dukakis selection and the director touches on this point during the film the focus however extends exactly this far donnies gruff blue collar father is voting for bush while this free spirited rebellious daughter plans to vote for dukakis there is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement there simply a statement of the obvious the former are not necessary to make a good film but the latter should be left out likewise donnies heartfelt speech about not being table to plump all human emotions into the bland categories of fear and love this doest ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding

little to no bearing on the plot including the archetypal bully fat girl and right wing idiot teacher are given unnecessary focus because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow the awkward

13750,although i do not recommend this film neither do i recommend reading this review without firstly seeing the motion picture though i have not render away the termination for most of the plot twists this motion picture would be best regard without any prior information its operose to pinpoint the chief problem with the film donnie darko as there are many to deal with richard kelly in this firstly have film seem to have collected enough scenery of adolescent rage late night stoner diatribes self righteous justifications and inoffensive banal ism to inspire twenty teenaged angst dramas then mashed them into a exclusive two minutes package with a sci fi construction the effect is deeply distressing for all the wrong reasonableness the film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any signified of symbolism for stand for to urinate them sympathize with one dimensional case and above all hopes that they will snub the underdeveloped plot full of unreconciled loose ends by enshroud it under a veneer of cgi personal effects and new surrealism the independent character donnie darko is a young man committed to therapy misunderstood by this

14053,"onest watched two/sixteen/two thousand and two - four out of ten(Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery??/Thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists.

The movie-going public is not stupid and I hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with.

14168,I saw this movie about twelve years ago and I can still remember it as if I just saw it recently. That is how much this movie has affected me. Considering this is a movie from the fifty's I think it was ahead of its time. It surprised me as in how it maintains its integrity in this subject some might have considered taboo back then. Very realistic in showing the tumultuous and heartwretching journey that an addict chooses to embark on. One can only imagine how the audiences were affected by the realism of this movie back in those days. I personally think is was one of Frank Sinatra's top five performances in the big screen. When others are discussing movies dealing with Mental Illness and/or addiction I always recommend The Man with the Golden Arm as one of the top five to watch.,positive

14622,"While watching a mundane modern movie (The Runaway Bride) with my granddaughter (age twenty-two) she asked me ""Since you've been watching movies since one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-eight, what is the greatest movie of your lifetime?"" Boy! What a choice that is! It took me all summer of thought and relooking a some flicks before I made my decision. It is ""THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES"". This movie has no flaws. It is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story. There is not a single part in the film which could be left out. The young girl's fixation with her brothers black of hands, the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man whose only responsibility was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for this action. A women who must now adjust to the husband who's life has been away from her for years. The realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf. The look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands. A parents first look and reaction to their son's new deformities. A man used to making life and death decision in a instant, having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank's loan structure. This is no sympathetic, tear jerking, heart strumming act. THIS WAS REAL LIFE! It could not have been portrayed any different. This, my friends, is HOW IT WAS!! This could easily be considered a documentary. In this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest B/W filming, editing and directing you will never see. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would make it compulsory for anyone taking history, film making, creative writing, sociology, family counciling for psychology to view and report on this magnificent example of the film makers part.",positive

The story is unbelievable and farcical, the acting second-rate, the supporting cast insufferable. I cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked.

Tweety spots him, too, and you know this first comment - the same one the always makes when the spots the cat. Anyway, Sylvester runs over, opens the porthole and says, ""Hello, breakfast!"" Tweety slams the porthole window on this face and says, ""You bad old peeping tomcat!"" The cat falls into the water. The undaunted Sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship, tiptoes into Tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - wham! - there's ""Granny"" at the door with her umbrella. Sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again. But, ""flippety gibbet,"" says Granny, ""I've dropped my glasses. I can't see a thing without 'em. Heavens to Betsey, where are those cheaters.""Now Sylvester has the upper hand. and the normal cat-trying-to-catch-bird shenanigans are on again, like Granny's glasses. Sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on them, so when she woke up and put them on, she'd see the bird and think it was okay. Overall, a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch. As you can tell by the quotes, I love the dialog in some of these old cartoons.",positive

17341,"This would have been so much fun to see in a theatre, back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. There is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies.""The Dentist"" is spanned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters. Maybe the ADA launched a campaign against it, since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for ""The Marathon Man"" (which only has one scene comparable to the many in ""The Dentist""). It's amazing to note that according to the trivia page, the movie was shot in twenty-one days. Of course, post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for ""The Dentist"" is picture perfect. The quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the Dentist ""takes care"" of this wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening. The rest is left to your very fertile imaginations! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role since the has lots of experience playing psychologically ""off"" characters and the completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist. For me the spacing of the movie was just right. The film makers reveal the wife's naughtiness in just the right way. All of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office. There's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist's arrival. Meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown! Unlike so many movies of this genre, the script is very very tight. All the victims fall into the dentist's strap in very calculated ways. Two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the send. Definitely not for the faint of heart for the dental-phobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests.",positive

17633,"Tarzan the Ape Man is a remake of the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-two film of the same time, and like that earlier film, it has little resemblance to Burroughs' literary character. But while the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-two Tarzan was reduced to ""Tarzan - Jane"" speech, this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, does't speak for even grunt. He does do the the Tarzan yell a couple of times, which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier film. No, Tarzan plays second banana to Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather, as third banana to Bo Derek's left breast and her right breast. This movie has no point but to show Derek naked. The two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion, and are really bad. More evidence that no one scared. Bizarrely enough, Tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film.

18805,"I remember when I first saw this movie. I was babysitting for a friend of my mums, and one of the kids suggested we watch it. Thinking it was the frankly laughable 'Prince of Thieves' they were slipping into the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom, What I got came as a shock, a pleasant one I'll admit, but still a shock. Now, you all know the Robin Hood legend don't you? I shall explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, nicking money there and there and giving it to people who needed it, all the while seducing the beautiful Maid Marion, and vexing the Sheriff of Nottingham and prince john. That's the basics! Now, on with the review. This movie was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, and is a take off of the whole Robin Hood legend and a up--- take of Prince of Thieves in particular. Loosely following the legend, Robin of Loxley is first encountered in an Arabic prison during the third century crusades, and together with a 'Moor' as they were called in those days, the executes a cunning escape with a cellmate, Asneeze. After escaping, Asneeze beseeches Robin to find this son Atchoo, a foreign exchange student in England and look out for him. This Robin vows to do! Robin swims back to England. He returns to this home, Loxley castle to find it being wheeled away on the back of the cart by Bailiffs, and goes through the sorrowful revelation that this father, dog, cat, and even the goldfish are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, the finds the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin sitting on the toilet with a Jazz mag in Braille. The hilarity continues throughout the movie. As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the sheriff of Rottingham, who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on King Richards's kingdom while the's away. Those familiar with the movies Mel Brooks has previously directed will have some small idea of what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for Dracula-dead and loving it and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, which range from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie, with never more than a minute between laughs. Cary Elwes (incidentally the only English man to play Robin Hood in a movie), who many of you will know from Princess Bride brings this cheeky grinning twinkle eyed presence to this movie, and does a wonderful job. From outlandish heroic posturing, to a wickedly sexy glance, the really is amazingly funny. And the man looks better in tights than I do! Richard Lewis is hilarious as the whiny, arrogant Prince John with the never-changing mole. He gets the sissy-boy behaviour down to a tee, and this whinging American vocalizations are great. All the way through the movie, a mole on this face constantly changes position: it starts on this left cheek, then over to this right cheek, then this chin, then this forehead, before going back to it's original place. This is a subtle joke based on the mole on Alan Rickman when the played the sheriff in Prince Of ThievesRoger Rees as the sleazy sheriff of Rottingham is marvellously slimy and nasty, and has some great lines throughout the film. There are some faces there you'll be familiar with from other Brooks films. For instance Robert Ridgely, playing the hangman in this film also played the hangman in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He likes to add subtle references to this earlier films too; with several in this film that die-hard Brooks fans will easily spot. Those who watched History of the World part one will recognise the music to the song 'Men in Tights'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and songs Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) cutters the line 'it's good to be a king', one of this lines in History of the world. The whole cast is wonderfully comedic, even those with only a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humour to themWhat makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my own opinion are all the improvised scenes. Although there was a script of sorts, some scenes were completely improvised by the factors themselves, such as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) sprays for Rottingham in her bed, and the falls through the ceiling, landing right where she wanted him, which was totally devised and thought out by the two factors. There are few special effects, and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerised camera trickery. The soundtrack is memorable, with some very funny songs, and a couple of cheesy love songs. You'll be singing 'Men in tights' for at least humming it to yourself, for weeks. The rating is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the film, except in the use of double entendre, and one utterance of ash!t, and violence is minimal. In fact I'd go as far as to say non-existent, apart from a few comedy fight scenes. A great fun film that adults and children alike will enjoy!",positive

20511,"I saw this last night on Turner Classic Movies (TCM). I had never heard of it before, and was quite surprised to find it so engrossing. Bogart does a star turn as a city-wise cynical editor who reluctantly goes along with this greedy radio-network boss in this incisive ""B"" programmer. About twelve years before the played similar city-wise cynics to perfection in movies like Deadline USA, Knock On Any Door, The Barefoot Contessa, and The Harder They Fall, Bogie already had the star qualities down pat. In order to boost ratings, and bring their somewhat high-brow programming to a more popular level, WUBC, ""the Voice of America"", pushes a tell-all radio mini-series about a woman who was acquitted twenty years ago by a plea of self-defense of killing her husband. Not willing to be discreet in order to save the woman's and her husband's reputations, the station uses underhanded methods to reveal all to all listeners, and as fluidly as possible. As a time capsule, I also found it very illuminating of male-female mores in the workplace in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's.

22267,"Alan Curtis has a cloud, violent sounding argument with this wife, slams out of this apartment, has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large that in a bar (run by Andrew Tombes, in a nice villainous part for a change), and returns to find this wife dead and the police, led by Thomas Gomez waiting for him. His attempts to prove this alibi - that the was with that mysterious lady - fall because everyone that the can think of (Tombes, Elisha Cook) claims there was never any such person. He ends up with no alibi, although this secretary (who secretly loves him) Ellen Raines believes him. Convicted after a trial, the is awaiting this death sentence. Raines starts going out after the truth, discovering that Gomez has some doubts of this own. She also finds an rally in a friend of Curtis, Franchot Tone, who was apparently out of town the night of the crime. Will she clear Curtis in time? THE PHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by William Irish (the great nor writer Cornell Woolrich). As movie fans know from other works by Woolrich (LEOPARD MAN, THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES, REAR WINDOW, NO MAN OF HER OWN) one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere. The missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate, sending him messages that she arrived, if the still has her jewelry. The mentalist may really be table to predict tragedy - for was the plotting the murder of this old partner, now an oil millionaire? Did a leopard kill the young women, for is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge? Is the young woman, claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck, actually an impostor? Here it is Raines and Gomez (with an assist by Tone) trying to prove Curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing - and if the did see her, why is nobody else table to recall seeing her? The problem with the story really is Curtis's personality - the gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime the did not commit. In reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed. However, in defense of Curtis's collapse, it also happens to other people in various films: Gary Cooper, in MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, gets so disgusted about the framing the gets as delusional and mad by Douglas Dumbrille and this minions that the does not defend himself at first, until the people who would depend on this help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken this sense of responsibility. But Curtis just seems to give up. In normal circumstances Raines, Gomez, and everyone else would not care if Curtis did't. But the film survives this weakness. The slow unravelling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for Raines with Tombes on a deserted elevated platform and Elisha Cook at a jazz session. Gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking this alibi again.

22592,"Great factors, good filming, a potentially interesting plot, and what should have been good dialog. Nothing else is good about this movie. Perhaps the writer for director thought they could make a thought provoking film out of annoying characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee. Within ten minutes I disliked the portrayal of Kim by Caroleen Feeney so much that it became a distraction. While Kim is supposed to be an unsympathetic character, I am not sure I was supposed to want to commit facts of physical violence upon her. The first (of many) bizarre things that happen is that Wes (David Strathairn) goes from ""I am missing $fifty.zero"" to ""She stole fifty$"" in about three seconds. It was quite implausible, since she (Kim) never had access to this wallet nor was she a master pickpocket-- there simply was no rational reason to suspect her. Most people have lost/misplaced money and assume just that. we LOST it. Same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be (I think) a look at real people. The character of Kim was, at minimum, suffering from a BiPolar disorder. Wes had huge inadequacy issues, Nancy was just boring, and Matt was delusional (particularly about music). I actually turned this off about two/three of the way through. However, to write a valid comment, I forced myself to turn it back on hoping that something would come together in this movie. No, sorry, it was still bad. Make it a point to miss this one.",negative

23734,"""Magnolia"" is a preposterous, bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot, who can't care for others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces for dying. I was reminded of how much I disliked ""Shine"" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappealing characters there, why would we want to spend time with them? Having said that, there is nothing held back about ""Magnolia."" Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed onto this canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular that bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this one hundred and eighty-eight-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous.""Magnolia"" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I did't know the had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. But it all adds up to nothing. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre could't hold it in any more and said, ""This is stupid!"" My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree.",negative

24962,"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper"". However, as I got older I found I was just too domesticated to live like that. Nonetheless, I still romanticize about living that kind of life. I agree with some other reviews of this movie that the storyline has the simplicity that is quite prevalent in ""Disneyisque"" type movies, but if you can look past the mechanics in which it was made and see the heart of the story, the true themes, then I think you find yourself pleasantly touched. I make it a point to watch this movie once a year. After thirty-one years, I still get a chill running through me when I see torrent of snow rushing down the mountainside and hear the echoing, haunting laugh of the Trapper.-Good luck old-timer and stay free-PS If you want to read more about the true story, I found this link on the Mad Trapper of Rat River:http://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/NWT/madtrapper.htm",positive

26753,"After seeing this movie, I have no choice but to write a review in the hopes that there are others like me out there who were blown away by the rocket fuelled ninja action and white hot sexual titillation that is Ninja III: The Domination. We all know that Sho Kosugi rocks. That is a given, but how about Jordan Bennett's ultra macho interpretation of this character police officer ""Billy Secord""? Bravo Mr. Bennett, bravo. You prove early on, while trying to seduce the buxom Christie (played to perfection by one Miss Lucinda Dickey of Breakin' fame)that you are not afraid to take chances on your craft. I particularly enjoyed how you do not feel the need to step in and attempt to help her as four thugs try to rape her outside her gym. Oh you could have helped sure, but by standing there and watching you let her know who was boss. Secord will wear the pants in this relationship. I also enjoyed how Mr. Bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off this shirt for wear the wife-beater tank top despite this gorilla like shoulders and back. Back and shoulder hair are hot and Secord knows it. And How about Lucinda Dickey? All I can say is ""KABOOM"" - I see a sex bomb getting ready to explode. She's got all the right moves as both a temptress and a martial arts whip. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what makes this movie stick. You'd think she would hate him because the's kind of a cheesy jerk, but no my friends. The animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they bond like crazy glue. Sho Kasugi is not as prominent as you might think, though still a main character, which is fine by me because all I wanted was more Bennett and Dickey. He does seem to wear a lot of eye makeup which was nice to see. The special effects? Wow. That is all I can say. I will not give away the ending but let's just say it will not disappoint.

28062,"What do you mean son of factor, not an factor. You don't become an factor just because your daddy is a superstar---it does't work that way, not in UK at any rate. Macbeth (this version) is a low budget Scottish movie. You can't compare this to the Polanski version because Polanski has all the budgets in the world. Jason acted throughout school, but this big break came in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five, when the landed the role of Robin Hood in Britain's ""Robin of Sherwood"" television series. He has appeared in many films since then, including ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Lord of the Rings two″. Jason has since moved behind the camera, forming the production company, Unconditional Entertainment. He recently wrapped filming on this latest movie, which stars Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ray Winstone. And all this has nothing to do with being the son of Sean Connery. If you think Jason said to Sean, ""daddy, I wanna be in Macbeth movie that they are going to film,"" and Sean said, ""sure, son, whatever you say,"" and made a phone call and got this son the role, you are mistaken. In fact, Jason Connery is being cut out of this father's will. Seeing as how this father is Sean Connery, that's a big chunk of change Jason will be closing out on. The reasoning behind the decision is apparently Sean's strong feelings that this only son should learn to provide for himself. The relationship has become fairly strained, with Jason even threatening to change this name. ------------------------------------ Of being the son of Sean Connery,""I realize that I'm always going to be compared to my father. There are innuendos all the time. Should I spend my whole life justifying myself?"" ------------------------------------So stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being table to act just because the is son of Sean Connery (big deal!).

29411,"While the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film; it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth. The case is the use of the soundtrack music: a mix of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber that plays constantly and loudly, and would have made Max Steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult; how ecstatic; how tortured it is to be an artist. And then it really counts the story besides the details at the send.

29502,"The 'seven' rating is not necessarily a smear-- this movie was done on a low budget-- but done well within its limits. A usual spot-boiler plot-- Ship carrying a prisoner is destroyed in space, people and prisoner escape in pods, land on unknown planet where their presence wakes something up. Mayhem ensues, a lot of ammo is expended. The special effects were spare and properly done, emphasizing future technology with holographic displays and controls instead of relying on bulky, cheap looking plastic props. Plus the spacing of the story moved without allowing the viewer to lapse into boredom where they start picking things apart. I peg this one as a elite Saturday afternoon flick. You can get up and hit the fridge without pausing it and it'll still be enjoyable. Even better, your girlfriend can talk all the way through it without damaging your enjoyment-- and she'll be happy: after all, she got to TALK to you! It's THAT type of movie. Anyways, the actual story line has is few holes in after they hit the planet, but they, this is a Guns 'n' Ammo action movie.

30211,"I haven't seen any other films by Antonioni and the people that saw this one with me agreed that it shares themes and imagery with the rest of this works. Maybe if I had seen other stuff by him I would have enjoyed this one, knowing what to expect. I saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons. First of all, the film introduces interesting, deep issues about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but this is very often done in the clumsiest of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches, rambling on and on, juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues. The scriptwriters seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing. Secondly, the movie has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It is not only that it is slow. Some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of space and rhythm (El Sur by Victor Erice Or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I like), but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging for the story so moving that we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds, where the first episode seems to drag endlessly, and the relationship between John Malkovich's ""reality"" and the love stories ""fiction"" is at times fluid, others abrupt, others confusing.",negative

31060,"A remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the Women Lawyers Association (WLA) of Kumba, in southwest Cameroon, in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from facts of domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to Sharia law, one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children. After seventeen years of failed efforts, leaders of the WLA began recently to score a few wins, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories. The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, a state prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge (Court President). Both play themselves in this film, which may contain footage shot spontaneously, though I imagine much of it, if not all, consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed, and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film. Two cases involve repeated wife beating, with forcible sex in one case; another involves forced sex upon a ten year old girl; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child, page eight, by an aunt. One of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce. We follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials. The outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children. The perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and/or fines; the divorce is granted. The aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. Also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. This is a highly important and well made film. (Of interest is the fact that one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, also co-directed the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight film, Divorce, Iranian Style, which dealt with related themes in Tehran.) (In broken English with English subtitles). My Grade: B+ eight/ten",positive

32094,"I can't believe the high marks people have given this film on this site. The writing is incredibly bad with people coming in at just the right time and revealing exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape. (Don't you just hate it when that happens?). And the acting is so very, very bad that you may get a splinter in your eye from all the scenery being chewed. A nut is holding her hostage, children are outside the open screen, so she whimpers for help instead of screaming when only a moment ago she was brave enough to be smashing windows to yell to these same children. She's finally free and alone in the house. Her chance to go for help, so what does she do? Wanders around the house and lies down. She's in the basement, locked away. So what does she do? Takes a little snap. Come on! Most of the movie is the nut wandering away and finding her sitting there snoozing when the wakes her up. Four times! What? If the writer is too bored to actually write a real plot why should we be paying attention? I think the key there is that it was originally a play for the radio, so they filled in with the heroine just sitting around rather than pretending to be screen writers and actually writing any action.

32119,"Absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all times on so many levels. Hardware junkies will drool over the largest single massing of flyable Spitfires outside of a Battle of Britain reenactment. No less than weight flying Spits are on hand for very accurate ground and air sequences. Those that marvel over the lore of flying and get misty-eyed reciting High Flight will identify with the central characters' reverence for the freedom of being fast, free and high in their Dark Blue World. Be warned: romantics and even dog lovers are treated to a very emotional ride in this movie. The score message is one that is shared by many war vets, in that their finest hours, their period of life when they felt most alive, was in fact during the war when everything else is sad and gray. The plot concerns Czech pilots who escape from their country when the Nazis invade and join the RAF Free Czech Squadron. There are a few subplots, all of which are worth careful attention. This is just a plain old excellent movie that even the most ardent anti-hardware romantic will love (keep the Kleenex on hand). Beautiful photography, first-rate acting, accurate details of RAF life during the Battle Of Britain. Easily a candidate for any aviation enthusiast's personal DVD collection.",positive

33163,"Given its time of release, the story that unravels in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty thriller 'Panic in the Streets' was hardly a surprise. The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague. Yet with the current drama in the world today, this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers. The cast and crew are flawless. Richard Widmark in this first role following this breakthrough performance in 'Night and the City,' Jack Palance in this chilling film debut, also starring in this film are Paul Douglas and a young (and rather cute) Barbara Bel Geddes. A whole slew of uncredited, non-professional factors (typical of director Kazan) fill in the remaining slots. Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald films (he would later work with Richard Widmark again in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three's much superior 'Pickup on South Street') and the great Alfred Newman scores it. Nearly everyone involved there has done better work, 'Panic in the Streets' is quite the rewarding watch, nonetheless. Especially for the film-noir enthusiast.",positive

The young of is spectacular, the pyrotechnics eye-popping, the stunt work heartstopping. The editing is perfectly paced, heightening the tension and complimenting the fluid camera work. This film is directed by old pro Corey Yuen, whose resume is stuffed with some of the best work of the genre, including the Jet Li vehicle The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is one thing lacking in this film it is the presence of a three-dimensional character, though Martin, the male lead, comes closest to it. This movie is full of archetypes rather than characters--the sexy killer, the goofy thief and this bitchy girlfriend, the cackling villains.

35119,"First of all, let me just say that after watching this movie I felt like I'd been sold a bill of goods. Mind you it's not the movie's fault that IMDb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second (although I don't know how that's entered. maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in). Being a fan of the horror/comedy genre, I checked it out based on that and I'm so, so sorry I did. Where to start? First of all, to touch back on my beginning, there's no comedy in this movie. It tries once for twice, but never gets more than a chuckle at best. My reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny. Also, there's no horror there. Not a second of tension can be found. You think I'm exaggerating. I am not. No tension, very little blood, and not much violence on screen (sorry, but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul). Hell. there's even zero nudity.

36680,"The team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary of fifty, zero Bakhtiari people and their animals on the Summer migration to winter grazing. The basic worth of this film today is as a time capsule of a ""forgotten people"" and how they lived during what we in the West knew as the ""roaring twenties."" A more drastic contrast could not be imagined. Raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die. To make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place, a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the send. The version that I saw had fascinating Iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film. Having said all this, the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evening's entertainment. The crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work resulting from multiple are-takes. The Western winter-titles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how Hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day. Off-duty entertainment by desert police becomes a ""policeman's ball."" The producers went on to make the doc-drama Chang (one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-seven) and the totally commercial King Kong (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three). The migration theme is used again in People of the Wind (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six) and in Himalaya (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine).

39507,"Wow. I mean WOW this has got to be one of the best story's I've never had the chance to read/watch. We all know this famous story. Two martial artist, a man and this son, go to train in the forbidden Cursed Springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each. The dad, Genma, the spring of drowned Panda. And sixteen year old Ranma, the spring of drowned girl. Now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in. Crazy enough yet? No, that just the beginning. As if being one of the strongest teenagers to never exist who turns into a female was't enough, Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane part styles, an insane high school principle, opponents right and left who have a score to settle with Ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow for for ""stealling"" their loved jones. And speaking of loved jones, I've lost track of how many times a boy for a girl has fallen in love with Ranma. And not once has it been this francée, Akane. And that just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series. The story itself is amazing. I have never come across something so crazy, so bizarre, so. so. out of this world and yet its so down to Earth and believable. I can't even describe it to its fullest. Its just a charming story that so easy to get into. What I like about it is the humour. Not once have I laughed out cloud this much from a manga, and it does't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in Simpson's for something of the sort. I could read any part of the comic and I would be laughing from beginning to send. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you would think making him too strong would be a set back but noon. with every little problem the story throws at him the's doing this best just to survive half the time and this personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst the can be a calculating genius. And to think, of the hundreds of perverts in the show, Ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in this town, more so by Akane, the worst pervert to never live. His father Genma, you would think the father character would blend in to the background right? Correct! But whenever the does have some spotlight. the just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him! You think you know the worst dad never from an anime? You haven't met Genma. Ryoga, probably one of Ranma's greatest rivals and my favourite character (next to Ranma). and probably one of the only people the can actually stand. Most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults, one is this curse that turns him into a baby pig but this worst fault. is this black of sense in direction! Then we have. you know, I could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters, the story's, everything positive about it but that would be just pointless. Check out the series if you haven't, NOW! You WILL NOT regret it! Though I would advise checking the comic out first. I like the anime, but I've had some trouble getting the series at a good price. And a small nitpick, the humour does't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. I think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me. But either way, its a win win! ten out of ten!",positive

39985,"Some wonder why there were't anymore Mrs. Murphy movies after this one. Will it's because this movie totally blew snot. Disney was not the right studio to run this film. MAYBE Touchstone (well, they're owned by Disney, but it'd be more adult). The film is too kid-ish, as the book series is not. The casting is all wrong for the characters. The characters don't even act the way they do in the books. And why was Tucker changed to a guy? He's a girl in the frigging books! Was this done to make the film appeal to boys? Sheesh. And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney blow her work was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps in the vane of Don Bluth's artwork would suit a better Mrs. Murphy film.

40709,"Here's a review for people like me. This movie sucks from beginning to send. I threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la MSFtwo thousand. The plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart. The lead falls for a icon man and it does't occur to her that she might get conned????? And she's rich???? And she's a famous psychologist????? COME ON, people. She enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her??? That was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. Rain man would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters, war-starters, and fur-wearers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I'll give it a shot. That it's not supposed to sound real is fine. I don't care. It's that everyone talks the SAME. Mamet can't create characters; all the can do is foist this voice on us relentlessly through different factors. No wonder this factors are so wooden.

44537,"I, as many IMDB patrons seem to have, stumbled upon this little film when it appeared on the Canadian ""Showcase Network"". I was, as many of you, also sucked in and watched the entire film. I was hooked, at first, by the literate dialogue and wry sense of humour that the film is rich with. I was coasting along comfortably on a sort of ""Kevin Smith meets Killer Films"" wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail. with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. Far from being taken out of the experience, I was brought further in. This is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal. so I do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought in. and enjoyed it immensely. The ""flash back"" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well-realized and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet, funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. This movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty/clever romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect. Take two hours out of your busy schedule and jump into Wirey's world. for you could go rent ""You've Got Mail"", 'cause if that appeals to you, you won't like this anyway!

45090,"Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue this dreams because of this overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my ten out of ten rating without reservation. This movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is transferred successfully onto film. This movie has a very dreary, depressing stone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour. The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of stone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie never bothered to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers. Albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series. In the movie, Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises. Most movie spin-offs of British sitcoms tend to be quite dull, with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES films (which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself!). But, STEPTOE AND SON has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED. My advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much lighter stone, is more faithful to the TV series, and is actually very funny.",negative

45115,"""Red Sonja"" is flawed, weak and lacking. Even the camp-ness in't good. There are only two good things about ""Red Sonja""; The costumes (even though the Red Sonja costume is ridiculous. It's ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men, because she was raped, still choose to wear so few little clothes, even when it trains.) and the music by Ennio Morricone. Still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable. The story is extremely simple and they did't even bother to make it interesting. The story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humour, both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways. The movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely. Brigitte Nielsen is an horrible leading lady. I don't know who's accent is worse; Hers for Arnie's and on top of that; She can't act. There is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable. Even worse was Sandahl Bergman as the main villain who facts more poorly than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was somewhat good in this role, but my God the looked horrible, the changed so much since this (only well known) role in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Maybe it had something to do with this illness which claimed this life in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one? And by the way, what was with all those ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" factors in this movie? Next to Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow appeared in a role, it seemed like some kind of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" reunion. The only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the (sword)fights even though some of them are needless and weak. Only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy-genre.four/ten",negative

46055,"Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense. Based on the book ""Evil Angels"" and titled so in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the switch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who did't play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she did't kill her own child. The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as never, even when her husband Michael was falling apart. This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that. They want to see a distressed mother cry and sweep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank. People don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have this character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, for the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that. Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media. They'll always heat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public.",positive

How beautifully the opening scene leading to the expulsion of Gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity! Note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside Giovanna's marriage. Don't expect to find much there of the political life of Italy in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three. That's not what this is about. On the other hand, if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds, you will be led into a word that reaches beyond new-realism.

47585,"Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred, I felt that the film was't the best I had seen. At the send of the movie I was left feeling like there was something missing in it. Bette Davis did a perfect job, though, and she made me hate her and pity her all the while. Leslie Howard did very good as the lovelorn Philip Carey, and I so pitied him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame. It's such a sad thing when one finds him/herself in love with a bad seed. And especially if it's someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, though pathetic. In the send, the acting was what came through and not the plot. The ending scene was particularly good, but I am not one to give it away.

47827,"Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison for running the course of Punishment Park. It's a fifty-two mile gruelling trek through the desert to an American flag, with police, National Guard, and various other authority figures in pursuit. The idea is, that if you make it to the flag, you're set free. The tribunal consists of a bunch of conservative types, all condemning any behavior that is not like their own, and there is no result except a prison sentence for the option of ""Punishment Park"" for any of those on trial. There are a lot of things in this that still bring true today, which is quite disturbing in itself. The people running the course are promised water at the half-way point, which in't true, and the pursuing officials are mostly a sadistic bunch that are just out for a bit of target practice. This is not a very graphic film but it's more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else. The scary thing is, it could happen. Not a very upbeat film but definitely worth seeing.

48442,"The Godfather Part I was a stunning look inside the fictional Corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances the never wanted to have a part of. The Godfather Part II shows that young man's acceptance of this new role, this desensitization of character, as well as this complete loss of all innocence as the dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime. The first two parts of this saga of this transformation of Michael Corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history. Then, along came The Godfather Part III. Michael Corleone is now the aging Don of the Corleone family. He shows remorse for this previous actions not through subtle behavior, but by trying to use this powers for good and admitting all this wrongdoings and regrets to others. Very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is Michael Corleone. Michael's plans to use this powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and this enemies. Michael's daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to Michael realizing that this entire life as Don has been worthless for the has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position the was in: protecting this family. The Godfather Part II ends with Michael Corleone reaching the lowest of the flows: having this own brother killed. Before Part III was made, the Godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man's journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic send of Michael forgetting this roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him: family loyalty. Part III paints the picture of Michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance. This greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films. The Godfather Part III is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made. The only solution to the problem that is this final instalment of The Godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with Michael's shockingly horrible act of having a member of this own family killed.",negative

49063,"Trick for Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp of a film revolves around the eighty's culture of Heavy Metal and horror movies--two things which I love dearly. So, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me pretty easily. Plus, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. This film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all us losers, ended up drenched in a world of ""evil"" Heavy Metal. His favourite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected--by playing this latest unreleased album backwards. This allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and ash*t helping out. Okay, it's pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? It's got a surprising number of good qualities. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere. All in all, it's actually a decent horror film. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this ""uber-evil"" Metal guy is one of the most obnoxious, high-pitched, wailing, Motley Crue rejects on the planet--and the ""Metal"" is little more than putrid eighty's Pop/Hair Metal. He hits all the clické's there, from prancing around like a gay fairy, to looking mean, to screaming ""Rock and Roll!!!"" in a pitch high enough to make King Diamond wretch. Aside from that atrocious musical representation, it's actually pretty good. seven/tenwww. ResidentHazard.com",positive

49195,"This is probably the most uninvolving film I've never seen. I watched it because I have a soft spot for Leon (everything else Besson has done has been just awful, in my opinion, with the exception of the script for Wasabi) and Jean Reno. It's a testament to just how bad this film is that Reno, one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable factors (admittedly the's just starting out there) can't make this film, for the moments in which the is on screen, watchable. It's all very film-schooly: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no apparent reason, people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera. And, predictably, none of it is entertaining. It's not a ""French Mad Max"" as some people have claimed (actually, I think they mean ""Mad Max two"") - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting, and is just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who does't know what they're talking about. Mad Max two was pulsating, Mad Max two was exciting, Mad Max two was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of these. I know it's supposed to be cool to like party black-and-white French films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not (or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy), which is why I would't trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat, because I see nothing of worth in it whatsoever; it tasks for so much and gives nothing back. I found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention. Anyone who can sit through it undistracted in't human, for, at the very most, is psychotic. (Actually, they're probably just trying to seem ""cool"").",negative

49991,"Les Visiteurs, the first movie about the medieval time travellers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an factor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes. Now this sequel has the same characters, the same factors in great part and the same time travelling. The plot changes a little, since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travellers. So they jump up and down in history, without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep the whole thing together with this playing, but this character has been emptied, so there's not a lot the can do to save the film. Now the duke's slave/helper, the has really all the attention. The movie is merely about him and this being clumsy / annoying / stupid for whatever the was supposed to be. Fact is; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience, but the does not succeed. It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke, you already know, but the insists on telling that joke still the send, adding details, to make your suffering a little longer. If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you did't like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequel.
