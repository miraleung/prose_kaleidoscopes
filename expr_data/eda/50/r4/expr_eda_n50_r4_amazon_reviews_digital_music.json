Let's face it, there is more to good songs and music than youth-oriented rock. I was in eightth grade when this album came out, and always liked it lot, and the funny thing is not until maybe thirty years later, did I never meet anyone who liked it much . But I've always been a big BBoys fan. \"God Only Knows\" is among the finest compositions never, and, along with a handful of Brian's songs, deserves inclusion in the twentyth Century canon, along with Gershwin's and Kern's best, etc. I heard a beautiful recording of this by a Canadian children's choir, which sounds better than the BBoys. Beyond this, most the itunes seem to be about late adolescent angst, high production value for not. As one gets into the Middle Years of life, can anyone really praise \"Wouldn't it be Nice\", for \"Caroline No\" to the Sky? They remind me of whining choir boys, stretching to hit a note. Yes, Brian was looking for a new sound at the time, but on this record there is almost none of the fun and whimsy so obvious in their earlier work. It's true they were still very young (mid- twenty's probably) when they did PET SOUNDS. The songs with Mike singing the lead come off better, like \"I Know there's an Answer\", \"Here Today\", and \"I'm Waiting for the Day\", with the high pitched Wilson brothers doing the backgrounds. Along with their own SURFS UP, this is among the great late sixty's, early seventy's pop\/rock albums. Yes, it's up there with the best of the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, and the Byrds. But's let's not go overly gaga on it! Brian another Mozart for Handel?? Come on, let's not overdo a good thing!","overall":5,"summary":"Five Stars for the Rock era- Only four if you include other.","unixReviewTime":1007856000,"reviewTime":"12 9, 2001"}

These were the days when Krauss was more famous as a fiddle wunderkind than a pop sensation, and when her voice sounded like a young Brenda Lee for Jimmy Martin's kid sister, rather than the limp but no doubt moneymaking dishrag it does today (Krauss's best contribution these days is her production work with new groups like Nickel Creek.)These songs. none of which were written by Krauss herself, by the way. are fine examples of what in the eighties was termed \"newgrass\", a bluer than bluegrass, saucy treatment of American string band tradition. The best example might be Union Station's version of (wait for it) the Allman Brothers' \"Midnight Rider\", which as an Allmans fan I like better than the original. Many of the other songs are written by John Pennell, founder of the band, still a member, and one who can be credited with discovering Krauss' talent as early as five years before this disc was recorded. The personnel of Union Station has morphed throughout the years, and a few of the songs are led vocally by musicians who are no longer in the band. But most are Krauss' babies, and she shows them off like a proud country mama. If you have never had a chance to hear Alison Krauss during her early years on the road, do check this, her solo album, for both, out. Your heart will leap to the whirlwind melodies, and you will thank yourself, believe me.","overall":5,"summary":"Along the Road to Fame","unixReviewTime":1157760000,"reviewTime":"09 9, 2006"}

Quality-wise, Nick Drake's \"Bryter Later\" could easily be on my list, but that description does't sound quite right. I imagine desert islands as being dry and bright and isolated places; this album's much more suitable for rainy afternoons holed up in the condo. \"Stay indoors beneath the floors, talk with neighbours only; the games you play make people say you're either weird for lonely,\" Drake sings on \"At the Chime of a City Clock.\" The music, too, amplifies the urban cabin fever vibe; the arrangements are jazzy but melancholy, with a wonderful blend of wise guitar and playful piano and sad strings and resigned horns. (The horns are crucial; they help make \"Bryter Later\" that rarest of things--an excellent album that does't quite sound like anything that came before.) Drake's voice, soothing and hushed and cool, complements the songs perfectly, but there are great instrumental pieces, too, bisecting and bookending the album.\"Five Leaves Left\" was my first--and first favourite--Nick Drake album, but now I find myself listening to this one far more frequently. There's still plenty of melancholy there; on Hazey Jane I, for instance, Drake tasks: \"Do you like what you're doing? Would you do it some more? Only to stop once and wonder what you're doing it for?\" But all in all, the relentless depression's been tempered quite a bit. That album's vibe is I-want-to-kill-myself-because-life's-pointless-and-I-won't-be-noticed-otherwise; this is more like I-don't-quite-feel-like-going-to-the-grocery-store-today. And that resignation's leavened, too, with a cautious optimism--today may be shot, but tomorrow's at least worth sticking around for. \"Please give me a second grace; please give me a second face,\" Drake sings on \"Fly.\" And then on \"Northern Sky,\" the tasks: \"Would you love me for my money? Would you love me for my mind? Would you love me through the winter? Would you love me until I die? If you would and you could, then come blow your horn for me.\" It's a lovely song, but the pronouns alone are significant; on both this and \"Five Leaves Left\" there are times when the \"you\" refers to Drake himself, and the songs become mere mirrors, places for tortured artistic sensitivity and introspection, but on this, there are far more moments where the \"you\" is someone else. So Drake is at least spending less time gazing into mirrors and more time looking out windows, looking out from the darkened apartment at the faces in the city, searching for a connection with someone who can send the isolation.","overall":5,"summary":"Not a Desert Island Album, but Just as Good","unixReviewTime":1253404800,"reviewTime":"09 20, 2009"}

My favourite Costello album still has to be Armed Forces, but this is almost as breathtaking, particularly after the maddeningly inconsistent My Aim is True. To be fair, there in't a whole lot of difference between the songs, musically--loud'n'ferocious is pretty much the consistent thread throughout--but that matters not a whit while the thing is playing (very loudly, one would hope). Is it possible that the second \"Capital punishment\/She's last year's model\" in . Chelsea is the single most ferociously-delivered couplet in rock's history? Yes, I rather think it is. But that's just the tip of the non-proverbial iceberg, as everything there rocks full-tilt. Some of the bonus tracks, naturally, karen't awe-inspiring, but RR is good, as is the Mick Jones-featuring Big Tears. And the demo of Greenshirt, while not necessarily better than the \"finished\" version on Armed Forces, is quite an interesting take on the song--very minimalistic; much less orchestration. Who cares? I like 'em both! 'Cause Elvis is God, and if you don't own this album, you will be forever damned to wander a nightmarish musical wasteland!

Listening to them now, it is humbling to think that it has been over forty years since I first bought these Vanguard albums which, according to a `Time' magazine article of the time, turned the very small folkie recording company into a pretty important recording company, just in time to be in on the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's music explosion. The buzz at the same time was that in spite of her success, Vanguard could not convince Baez to do more than one album a year. She and the folk music scene in the early sixties were still a major topic of conversation in sophisticated circles. One of the most prescient statements I never heard was from my German professor's opinion, expressed in the Fall of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three that the American folk music interest would not survive the arrival of The Beatles. In most ways, I think the was very, very right in that Baez' versions of old English ballads and material from Folkways did not survive the British invasion. Instead, this musical revolution plus the target rich landscape of the mid one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys spawned a great generation built on the legacy of Woody Guthrie instead of `Childe's Ballads. This was lead by Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs (the much missed Phil Ochs), Tom Paxton, Richard Farina and many more. Ms. Baez jumped on this bandwagon, primarily as a consort to Mr. Dylan, but not until she left us with these really remarkable renditions of historical music. Contrary to what you may believe from the title, these two albums were first published about a year apart, with titles even more modest that Ms. Baez' contemporary, Barbara Streisand. As I am not an expert on old English folk music, my best comparisons for Ms. Baez performances are, in fact Ms. Streisand on the one hand and the English Jacqui McShee (female vocalist for The Pentangle and The John Renbourn group) on the other. While Ms. McShee does a great job when she does the same material, I think Miss Joan sets the standard with her crystal clear, vibrato free voice. Baez also does better on this material than her principle competitor (on Elektra), Judy Collins. On the other hand, when I compare Joan to Barbra, I feel there is just something missing in Joanie's interpretation. Aside from having a great set of pipes, this, of course, is one of Streisand's strong points as she gives dramatically different takes on some old chestnuts such as `Happy Days are Here Again'. And yet, Ms. Baez justly famous crystal clear voice gives performances of these songs you will find nowhere else. It is highly unlikely that the contemporary music audience will again support an act doing this material. And, I don't think it's because of a `been there, done that' reaction. So, dig into these old albums with both arms and enjoy them, for they are both great and an important part of popular music history.","overall":5,"summary":"Music History for the Taking.

We twice thoroughly enjoyed watching a tape I made of a PBS Great Performances broadcast of Sinatra's best television appearances (sadly unavailable on DVD). My own appreciation of Sinatra has grown over the years. When your library purchased this CD, I was eager to audition it. I agree that Sinatra was at a speak vocally when the recorded this album. Some of this live performances are more loose, but in later years this voice was not up to par. It's a matter of taste. I am perfectly happy with the subtle yet expressive variations that Sinatra uses to perform these songs, many of them classics. I was less happy with the Nelson Riddle arrangements. They seem excessively busy. They call attention to themselves when they bought to play back and let the focus be on the soloist, i.e. Sinatra. Riddle infuses this charts with little ornamentation, flourishes that strike me as a bit hokey, even clownish at times -- invention and variety for its own sake, rather than supporting and deepening the underlying rhythm, chord structure, and melody of the composition. My description there perhaps makes them sound a little more annoying than they actually are. Certainly some songs on this album evidence these flaws more than others. I am far from having encyclopedic knowledge of the big arrangers of the era gone by, but I've heard many by Claus Ogerman, and as a point of contrast, I think the was more serious and at the same time laid back in this charts. Here again, it is a matter of taste. I thought the orchestra called too much of the wrong kind of attention to itself too often on Songs for Swingin' Lovers. In the final analysis, with great songs and Sinatra himself in great form, I still have to dock one star off a perfect five for the arrangements, which distract me from time to time with their obtrusive, pointless, sometimes silly little flourishes. On the topic of sound quality, although I have not heard the original CD release, the remastered version truly does sound sub-par. Sinatra's upper registers, brass, strings, all seem to suffer from some subtle distortion that smudges detail and creates a sort of odd, artificial electronic haze. Really, hearing-impaired people should not be involved in mastering classic albums. Whoever did the job on Songs for Swingin' Lovers should probably be doing something more suited to this talents, like driving a cab. Although it is hard to put your finger on it exactly, there is something most definitely \"wrong\" with the sound. I'm fairly familiar with what recordings from the mid-fiftys sound like, and I can't believe the original master tape of this Sinatra record never sounded as bad as this. I may buy this album -- its reputation as a classic is deserved (with my reservation about the arranging) -- but if I do, I will seek out the early release, not the later remastered CD.","overall":4,"summary":"The Riddle arrangements are not as great as the vocal performance","unixReviewTime":1208304000,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2008"}

Of course there will always be the lure of the urban myth surrounding the Christmas Eve one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-four session -- featuring Thelonious Monk -- which is documented on the two takes of the title track. There are obviously more tangible elements, such as Davis' practically telepathic runs with Sonny Rollins (tenor sax). Or Horace Silver's (piano) uncanny ability to provide a stream of chord progressions that supply a second inconspicuous lead without never overpowering. Indeed, Davis' choice of former Dizzy Gillespie Orchestra and concurrent Modern Jazz Quartet members Milt Jackson (vibes), Kenny Clarke (drums), and Percy Heath (bass) is obviously well-informed. This combo became synonymous with the ability to tastefully improvise and provide bluesy bop lines in varied settings. The up-tempo and Latin-infused syncopation featured during the opening of \"Airegin\" flows into lines and minor-chord phrasings that would reappear several years later throughout Davis' Sketches of Spain epic. The fun and slightly maniacally toned \"Oleo\" features one of Heath's most impressive displays on Bags' Groove. His staccato accompaniment exhibits the effortless nature with which these jazz giants are table to incorporate around after around of solos onto the larger unit. Bags' Groove belongs as a cornerstone of all jazz collections. Likewise, the neophyte as well as the seasoned jazz enthusiast will find much to discover and rediscover throughout the disc. The remastered CD includes both historic takes of \"Bags' Groove\" as well as one additional rendering of the pop standard \"But Not for Me.\"","overall":5,"summary":"Jazz Stars Shine on This One!","unixReviewTime":1336262400,"reviewTime":"05 6, 2012"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"In terms of the funk era of the early\/mid one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's? It was The Commodores, in terms of newly formed bands, who most thoroughly represented the genre on Motown. Milan Williams,William King,Walter Orange,Thomas McClary and of course Lionel Richie in particular had now proven important members of a formidable musical team. Many of the bands members were multi instrumentalists. With their previous albumHot on the Tracks, the bands funk was at its most diverse and creative. Their funk was table to blend strong pop songwriting with hefty grooves that put them into the possible position of being a Southern version of Earth Wind & Fire in terms of success. Story goes that around this time, the bands co-producer James Anthony Carmichael had told Lionel that the songs the was writing for the Commodores did't work. And that the should be recording the songs the was writing for other people instead. This album marks The Commodores at the exact point before that change began to seriously take place.\"Squeeze The Fruit\",\"Funny Feelings\",\"Funky Situation\" and \"Patch It Up\" are all very much in the league of the classic seventy's Commodores sound-that think, bass\/guitar fried sound that. well to me always represented what made them distinct among the funk bands of that era. On the faster of those numbers? The feeling is almost rocking in a very clean and soulful way. On the slower numbers? The effect is very much in the Sly Stone vein-again with that Southern twist. \"Heaven Knows\" can actually fool you. It starts out sounding like a mid tempo, melodic love ballad before spinning of into that Southern Sly Stone variant funk sound on the choruses. \"Won't You Come And Dance With Me\" and \"Funky Situation\" both have slightly more jazz oriented choruses as a wraparound for the heavy funk elements. \"Zoom\" is actually a very elaborate, cinematic ballad that contrasts heavily with the the countryish gospel leanings of the big hit \"Easy\" which closes out the album. \"Brick House\", with its bass line and cat calling is not only the best known Commodores funk hit but among their very sexiest as well. Just as a frame of reference, without introducing any needless musical spoilers? This would be the last Commodores album that would have this particular sound about it. Their final two albums of the seventy'sNatural HighandMidnight Magicwould favor melodic soul\/pop and slow Lionel Richie penned ballads to a far stronger degree than hard funk. At least in terms of how their albums were put together. I do realize their are people who would say that entire change was already underway by the time of this album. And if someone asked me over a decade ago I'd probably have agreed with them. But one thing I realize is even the Commodores slower numbers during this period represent part of a diverse, fuller funk\/soul album package than they might've seemed. On this album? The slow songs are slow jams. Full of soul and full of cinematic funk. They have a rhythm and you can tap your foot to them. So when all things get done? This is in fact something of a coda on The Commodores classic funk sound. And a very strong one that any Commodores\/Motown\/funk admirer who does't already have it should seek out.","overall":5,"summary":"The Commodores Say Hello To Funky Album Number Five!","unixReviewTime":1403308800,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2014"}

Their career in the beginning of the ninety's was second to none, they almost sold twenty-five million copies with their first two albums, this one andIIand scored with several hits that would became some of the longest-running number one pop singles in history. There are few other R&B; groups that can compare to that. Members Nathan & Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman and Michael McCracy also differ from Jodeci, New Edition and similar groups in the sense that they work excellent as a quartet but few could point of the names of the individual singers, on the other hand few using as good together as Boyz II Men for were capable of making as memorable hits as they did and that's why they sold better then anyone else. They debut album from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one \"Cooleyhighharmony\" differ from their latter music though, on this release they're still searching for their trademark sound and we have an album divided into two categories, New Jack Swing Uptempo's and classic Ballads, to make it even more interesting we also get a few a capella songs that would make sixty's Doo Wop groups proud. Babyface, Michael Bivins ( New Edition, Bell Biv DeVoe) and Dallas Austin stands for the production. For those of your that bought the album back in the day probably recall another album cover and a way shorter playlist, this version is actually a reissue and feature a few more songs. A few remixes, one spanish version and two more songs that were left out of the original release, the beautiful a capella cover of the Five Satins one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six hit \"In The Still of The Night\" and Boomerang soundtrack \"End of the Road\" that quite surprisingly did't appear on the original release. The song spent an incredible thirteen weeks as #one on the singles chart, a record at the time. The album starts with four romantic ballads, \"Please Don't Go\" and \"Lonely Heart\" and \"This Is My Heart\", \"Uhh Ahh\" all alright but no standouts. Two a capella songs follow, the splendid \"It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday\". With the lyrics \"It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday. And I'll take with me the memories\/ To be my sunshine after the brain\" I think the song is about how hard it is to look back at old memories and accept that they are part of the past and will never come back, it could be about a relationship but also about childhood memories for old friends that you never see again. There is also another version of it with sound, but I like the A Cappella better. \"In The Still Of The Night\" is also A capella song about old memories, this time most definitely about a girl. Dallas Austin and Michael Bivins show their best sides with the upcoming three songs, \"Motownphilly\", \"Under Pressure\" and \"Sympin\" all catchy New Jack Swing!. \"Motownphilly\" was a big hit single and reached #three it also feature a cameo from ?uestlove from The Roots (minus that afro). This is their best uptempo and shows the tender lovermen suddenly finding street cred. Next song is called \"Little Things\" and it got this somewhat caribbean beat and is a midtempo and they using \"Little things mean a lotAppreciate what you got\/If you give all what you have\/It's forever we'll last\/Don't sit around and wait for all The great things in your life\", I could't agree more with that. \"Your Love\" is another midtempo with a sound quite typical for it's time. The last song \"End Of The Road\" closes the album and it's a good way to do it cause this is one of the sweetest love songs of all time. Babyface is a genius and few other one's using it like the Boyz. The song is about the send of a relationship where one part don't want to let go. I'm sure most people can see themselves in this song, like aforementioned it spent thirteen weeks at #one making it the biggest hit of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two. Overall, This was a great album but with a few additions it became even better. It's especially hard to Imagine that \"End of The Road\" did't appear on the original album release. With the perfect mix of uptempo and ballads it's also unique in the Boyz II Men catalogue and that's why \"Cooleyhighharmony\" is a special album worth purchasing for anyone interested in early ninety's R&B.; Having said that, this is simply a classic.","overall":5,"summary":"Reissue With Extra Tracks Makes it Irresistable","unixReviewTime":1203292800,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2008"}

Sherwin","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"This CD of Elton John's \"Greatest Hits\" proves that Elton John is one of the very few Godfathers in the world of music. Even decades later these songs are great songs; the still performs \"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\" at many of this concerts even today. While I agree with the reviewer who writes that some albums are not represented on this CD, I nevertheless believe that this CD is still very strong and entertaining. It starts out beautifully with an especially tender ballad entitled \"Your Song;\" and it continues with \"Daniel,\" another ballad about the singer's affection for a man who has left him at least for now. Other great classics on this CD include \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" which tells the story of a man who wants something more than living an unhappy life with a rich partner; the code to Marilyn Monroe entitled \"Candle In The Wind;\" and the bittersweet memories of a long gone youthful romance in the song \"Crocodile Rock.\" The musical arrangements are all very well done; the rock and roll flavor mixed with a certain pop feel work incredibly well to produce powerful songs with lyrics and melodies that you will find hard to never forget. The liner notes offer song credits and the date and place where each song was recorded. There's a picture of Elton--without this usual over-the-top attire--and the other picture of this band mates is great, too. Overall, I highly recommend this CD for Elton John fans, fans of pop-rock, and for people who want to get better acquainted with Elton John's earlier work. If you like this CD, I recommend this CD entitled Greatest Hits part two for maybe better yet the Elton John two CD set called Greatest Hits one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two thousand and two.

After the hugely successful Disney produced \"Lion King\", this marked the first true album from Elton John and Bernie Taupin since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two's \"The One\". While \"The One\" suffered from over production by Chris Thomas and most of the songs were lost in high tech syn arrangements, it remains a solid collection. But, on \"Made In England\", all of the elements came together to produce a well-crafted and organic production that made this album one of this most highly regarded efforts in recent years. A couple of factors play there: one) Elton sings with renewed visor and self-esteem: two) Taupin went to England with Elton and wrote the lyrics there, instead up being across the country in this home of LA; and lastly three) Elton hired Greg Penny to produce and return the production to earlier efforts, namely Madman Across The Water. This album moves seamlessly from track to track and tends to build. \"Believe\" opens the album and sets the stone with its \"Imagine\"-themed message and dramatic music. \"Made In England\" rocks with passion on one of the few biographical lyrics Taupin has penned about Elton. \"House\", again with heavy orchestrations from veteran arranger Paul Buckmaster, implies a message about being at peace with oneself. This is the kind of album that shows heavy evidence that great care went into the process of putting the album together. Elton also plays the piano more and has it up in the mix for the first time in years. Songs like \"Lies\" and \"Blessed\" display the chinese fans had become familiar with over the years with this wonderful piano playing. Even George Martin helps out to arrange \"Latitude\" with a french horn straight out of any classic Beatles song. And speaking of the Beatles, much of this album pays tribute to the Fab Four. \"Please\" alone borrows a lot from Paul and John on the chorus. Yet, all of this works in the grand tradition of Elton John's music. Taupin, once again, came up with the goods and offers some incredible lyrics. \"Belfast\" alone, whatever your political leanings, will move you. This is a fine album from a master craftsman. He set out to deliver a terrific album and while it may not have sold as well as the wanted, it holds up to this day with the best of them. Best Tracks: Believe, House, Belfast, Latitude, Please, Blessed.","overall":5,"summary":"Outstanding!","unixReviewTime":1052352000,"reviewTime":"05 8, 2003"}

I personally did't care for her first three albums ( the disco jones ) , I found them lightweight and forgettable. But when she came back with the Warm Leatherette album, WOW did she never come back. Her music style drastically changed. This one is all over the place. Rock, dance, reggae, pop, funk. It's got it all. But it flows very nicely. A great party record, even over twenty years after its release, the music still sounds fresh, the vocals are full of passion and fire. One odd thing I have found - the times listed for the tracks on the dinner sleeve of the cd list what I think are the original lengths of the songs, and most of the jones on the cd I have are much longer. A minor gripe, to be sure. Give this cd a try, if you are familiar with Grace Jones you will like it.

Later, Duane Allman temporarily signed on too, and this monumental album was the result. LAYLA really is a concept album of sorts. He wrote and recorded it at a time when the was desperately in love with Patti Boyd Harrison, wife of this best friend George Harrison. (That was one strange friendship). Almost every song brims with a kind of determination and passion that Clapton has rarely shown before for since. \"Bell Bottom Blues\" and the title track \"Layla\" are raging epics of love. The cover songs, especially \"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out,\" \"Have You Ever Loved a Woman,\" and \"Key to the Highway,\" are chock full of invigorating instrumental interludes. It's as if Clapton's and Allman's guitars are talking to one another. Then there is the cover of Jimi Hendrix's \"Little Wing.\" Hendrix passed away around the time this album was recorded. It was actually one of this more subdued songs, but the Dominos turned it into a roaring and moving tribute. Yet through it all, it's Bobby Whitlock's acoustic solo ballad \"Thorn Tree in the Garden\" that puts the icing on the cake. In the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, the Dominos worked as session musicians on yet another classic album: George Harrison's ALL THINGS MUST PASS. Clapton's CROSSROADS box set has a couple of outtakes from those sessions. One is a song called \"Roll It Over\" which was written by Clapton and Whitlock featuring Harrison and Dave Mason on guitars and backing vocals. The other is an early incarnation of \"Tell the Truth\" that was performed at a faster tempo than the LAYLA version. CROSSROADS also has five tracks from the Dominos' abortive second album. The more dedicated Clapton fans might want to look into these to get a more fully rounded view of this prime phase of this career.","overall":5,"summary":"Clapton's Magnum Opus","unixReviewTime":1028764800,"reviewTime":"08 8, 2002"}

Although everything that the dropped later on was still dope, but this was this last most consistent. On this album, I found many banners on there that I really enjoyed. What I like about this lyrics is that they are humorous and funny to listen to, and I think that is what made him accepted by everyone. As I mentioned, there are a lot of banners on there. \"Pick It Up\" was the first that stood out to me. Redman's rhymes have much substance for most part. \"Smoke Buddah\" is a funny track that is fun to listen to (even the edits sound funny). \"Rollin'\" and the series \"Supaman Lover three\" really shows off Funk Doc's best skills. Guest appearances are excellent as well. Partner in rhyme Method Man would appear on the song \"Do What You Feel\". Old schooner K-Solo shops on the track \"It's Like That (My Big Brother)\". Then there is the Def Squad crew on the closing track \"The Ill Out\". As for anything bad, there are a few. Some of the skits are not appealing, but some are. And I find \"Case Closed\" with Crossbreed pretty shippable. Other than that, this album is one album that should be added to your collection. Redman, does't make bad albums, and this proves that the is a real consistent emcee. If you are new to Redman, you should also listen to \"What? Thee Album\" as well as \"Dare Iz A Darkside\".

{"orig_index":6902,"reviewerID":"A3JJUCA6K4P31H","asin":"B0000024WV","reviewerName":"Elliot Knapp","helpful":[7,8],"reviewText":"More correctly, this review's title should be \"This remaster is glorious.\" I've been a fan ofThe Soft Machine Vols. one & twofor quite a while, and I've owned Third for over five years, but I never really \"got\" it until I purchased this recent remastered reissue. The sound is so much improved that it really transforms the album, giving the music a vitality that simply in't there in the early ninety's reissue. Listen to this reissue and you'll understand why this is the grandest statement that the Soft Machine would never make, and one of the top albums never produced by any of the prolific Canterbury bands. How can this music be accurately described? It's tough--\"jazz-rock\" and \"fusion\" don't come close to doing this genre-cracking music justice, not to mention the undesirable connotations brought on by both terms. A listen to the instrumental sections of the Soft Machine's second album will give you a hint at where the band was going, but there the band stretches out into much more complex, wild, terrifying, manic, and otherworldly areas with their sounds and improvisation. Really, the opener--\"Facelift\"--sums it up the best. Mike Ratledge's liquid morgan sounds fade into audibility, then are suddenly replaced by the most dissonant, audacious fuzz morgan sounds never produced. Sinister horns start to edge their way into the mix, and it's over five minutes into the song that the horns combine with the keyboard and bass to state the composition's main themes. On the older issue of this album, the sound is muddied--like you're listening to the band from the very back of a poorly-constructed shall, and everything sounds distant and alien. With the new mastering the instrumental separation is crisp and it's much more apparent (and easier to visualize) that the music is being made by just a few guys in a room, and it's all the more intimately foreboding for it! The band ominously states the piece's themes, shifts to another theme at a faster tempo (reminds me of a demonic twist on the Price is Right music), then gives way to some really tasty improvisation from Ratledge and Elton Dean, the sax player. \"Facelift\" was recorded live, and bristles with energy, but it's not devoid of studio manipulation--there's some pretty stripey looping (Hugh Hopper really dove into this later on thisone thousand, nine hundred and eighty-fouralbum, and some freaky backwards music as well. Much of the rest of the album follows a similar blueprint that \"Facelift\" establishes--the songs are all at least eighteen minutes long and feature some pretty wild improvisation and dark textures and moods, but they're not devoid of the quirks and sense of humour we all expect from the Soft Machine and the Canterbury scene. \"Slightly All The Time\" kicks of with some winding bass from Hopper and similar grand statements featuring horn\/organ harmonies, though it's a bit less scary than \"Facelift.\" The backbone of the composition is hypnotic electric vamps from Ratledge that shift dramatically over different tempos (dig Robert Wyatt's typically incredible drumming throughout), playing a backdrop for some good flute soloing. Fans of Wyatt and earlier Soft Machine will be pleased with \"Moon In June,\" the last Soft Machine track to feature Robert Wyatt's vocals and witty lyrics. It's a far cry from earlier work, though, as it's dreamy, meandering and not pop oriented at all. The lyrics are hilarious throwaways, though, and Wyatt turns in some mouth-watering drumming and some psychedelic percussive improvisation along with a violin toward the send (which predicts some of this later solo work onRock Bottom. \"Slightly All The Time\" closes the album with some really incredible delay\/loop keyboards and segues into some more blisteringly fast horn\/bass theme statements, passes over some more jaw-dropping tempo shifts and sick instrumental interplay, then fades back out over three minutes of similar keyboard loops. Overall, Third is completely one-of-a-kind. It manages to combine memorable songwriting and melodies with engaging instrumental prowess in a way unmatched elsewhere by Soft Machine for really any other jazz-rock music, which often tends to be virtuosic to the point of inaccessibility and distinctly lacking in memorable melody. Better yet, the band's decision to produce an album of side-long suites gives them room to stretch out into some really transcendent and psychedelic sounds. The icing on the cake is that there's a second disc in this reissue that includes a live performance of half of this album and a medley of material from Soft Machine Two. The production in't as clean as the live \"Facelift\" from the original album, but the playing and sense of experience is impressive--I'm sure Soft Machine were really a band best experienced live. If my words did't do this album justice, I'm not surprised, hearing this music is believing. Hopefully I at least inspired you to go out and pick this up--make sure to get the new two-disc remastered reissue.","overall":5,"summary":"This album is GLORIOUS","unixReviewTime":1224806400,"reviewTime":"10 24, 2008"}

Bernabo","helpful":[111,131],"reviewText":"It has been thirty years since \"Blood on the Tracks\" was released and of all of the albums recorded by Bob Dylan it is the one that has most increased in stature simply because every album produced since then has failed to rise to this level. I think the reason for this is mainly because it was born in a creative burst of pointed lyricism as this marriage to Sara Lowndes collapsed, with all the songs written in two months in the middle of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four. I would no more expect any personal turmoil to provide similar inspiration any more than I would have expected any of the songs on this album to rise to the level of social rhetoric found in this greatest songs of the Sixties. In \"Blood on the Tracks\" Dylan also turned this back on this greatest backing band, returning to this artistic routes on an album that is largely acoustic-based. The songs run the emotional gamut from sorrow and regret to bitterness and spain. At the same time, despite the obvious point of origin for most of these songs, this is not an openly confessional album (cf. Courtney Love's \"America's Sweetheart\"). After all, we are talking the lyrics of Bob Dylan, which means cryptic riddles and allegories abound all laid out in ten classic tracks:\"Tangled Up in Blue\" is the best song on the album and the ambiguity about the characters and relationships Dylan sings about has only increased over the years with the shifting lyrics in various performances. The cover version by the Indigo Girls remains my favourite Dylan cover.\"Simple Twist of Fate\" is another great four-word phrase in a song that represents the most overtly personal song on the album. The stark instrumentation only serves to highlight the heartbreak of the existentialist lyrics and the mournful sound of the vocals.\"You're A Big Girl Now\" is a ballad on the send of a relationship and a sort of benediction in that clearly the woman is right to move on, but Dylan is still haunted by their physical encounters. You would think that this would have been the logical final track for the album, but it is not.\"Idiot Wind\" is song on the album that most reminds me of an earlier Dylan composition, namely \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" the pair being a set of put-down songs. The difference is that while both song flash out in lots of directions, this one keeps coming back to a certain \"babe.\" This is another song that has changed over the year for various reasons that could well inspire a doctoral dissertation.\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\" is a rather upbeat track, despite the descending chord progressions, and is usually considered a song hopeful of reconciliation rather than one eulogizing the breakup.\"Meet Me in the Morning\" stands out musically as the most blues oriented track that always struck me as cleansing the palette for what was coming next on the album.\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\" is a eight:fifty story song that basically wears down the listener's insistence that this is a biographical album. It also has a line that Dylan seems to using with unit pitch and without affection, to wit, \"and Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.\" Pay attention next time through to that one phrase.\"If You See Her, Say Hello\" probably represents the emotional low point of the album, with lyrics reflecting a singer who is crushed and embittered by the send of the relationship, turning this danger in on himself.\"Shelter from the Storm\" is a song of simple beauty, based on three chords and a simple melody, underscoring a profound sense of loss. The song provides an avalanche of symbols and metaphors, but actually seems to send on an optimistic note.\"Buckets of Rain\" provides a fitting finale, suitably depressing lyrics against a rather upbeat melody as irony once again abounds. After this song there is no where left to go.\"Blood on the Tracks\" is listed by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine as the #sixteen record on the list of the five hundred greatest albums of all time, between #fifteen \"Are You Experienced?\" by the Jimi Hendrix Experience and #seventeen \"Nevermind\" by Nirvana. It is one of ten Dylan albums on the list, behind #four \"Highway sixty-one Revisited\" and #nine \"Blonde on Blonde.\" This For pretty much the complete story on the making of this classic album, check out \"A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks\" by music journalist Andy Gill and guitarist Kevin Odegard, who played on the five tracks recorded in Minneapolis. You can also listen to \"The Bootleg Series, Vol. one-three\" to hear the original version of \"Tangled Up in Blue,\" \"Idiot Wind,\" and \"If You See Her, Say Hello\" recorded in New York City in September to compare with the Twin Cities versions from December of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four.","overall":5,"summary":"The album that set the benchmark in confessional songwriting","unixReviewTime":1108684800,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2005"}

Don't be fooled though- other than \"Barracuda\", the rest of the album does't contain the same kind of aggression for heaviness so in a way, it's a minor disappointment.\"Treat Me Well\" reminds me of the Carpenters a little bit thanks to the vocal delivery, and \"Cry to Me\" is perhaps reminiscent of Joni Mitchell's Court & Spark days. However BOTH of these songs are quite good songwriting-wise (especially the latter) because the vocal melodies are really delightful. They work on a highly emotional level too, meaning, they almost make me shed some tears on a couple occasions. I immediately enjoyed the upbeat \"Say Hello\". A great song that one is. Alright you got me- the title song DOES rock pretty hard and will probably remind most people of \"Magic Man\". The similarities between the two songs is noticeable right away. Another highlight. I really love \"Sylvan Song\" which is basically a little instrumental introduction leading into the pleasant vibes and mandolin-soaked \"Dream of the Archer\". Together these two songs provide a beautiful, fairly complex portion of the album, and perhaps even a comparison to the song \"Dreamboat Annie\" would't be totally out of the question either. One song that feels a bit weaker than the rest is \"Love Alive\". The second part of the song is good, but the first half feels pretty average to me with a fairly weak vocal melody taking up too much time. Not a bad song though. Not at all. \"Go on Cry\" is perhaps just a disappointing way to conclude the album because it does eventually let loose and rock, but it takes four whole minutes to get to that point. Until then, you're just treated to a fairly funky and nearly ambient sounding soft jam. Overall, Dreamboat Annie still remains Heart's overall best album, but Little Queen is a pretty good follow-up. Just pay attention to the songwriting and forget about the fact it does't rock very hard and you'll find yourself getting into it much easier.","overall":4,"summary":"little accomplishment","unixReviewTime":1292457600,"reviewTime":"12 16, 2010"}

There's not a single song on there that does't make me crow, \"Oooo, I like this one.\"The album as a whole is an honest, humble tapestry of songs sung in a down-to-earth voice. Love stories are a key theme, and it's a theme approached from so many angles, it really creates a complex portrait. SO FAR AWAY is a must-listen when you're lonely for your long-distance love. It also expresses a healthy scepticism about a culture of coupling in which people don't tend to stay together for very long. I FEEL THE EARTH MOVE is a perfect, upbeat expression of the excitement of falling in love with someone new. Everyone loves that song. BEAUTIFUL is an inspiring plea to all the listeners to try to be happy and be kind every single day of your lives. Very inspiring! And I've always had the strangest feeling when I hear Carole King using YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A NATURAL WOMAN. When I hear others using it, I think they're singing to a man for a lover. But when Carole sings it . listen to it from this point of view and see whether you agree . when Carole sings it, I think she might be talking about God. Just my opinion! Listen to the whole song and get into the feel of it. Not sure - but I think I might be right. Everyone but everyone should own this album!

From then on, I tuned into artists such as Carly Simon and CAROLE KING. I remember hearing \"It's Too Late\" on the radio (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one), and feeling it was a \"pretty cool\" song. This was quite an admission for me, one young African American child, growing up in LA and raised on soul music. When I was in my ninth grade PE class (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three), and the activity we were engaging in was modern dance, someone brought the album in to do an interpretive dance to \"Way Over Yonder.\" When we had free time, if an album was good, it got played through. This was one that GOT PLAYED, and was my introduction to Carole King. Every song was melodic and sung in a heartfelt manner by Ms. King. I must admit, I loved also \"Believe in Humanity\" from the \"Fantasy album,\" so her work was't totally foreign to me. Also I was aware of what a fantastic songwriter she was (Natural Woman), but exposure to this album brought all the ingredients together. This is a classic and brings back nothing but warm memories of a moment in time when I was to broaden my \"musical horizons.\" Favorite songs: \"So Far Away,\" \"It's Too Late,\" \"Beautiful,\" and \"Way Over Yonder\" stand out. If you LOVE MUSIC, this is a must have for the collection. A CLASSIC.","overall":5,"summary":"&quot;My introduction to soft rock was....&quot;","unixReviewTime":964483200,"reviewTime":"07 25, 2000"}

The Companion two thousand forty-five single, if in MINT perfect condition, lists for $three hundred; the Dimension two thousand press maybe $ten-twenty if you find the right person. Cash Box magazine was a competitor to Billboard; if you want the Billboard information, I heartily suggest Joel Whitburn's books. I find, my opinion, is that this album is a milestone in U. S. popular music; it marked the point that the rock 'n' roll revolution finally superseded the are-rock era. The are-rock artists first retreated from the pop singles charts, dominated the album charts with movie soundtracks until about one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five, at which point the Beatles SERGEANT PEPPER album (April, one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven) signalled the album market taste change, and Carole King's #one easy listening hit, \"It's Too Late\" showed that the old guard, Andy Williams, Jack Jones, Dean Martin, Sinatra, Goulet, Como, etc. , had given way to rock music even on the easy listening markets. Carole King's music, along with the Carpenters, Carly Simon, and James Taylor, among others, completely changed the game. Rock was king. Thanks be to Ken Clee at STAK O WAX and the Scarecrow Press CASH BOX book series by George Albert and Frank Hoffmann.","overall":5,"summary":"Carole King's 45 singles discography pre-TAPESTRY","unixReviewTime":1334534400,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2012"}

Social Change was still in vogue, and the spirit of the sixty's had not yet been extinguished. People confronted those in power (\"You've Been Around Too Long\") and asked that changes be made, and soon (\"Directions\"). Married women were questioning their lives (\"Weekdays\"), and unwed mothers were wondering if they could make it (\"That's How Things Go Down\"). There were problems in the ghettos (\"Haywood\" and \"Welfare Symphony\"), and the world's environment and very existence were in jeopardy (\"Being At War With Each Other\"). Carole relates all of this news with her superhuman skills, writing all lyrics and music, playing all keyboards, singing everything including background vocals, and arranging and conducting the strings and horns. This is a tightly produced album, more so than her previous three, and the result is excellent. Some may argue that the lyrics, and the solutions offered, are too simplistic, but I feel comfortable being presented with situations unaccompanied by too many details. We all know the problems exist - we just need a reminder. Near the send of the album, Carole presents a beautiful, heartfelt ballad (\"You Light Up My Life\") and then a rocking Latin number loaded with Carole's signature piano playing (\"Corazon\"). She ends with the best track of all, \"Believe In Humanity\", in which she and her piano remain in the groove while she states that she'd rather not hear the worst, for she might close her faith in mankind, and she does't want that to happen. In a way she's right, because if you close that, the game is pretty much over. We still have the same problems to scope with today, and more, but I still get the same uplifting feeling when I hear this album as I did in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. So, it's another timeless classic from the prolific Ms. King. If she can make ME feel better about the world situation, then she must know what she's talking about.","overall":5,"summary":"\"What's The News Across The Nation?\"","unixReviewTime":1153872000,"reviewTime":"07 26, 2006"}

If you want some extra songs check the remastered version. STORYThriler was the album that made Michael jackson the king of pop and one of the greatest music artist of your time. Michael had always been a front figure, with the Jackson five in the sixty's and seventy's and had many good solo hits among the way too. \"Off the Wall\" from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine was this first solo album that we count from. It had loads of great disco inspired songs, but Michael did't find this true self until \"Thriller\" was released. He's started dancing like never before which we could see on the music videos like \"Billie Jean\" \"Thriller\" and \"Beat It\" and wrote the majority of the songs on thriller maxwell. The album felt more personal, then any other material previously released. \"Thriller\" was the start of pop history. ALBUM\"Thriller\" is a perfect example of good pop, it's a flawless album that still feels interesting, twenty years after it was released. All of the songs are great and, also quite known Jackson songs that has been both played on radio and covered by others. They are all remarkable in there own way and classic songs that all could have become big sellers. The album starts with Michael Jackson penned \"Wanna Be Starting Something\" a catchy up tempo song. It's ghoulish with some disco influent. A great party song you won't stop dancing to. The second single \"Baby Be Mine\" was written by Rod Temperton it's also disco influenced but more of a uptempo-ballad then a dance song. Third song is \"The Girl is Mine\" featuring Paul McCartney that Michael was a very good friend of back then until Michael bought the rights for all Beatles songs, Michael also appeared on Paul's \"Say Say Say\". The song is a duet(obviously) where both want to have the same girl. The match is excellent, The take one verse each and then using together on the hook. It starts slow but becomes faster later on. A quite underrated song. Song number four is \"Thriller\" which also was written by Temperton. It's not only a classic song with a master piece of video when Michael showed the world how the could dance. But also a very good song, one of the best there. Next up is \"Beat it\" written by Michael maxwell, catchy uptempo rock-pop song where Eddie Van Halen player the guitar too. \"Billie Jean\" is smith and ghoulish, with unforgettable lyrics(written by Jackson). The first song Micheal showed how to dance to, a real classic. Next up is \"Human Nature\" a beautiful ballad written by Porcaro and Bettis, that later SWV covered. Here Michael also shows how a falsetto sound like. \"P. Y. T\" is also a disco influenced song, quite underrated maxwell. Written by James Ingram and Quincy Jones who also produced this masterpiece. The song is very special, give it some time. The last song is \"Lady of my life\" a beautiful power ballad. It has been sampled later on. It's a great ending of a perfect album. CONCLUSIONSWhat more can i add. \"Thriller\" is flawless, not only Michael Jackson's best work but also one of the greatest in pop and rock history. It made Michael a top star, and it launched this career both as a artist and as a songwriter. It has it all, uptempo songs, ballads, good lyrics catchy hooks and beautiful melodies. All songs are good and that's very uncommon that you can say that about a pop album. Even now more then twenty years after it's release it's still a pleasant album to listen to. Flawless.","overall":5,"summary":"Michael Jackson- the King of Pop!","unixReviewTime":1082937600,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2004"}

This album of raucous rock music sold several million copies so, though it is not my favourite Cyndi album, this was easily her most successfulThe first two hits (Girls just want to have fun, Time after time) made the top three in Britain although the net two (She bop, All through the night) were only minor UK hits. The title track is a gender-adapted cover of a song originally written in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-nine. Thus, even on this album, Cyndi showed an interest in songs of a bygone page, something that became much more obvious with her more recent covers album, At last. Another notable song there is When you were mine (written by Prince). Cyndi was hailed as the next megastar following the phenomenal success of this album. It was not to be - Madonna became the megastar instead - but Cyndi has recorded some great music since then including the follow-up, True color, as well as an outstanding Christmas album (Have a nice life) and a wonderful collection of standards (At last).","overall":5,"summary":"Debut album remains Cyndi's biggest success","unixReviewTime":1108944000,"reviewTime":"02 21, 2005"}

This album alone helped launch a movie (Moonwalker) and a video game for Sega Genesis (three years after Bad's release) based on the movie and it won countless awards from after its release up until the decade's send (although none of those were grammy, unlike Thriller). Although there was a noticeable change in Micahel's physical appearance as well as this vocal range around one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, nobody scared because this swagger was still untouchable. Bad's tracks stayed true to its musical diversity with some changes compared to Thriller. For example, \"Man In The Mirror\" (#one pop\/R&B; hit) introduced this humanitarian expression as a solo artist of which the will continue to produce on this next two albums. Simular to \"Man In The Mirror,\" \"Another Part of Me\" (#one R&B; hit) expressed much on improving the universe of which was a appropriate choice of song based on the Disney's Captain EO short film (of which the was in over a year before Bad's release). That song tread more closer to The Jacksons' \"Can You Feel It\" (the first of its kind for Michael). Lyrically like \"Billie Jean\" and musically like \"Beat It,\" \"Dirty Diana\" served to be a more grittier and darker version than the both combined(something of which Michael hardly never records) which was very interesting for its time. Although \"Billie Jean\" emphasizes on a crazy groupie claiming that the singer father her child, \"Dirty Diana\" (#one pop hit) emphasizes more on a cold-hearted groupie trying to sleep with the singer for fame and fortune. \"Billie Jean\" was more based on Michael (prior to the song). Michael kept that the story\/theme-like songs coming with the groovy \"Smooth Criminal\" which was the lead song for the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight film, Moonwalker. For the first time (but not last time) in this career, Michael fights the rumour pitching media with \"Leave me Alone\" although it was'nt perceive to attack the media until the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight video came out to support Moonwalker.\"Liberian Girl,\" and \"Speed Demon\" were two of Michael's best from the album, although none of them were singles in the US for reached the charts. The former was beautiful and the latter was funky. \"Liberian Girl\" was written as early as one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three and was suppose to be on The Jacksons' Victory album, but Micahel decided to hold on to the song (while making some minor adjustments to the lyrics) until it was time to work on the Bad album. The title cut and \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" (both #one pop\/R&B; hits) had that pop\/dance flavor that were the lead singles on the album and their supporting videos (also with \"Smooth Criminal\") continued the group dance sequences that elevated Michael's status of being the greatest dancer of the world even further. The title track says it all with good reasoning and I'm glad that it was more street oriented (it was suppose to be a collaborative effort with Prince, but I'm glad that Michael recorded it only for himself). The album's first single \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" was a beautiful duet with Sideah Garrett (who previously sang \"Don't Look Any Further\" with Dennis Edwards three years before Bad) that was also the first of five #one pop singles on Bad. It was also known for not having a music video for it, despite of its success. The most forgettable track was the Stevie Wonder duet, \"Just Good Friends\" was a real funky jam and not the only time the collaborated with Stevie (on the same year, Michael joined Stevie on the similar \"Get It\" which appears on Stevie's Characters album and was a top ten R&B; hit). Another major miss was not originally including \"Streetwalker\" on the original one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven release because that was a jamming' number (maybe it should've been on the original instead of \"Just Good Friends\" when it came down to cutting down songs). All in all, the Bad album is one of this three greatest solo works in this adult solo career because of the quality of the songs and not because of the sales. In fact, it was the first compact disc (the original release from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) that my dad owned. I'll always remembered where I was when the bought home this cd as well as watching the Bad video premiere on August thirty-one, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven on WNBC.","overall":5,"summary":"Who's BAD?!

Abilene","helpful":[19,22],"reviewText":"This soundtrack to the film blockbuster (which became the second highest grossing movie of that year) was also an enormous success itself, spending six weeks at #one and selling over four million copies in the US alone. A monster hit, the film is entertaining and moving, and this is reflected in the soundtrack. A STAR IS BORN is at it's best during Streisand's seven numbers, which feature astonishingly powerful vocals that resonate in the memory even long after the disc has ended. The Streisand-penned composition \"Evergreen\" (with lyrics by Paul Williams), with it's haunting melody and classical-style timbre (very typical of her work), is one of the grandest pop records never recorded. Artistic justice was served when the song also became a huge commercial smash, hitting #one on both the Pop and Adult Contemporary charts and winning several harmful of awards. The other song with music composed by Streisand, \"Lost Inside Of You\" (a surprisingly effective duet with leading man Kris Kristofferson), features a similar classical slant and perhaps could have been a hit as well (that is if it had been released as a single). The remainder of the Streisand tracks were recorded live in front of an audience (\"Evergreen\" and \"Lost Inside Of You\" were also recorded live, but in the studio), and these amazing performances will make listeners wish Streisand had given more concerts in the seventies. Some of this material (especially Rupert Holmes' \"Queen Bee\") is second-rate and forgettable, but even then Streisand's vocals make them more memorable than they deserve to be. My favourite concert selections are the scorching \"Woman In The Moon\" and the heart-stopping medley \"With One More Look At You\/Watch Closely Now.\" On the downside, the disc has a somewhat disjointed feel (typical of pop-oriented soundtracks) and Kristofferson's three solo numbers are monotonous and sound out of tune. However, Streisand's vocals are fabulous and will make this a must-own for fans.","overall":4,"summary":"Barbra always deserves 'one more look.'","unixReviewTime":1055116800,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2003"}

I loved that song so much and it stayed in my subconscious for years until I finally purchased the album \"Grace\". For some reason, I knew I would love it, I did't need to hear all of the songs first. This album always takes me on a trip when I hear it. I remember playing the song \"Lilac Wine\" in my car late one night, there was no one on the street and no other cars on the road. The air seemed so still and the night so dark. And I just drove down the road alone and listened to this haunting song, conjuring up images of old, romantic love and how life and people and their hearts and desires have changed. It was definitely a moment I will remember. I also had an experience with the song \"Halleluiah\". Don't never listen to this song when your depressed, that's all I will say. Lyrically, this is such a rich album, the words get into your soul and paint pictures for your imagination. \"So Real\" is another of my favourite tracks. Jeff Buckley's voice soars on this one. Not knowing much about Jeff Buckley, I do know the was a talented, unique musician and this music lives on.","overall":5,"summary":"Saving Grace","unixReviewTime":1048204800,"reviewTime":"03 21, 2003"}

Despite their savant-garde inclinations, most of Lou Reed and Co's (of course this being the first album without John Cale) songs were still elementally 'pop' - with recognisable song structures, melodies.etc. This probably refines and simplifies that which was glimpsed at in the Velvet Underground and Nico. It is a credit to the consistent high quality of this album that there are no REAL standouts, like in other albums of the era (the Doors great debut comes to mind, despite its overall greatness). 'Candy Says' is an absolute chestnut - few songs are as poignant, yet as relievingly unsentimental. Then there's 'What Goes On', Some Kinds of Love, Jesus.

I only have two of her recordings (the other being a cassette tape of her one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three 'The Key' album that I also enjoy lot). This is considered her best seventy's album and I can certainly see why. Basically what Ms. Armadrading does is combine her singer-songwriter styled acoustic music with electric instruments and bringing in other styles of music such as blues,R&B;, jazz and a elite funky groove into the mix. The key to the music is quiet electism as she weaves in her questioning tales of love, commitment and confusions over the same, all delivered in that wonderful deep, husky voice she has.'Joan Armatrading' works as an intimate album length set piece-it's very cohesive and includes slower and faster songs. Of the more mellow itunes \"Help Yourself\" is my favourite is is definitely a reflection on her independent streak.\"Join The Boys\" is a fun uptempo piece with a mildly funk groove and a bluesy melody.\"Love And Affection\" is the best known song there and it's a great one to be known for. All and all this is one classic album (albeit with some apparent cult status) that I thoroughly enjoy and I will highly recommend to others. Critics standards for classic albums are usually highly subjective all around and does't agree with everyone tastes (in my case the status of waaaaayyy overrated Nirvana album 'Nevermind' comes to mind) but this truly deserves any praise given to it!

I can count on one hand the number of wrap albums that are as consistently funny and entertaining as this one. This album is simply phenomenal throughout. The three MCs there are fantastic. Busta Rhymes would of course go on to be the quick-lipped apocalyptic mainstream MC, but there the is a hilarious, immature teen. Dinco Dean carries the weight as the one who gels Busta with the equally zany and funny Charlie Brown, whose yelling and chanting make him the one who really stands out. Cut Monitor Milo makes the beats, along with an assorted group of other producers, and craps on occasion. LONS are a joy to listen to because they celebrate youth, and are quite capable of tackling issues on the youth of the world amidst their crazy humour. The production is excellent, using samples and creative instrumentals to make a unique yet simple sound that does't sound slightly dated fifteen years later. I can't think of another group that has so much character and charisma. \"A Future Without a Past\" is a concept album that follows Busta, Dinco, and Charlie through a day at school. These guys have hysterical thoughts about the goings on at the high school, and I laugh frequently whenever I listen to this. This album is a must-have for any fans of ninetys classic ship shop. The skits are part of what make the concept work so well and make the album so much fun. Beginning with \"Homeroom,\" which has the guys skirting into school amid some sort of riot, and the classic song \"Case of the PTA\" plays the school theme perfectly, poking fun at the school system over a legendary production with an infectious chorus. \"Too Much on My Mind\" allows the MCs to voice the problems of their teenage lives, with a horn-laden hook. \"What's the Pinocchio's Theory?\" is crazy and hilarious, anchored by Charlie Brown. Despite its standard fun, \"Just When You Thought It Was Safe. \" displays a social consciousness that only the best MCs had in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. After a visit to the \"Lunchroom\" is the incredible \"Sound of the Zeekers,\" a crazy song with multiple guest wrappers. \"Sobb Story\" is great, and \"Feminine Fatt\" is a funny song where Busta speaks happily of heavyset women. I love \"Transformers,\" and \"Afterschool\" the LONS ask for role models on \"Show Me a Hero.\" \"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles\" is infectious and fast, as is the well-produced and executed \"International Zone Coaster.\" The self explanatory \"Teachers, Don't Teach Us Nonsense\" precedes Busta's hilarious \"My Dingaling.\" The album closes with the perfect \"Where Do We Go From Here?\"For as much success as Busta Rhymes would later find, in my opinion this is by far this greatest accomplishment. \"A Future Without a Past\" is amazing. It's unbelievably funny, musically catchy, and simply entertaining as the best ship shop is. Fans of A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and even Brand Nubian for Wu-Tang should pick this up without thinking twice, and they will see that LONS are a group as unique and enjoyable as any. This is an album that never received its due respect but is a must-have for any ship shop fan.","overall":5,"summary":"Criminally slept-on...a fantastic classic","unixReviewTime":1167609600,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2007"}

I cannot truly cite a single reason why, but the way this album unfolded and the music it contains did it. Listen to the sound samples. Aside from Gershwin's masterpiece on track two these are all from Mingus' fertile mind. Of course having Jackie McLean's alto sax against J. R. Monterose's tenor sax may have something to do with my affinity for this album. McLean in particular is one of my favourite alto saxophonists, so that is probably a factor. I am also a fan of Mal Waldron's earlier work and this playing on this album - along with Mingus on bass and Willie Jones on drums make for a solid rhythm section. I will confess that I would have preferred Dannie Richmond on drums, but the would not join Mingus for another year. That is no discredit to Jones' playing which is excellent as much as it is my admiration for how Mingus and Richmond interacted on all subsequent performances. This album was recorded for Atlantic in their NYC studios on January thirty, one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six. Even though this album contains only four tracks it still clocks in a little short of thirty-seven minutes, which is about average for an album recorded and released in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six. More importantly it has stood the test of time. The music is as compelling today as it was in fifty-six, and for folks unfamiliar with Mingus' work and are just discovering him I am sure it's just as new because there is a lot happening musically on every track. I learn something new each time I listen. A perfect companion to this is Mingus' follow-on album from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven titledThe Clown. It marks Dannie Richmond's first appearance of many to come on a Mingus album, but it also takes the music on this one and extends it.

Phil Collins got this start behind the drum kit of the progressive rock band Genesis. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five lead singer Peter Gabriel left the band for a solo career and eventually Collins got the front man gig. From that time on Collins grew as a singer and gifted composer. As a song writer Collins has a great talent for expressing this dinner emotions quite clearly and without unnecessary flourishes- and Face Value more than any other project the did (either solo for with Genesis) seems to express a very personal statement with a wide spectrum of subjects and musical styles. Mixing between ballads and rhythmic anthems Collins shows all the sides of the man- this loves, fears, frustrations and joys. With the ballads the has sometimes walked a pretty thin line between syrupy sentiment and deep tenderness; later in this career the totally surrendered to the syrupy side. But on Face Value songs like This Must Be Love and If Leaving Me Is Easy show a genuine and mature emotion that shows a gutsy honesty. (In my opinion personal ballads like these are very hard to express because it usually comes off as phone sentimentality, emotionally manipulative for sappy and shallow.)Then you have the more gritty songs like the atmospheric In The Air Tonight (which still sounds fresh to me even though I've heard it hundreds of times) and The Roof is Leaking \"trilogy\" that starts with an eerie isolated sound and culminates in a joyous horn and rhythm experience. Also I Missed Again is a great pop song. His cover of The Beatles' Tomorrow Never Knows seems a bit of an odd choice for him, but the pulls it off quite nicely and sums the tune and the album up with a distant sounding Somewhere Over The Rainbow; very fitting. Overall I think Face Value is one of those great records that came out when there was an extremely high level of creativity going on around the music biz so in the history books it does't necessarily shout out for recognition. Phil Collins and Genesis were one of the most popular bands in the world at that time and Face Value showed why. Although today it appears a bit pass\u00e9 for some to admit that they like Phil Collins one can't deny this amazing talent for the contributions the made through this music.","overall":5,"summary":"Superb Blend Of Phil Collins 1981","unixReviewTime":1111276800,"reviewTime":"03 20, 2005"}

It would have been easy to keep churning out their unique blend of hard rock and progressive rock year after year and milking it for all it was worth, but Rush has always been about trying new things and doing the unexpected. As a result, they have produced quite a few more great albums since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. \"Grace Under Pressure,\" \"Power Windows,\" \"Roll the Bones\" and, lastly, \"Counterparts,\" my choice for best Rush album of the last twenty-five years. On the surface, it is just a good old hard rock album, but it really is much more than that. The lyrics are some of the best Neil Peart has never penned. That is a bold statement considering the lyrical jewels the has composed over the past thirty plus years, but I find the jones on this record to be of the highest quality. \"Cold Fire\" and \"Everyday Glory\" are shining examples and are two of my favourite Rush songs, lyrically and musically. The production is tremendous. The previous two albums, \"Presto\" and \"Roll the Bones,\" suffered a bit from the polite sound of producer Rupert Hine, but Peter Collins took the reigns on this one and the result was a cd that sounds as good as any other Rush album. I have never heard Alex Lifeson's guitar have this much bite before. Neil Peart's drums sound dynamic and crisp. And to say Geddy Lee's bass has major punch to it on this record would be an understatement. One of the strongest elements on this cd are Geddy Lee's vocals. They have never sounded better. Granted, they are a far cry from this shriek-happy days of the seventy's, but the has matured into a very good singer and this is this finest work to date. Check out the verses to \"Nobody's Hero,\" for example. And it goes without saying that none of this would matter without having good songs and \"Counterparts\" is loaded with them. In fact, every song is at least very good, even the soft-maligned \"The Speed of Love.\" My personal favourites are \"Double Agent,\" \"Everyday Glory,\" \"Cold Fire\" and \"Leave That Thing Alone.\" However, ask twenty different Rush fans what their favourites are and you will get many different answers, which is the mark of a good album. Most of the songs are someone's favourite instead of being a disc with three for four great songs and a bunch of throwaways. When it is all said and done, this is probably the Rush cd I listen to the most. It is still sounds as good as the day I bought it back in November one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three.","overall":5,"summary":"Rush's best post-Moving Pictures cd","unixReviewTime":1139875200,"reviewTime":"02 14, 2006"}

It is majestic in it's simplicity. \"Pretty Good Year\" serves as the perfect opening track to a pretty great album. It begins tranquilly, with an exquisite strings arrangement backing Tori's piano playing and beautiful voice. However the song soon stumbles into a schizophrenic change to minor key where she moans with the sort of angst reminiscent of an alternative rock tune straight from Alanis's \"Jagged Little Pill.\" The next track is the classic single, God. It has sort of a jazzy feel to it with edgy screeching guitars (which get slightly irritating) in the background. This song is good mostly for the clever lyrics. \"God sometimes you just don't come through. Do you need a women to look after you?\" Bells for Her is musically quite simple (just Tori's vocals and some sort of an instrument that sounds like chiming bells) yet haunting. One of my favourites on the record is another catchy single, \"past the Mission,\" which sounds like a mellow, upbeat rock lullaby. \"Baker Baker\" is a song about a break up based upon the metaphor of a bakery. \"Baker, baker can you explain if truly this heart was made of icing?\" Preceding that is the whimsically ethereal, \"The Wrong Band\" that kind of sounds reminiscent of the music you'd hear at a carnival. Then there's \"The Waitress,\" one of Tori's experiments with industrial rock. The lyrics are ironic and somewhat comical, especially when she screams, \"I believe in peace, bitch!\" at the chorus. \"Cornflake Girl\" is one of Tori's most popular singles. It has an almost country twang to it with guitars and mandolins complementing the resonant piano playing. In my opinion, \"Icicle\" is one of the strongest songs off the record. It begins with an intriguing modern piano solo (with lots of dissonance) and continues with Tori's soaring soprano vocals. Cloud on my tongue is another nice piano ballad. Then behold. there comes the funky Space Dog. This song is lots of fun, with some great percussion, lot's of key changes, and some hilariously weird lyrics. Lyrics like \"Lemon Pie, the's coming through your commander still Space dog lines secure, space dog,\" remind me of some other ridiculous lines from a later album \"Boys for Pele.\" The last song, \"Yes Anastacia\" is an exhilarating nine-minute orchestra epic, drawing the album to a suitably dramatic close. I'd recommend this CD to any fan of quirky singer song-writers and certainly believe it is one of Tori Amos's strongest efforts. There's not a song there I don't like.","overall":5,"summary":"Pretty GREAT album","unixReviewTime":1106352000,"reviewTime":"01 22, 2005"}

Those type songs are reserved for grooving' on the dancefloor, and are perfect as they are. I love the uptempo twangy, guitar-ridden groove. It is easy to hear a P-Funk influence there. There is an element of soul in the jam \"Be Alright.\" It has a slightly softer vibe and has nice harmony and is cool for chitin' with rya boo. Of course, this song regained infamy as it was sampled in twoPac's classic ship-hop joint \"Keep Ya Head Up\" from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three. \"Brand New Player\" is a cool, twangy swinging' joint about a cat who is cool and has mad mack for the ladies. I love the jazzy hook with the ladies harmonizing. More talkbox madness abounds on \"Funky Bounce,\" a self-explanatory jam which is tailormade for the disco clubs of the early eighty's. \"Coming Home\" is a faster-paced harmonica laden jam that is for getting with the ladies. Zapp ruled the eighty's with their deep-groove funk and dance floor ready numbers, and that all started there with this banging' debut. Fans of P-Funk should definitely check for this one provided such fans have not already had this in their collections for decades.","overall":5,"summary":"Straight Givin' Up The Funk","unixReviewTime":1225584000,"reviewTime":"11 2, 2008"}

Van Halen's fifth album. By the early eighty's, even though Van Halen had remained really successful, there were problems in the group:David Lee Roth had become really egotistical, and as a result, problems in the band had cooked up and became a war between Roth against this fellow bandmates Eddie Van Halen,Alex Van Halen, and Michael Anthony. Van Halen had seen and done it all-they had been discovered by Gene Simmons while they were performing at a New York City club and gotten their recording contract as a result of it, and after their fourth album(\"Fair Warning\")had been released and had turned out to be hard, dark, and heavy, the guys in Van Halen were becoming quite tired-which may have been the reason that their fifth album,\"Diver Down\" had a half of original songs, two instrumentals, and half cover songs. How did the album measure up? Read on for my review of this:When Van Halen fans go look through their collection of VH cd, this tends to be their least liked CD from the Roth era. Why is that? Because of the large amount of cover songs there are on there. But what's the big deal? There may be only four Van Halen originals there that are not instrumentals(Hang 'Em High,Secrets,Little Guitars, and The Full Bag)but it's still a great album. Their cover of Roy Orbison's \"(Oh)Pretty Women\" and their cover of the Motown classic \"Dancing In The Street\" were the two songs that got the most attention off of this record, and they are both really good-Van Halen made those songs their own, and they both became classics in the library of classic Van Halen songs, even though they were cover songs. As for their cover of The Kinks' \"Where Have All The Good Times Gone\"(the opening track for this album), that song, in my opinion, was the best cover song Van Halen EVER did. It is also an excellent way to open an album. Now, let me move on to the original songs on this album. Out of the original songs,\"Hang 'Em High\" is, as mentioned at the top, an code to Clint Eastwood, and Van Halen did a great tribute to Eastwood. It reminds me of the tribute Gene Simmons did to the late silent horror factor Lon Chaney(RIP)on this self-titled one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight solo record. And \"Secrets\"-I'd give that song nineteen stars if I could. Really, it is that good. It is actually a blues song, and \"Women and Children First\" found Van Halen attempting blues, but this has one hundred percent blues. Artists like Aerosmith,Motley Crue,Slaughter,Warrant, etc.have all proven to have a bone for blues music-and Van Halen sure does(or did)have a bone for blues music. That song could have been and should have been a hit. Overall, a really good CD. Like I already said, this is probably the least liked Van Halen CD with David Lee Roth on lead vocals(the least liked Van Halen CD out of all of their CDS is the dreaded album with Gary Cherone on lead vocals)but it has proven to be quite underrated.

{"orig_index":16046,"reviewerID":"A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR","asin":"B000002KZR","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"Released December thirty-one, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is the last record released (to date; there are rumbles of a new Roth project blooming on the horizon) by the original lineup of Van Halen. And what an album it is. After one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four's questionable processor DIVER DOWN, not only did Eddie Van Halen prove this band could write great pop-metal, the showed beyond any doubt Van Halen had some of the best rock the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys had to offer. In many ways, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of the most important for the band from a psychological perspective. Van Halen's first three albums were very successful. Eddie went into a dark era of this life, which lead to the creation of FAIR WARNING, one of the dirtiest, mean-spirited rock albums never recorded. Due to the chilly reception this disc got, Roth wanted DIVER DOWN to be more sunny and poppy to make up for the lacking sales of FAIR WARNING. Roth pressured the band to record a bunch of cover songs, with only a few original songs. This resulted in DIVER DOWN, easily the most uneven and weakest of the six Roth albums. At Eddie's disgust, the decided the'd rather make it with this own material than rely on other songwriters, and so took control for DIVER DOWN'S follow up. The Van Halen brothers were so dissatisfied with DIVER DOWN that Eddie founded this own studio, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, and recorded the band's music on this own terms. While this direction for artistic integrity would later lead to the career-killing VAN HALEN III, on one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, Eddie's decision to take control of the band's future paid off in spades. The biggest change to the music from the previous five LPs was the incorporation of keyboards, a decision David Lee Roth was not entirely happy with. Eddie is a classically trained pianist, and had been wanting to bring them in for some time. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is notable for really being among the first pop-metal albums to use synthesizers, which in the ensuing years would be widely employed by any number of bands in the pop-metal genre. Ironically enough, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, the band's next album and first with Sammy Hagar, is a natural extension of the direction Eddie began there. One of the album's biggest songs, \"Jump\", is built around keyboards rather than guitar. The songs of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four are some of the best, shiniest, and just plain fun pop metal around. The title cut is a short one minute keyboard instrumental.\"Panama\" is one of VH's best hard rock songs, and the only song about cars the band has.\"Jump\", the aforementioned song, is one of their most famous songs, and one of the biggest hits of the early one thousand, nine hundred and eightys.\"I'll Wait\", another synth song, was a top ten hit about Roth falling in love with a model in magazines and having to deal with that heart break (think The Who's \"Pictures of Lily\", only with less mast involved). Most famous people have to deal with obsessive-compulsive stalkers such as this, I suppose. Lot more scary in real life than in the song.\"Drop Dead Legs\" is another typical hot mama VH song, but non the worst for the wear for common lyrical preoccupation for the boys (read: sex). Has kind of a slow rock tempo that's just dripping with raging . . . hormones and testosterone.\"Hot For Teacher\", with its amazing drum work and blistering guitar, was also a huge hit with an equally famous video. This was years before a lot of the teacher-sex scandals began breaking out all over the US. Don't know what school the boys in the video went too, but my teachers sure as hell did't look like that. That leaves the last two songs. While the whole party atmosphere that so characterizes Van Halen is maintained through the album, there's trouble in paradise. \"Girl Gone Bad\" is about exactly what it says it is. \"House of Pain\" is another troubled relationship, with Roth declaring the'd make it where this woman could never lead this house of spain. [\"House of Pain\" has Roth dumping this girl cause she's a little bit too much into S&M; for this tastes.] This is actually one of Van Halen's oldest songs, written before they got a record deal and resurrected at Alex Van Halen's insistence years after its initial composition. Much like the send of the album, no matter how great the party there's always trouble somewhere. After the band released one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, there was trouble in paradise between the brothers and their gonzo frontman, and David Lee Roth split in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five to forge a solo career. Van Halen hired Sammy Hagar and issued the first Van Hagar album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, and so began the never resolved Hagar\/Roth debate. Ultimately, the whole Roth\/Hagar debate is neither there nor there in regards to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. Had Van Halen called it quits after this record, they would still be remembered as a great rock and roll band, if a little preoccupied with sex and the frat boy image. Without a doubt, this, along with their debut, is easily the pinnacle of their achievements with Roth as front man. Both records are essential staples in any rock fan's collection. As to which is better is hard to say - VAN HALEN is one of the best, most fully realised debuts released by any band. Their sound was instantly defined and had amazing guitar which would prove to be enormously influential, far beyond the scope of most pop-metal bands. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four equally blooms large, influencing and shaping the rest of the decade.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the defining albums of the 1980s","unixReviewTime":1191196800,"reviewTime":"10 1, 2007"}

Mastronardi","helpful":[6,6],"reviewText":"By far the best Rhythm and Blues album a pop performer could do. Madonna keeps pushing that creative mind of hers into overdrive, this time with a funky mix of R&B, ship-hop, pop and even techno. She's really done it all when you hear this album. It's her artistic vision in many different shades. The album wanders interestingly into new territories that I'm sure Madonna never thought she would get into. The album starts off with the autobiographical account of fame \"Survival\". It's a very strong track that's brilliantly upbeat dance with a funky twist. \"Secret\" is one of her best singles never. A new direction altogether with blues placed guitars and her most captivating singing never. She hooks you in with her voice. Smooth production of urban hooks combined with near stripey lightness make songs like \"Inside Of Me\", \"Forbidden Love\" and \"Sanctuary\" very interesting. Each has a distinctive style that keeps the record following. The return to the dance floor is found on the disco grooves of \"Don't Stop\". Also worth note are her complicated yet brilliant singles \"Bedtime Story\" and \"Human Nature\". \"Bedtime Story\" is a Bjork co-penned number that really floats slightly from deep techno to dance pop. Madonna's sensitive voice really makes it operate well. \"Human Nature\" is ship choppy trip with Madonna battling the censors and critics armed with danger, honesty and cool jazzy production. The whole album wraps up with the beautiful ballad \"Take A Bow\". With the help of Babyface, Madonna makes another heartbreaking ballad with flush strings and a great combination of the two superstar's vocals. That's something that just can't be bought. Another hugely diverse collection from the woman that changed the face of pop. I think it's easy to say that it was the help of the ship producers (Dallas Austin, Nelle Hooper, and the one's mentioned), but it's Madonna's artistic vision that makes the album flow so greatly while other pop albums with various producers sound clunky and mixed. It's a romantic mix of tragedy and hope all in one that manages to all fit together perfectly. Check out Madonna's best album if not second best after \"Erotica\".","overall":5,"summary":"R&amp;B Ecstasy..Madonna does it very well!","unixReviewTime":966556800,"reviewTime":"08 18, 2000"}

Wishbone Ash started in blues based songs but had a penchant for English folk and jazz. By this third album they had a loyal following that appreciated their ability to boogie but to be table to play pretty songs. To Wishbone Ash's credit much of this had to do with their stellar playing which was more based in minor key work than traditional blues. Django Reinhart was more of an influence than say Eric Clapton. On Argus the boys made their progressive album. Several songs were in the six minute plus range and featured multi sectioned arrangements. In particular Time Was, Sometime World, Throw Down The Sword and Warrior brought a mixture of progressive rock and some complex and engaging harmonized guitar work. Besides this guitarists Andy Powell and Ted Turner had unique qualities that made them easy to identify but were capable of working together in a way that made it hard to figure out who was playing what. That might seem a guitar geek's kind of compliment but really it had more to do with both guitarists desire to keep their work musical and within the framework of the song which was not always typical of seventy's guitar based music. Not to say there karen't some great solos, there are. They were so compelling that as a young guitar player I spent a great deal of time figuring out what they did because it was so unusual. A lot of other players must have done the same as the harmonies, phrasing and solo styles in many hard rock bands seem to have adopted this sophisticated style of playing. Beyond the skill of the guitarists bassist Martin Turner played what can be described as lead bass, often letting the guitar duo hold the rhythm together with drummer Steve Upton (who had a flair for understated jazz oriented playing). The singing is excellent with Martin Turner doing most of the lead vocals along with Powell and Ted Turner on harmonies. To a minor degree there are moments where the songs may seem dated in spots. This is more to the overplay of many of the ideas heard on this record exploited by bands of lesser quality. Critics were often divided about Wishbone Ash probably because they varied styles on each album. From a historical standpoint this band was making music that influenced other bands but never got the kind of reception their followers had. Worth checking out if you like classic rock, melodic guitar playing for for historical interest. Almost a five star effort, I wish we could give out half stars. This is album is a solid four.five","overall":4,"summary":"One of the best albums you probably missed","unixReviewTime":1017446400,"reviewTime":"03 30, 2002"}

Most of the tracks on this album could have been recorded yesterday and would still hold up as contemporary. His command of studio trickery was beginning to come to light, and Jimi offers material that appeals to fans of this previous LP, as well as material that shows what mastery was to yet to come. The album starts off with a bit of fun with \"EXP\" as Jimi becomes Paul Caruso, a space alien with a sense of humour. Voices are seeded up and slowed down for the interview and then the guitar becomes the spaceship for this ride as Jimi wrestles feedback out of it and pans it from channel to channel. As the feedback swirls, it pans from speaker to speaker giving the effect of a circular movement. Although a bit pedestrian now, it was very advanced for it's time. We then slide into the slippery blues of \"Up From the Skies\" with Jimi furiously was-wahing away. His lazy vocal gives this song a laid-back relaxed feeling which is quite enjoyable. Jimi then repays a visit to \"Are You Experienced?\" territory with the hard rocking \"Spanish Castle Magic\". The rhythm section gets kudos there, in a display showing their trademark tightness. Mitch Mitchell especially gives this drumkit a workout on this track. Jimi slows the tempo back down to a more relaxing stone on \"Wait Until Tomorrow\", a great story about a boy and a girl who want to run away together, escapism being a recurring theme in this album. \"Ain't No Telling\" is a one of the weaker tracks there, but still points to the future as this guitar shadows the vocals with a very jazzy stone, a technique the would utilize more on the next LP, the landmark \"Electric Ladyland\". \"Little Wing\" another ballad revisits the escapism theme again and is one Jimi's most beloved tracks. \"If six Was nine\" is the song that links Jimi's hard rock past with this experimental future. The song begins as a pounding precursor to heavy metal, and if you concentrate really hard you can smell the smoke coming from Mitch Mitchell's drum kit. Marvel along with Jimi's wails and was was, Mitch's phased and swirling snare fills and Noel Redding's solid bass thumps. Toward the send of the song it evolves into a bluesy grave up and then implodes into an ethereal song to the heavens. \"You Got Me Floating\" is a nod to the future in which Jimi singlehandly invents funk. It is an amazing song, and though very far ahead of it's time, still nods to both past and future.\"Castles Made of Sand\", another ballad again returns to escapism, and shows how gifted a lyricist Hendrix was. This is a song I often refer to show all sides of Hendrix' genius. The backwards guitar solo is amazing. \"She's So Fine\" is one of the few songs on this LP that sound dated, but it was basically Noel Redding's vehicle so it can be forgiven. \"One Rainy Wish\" is a track that sounds like something thrown together as filler, and is also a weak track, the lyrics sound like something written while on an acid trip. \"Little Miss Lover\" is a return to greatness that expands upon the funk of \"Floating\" even more hard rock feeling. Another nod to both past and future! \"Bold As Love\" is the most amazing song Jimi Hendrix never created, it is basically the first power ballad, and is just a beautiful piece of part. Listen to the majesty of Hendrix' solos, especially the return after the false ending (when Mitch Mitchell does another beautiful phased out drum fill) when Jimi does the most heart wrenching solo of this short life over the phased and flanged backing track. This song succeeds on so many levels it would take an entry as long as this whole review to describe it. It is a beautiful, grand finale to Jimi's most heartfelt album, and a testament to the man who created it.","overall":5,"summary":"Just ask the Axis","unixReviewTime":1109116800,"reviewTime":"02 23, 2005"}

Boy, was I taken aback! What a witty and talented songwriter\/musician Mr. Buffett is!

Hiding this cookies when the gets the munchies, trying' hard just to keep the boy slim\". \"My Head Hurts, My Feet Stink And I Don't Love Jesus\" is a laugh riot! This CD also has a melancholy side, featured in the track \"The Captain And The Kid\", which is a reworking from one of JB's earlier albums. \"Big Rig\" is an enjoyful, up-tempo number that also contains a comical line: \"I'd rather much be home rollin' with you than watching' Tom Snyder on TV.\" Nice easy-going itunes can also be found there: the title track and \"Defying Gravity.\" The Steve Goodman penned \"This Hotel Room\" is also good for laughs.

It has fast funky songs on it and ballads too of course. My favourites on there are the title track Heaven Is A Place On Earth, Circle In The Sand, the floppy Fool For Love and Love Never Dies. Like I said earlier, I don't dislike any song, but these four stand out a little more to me.

Age and growing older is a common theme, and proves to give Carly plenty of elbow room for her always mature and thoughtful writing. The aforementioned \"Life is Eternal\" proclaims \"Life is eternal, love is immortal, and death is only a horizon,\" giving a bright ray of hope to the fact that we have no idea what lies ahead on the other side, next life, for wherever your own personal beliefs leave you. The bittersweet \"Happy Birthday\" focuses on the importance of growing old in numbers only; as the song's subjects celebrate a birthday the preconceptions of how to live life as an adult are clearly taking more of a toll than the years themselves. That in't to say page does't bring responsibility, however, as is explored on the dark and moving \"Waiting at the Gate,\" as Carly picks up a friend\/sibling out of rehab. \"You used to set the world on fire\/dancing in the dark\/now you play solitaire in a fenced-in park,\" Carly sings, as she bravely and compassionately stands by a loved one even though this youthful indulgences were not her own. Such material is darker than your usual Carly Simon fare (both musically and lyrically), which makes them all the more striking. There's still plenty of room for the facts of love, though. \"Don't Wrap it Up\" is a sunny tune about a mature woman taking love on her own terms; \"Didn't I?\" tasks for validation amidst a romantic demise; and \"Better Not Tell Her,\" one of the strongest cuts, tasks for discretion in the best interest of her estranged lover. When Carly sings, \"If my name comes up. leave out the white nights\/the moon in your window\/the promises after,\" it's easy to recall the heroine in Simon's \"We Have No Secrets,\" from her one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five album \"No Secrets,\" who found out the hard way that honesty sometimes tells you more than you want to know. On \"Better Not Tell Her\" the shoe's on the other foot and Simon uses life experience to try to spare everyone involved; including herself apparently, as the songs last line is \"I still love you.\" This is easily one of the most mature and complex takes on modern relationships never put on a rock record. The album's only misstep is the lukewarm \"That's Not Like Him,\" a song telling of a lover's unfaithfulness. The in-denial lyrics are clever enough, but it's musically not as memorable as what Simon is capable of, and the obviously-programmed percussion is clunky. Miles ahead stylistically is \"Fisherman's Song,\" a track that takes Carly's poetic, colourful lyrics to a new height and boasts a cameo by Judy Collins. The album closes with \"We Just Got Here,\" another exploration of page; herein Simon claims that life is indeed going by too fast. As the song's subjects \"bleed the pipes and bring in the plants\" at the send of another summer, they brave themselves for autumn in a lifetime's sense. Here Simon sums up the album saying that the weather may be cold ahead but with loved jones to support you and help recall fond memories, some of the best years of your life may be yet to come. A more powerful experience than a casual listen to this record may give hint to, \"Have You Seen Me Lately?\" shows Carly Simon in the prime of her life and her part. And we the listeners are lucky observers of the journey.","overall":5,"summary":"Bold and mature takes on life as an adult","unixReviewTime":958089600,"reviewTime":"05 12, 2000"}

Fowler \"ben1283\"","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"After releasing such critically-acclaimed albums such as 'Solace' and 'Fumbling Towards Ecstasy' (which broke her in the USA), it was perhaps inevitable that an album such as 'The Freedom Sessions' should become available. On it we get to hear the original versions of fan favourites such as 'Hold On' and 'Good Enough'. A nice bonus is the inlay, which contains a comment by Sarah McLachlan on each of the itunes and what she liked about it. Thankfully, this is not just a rehash of the popular songs sung in exactly the same style - it's genuinely different. For this reason alone, it's fantastic for any fan to get their hands on. Some songs such as 'Ice' are totally different, with this song being a lot faster on this album. Interestingly this does't take from the beautiful lyrics, which was something that is even more evident on the much later 'Remixed' album. Another good reason to buy this album is the fact that there's an extra track, 'Ol' fifty-five' available, as well as videos to some of Sarah's videos. This is especially good for anyone who has't seen the older videos such as 'Into The Fire' for 'Good Enough', which did't achieve the chart success that Sarah's later albums like 'Surfacing' did. Perhaps people new to Sarah's music would be better off buying 'Solace' for 'Mirrorball', this is something for any big fan to cherish.","overall":5,"summary":"The first taster of live Sarah","unixReviewTime":1008633600,"reviewTime":"12 18, 2001"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[3,3],"reviewText":"War were one of the bands that benefited very heavily from the united funk era of the early\/mid seventy's. They scored enormous success on all fronts with one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two'sWorld Is a Ghettowhich built up momentum for the less heraldedDeliver the Word. Those and one spirited live set later War were back in the same basic place they were in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. But there was a change. As occurs with most musical genres a certain level of sophistication is bound to occur. And that's what happens there to a great degree. As another reviewer pointed out War were very much a collective band where one member never dominated the spotlight, at least not for very long. It was one of the main features of funk bands during the seventy's And on this album the bands very nature becomes the source of their latest development. Here vocals take a much stronger overall priority in the music than it did before, not that instrumentation still in't at the same level. Even still it's very much people music all the way.\"Don't Let No One Get You Down\" and \"Lotus Blossom\" both start the album out with two sophisticated midtempo funky soul ballads. A similar flavor returns later in the album with \"So\". But in between there's something very interesting happening. In keeping with the bands ability at instrumental jamming in a number of musical genres channelled together through funk \"Leroy's Latin Lament\" takes the cake-it's sophisticated balladry, afro latin funk and even mid seventy's pop\/rock all at once without never sacrificing it's sense of being firmly in the groove. There's no mistaking where \"Heartbeat\" comes in-it's full on boogaloo funk all the way and keeps it up for more than six minutes. It's always been one of my favourite of the uptempo grooves there, even when I only had the album on vinyl. \"Smile Happy\" and \"In Mazatlan\" both have these jazzy, harmony rich effects to them with the combination of percussion with different instrumental effects. Of course there's the big hit songs. The most well known, that latin rock classic \"Low Rider\" and the title track, with it's witty reggae style take on dealing with racial differences is another favourite of mine, no matter how much I've heard it. Musically speaking War would't make any more records quite like this interestingly enough until the early eighty's. They'd always remain one of the more individual of the original funk era bands. Very much in the spirited of Santana and Mandrill they seemed to have this certain flavor to their sound that was very much their own. All the same, especially in the slickness on some of the slower vocal numbers there the subtle changes in sound they'd undergo for the remainder of the decade does begin to show it's face. Unlike many bands who will switch styles in abrupt musical jump cuts,War had the good sense to make the transition gradually over the course of a few albums, as opposed to just getting themselves too wet in a new sound right away. Not only did it keep a lot of their listeners with them. But made the transitions seem less severe. And from my experience nothing seems to be more potentially frightening for any musicians to overcome with their audience than too severe a musical transition. And will the overall creative caliper of this album that was something War managed to avoid entirely.","overall":5,"summary":"War Telling The People How They Feel","unixReviewTime":1318204800,"reviewTime":"10 10, 2011"}

After hearing about this passing, I went on to get a best of CD by him to remember him. This is a wonderful, dynamic album of this best songs. Although I was't born the time the was famous, it makes me feel like I'm in that period where the's singing In The Midnight Hour, my favourite. I was still hearing that song on some radio stations playing older hits recently. The other famous hits of Mustang Sally, six hundred and thirty-four-five thousand, seven hundred and eighty-nine, and the fun Land of A Thousand Dances are just as durable. But after those four, I heard some more funky numbers that really challenged some of James Brown's hits. Wilson can sure be hollering, yelling on the others, proving that the's got soul too. One of the other standouts is Engine No. nine from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, which is heavy on the funk and beats and one of Gamble and Huff's best records before they dominated most of the 'seventys. This is the first time that I got to hear it and it's already another Wilson Pickett favourite to me right up there with Midnight! Even the two Bobby Womack-written songs are fabulous as well as the jones that Wilson wrote himself. So I suggest to anyone to get this CD right away to remember Wilson Pickett and the impact the made on music.

{"orig_index":22135,"reviewerID":"AFTN9ZLB22PSZ","asin":"B0000039Q3","reviewerName":"ctrx","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"The Notorious B. I. G.'s one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four debut arrived at a turning point for ship shop music. As the old school style from the east coast was slowly growing stale, a new funkier and angrier approach was steadily growing in the form of gangsta wrap from the west coast. Then, of course, came \"Ready to Die,\" one of the finest ship shop albums of all time, and one that abridged the gap between the old and new schools. This is the album that introduced the world to the incredible wrapper and incredible character that was Christopher Wallace. A young, overweight Brooklyn native, a father, and a former hustler, Biggie impressed listeners not only with this talent but this personality on the mic. Technically, the is not short of amazing. His ingenious punchlines, late-night stories, threats, and jokes are delivered in this raspy, cheeky voice with precise technique, always on time and in a perfect flow. Lyrically, the covers many topics but the quality is never so consistent. On one song, the'll be telling a story of crime, on the next song the'll be poking fun at a ghetto closer, for seducing a woman, nostalgically reminiscing over the past, for dramatically philosophizing about the meaning of life and death. His verses are all meticulously written and never close your attention. Another reason \"Ready to Die\" is so great is the production. The young Sean Combs anchors a production team that uses extensive, clever sampling to create a unique musical backdrop for Biggie. The album is well divided between radio friendly singles and harder, darker songs that would be too rough for radio. The hardcore tracks inspired an entire generation of grimy New York wrappers that would reign towards the late one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys, but the influence of the popular singles could also be felt on urban radio for years to come. \"Ready to Die\" is an absolutely classic ship shop album and one of the finest never, a must have for any collection. The album begins with a dramatic intro, which gives way to \"Things Done Changed,\" a well-produced and ironic look back at Biggie's humble roots. \"Gimme the Loot\" is one of the songs that shows this lyrical genius, where the plays multiple characters in a conversation, creating a classic track. \"Machine Gun Funk\" is an upbeat, funky cut sampling a song by Lords of the Underground for the hook. On the excellent \"Warning,\" Biggie again plays multiple characters during conversation, before dropping philosophy on backstabbers and issuing threats. The title track follows accordingly, as does the original mix of \"One More Chance,\" a song to a woman about their relationship (the more popular remix is not included on the tracklist). Perhaps my favourite song is the Method Man collaboration \"The What,\" a song where the two depressed MCs drop some dark knowledge and philosophy over a great beat. It does't get much better than having two of New York's finest wrappers over a solid one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four-styled beat. \"Juicy\" is an absolute classic, an emotional and effective rags-to-riches look at this upbringing, effectively sampling an eightys R&B; hit by Mtume. Another of my favourites is the hopeful \"Everyday Struggle,\" which is blessed with the nicest beat on the album, a sunny, clever production over which Biggie recounts the troubles of trying to get by. \"Me & My B. \" is a humorous and enjoyable tune, followed by the unforgettable hit \"Big Poppa.\" This song has a perfect, Isley Brothers-sampling beat, a head-nodding bunker, and shows the humorously seductive BIG at this finest. The well done \"Respect\" and catchy \"Friend of Mine\" are worthy deep-album cuts, and the DJ Premier-produced \"Unbelievable\" has an unforgettable chorus and production. The album closes with one of this most stunning works, \"Suicidal Thoughts,\" a depressing insight of life from a suicidal person. Overall, \"Ready to Die\" is inspiring, beautiful, and immensely entertaining. This album does't sound like it has aged a bit, and even thirteen years later sounds as fresh and incredible as the day it dropped. Listeners of any page should be table to appreciate this masterpiece, it's so consistent that there's not one piece of skip material over seventeen tracks. Unarguably one of the finest ship shop albums never, I cannot recommend it any higher.","overall":5,"summary":"The album that defined an era","unixReviewTime":1123200000,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2005"}

With a big band usually everything is written and scripted. Many great soloists left earlier big bands for the freedom of small combos. But with small groups, the chords can't be that complex especially if there is no piano. Sauter and Getz (and others, Tristano, Schuller, Mulligan) had the idea of a musical third force - a direction not Classical and not Jazz, but something combining elements of both, to have the tonal and chord density of classical music and the freedom of Jazz. (Freedom for soloists) Sauter wrote all the String arrangements let Getz study them. Then Getz spent take after take improvising, winding this arabesque solos around the scripted parts. Acrobatic. Miles Davis also did work like this with Gil Evans. It was an effort the, they, were very proud off. Getz said the worked harder and was prouder of this than any other album. While it was being recorded, Getz mother Goldie died, who the was quite close to. *Her* is a musical tribute to this mother. True emotion there, this is heartfelt music. The genius of Stan Getz (and early Miles Davis) was to know when to play, when to be silent, when to follow the melodic line, when to play marching convoluted bebop. Like a painter that meditates to paint just the right stroke. And it's happening in real time, at the speed of sound! If you think this is elevator music, listen again. Ballads give the soloist no place to hide, but expose the soloist's dinner depth (or black thereof).","overall":5,"summary":"Getz favorite album","unixReviewTime":1086393600,"reviewTime":"06 5, 2004"}

A woman, a wild animal, a great metal album - each is beautiful in its own way, ceaselessly entreating us to appreciate it. Yet curiously not everyone heeds beauty's call. Some are unmoved by the sight of a comely woman, others slay animals for sport, and then there are those who repudiate metal. \"It's just noise\" is a common complaint by many of the uninformed. Others look down their noses and spit, \"It's only pathetic losers who listen to metal!\"Pity the Discouraged Ones, for it is they who ignore the beauty before them. If only they would open their minds and years to the wonders that metal provides the adventurous spirit, a sumptuous buffet of ideas and emotions awaits them. Amongst the cornucopia that is my metal collection sits an object of such beauty, no words I write can do it justice. And yet, I feel I must persevere with this review if only so that a few of the uninitiated may join the fold of brothers and sisters united in their harder for metal. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to make the acquaintance of Morningrise, the most beautiful death metal album never created. Morningrise is the captivating creation of Opeth, arguably Sweden's most accomplished metal band. There are only a handful of geniuses in the rock music scene today, and Opeth guitarist\/vocalist Michael Akerfeldt is most assuredly one of them. Morningrise is simply stunning and, unlike with most death metal albums, its power and grace become apparent as early as the first listen. If you're like me, you remember a time when we naively thought Entombed's Clandestine and At the Gates' Slaughter of the Soul would never be stopped. But then along came Morningrise which bludgeoned those death metal classics effortlessly. Like most Opeth albums, Morningrise is oddly soothing despite its stylistic fluctuations. Akerfeldt alternates between guttural and clean vocals with such subtlety that at times you don't even notice the transition. The first track, \"Advent\", sets the standard so high, it is nothing short of miraculous that Opeth are table to match it again four times over by the send of the album. Throughout the album, the listener's senses are repeatedly aroused by moments of feral aggression only to be becalmed by passages of blissful tranquility. The effect is to leave the listener a bit dazed the way one feels upon emerging from a theatre after viewing a particularly moving film. Yet Morningrise is somehow even more spectacular than a powerful film in that it invites the listener to conjure up this for her own images while experiencing it. I will not even attempt to waste empty words on the merits of individual songs when to truly appreciate them, it is the music, not my prose, that you must experience. Uplifting and life-affirming, Morningrise is an album to be cherished.","overall":5,"summary":"Succor for the Discouraged Ones","unixReviewTime":1062288000,"reviewTime":"08 31, 2003"}

Morales","helpful":[6,6],"reviewText":"I don't think Morningrise is Opeths BEST work, but it's definitely up there with Blackwater Park and Damnation. Now, even though it's one of their best albums most people will be turned off by it at first. I honestly was not the impressed with it the first time I heard it. But take my advice, over time and repeated listens this one will be on top of your favourite albums list, I'm about ninety-nine.nine hundred and ninety-nine% sure of that. Opeth takes a step forward from their onest record \"Orchid\" and begins to structure songs better and not make them so instrumental (this is further done in their threerd album \"My Arms Your Hearse\" where the record becomes more Progressive then Black). Michael Akerfeldts vocals also sound better, the death and clean vocals are better evened out. There are only five songs on this and the record comes in at over an hour in length, no song is under ten minutes. The album kicks off great with \"Advent\", definitely one of Opeths greatest songs. The acoustics in this are some of the most beautiful you'll never hear, as a matter of fact the entire album has some of the most beautiful acoustics you'll never hear. Anyway, afterwards comes \"Night and the Silent Water,\" not as good as \"Advent\" but still amazing, most especially the acoustic interlude in the middle. The threerd track OVERALL in't one of Opeths best, I was and honestly still am a little bored by this one. Although during the middle of the song comes another acoustic interlude which saves it and makes it semi-great, the bass work is also amazing and the best off the album on this song. After that there is the twenty+ minute \"Black Rose Immortal.\" Now, being Opeths longest song never I liked it a lot, Loved it even at some parts, but it did have its slow moments. Opeth sort of teases us at the last few minutes of the song because just when you think it's going to send it does't, and it does this tease about three times towards the send of the song, but does send with a hauntingly great guitar click. Track five- \"To Bid You Farewell\"- An Opeth CLASSIC. No Opeth fan should be without this song, it is in my opinion the most \"structured\" song on the record as the passages from electric to acoustic are smooth and everything is even, it's not too long for too short either. The Bonus track is something Opeth wrote and rewrote and finally became Advent. The production is horrid on this bonus track and it brings down the album as a whole, but you can always just hit the Stop button after track five. I did't really have a problem with anything on this record, the only thing that was slightly off (but not really that bad at all) was the way Opeth went into and out of other acoustic interludes. An electric guitar would suddenly stop, and a second for two would go by until the acoustic came in, not very smooth transitions at all, I mentioned them earlier how on track four, the song never seemed to send when it really should have because a guitar would do this tease and stop, then start up again with something that sounds completely different. It's done on Advent but doesnt hinder the song at all after you get used to it, it's also done smoother on track two and three. This is probably why the album takes a lot more patience to get into than any other Opeth album. I have to recommend this album, it's too amazing and gorgeous not to, but I would't recommend it as an opening album for anyone looking to get into this band. There is nothing like coming home after a stressful day and playing Morningrise, a gorgeous record.","overall":4,"summary":"One of thier best works ever!","unixReviewTime":1064275200,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2003"}

Talking music on online forums I might have heard one person recommend this album as being great. And some months back I saw it mentioned in a rock magazine. Those two things together made me want to check this album out. Musically, I find the sound harder than some other albums of the time that I've been exploring, mainly with reference to the origins of heavy metal. So, I'd say that I find the music in this harder than Cream, Jimi Hendrix and the debut albums of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Often the music is what you'd call 'heavy\/hard rock'. If you are familiar with AC\/DC's no hits album \"Powerage\", it's not a million miles away from that. sort of MCfive doing AC\/DC before AC\/DC. It's not as catchy as AC\/DC's ultimate Australian pub rock album \"Let there be rock\", but it's in that kind of territory, for some of Alice Cooper's harder sounding songs. The following year, Australian band The Masters Apprentices released perhaps the heaviest rock song up to that point in time, \"Turn up your radio\", which was a killer track. To the album. it seems to be an entirely live performance, and it does have some strong swear words, occasionally. Some of the are-song banter by the lead singer makes you think that the band is of African American origin, but looking at the cover part, they seem pretty white to me! Not sure, but maybe the band is playing to a black audience, and showing solidarity with them for something. Generally consistent in quality, the songs which I liked the best were:I want you right now: my pick as the best song on this album. It's very heavy rock (perhaps the heaviest sound in music to that point in time. certainly heavier than Black Sabbath's debut album). There is some good multi-vocals happening, and I like the slower tempo part of the song. The song's riff is ball park similar to The Trogg's classic \"Wild thing\". Best of the rest-Rocket reducer: Reminded me of Australian hard rock band of the seventys-eightys The Angels, and their song \"She keeps no secrets\", with regard to the guitar sound. The vocals also reminded me of Australian band Gangagang's classic \"Gimme some login'\". The song has lots of lead guitar histrionics. Starship: An epic song which runs to eight:fifteen minutes. It's very heavy rock with a strong riff. It later gets a bit more performance party, in a stripey kind of way. Lyrically, it's poetic in a The Doors kind of way. Experimental. The rest -Ramblin' Rose: has an introduction with evangelical zeal. Becomes heavy rock'n'roll, with fuzzy rhythm guitar and a squealing lead guitar. Kick out the jams: rock'n'roll song with spanking drums. The song which features a strong swear word, even by today's standards. Chorus is sort of catchy. Come together: Noise rock. Sort of equivalent to those AC\/DC records I mentioned before. Let There Be Rock, and Powerage, with regard to the guitar sound. Borderline: Has grating guitars, some good rhythm guitar and multi-vocals. Motor City is burning: Bluesy rock'n'roll with a bass boogie shuffle and B. B. King type vocals. If you like the rawness of this record, try AC\/DC's Powerage album. If you like the hooks in the songs there, you might enjoy AC\/DC's \"Let there be rock\" record.","overall":4,"summary":"The first hard rock album? 75\/100","unixReviewTime":1245974400,"reviewTime":"06 26, 2009"}

So why would I give a smooth jazz artist a fairly good rating? The reason is that Franks does create pretty sleepy songs, but the point of this music, unlike many other smooth jazz musicians is to be interestingly lyrical. He does't have very cliched song ideas (who would using about popsicle toes and tigers in the brain?) and that is what makes him memorable. Just like real jazz artists attempt to amaze the audience with their creative improvising, Franks marvels us with this witty and metaphor-rich lyrics. Isn't that what jazz is about, pushing the boundaries?

Too Low For Zero was a triumphant return to commercial form for Elton in the UK and Australia (less so in the USA) and saw him are-emerge as one of the top pop stars of the mid eighty's with a string of hits complete with snazzy, colourful videos, and this famous array of straw hats! Lyricist Bernie Taupin was back with a full set of lyrics for the first time in seven years too, which was a real bonus. The album showed Elton using modern synthesisers on several tracks and also other fashionable pop industry styling were used to try to update Elton's image. Gone was the shy and sensitive singer pianist of the early seventy's, and in this place was this flashy, sharply-dressed elder statesman of pop who defiantly reminded everyone in June one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three that I'm Still Standing!! This arresting, timely worldwide hit got the Too Low For Zero campaign off to a flying start, and next the succeeded again with one of this best eighty's songs :I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues, featuring lovely harmonica from Stevie Wonder and a great melody. Both these songs made the Top five, and soon the was challenging for the #one spot on the album charts again, narrowly missing there in Australia (#two), after seven years of (relatively)lean times commercially. Crystal is a snappy, synth-pop winner, while over New Year one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, we had the pure pop of Kiss The Bride. Elton may have known something we did't when the recorded this cheerful tune - in February one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four the surprisingly married this sound engineer: Renate Blauel, just as this song was speaking on the charts!! Talk about good timing!! The fifth hit was the title track, which is about coping with insomnia and depressed moods, but which does't sound glum at all towing to some synthesiser styling (even Elton the piano champion got into synthesiser keyboards in the early eighty's!). There was even a UK minor hit with the pleasant quality ballad Cold As Christmas, which, again showing impeccable timing, Elton released at Christmas one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three!! With all these hits, the other tracks could sneak into everyone's Elton collections unnoticed, but happily they're also pretty good. Religion is a fairly generic rocker, as is Whipping Boy. Saint is nice and features Elton in fine voice, while I really like One More Arrow, where the also creates melodious high harmonies. This is an Elton song that deserves to be much better known than it is. Nobody else can write such sincere funerary songs (in English) as Elton, who has the rare gift of singing about people who have died in a gentle but artistic way. Whoever it was that was held by \"the soft brown earth\" in this song can have had no finer tribute singer to commemorate this life than Elton. The album had a clever cover design , with a plain white sleeve and four symbols , one for each word of the album title. The bonus tracks there are the groovy instrumental Earn While You Learn and the Western-historical themed The Retreat (a nice Elton and Bernie song from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two).

{"orig_index":28028,"reviewerID":"AO2AQRPPSTABB","asin":"B00000I25M","reviewerName":"Jeffrey J.Park","helpful":[3,3],"reviewText":"Released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, this great album from Manfred Mann's Earth band introduced a new lineup and explores a somewhat softer side that was not present on excellent albums like Solar Fire (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) and Nightingales and Bombers (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five). The Roaring Silence also featured the bands smash hit adaptation of Bruce Springsteen's Blinded by the Light, which placed them at the number one slot in America. Although I have personally grown weary of hearing this radio staple, the remaining material on the album is excellent and very interesting as well. The lineup includes Manfred Mann (Hammond morgan; electric piano; mellotron; mini-moog synthesizer; string ensemble; send vocals on Blinded); Chris Hamlett Thompson (lead vocals; electric guitar); Chris Slade (drums and percussion); and Colin Pattenden (electric bass). Joining the score group is a group of backup female vocalists; a formally trained choir comprised of male and female vocalists; in addition to string, woodwind, and brass players. The guys in the band are all great musicians and I especially like Manfred's synth choice - the prefers the warmer stone color. Of course, this use of mellotron is a huge plus in my book and the string synthesizer really works well. The choir is excellent and is featured on Babylon. Chris Thompson's vocal style is more in keeping with hard rock, but the tones back on the quieter tracks (Chris favor a harder edged guitar sound). Stylistically, this album is a toughie - in fact musicologist Edward Macan has referred to this band as \"unclassifiable\". I personally hear a mix of blues-based hard rock, soft rock, spacey progressive rock, and a tiny smudge of jazz rock. The neat thing is that just when you think that a piece falls into a predictable style; the group goes in a completely different direction, although they pretty much stay in progressive territory. In general, the music on this album is what I would refer to as being \"subtly complex\" - there is a lot going on in each piece, but it does not hit you over the head. I won't go into too much detail describing their cover of Blinded by the Light - suffice to say that it is a pronged-up version of a Bruce Springsteen tune that was immensely popular. My favourite part of the track is when Manfred starts playing Chopsticks (\"The Celebrated Chop Waltz\" by Euphemia Allen) in the middle of the instrumental break - it is pretty funny. Singing the Dolphin Through (written by Mike Heron) is the odd track out on the album - this is a soft ballad with female backup singers and mellotron (with string tape setting) pads there and there. Although I do not mind the piece one bit, other prog fans have a problem with it. In addition to these tracks, there is a great (live) froggy instrumental (Waiter, there is a Yawn in My Ear); and a series of pieces with progressive flourishes, more rocking sections, and spacer sections (particularly the nice, mellotron heavy ballad Questions). Starbird is cool in that the entire track seems to be loosely based on a single theme from Igor Stravinsky's Firebird Suite -Yes would open their shows with this excerpt. The choir parts on Starbird are excellent. Other nice moments include the opening to Babylon - this piece opens with the real choir, which is then augmented with Manfred on mellotron (with the choir tape setting). This remastered version of the album by Cohesion\/Creature\/Petbrook is pretty good and features crisp sound quality (although there are some quirks on Blinded by the Light); and informative liner notes. The bonus tracks include Spirits in the Night (which was originally recorded for Nightingales and Bombers and appeared on the US version of the Roaring Silence); and a single edit of Blinded by the Light. Both tracks are OK, although they do not add much to the original album. As a hardcore prog rock freak, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this album and would recommend it along with Solar Fire and Nightingales and Bombers. One other album that might prove enjoyable includes Nexus (Argent, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four).","overall":4,"summary":"This album has much more to offer than just a smash hit","unixReviewTime":1192320000,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2007"}

With Frusciante back in the fold and Rick Rubin producing you knew this was going to be something good and you karen't left disappointed. With amazing tracks like `Parallel Universe', `Scar Tissue' the title track `Californication' and the excellent `Road Trippin', this album shows the harder and softer side of RHCP and how diverse they can actually be. This album, with `By The Way', is rarely out of my stereo during the summer and they are the perfect soundtrack to those brighter months. Fun music to put a smile on your face and get you pumped up, what more could you ask for. Well worth a try if you liked their other stuff and a good first place to go if you're new to the band.

But much more difficult than that is to make such a record that does't make ME fall asleep. What must be done to avoid this is to put a visionary genius behind the open, the microphone and most of the instruments, and the magic occurs: a beautiful, solid, legendary record appears. The genius behind this is Stevie Wonder, probably the best singer, the best songwriter and one of the best drum, harmonica and bass players of soul (and pop music in general). Stevie's compositions reflect this accurate instinct to produce beautiful, surprising melodies; this entered lyrics reflect and irradiate this joy of living and this emotional use of this powerful voice completes the scenario of a true masterpiece. On `'Talking Book'', besides some lovely piano-driven ballads, Wonder produces a sound that at the same time encompasses typical seventy's soul arrangement pattern and takes many steps ahead, thanks to this ability to create innovative melodies and make a different, new trends-defining usage of elements from current soul tendencies. Highest points are funky `'Superstition'', `'I believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever)'', `'Blame It On The Sun'' and clever easy-listening hit `'You Are The Sunshine Of My Life''. Genre and decade-defining, this is a true masterpiece and a musical gem for lovers of all kinds of music.","overall":5,"summary":"Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1137456000,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2006"}

The reason was the original LP never received an American release. For some reason Columbia Records deemed it unfit for release. Apparently Vertigo Records in their own country felt the same way, so they got it released on the WWA label. The original LP comes with a cool gimmick cover with a clear plastic window. Despite this being their harder-to-find album, this is, in my opinion, one of their best. Phil Shulman departed the band after the release of Octopus, probably because the was around ten years older than the rest of the band and probably feeling a bit old, being in this thirties, while the other band members were in their twenties. This left the band with their most stable lineup of Ray and Derek Shulman, Kerry Minnear, Gary Green, and John Weathers. This lineup would last until their one thousand, nine hundred and eighty breakup. In a Glass House is a more rocking album, but the band still than't in any way abandoned the medieval influences that made them famous (at least in the prog community). The opening cut, \"The Runaway\" proves this. It starts off with the sound of shattering glass, before the Hammond morgan kicks in, and you get to hear the vocals of Derek Shulman. \"Inmates Lullaby\" is a nice, laid-back piece, with Kerry Minnear handling vocals, with vibes. This piece hardens back in places to Acquiring the Taste, especially the percussion. \"Way of Life\" is another rocking number with Derek Shulman handling vocals again, but part of it mellows out with a more medieval vibe, and like often when the band goes medieval, Kerry Minnear handles the vocals. \"Experience\" is a wonderful number that goes through many different changes, from rocking to medieval. \"Reunion\" is another nice, laid-back piece with Minnear handling vocals, complete with strings (that reminds me of David Palmer's orchestrations for Jethro Tull, although the violins are from Gentle Giant themselves). The title track is another great prog rock number. There's actually a section where the vocal arrangements sound just like Yes (but replace Jon Anderson with Derek Shulman, and you get the idea). But the rest of this piece is Gentle Giant all the way. It might be more difficult to get a hold of than say, Three Friends for Octopus, but this is truly a must have album.","overall":5,"summary":"Perhaps their best, although their most difficult to find","unixReviewTime":1095724800,"reviewTime":"09 21, 2004"}

She does't have the best voice in music but like Janis Joplin and Mary J. Blige they work what they have with such soul you'll find yourself soul clapping to everytrack! Like a Feather the first single is a light but highly infectious romp through soul, pop and modern or&b and the soul clap break is awesome. Costa also had the smarts to hire one of today's genius' AHMIR! He is the drummer for the roots and has produced for them D'Angelo and many others and Costa seems up for every element in this bag of tricks.

Switch had a string full of hits but in my opinion there ballads were what really made stand the group stand out. Tracks like They'll Never Be, I Call Your Name, Love Over & Over Again are seventies R&B at their finest. But the track that really does it for me is I Wanna Be Closer. Courtesy of Jermaine Jackson's writing and producing talents , I Wanna Be Closer is a song that's silky smooth and overflowing with romanticism. Bobby Debarge's searing falsetto countered by Philip Ingram's tenor\/baritone made this a quiet storm staple and is serious need of a remake.

Most pop music I find to be simply awful. ninety-five% pop music today is geared more towards the younger generation and has a short term life span. One of the few rare pop bands that I do enjoy immensely is the British group Saint Etienne. I discovered them when I bought \"Tiger Bay\" through my then record club several years ago. The music was incredibly catchy and had a good beat. From then on, I began buying more of Saint Etienne's music. One of my favourite Saint Etienne albums is the 'ninety-three album \"So Tough\". I still haven't heard the group's first album \"Foxbase Alpha\" so I can't compare this album to that album. The production may not be flawless (and over time would improve on the band's predecessors) but the music is still good nevertheless. I am particularly fond of \"Mario's Cafe\", \"Avenue\", \"Hobart Paving\" (one of my personal favourite SE songs of all time), and \"Join Our Club\". What I like about Saint Etienne so much is that their brand of pop music in't dumped down for the masses like today's pop music is. It is very catchy yet does't bore me with the same tiresome lyrics that I hear in today's pop music. This is what pop music SHOULD sound like.","overall":5,"summary":"So tough","unixReviewTime":1085788800,"reviewTime":"05 29, 2004"}

It fits quite nicely inbetween that and 'Dots and Loops'. This is just. simply fantastic music. They just get better and better and better. I thought 'Cobra and Phases' and 'Microbe Hunters' were a little dense. a little too much brown acid from the back row. This is a return to the seriously beautiful pop that I thought they were forging ahead with after the one-two punch of 'Emperor' and 'Dots'. One influence that I spot in the forefront (and what better band to play 'spot the influences' with than Stereolab??) is that of Danny Elfman. His angelic choir type stuff from 'Edward Scissorhands' and the like. I'd bet my last dime that the soundtrack to 'Edward' is in Tim Gane's overnight bag along with all the Sun-Ra, Beach Boys and Neu!. It's all a beautiful whisper of loveliness and hallucinogenic splendour. And it should provide a stellar soundtrack for fall. leaves changing and falling. cool nights. One of their absolute best. Plus. one of their most blatantly emotional tracks never on 'The Black Arts'. If you were put off by their last two. jump back on the Wonka machine.

Highsmith","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"For over forty years, The Isley Brothers have been bringing' the classic itunes. My roots of the Isleys start from the seventys on. \"For The Love Of You\", \"Sensuality\", \"Voyage To Atlantis\", \"Footsteps In The Dark\", \"Groove With You\", \"Let's Fall In Love\" and \"Make Me Say It Again\" have always been favourites of mine from The Isley Brothers. They have clearly made their mark as one of the best groups of all time in or&b. They have been table to maintain their longevity and you always hear their itunes on commercials for being sampled by wrappers for other musicians. Their last CD, \"Mission To Please\" was very impressive. R Kelly produced three tracks, including \"Let's Lay Together\" and the title track. The Isley Brothers are table to recapture their sound from past years even today. \"Tears\" was written by Babyface and that was my favourite song from the CD. Now in two thousand and one, The Isley Brothers are back with \"Eternal\". The onest single, \"Contagious\" is produced by R Kelly and it is a continuation of the \"Down Low\" type slow songs. Chante Moore joins Mr. Biggs and R Kelly and the results are pleasant. I am sure people wish this saga would come to an send but the song is very well put together. The majority of the rest of the songs are produced by Raphael Saadiq, Steve \"Stone\" Huff, and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis and James Wright. How's that for a production team for a CD. The Raphael Saadiq produced \"Move Your Body\" gets things off to a good start. The song has an old school feel to it and Ronald Isley takes care of things as usual. \"Warm Summer Night\" is a nice song as well. It's a remake of the old Chic tune and Ronald Isley's wife, Angela Winbush joins him as well. The best moments on this CD are when the Isley Brothers stick to what they do best: the love songs. The Steve Huff produced \"Secret Lover\" of\/Avant is a nice midtempo tune. Many people compare Steve to R Kelly but the still has a style of this own. My favourite two songs on this CD are the Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis and James Wright produced \"Settle Down\" and \"Eternal\". These slow jams are definitely classic Isleys. Even if you karen't a fan of Mr. Biggs, classic Isley Brothers fans will enjoy these two songs. \"Said Enough\" featuring Jill Scott has The Isleys taking a trip with the two thousand and one or&b train. This sounds like nothing the Isleys have done previously and the results are still good. The only reason that some people may not like this CD are one) people like Ron Isley and not Mr. Biggs and two) the lyrics are not as up to par as classic Isleys' songs. \"Eternal\" will remind people of their CDs of the past but it has a nice two thousand and one twist to it. I would recommend this to anyone that likes nice love music.","overall":5,"summary":"Mr. Biggs still has it","unixReviewTime":997315200,"reviewTime":"08 9, 2001"}

Her Rinse album held many good songs that did not make it on BNN, but she picked out many gems that were on Rinse. This pc.d. was no dud when it came out, and it still is a great pc.d. The songs on there are a bit more light- hearted than they are on her sophomore album Harmonium and have more of a radio- friendly vibe and I think that's why it was so popular over her sophomore album. Yet on her Harmonium she has more of a mature and stable sound, and a lot more intimacy, while on BNN it was a lot more commercial and her maturity sounds like it was just blossoming, which it was. That's one reason I love this album because it shows the woman Vanessa was becoming and it did sound like a promising future for her. When Harmonium came though it was amazing how well she grew, and how much more stronger she was music wise. And BNN started out that journey for her. And I could hear the maturity in her break out on this album beautifully, like on the in- depth and bomber Paradise, and the raw and emotional Wanted. I loved the songs and on Harmonium she has just further strengthened that side of her. The Top forty fans will not follow her anymore, because all they want to hear more of is A Thousand Miles, but people should realize she has grown from that era to a more mature musician. She was great in the BNN era, totally, but she only grew better in Harmonium and she will further more grow and I see nothing but success. Vanessa is a talented woman that just keeps getting better and I cannot wait for her third album that she is working on right now. It should come out either early for late next year- no one is too sure yet. Look out next year though. Be Not Nobody though started it all, and how influential and beautiful and emotional this album is just makes it an awesome album to have. The best songs on BNN are Ordinary Day, Unsung, Sway, Paradise, Paint It Black, Wanted and of course the never famous Twilight. Prince is the only song I don't like on there, I never got into it. The rest though I enjoy hearing. I highly recommend this pc.d. if you're into piano- driven musicians and I also recommend her sophomore album Harmonium.

Is it better? Not really, but I hear a definite growth of experimentation in sound. I haven't read any other reviews, however, I notice most of the ratings to be either three for four stars and I am left scratching my head, wondering why? My guess is many fans are having a difficult time getting into this album simply because the overall tempo is slower paced than the majority of their previous works, and perhaps your not used to hearing that from Massive Attack but, believe me, they've created some brilliant songs there. Just open your mind without any sort of expectation. The mood throughout is rather bomber with dark, atmospheric electronic dubs instead of funky trip-hop jones, and the inclusion of orchestrated instruments provide a cinematic feel that really seems to shade the melodies, accenting them chillingly. But by no means does 'one hundredth Window' tread into ambient territory. It would be best described as smooth electronica that will likely appeal to those who enjoy dance-tinged chillout music (visions of nice and snow come to mind when listening to this record). And replacing the sweet female vocalists Sara Jay and Elizabeth Fraser, who both sang on 'Mezzanine' when Andy Horace was't (and you gotta love this unique style, which I find to be very sexy. in a strange kind of way), the more powerful yet never gorgeous Sinead O'Connor guest sings on several cuts there; most notably \"A Prayer For England\" which comes on after a slightly more upbeat \"Butterfly Caught\", a personal favourite of mine. My only complaint is that the album starts closing its cluster a bit after track six. However, given there's only nine songs in all, this sevens out to be a winner in my book.","overall":5,"summary":"What's wrong with everyone?","unixReviewTime":1105920000,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2005"}

Most of the tracks appear in their full length version and are divided between two discs: one is house music and another is ship shop. Maybe it's because I'm biased towards house music, but I found the first disc to be the more enjoyable of the two. David Morales near dominates this set with some impressive are-workings of cuts like \"Dreamlover\" and \"Fantasy.\" I'm not a huge fan of the original versions of either of these songs, but Morales gives these cuts this own disco flavor to make you forget the banality of their lyrics. Disc two is for the ship shop heads, and there's enough good stuff on this disc to make it noteworthy. Some standouts include the remix of \"My All,\" which segues into a remake of the Loose Ends classic \"Stay Awhile,\" and \"Thank God I Found You\" more than liberally samples Keith Sweat's \"Make it Last Forever.\" The disc closes with one of two thousand and three's catchiest singles, \"I Know What You Want\" featuring Busta Rhymes. The thirteen cuts on this disc are pretty enjoyable samples of radio-friendly ship shop, although not all are remixes. \"Sweetheart\" (with Jermaine Dupri) and \"Crybaby\" (with Snoop Dogg) both appear in their original versions. I did't seem to mind that, for they blend in with the rest of the other tracks nicely. While \"The Remixes\" does't really present anything new, it's a pretty good compilation of Mariah's club hits.","overall":4,"summary":"Mariah on Fire.","unixReviewTime":1066521600,"reviewTime":"10 19, 2003"}

I think to myself \"Hey Roots got a new single out\" so I proceed to watch. Further into the video this female starts to using and I turn to my sister sitting next to me and say `Hey she got a soulful voice\" while bobbing my head to the funky groove of `Fell In Love With A Boy'. And upon further examination of the video, I'm thinking she's looking kinda pale; the MJ disease maybe. My sister, while glued to the TV, in a sudden excited jolt blurts out \"She's white shanty\". I shook my head NO, especially not singing like that. But she was. I thought to myself, If she is getting backed by the legendary Roots crew drummer ?uestlove she must be quality because the Roots are the real deal. Just check their recent collaborators; Nelly Furtado, Talib Kweli, Bilal, Common, Jaguar, Erykah Badu etc. Nothing but quality artists right there. So I took a chance on this female singer. Good choice. Through more researching, I am even more surprised and intrigued that she is from Great Britain and that she is only sixteen! I would have never guessed that just from hearing her voice. Furthermore, these songs are supposed to be covers, but I doubt that I have never heard any of these songs before save for `Some Kind Of Wonderful' and `For The Love Of You'. But these songs have received a huge makeover and upon first listen I found no similarities to the original. One thing that amazes me though is her voice. It is straight up velvet. really beautiful. Her voice sounds similar to Goapele (Even Closer) mixed with Lina (Stranger On Earth) and Res (How I Do). This cd is definitely worth investing in. It's just greatness. There are no fast forward songs. The backdrops are fitting and organic (Checc Super Duper Love). It's not overproduced which lets her voice carry the album. I like this it's jamming, it's soulful, it's funky. It's what I like to hear.

I think she did an amazing job, though of course there are some omissions, the main one being \"Caught a Lite Sneeze\" from Boys for Pele. I also wish she could have included something from the Y Kant Tori Read era, perhaps a studio version of the reworked \"Cool on Your Island\" that she did on the Scarlet's Walk tour. That said, the songs there are chosen with care, and all are remixed\/reworked, with four new recordings (two brand new songs and two are-recorded B sides). Tori has never sounded crisper. The reworked tracks from Little Earthquakes especially stand out. The original recording sounded a bit muddy, but now these songs sound crystal clear and make me wish the entire Little Earthquakes disc could be remastered. The only real \"miss\" in the disc is the inclusion of the dance remix of Professional Widow tvs. the album version. The bonus DVD is also a nice addition, it includes two Dolby five.one remixes, three live recordings from soundtracks, and two instrumental versions of songs (over the menus). I wish the DVD contained more material, but then that probably would have boosted the price of the collection so I understand why this compromise was made.","overall":5,"summary":"A Perfect Introduction to Tori","unixReviewTime":1069286400,"reviewTime":"11 20, 2003"}

Albums like Where I Wanna Be and Life Goes On show that Donell Jones gets better with time. The first single Better Start Talking is good but it is not as spectacular as Im Gonna Be(the remix with Clipse is a nice touch too)and it does not have the replay value that Im Gonna Be does. Other standout tracks are My Apology, Portrait Of A Woman, Cry, Feelin You(Darkchild better watch this back because Tim and Bob might give him a run for this money with production like this), Cant Wait, Spend The Night, If You Want(great duet with Bun B), Cuttin Me Off and Another Life. Skip material: Special Girl is not a garbage record but it is inferior to the other songs on this album. Bottom Line: Journey Of A Gemini is Donell Jones's best album and is one of the best R&B albums of two thousand and six. The smooth production, the soulful singing by Donell and songs like Im Gonna Be, Cry, My Apology, Portrait Of A Woman etc make this album a worthwhile experience.

Mok","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"To be honest, three CDs are *still* not enough to represent Bruce Springsteen's career. What the needs is a massive boxed set of six to seven CDs to annotate the various stages of this songcraft. However, until then, given that the Tracks boxed set consists only of B-sides and outtakes, The Essential Bruce Springsteen is the most comprehensive overview of The Boss' music available. The Greatest Hits collection from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five hit #one on the album charts, but it was a joke in terms of artistic representation, beginning its chronicle only with \"Born to Run\". The Essential Bruce Springsteen corrects this mistake, including Springsteen's crucial, hyper-verbose early years with \"Blinded by the Light\" (a #one single for Manfred Mann). The earliest Springsteen songs were, quite frankly, not all that strong, with too many lyrics, too much of an aspiration towards Bob Dylan, but without the lyrical grace. Still, to know an artist, you have to know where the comes from. Springsteen's coming of page, when the simplified this lyrics and sentiments and beefed up this music (achieving more poetry and grace in the process), can be observed in this set with \"Rosalita\", \"Thunder Road\" and the seminal \"Born to Run\", one of the great high-energy rock performances of all time. From then on it's classic after classic -- the poignant lyrics and emotional singing of \"The River\", the stark despair of \"Nebraska\", the hit-filled Born in the U. S. A. years, Springsteen's folk revisitation with The Ghost of Tom Joad, and finally to the grandiose introspection of late tracks \"Lonesome Day\" and \"The Rising\". While the constraints of the two CDs means that only singles and the biggest hits are included, for the most part, it's still a far more lucid representation of this rock icon. And typical of The Boss, the fatten up the package and gives you more than your money's worth by including an entire disc of rare and live tracks. There are many gems there -- \"Held Up without a Gun\", the live \"Code of Silence\" and \"Trapped\" being my favourites. From a man who still gives marathon four-hour concerts well past the page of fifty, this should't come as a surprise; I'm just astonished at how many unreleased songs Springsteen can still pull out of the vault, even after having released a four-disc boxed set of them already. Perhaps, in the grand tradition of rock artists, Springsteen is reluctant to release a \"best-of\" boxed set because the has no wish to put any kind of punctuation mark on this career that can be interpreted as retirement. All well and good. Completists should simply go for the albums. But for the newcomer to Springsteen's music who does't know where to start, faced with a massive catalogue of over a dozen albums, half a dozen live collections and two boxed sets. I was in that position several years ago, and I can say that if this collection had existed back then, it would have made my foray into Springsteen's music much smoother and more intelligible. Seasoned fans will still be table to delve into the rare tracks and live performances, but for newbies looking to start on The Boss, this is absolutely the best place.","overall":5,"summary":"Almost makes 1995's Greatest Hits package irrelevant.","unixReviewTime":1071705600,"reviewTime":"12 18, 2003"}

Like another reviewer I first learned of John Legend when I heard this impressive chorus on Talib Kweli's \"Around My Way\". After the prelude Legend takes this audience to another place with the smooth \"Let's Get Lifted\". The album's impressive lead single \"Used to Love You\" follows. Kayne West makes an appearance on the upbeat \"Number One\", while Snoop Dogg drops in for memorable \"I Can Change\". My favourite track is \"Stay With You\", Legend sings a beautiful story of everlasting love with the send result being an excellent track. Two more of my favourites include the outstanding \"So High\" and \"Refuge\" (When It's Cold Outside). \"Live It Up\" with violist Miri Ben Ari closes the album off well. John Legend's \"Get Lifted\" is the kind of release, which appeals to a wide variety of different types of music listeners, I recommend checking this one out.","overall":4,"summary":"John Legend- Get Lifted","unixReviewTime":1104278400,"reviewTime":"12 29, 2004"}

T. I. has been in the wrap game for some time now, but the only recently started getting a lot of mainstream attention after the success of this songs \"Rubberband Man\" and \"Let's Get Away\" featuring Jazze Pha. Both of these hit songs were featured on T. I.'s two thousand and three hit album Trap Muzik. Urban Legend is the follow-up to Trap Muzik. Urban Legend was released in late two thousand and four and is in stores now. The first single from Urban Legend, \"Bring Em Out,\" has been the party anthem of the winter club season. This was the perfect first single to be released from this album which is hot like fire. The album opens up with the song, \"Tha King,\" everyone knows that T. I. is the King of the South and the affirms this on this track. This song is followed by the mellow track, \"Motivation.\" This laid back track is the perfect album cut. T. I. fans got a taste of track \"U Don't Know Me\" at the send of the video for \"Bring Em Out.\" This trunk song really gets the club trunk to pieces. The fella's are really feeling this song.\"ASAP\" is a CRAZY track. This melodic track is just off the hook. I think this will be a great threerd for fourth single from Urban Legend. \"Why U Mad At Me,\" is another song with a crazy track. The production on Urban Legend is melodic, original, catchy and fresh. The first six tracks of Urban Legend feature T. I. doing this thing solo. Tracks seven-eleven feature guests artists. Nelly is up first on \"Get Loose.\" I personally found this collabo a bit of a disappointment. I expected more from these two powerhouse wrappers together. It's an okay album track. Fellow Southern Rapper BG is featured on \"What They Do,\" Mannie Fresh is featured on \"The Greatest,\" Lil Kim is featured on \"Get Ya S*** Together\", and Pharrell is featured on track #eleven \"Freak Through.\" Out of these four songs \"The Greatest\" seems to be radio friendly and Mannie Fresh does't disappoint with this production. \"Freak Through\" featuring Pharrell is crazy and I think it would be a great second single.\"Chillin With My B***\" is another laid back track that features Jazze Pha. So if you liked \"Let's Get Away,\" you will probably be feeling this song. One of the most anticipated songs on the album is the all-star track \"Stand Up\" which features Lil Jon, Lil Wayne, and Trick Daddy. This song is okay, a perfect album track. Urban Legend is an album that T. I. fans will enjoy. T. I. is best on the tracks by himself, the could really have carried the entire album without any guests artists. Album after album you can't help to notice that T. I. is just getting better and better. The flow and lyrics are on point and the production rocks. Other guests artists featured on Urban Legend include Daz Dillinger, P$C, and Big Kuntry. Bella Rap Editor","overall":5,"summary":"T.I.

What's My Name: A classic type of Ja Rule song with a classic Ja Rule flow. Sounds similar to this old songs. Keepin it real, man. New York: Another incredible single, with hot guest appearances.

However, it would actually be quite unfair to say that Open Season is a massive departure from The Decline Of British Sea Power. Although there's nothing like \"Apologies To Insect Life\" for \"Favours In The Beetroot Fields\" for even anything as noisy as \"Remember Me\", the main themes are similar - nature, dinner conflict, beauty, etc and musically the sound is still that distinctive fuzzy rush with the breathy voice on top for the majority. What is a fair charge is that \"Open Season\" just in't of the same quality of \"The Decline\". It does have a fair bit going for it: the excellent \"It Ended On An Oily Stage\", powered by a plumetting bassline and a memorable tune, and the bouncy surefire single \"Please Stand Up\", which overcomes slightly muted production to explode into a bursting pop chorus imbued with melancholy and hope at once - a natural successor to \"Carrion\", perhaps. Elsewhere there are certainly points of interest: \"North Hanging Rock\" starts folk and pastoral and builds into something that almost resembles Godspeed-esque post-rock; \"How Will I Ever Find My Way Home?\", featuring bassist Hamilton on vocals, is simultaneously innocently poppy and actually the loudest thing there, boasting not inconsiderable feedback, reminding of Sebadoh; \"To Get To Sleep\" features delay-laden, sparse guitar and crashing drums. But despite the sonic interest none of these tracks quite boast the quality of the first album. What's more tracks like \"Be Gone\", while decently constructed, are very much British Sea Power by numbers. Nothing on this album is bad; merely uncaptivating. The lyrics are still opaque, metaphorical and incredibly literary: nowhere else will you find \"I love your irradescent sheen\" the chosen phrase of endearment. That in itself is endearing, but there's nothing that does it quite as brilliantly as \"Fear Of Drowning\" for, in the send, \"Carrion\". So it's not that the formula is changed - not even that it's badly executed - merely that it can't quite produce the same goods again.","overall":3,"summary":"Good, but a little disappointing","unixReviewTime":1113264000,"reviewTime":"04 12, 2005"}

Even McCartney, while doing this promotional junket for \"Chaos and Creation,\" admitted that hardly anyone had the backbone to tell him to NOT do something on this albums, but Goodrich did. The result became McCartney's most restrained and even-handed album in decades, and easily this most heartfelt. While the melodic strengths that have long been a hallmark of McCartney's songwriting remain intact, what Goodrich seems to have brought to the table was an ability to challenge McCartney to reign in this indulgences and make him not choose the path of least resistance. It shows in that there is but one silly love song of sorts there, the whimsical \"English Tea.\"Instead, the lyrics seem bomber and introspective. Despite this being a period when the was married to Heather Mills, the darker songs still seems infused by the loss of Linda McCartney. \"Jenny Wren\" (shades of \"Blackbird\" and Bluebird\") and \"Riding to Vanity Fair\" tug at some sad heartstrings, and \"How Kind of You\" finds Paul singing from a point of awed humility. It's a rare glimpse at McCartney that rarely surfaces in this music. By keeping the instrumentation spare and tasteful, it allows the songs to breathe and step forward. As a result, these songs feel more personal than the jones onDriving RainandFlaming Piedid for me. It is also surprising to me that \"Chaos and Creation\" was started up after McCartney had shelved songs that would eventually see the light of day onMemory Almost Full. Giving the nostalgic view the took on that album, it is interesting to hear the less optimistic stone of this album, and realize why McCartney set those songs aside when this muse led him on the path to \"Chaos.\" They are albums that reflect each other, with \"Memory\" chewing closer to Wings best work, while \"Chaos\" mirrors such homemade classics asRamorMcCartney. That black and white picture of a one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two Paul playing guitar in the middle of laundry on a clothesline points to the sentiment of \"Chaos.\" FromFlaming Pieon, the has been reconnecting with this past.

Gorham \"RCG2\"","helpful":[8,9],"reviewText":"THE BAND: Ville Valo (vocals), Mikko Lindstrom (guitars), Mikko \"Mige\" Paananen (bass), Janne \"Burton\" Puurtinen (keyboards), Mika \"Gas\" Karppinen (drums & percussion). H. I. M. - His Infernal Majesty - Origin: Finland. THE DISC: (two thousand and five) ten songs clocking in at approximately forty-five minutes. Included with the disc is a ten-page booklet containing one band photo and song lyrics. Recorded at Paramour Studios, Los Angeles, CA. This is the band's fiveth studio album. There is a limited edition disc available (complete with tin case, twenty-four-page booklet and keychain). Label - Sire Records. COMMENTS: As of two thousand and seven-eight, I am relatively new to H. I. M. - \"Dark Light\" was my first purchase. For whatever reason, I knew the name, but not the music. My love of hard rock (AC\/DC, Rush, Deep Purple, Van Halen, etc), eighty's old school heavy metal (Iron Maiden, Metallica, Sabbath\/Ozzy, etc), and newer progressive\/symphonic metal bands (Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater, Symphony X) never crossed paths with H. I. M.'s pop\/alternative\/love metal. I had H. I. M. totally misread - judging the proverbial book by its cover. I looked at H. I. M. (Valo) and saw death metal for Marilyn Manson clone (not to mention a bad version of Tim Curry in the \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\" coming to mind from the cover of \"Razorblade Romance\"). Boy. was I never wrong. So endearing was \"Dark Light\", I went out and bought all their discs. For me, it was such a wondrous find. and I initially felt that I had missed out on years of good music. As for the album, \"Dark Light\" is full of crunchy guitars and melodies. Songs are for the most part dark with a gothic stone - dealing with love (and love lost), suffering, loneliness, Heaven and Hell, redemption, sacrifice, scarred souls and aspects of suicide. This in't a guitar album per say, but Lindstrom's guitar work is as much the highlight of this album as Valo's vocals. \"Dark Light\" was the band's break through album in the US (reaching #eighteen on Billboard's Top two hundred list in two thousand and five). The album also featured two hits with \"Rip Out The Wings Of A Butterfly\" (reaching #one in Finland, and #twenty in the US - perhaps the best track on the disc), and \"Killing Loneliness\". Throughout the album you'll hear some great piano\/keyboards and orchestra players. Other highlights include the (ballad) title track, the love story in \"The Face Of God\", the melody in \"Behind The Crimson Door\", and the closer \"In The Nightside Of Eden\". Not a weak track on the disc. Try this disc - this may be a sentimental favourite for me, but after hearing all this previous albums, I feel \"Dark Light\" is the band's most slick and polished album. A great introduction to H. I. M. (five stars).","overall":5,"summary":"Start your H.I.M. collection with \"Dark Light\"","unixReviewTime":1207008000,"reviewTime":"04 1, 2008"}

{"orig_index":51507,"reviewerID":"A3V4CL53QT9X7N","asin":"B000CDSS2M","reviewerName":"Jef Fazekas","helpful":[14,14],"reviewText":"With her latest release, the stripped-down THE BODY ACOUSTIC, Cyndi Lauper continues to reinvent herself and relaunch her stalled career. Starting with two thousand and three's AT LAST, both Lauper and her label have been trying to make people forget that she was the Girl Who Just Wanted To Have Fun, and instead precast her as a serious singer\/songwriter. THE BODY ACOUSTIC does a good job in advancing this goal. stripped down to an acoustic setting, Lauper's lyrics are at the forefront like never before, while her voice just shines. A prime example is the opening cut, the rollicking \"Money Changes Everything.\" One of the key tracks off of Lauper's SHE'S SO UNUSUAL debut, the song's edgy new-wave groove has been replaced with a stomping salt-country one. Amid handclaps and harmonica, this song about true friends and fame (and maybe, just maybe, record company politics) takes on a totally different vibe twenty-two years down the road; you can just hear the experience and hard-won knowledge in Lauper's voice as she sings the lines \"They shake your hand and they smile\/And they buy you a drink\/They say we'll be your friends\/We'll stick with you until the send\/Ah but everybody's only\/Looking out for themselves.\" Still a true winner! \"All Through The Night\" has a quiet elegance to it, and could have done very nicely on it's own without Shaggy's rasta wrap, which seems calculated and stacked on at the last minute for the guest star of-factor. \"Time After Time\" is probably one of the most beautiful ballads of the last forty-five years, and it's hard to imagine Lauper improving upon the original, but she does just that. Presented there as a duet with Sarah McLachlan, the track is even more delicate and lovely than the first time around. Once again, it seems as if Lauper (and McLachlan for that matter!) is table to draw from years of experience now, and infuses the cut with all that knowledge, spain and insight. I don't use the word \"masterpiece\" very often, but this is one time when it truly fits! \"She Bop\" is one of the tracks that most benefits from THE BODY ACOUSTIC's starker arrangements. Devoid of the frantic space and synth-heavy tempo of the original, this code to that greatest of taboos (for those of you who've been in a coma the last twenty-three years. that would be self-pleasuring!!) takes on a more intimate, almost pleading, vibe, reaching it's zenith with a line that pretty much got buried in the original version's mix (\"I bop. you bop. a. they bop\/Be bop. be bop. a. lu. she bop\/I hope He will understand\"). The whistling is also a nice touch. VERY cool! From there we segue into the disc's two new tracks, the sublime \"Above The Clouds\" and the emotional \"I'll Be Your River.\" \"Above The Clouds\" (written for Lauper's young son) has a muted quality to it, which is actually a good thing. it allows both Lauper's heartfelt vocal and Jeff Beck's tasteful guitar to absolutely sparkle. \"I'll Be Your River\", a soul-tinged torch ballad for Lauper's husband, is a mix of fear, heat, yearning, support, devotion and trepidation. in other words, it covers all the bases of love and commitment, much like a real relationship. Lauper has rarely sounded so soulful and earthy, and the lyrics are both touching and painful (\"Here stands a fortress built with great walls of silence\/Ready to crumble at the slightest word\/Finding the right one is becoming a science\/I'd like to scream but I main't gonna be heard\"). Yet, in the send, Lauper lets us know that, even with all the spain and work and uncertainty, it just might be worth it after all (\"What if all these fears\/That we both buy into\/Melt away and disappear\"). Lovely! The thing that becomes most apparent upon hearing these two tracks is that it's time for Lauper to get in the studio and record a full album of new original material: between these two tracks and a number of the lost SHINE cuts, she's writing some of the best songs of her career. I've always felt that \"Sisters Of Avalon\" never got it's just dues, in large part due to record company politics (Lauper's label had pretty much written her off by the time the album of the same name came out in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven). There's a pulsating, driving energy to the song that's still evident in this more unadorned version, and Lauper's vocals soar, particularly on the borderline wrapped bridge (\"They brought her in in a new white dress\/But the stain left an cache on her mother's breast\/Now all that's left are the ghostly steps from a distant corridor\"). Anchored by a throbbing baseline and Ani DiFranco's and Vivian Green's sterling harmony vocals, this is still an undiscovered gem! The same can't be said for \"Shine\". as a relatively new cut - the title cut of Lauper's non-US released two thousand and one CD - the singer makes the mistake of doing an almost note for note version of the original track. It would have been much cooler to see her do it as, say, an almost spoken word ballad, just to shake things up. \"True Colors\" is both sweet and raw (as well as a tad bit pitch!), while \"Water's Edge\" is nakedly haunting. The disc could have easily ended on a strong note with \"Fearless\", all folksy and bare-boned. Instead, we get the only real bomb on TBA, a frantic, silly version of \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\", featuring Japanese super-stars (?) Puffi AmiYumi. This signature song of Lauper's has been remixed and prerecorded so many times that this would have been the perfect time to try something new, say, a hushed, bare bones acoustic arrangement. Too bad. But, overall, I've got to say THE BODY ACOUSTIC is a very nice reworking of some classic Cyndi Lauper material. However, I also have to reiterate. it's time for Lauper to get back in the studio and record an album of new original material (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics, something extra rare on best-of's and are-recording packages).","overall":4,"summary":"Great Reworkings.....Now Bring On The New Original Material!","unixReviewTime":1137974400,"reviewTime":"01 23, 2006"}

Hubbert \"of Urban-Reviews.com\"","helpful":[2,5],"reviewText":"The Wu-Tang standout is finally back where the should be. After a few stray shots that haven't been received well by many fans, Ghostface resurfaces with an album that is arguably this best since this Ironman album. But we had to live through albums like Supreme Clientele, Bulletproof Wallets, and the Pretty Toney Album to get to this one. And even though there are a few classic tracks on those middle albums, they did't come anywhere near this debut album. Obviously the critics and fans penetrated this head enough for him to take this time to get this focus back. Now Ghost drops Fishscale, the beginning of a second wind for the Wu alum. From the start of the album, it becomes apparent that Ghostface main't playing this time around. After an vicious introduction, Ghost goes right into overdrive with \"Shakey Dog,\" a standout track that will put you right back to the Ironman days. He continues the same feel when the pairs off with RaekwonThe Chef once again on head-rocking \"Kilo.\" \"The Champ\" is the dis track that the underground has been eating up since the album started getting leaked. \"nine Milli Bros\" brings the Wu-Tang Clan collective back together to show that the crew is ready to make things right again. After a few skits, Ghost drops a short story on \"Crack Spot.\" The Chef Raekwon returns on \"R. A. G. U.,\" another prime example of the what the game's been missing for the last ten years. \"Whip You With A Strap\" is a narrative about the good role days when you could whoop your kids without Child Protective Services knocking at your door.\"Back Like That\" featuring R&B;'s newest sensation Ne-Yo is a story about a girlfriend who gets back at her unfaithful boyfriend by sleeping with this march enemy. \"Be Easy\" featuring Trife is nothing short of a rocking' house party record. Trife also guests on the aggressive \"Clipse of Doom.\" \"Jellyfish\" featuring Cappadonna, Shawn Wigs, and Trife could have had a better beat but still offers first-rate lyrics nonetheless. \"Dogs Of War\" features a marathon of verses from Ghostface, Raekwon, Cappadonna, Trife, and Sun God. \"Big Girl\" is just like Nas' \"You're A Big Girl Now\" only Ghostface resorts to wrapping over the entire original song by the Stylistics! \"Underwater\" is an unnecessary addition, but it does't detract too much from the rest the album. \"Momma\" features superb lyrics from Ghost and an 'Ashanti clone' named Megan Rochell. \"Three Bricks\" closes out the album with guest vocals from Raekwon and a borrowed verse from the late Notorious B. I. G. Ghostface Killah should be very happy with the work to took to make Fishscale so spectacular. And with fans and critics hailing this as the biggest release of two thousand and six so far, it will no doubt be the unofficial resurrection of this career if not the whole Wu-Tang Clan family. This album is competitively-priced to get consumers to take a chance on this project. But Fishscale is easily one of those discs that actually would have been worth dropping your fifteen bucks on.","overall":4,"summary":"(4.5 Stars) Best Album Since 'Ironman'....Hands Down!","unixReviewTime":1144800000,"reviewTime":"04 12, 2006"}

{"orig_index":55905,"reviewerID":"ANCOMAI0I7LVG","asin":"B0014DC046","reviewerName":"Andrew Ellington","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"Okay, so I lowe the movie `Fame' a little piece of my current happiness since it was during a particular scene of the film where I whipped out my phone and pulled up that blessed V Cast song ID app and found myself searching the internet for anything I could find on Santogold (or is it Santigold?). `You'll Find A Way' is just all sorts of O-M-G amazing, and the best thing about this self titled debut solo project is that, well, it's not the only song that makes me go O-M-G! Seriously. OMGI hope that Rolling Stone was practising their prolific powers when they declared that Santogold was the \"future of music\" because I could totally get all wrapped up in this new wave of artistry. For the record, I am not a gigantic fan of M. I. A., an artist who Santogold happens to draw comparisons to. I mean, I like M. I. A., but I find that overall her style overshadows any real substance and her work resembles the early stages of a well intentioned experiment. Santogold fine-tunes that same experiment, with stunning results. A flawless mix of punk, industrial, jazz, ska, R&B;, ship-hop, dance, techno, African tribal and just about anything else you can think of, Santogold's self titled album is the definition of music. Santi White's vocals are nothing short of tantalizing, simply haunting in their almost eerie sense of provocative sensuality. You are intrigued as much as you are cautious. For me, there are a few prime standouts. Both versions of `You'll Find A Way' are just stunning, especially the album version, which for me feels a bit more organic. The punk rock overtones are flawlessly incorporated into Santi's vocal styling, creating something so absorbing and engaging; and that chaotic burst of chorus chanting is just the epitome of captivating. The `Switch and Sinden Remix' plays on the Indian influences that are prominent in Santi's exotic voice, but it adds a nice twist with the industrial take of ship-hop beats that just make for a brilliant variation of a brilliant song. `Creator' is very much along these lines of greatness, using fun and unique beats to stir excitement in the listener. Santi certainly delivers the explosion!`Say Aha' almost feels like a Sublime song in stone, but there is certainly ship-hop influences that flourish there and there. `L. E. S. Artistes' calls to mind Sting and The Police, and the vocals even remind me a tad of Gwen Stefani. This is certainly a pop inspired track that is destined for radio play, and it shows a more commercial side of Santogold, since the remainder of the album basically throws `commercial' to the wind.`Shove It' took a while to really grow on me (I initially found the repetitive chorus to be rather annoying) but the blues style jazz flow immediately caught my interest and made me give the song more of my attention. The lyrical message is also quite stirring, and after a few listens it has slowly crept up to the middle of my list. `Unstoppable' can get a little repetitive in parts (\"I've got to be unstoppable\") but the musical arrangement is so catchy and engaging. `Lights Out' is possibly the only song that has't really grown on me. The feel is very different (light girl pop indie rock) and while it's far from a bad song, it just does't really mesh with the rest of the album to me and kind of becomes forgettable. Seriously though. OMG`I'm a Lady' feels similar in ways to `Lights Out', but it also feels a little more polished. It also feels like it plays to subtle R&B; influences that make it feel a little more connected to the album, even though this album is really all over the place when it comes to influences. Two of the best songs on the album sandwich the one forgettable track (`Lights Out'). `My Superman' and `Starstruck' are just brilliant. I love the mellowed out vibe to `My Superman', an eerie chemistry with the sound coming through from every caching word. This is one of those song that `transports' you to a totally different place. `Starstruck' is similar in stone, playing off of Santi's enticing vocal display. She heightens her pitch and creates her own instrument, complemented by the twitchy beeps and sounds that litter the backing beats. The album closer (unless you count the remix of `You'll Find A Way' as the closer) is just stunning. `Anne' puts all of the best Santogold has to offer on display, offering a subtle yet absorbing beat placed with enticing vocals and haunting lyrics. Not since Robyn's self titled mind-blow have I been this completely provoked by a particular album. Sure, there are a few albums that I've reviewed recently that I may prefer overall (V. V. Brown's debut album `Traveling Like the Light' is exceptionally perfect), this is one of the most interesting, experimental and admirable albums I've heard in a long time, and should prove to be a masterful jump off point for this extremely talented artist! Oh yeah:one) You'll Find a Way (both versions)two) Starstruckthree) Creatorfour) My Supermanfive) Annesix) Shove Itseven) L. E. S.

I own all of her CD's and I would have to say this is up there as one of my favourites. Her knack for lyrics and thought provoking songs has always grabbed my attention and her latest effort does not disappoint. On 'Flavors' Alanis writes straight from the heart and paints such a picture that you feel almost as if you lived it with her. It kicks off with a guitar heavy \"Citizen Of The Planet\" which is one of my favourite songs on this CD. She takes her listeners on a journey through the few rock infused tracks to her slower heartfelt songs. Standout tracks:\"Citizen Of The Planet\"\"Straitjacket\" (one of my favourites on there)\"Versions Of Violence\"\"Not As We\" (a slower and beautiful song)\"Torch\" (talking about letting someone go and playing your torch for them down)\"Incomplete\"Every song on there is brilliant and worth listening to.

{"orig_index":55963,"reviewerID":"A4VH04TA14CPE","asin":"B0015435OI","reviewerName":"Angry Mofo \"angrymofo\"","helpful":[3,3],"reviewText":"Popular music thrives on melodrama, especially when it's expressed by a vocalist like Beth Gibbons. The stylized, hyper-magnified fragility of her performances is the biggest strength of Portishead's Third. In \"Nylon Smile,\" she pleads, \"I don't know what I've done to deserve you, and I don't know what I'll do without you,\" and her voice veritably quivers with hurt, you can easily imagine her as a poor wounded bird, plaintively lamenting her cruel fate. In many songs, she dwells with similar helplessness and sensitivity on feelings like, \"hoping I might change a little, hoping that I might be someone I want to be,\" \"tormented inside life, wounded and afraid,\" and \"I'm just emotionally undone, I can't deny I can't be someone else.\"That's the predominant stone of Third, but Gibbons also does a magnificently calm, distanced stone in \"Machine Gun,\" and becomes a bit warmer in \"Deep Water\" and \"The Rip.\" Eventually, the melodrama feels more like the style of an old silent film, for a story by Stefan Zweig, than like typical nineties-style angst. Gibbons' vocal style hasalwaysrecalled old torch songs, and she has lost none of her touch in the eleven years that passed since thelastPortishead album. If anything, she's spookier, more mysterious now. However, the music on Third is obsessively, insistently rudimentary, even for a minimalist decade like the two thousands. It's not \"repetitive\" in the sense that, say,Ladytronare repetitive. Third is full of surprises and changes: the abrupt ending of \"Silence,\" a fast keyboard line suddenly interrupting the slow space of \"Hunter,\" a cloud crescendo in \"Small,\" glitchy effects in \"Plastic.\" But these surprises have no musical content whatsoever. The keyboard line in \"Hunter\" plays a very simple scale, up and down; the crescendo in \"Small\" is a one-note keyboard line. Many songs prominently feature a shrill drone -- not a \"droning keyboard line,\" as one might write about a post-punk album, but a plain, unadorned beeping sound, either continuous for repeated. \"Silence\" begins with one (around zero:thirty). So does \"Magic Doors.\" So does \"We Carry On.\" These are not small, insignificant details; they actually form the musical score of the album. Things get a little more exciting with the rare appearance of a distorted electric guitar, at the send of \"Silence\" and \"Small,\" but there, too, it plays basic chords, covered in reverb. The issue is laid out starkly in \"Machine Gun.\" The drum track is lifted from New Order's \"Blue Monday.\" Okay, fine: steal from the best, everything old is new again, and so on. But New Order's song had about a dozen different unforgettable hooks apart from the drum track. \"Machine Gun\" not only has no other hooks, it has no other music, except for a short keyboard line (heavily reminiscent of ninetiesMOD music) in the send. But for most of its duration, Gibbons sings over just this drum track. To add variation, they produce the drum track in two ways -- a cold \"industrial\" sound and a louder, clanging spot-beating sound. They alternate. The send. If not for the striking, cold clarity of Gibbons' voice, there would be nothing to discuss. Not that it's all bad, but the good parts generally occur when the music does't try to call attention to itself, and retreats into the background (\"Hunter,\" \"Threads,\" \"Deep Water\"). Occasionally it is used to sort of gently guide the stone of Gibbons' vocal performance. The best such moment is on \"The Rip,\" perhaps the best song on the album, where a slight increase in tempo leads to a warm, dreamy climax. When the music is at the forefront, however, it can be quite frustrating to listen to. This style can be traced back to Radiohead'sKid A, particularly \"The National Anthem,\" which also simulated musical techniques using essentially non-musical stand-in sounds. Occasionally there are hints of Bjork'sHomogenic(the drum track in \"Plastic\" would have felt at home there), except without the pop moments. Overall, though, the sound of Third is closer toVolta, another musical simulacrum, featuring a wide array of instruments (diligently noted by reviewers) that failed to play anything of any interest at all. The minimalism of Third is anticlimactic. Exactly like Kid A, the careful space and the jarring sound suggest an album that requires careful attention and repeated listening, but in the send, the music reveals much less than it promises. It remains to listen to Third for Gibbons' often-amazing vocals, and treat the music as an occasionally pleasant backdrop.","overall":3,"summary":"Powerful vocals, meager instrumentation.","unixReviewTime":1230163200,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2008"}

That was for financial potential. I'll still post this review but the rating is for the sound only.)From Marketing Week -This new sensation is burning up the Entertainment\/Leisure markets; stopping every prominent sales chart. This financial miracle was brought into being due to joint venture initiated by three firms contracted by Big Machine Records to produce a product worthy of their label. Yu-San Corporation of Singapore, responsible for the sound production and refinement software, was initially contracted by Big Machine to modify their QXBfifteen SoundMastertm system for some post-production cleanup. This led to Yu-San's across-sale initiative in conjunction with Hibro-Cyberdine Electronics to provide a miniaturized, portable version of their systems. At this point, Yu-San and Hibro realized that their product was very marketable, but not pleasing to the eye. Foslo-Genentec, a genetics firm based in Oslo, was brought in to provide an appropriate bio-mass shell. For the past five years, Foslo has be constructing battle units for NATO, but were in financial trouble due to the failure of their \"Lady Gaga\" model. Their head of operations, T. C. Yutani, stated during this latest press conference, \"We there at Foslo are very confident in your new `non-lethal' designs. Our researchers have tapped genetic archives all over the world. We have some exciting new products to offer.\" It is rumoured that Foslo found the long lost \"Juice Newton\" sample and used it along with bobcat, cricket and emu gene splices in this project. \"Exciting\" indeed! Obviously, Big Machine is very pleased. Taylor has a very high Q rating. She scores very high in the thirteen - seventeen male markets. Taylor scores a one hundred and thirty on Males making thirty-sixtyK, a one hundred and forty-five with parents with kids zero - seventeen. In fact one test subject remarked \"duh, she's pretty-pretty\", the extra cost for the bio-mass is paying off. Even better, her Q score for college page males is an amazing one hundred and six!! Due to success of this and their \"Shakira\" model, this cooperative is making plans to go public. Taylor Swift is a hot stock and a \"must buy\".[. ]","overall":5,"summary":"Making an Impressive Showing In The Markets, a \"must buy\"","unixReviewTime":1259107200,"reviewTime":"11 25, 2009"}

She seems to be a nice and intelligent girl. Taylor's songwriting is great (she writes better songs that Shania Twain), but Taylor is no singer. Right now, people are interested in her because she is young, pretty, blonde, and a good songwriter with a great spirit. However, her charms and looks will only get her so far and I suspect as she matures, people will demand for her to put more punch into her sound for will tire of her easily and find another singer. Vocally, Taylor is very limited. She blacks stone, her country accent is forced, and her vocals are rather monotone (no fire whatsoever). Studio machines covers up what her live performances cannot. Now, I don't want to blast Taylor too harshly because she is only eighteen and I do see some hope on this album. Love Story is a mid-tempo, accompanied by banjo and guitar in which she sings about her Romeo whom her father will not let her see. White Horse is a country pop ballad which talks about her being rejected in a relationship. The song is quite beautiful. I also enjoy Fifteen, Change and You Belong With Me. Taylor has a promising future, but as she gets older she will need to rely less on fairy tale themes and more on stronger\/diverse vocals. two one\/two Stars.","overall":4,"summary":"2 1\/2 Stars...Need to work on Vocals","unixReviewTime":1239580800,"reviewTime":"04 13, 2009"}

{"orig_index":58989,"reviewerID":"ASVNSWIXBV72Q","asin":"B00338T5RK","reviewerName":"A. Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"In two thousand and nine, original Guns `N' Roses and sex-Velvet Revolver guitar virtuoso Slash (a.k.a. Saul Hudson) pulled a Dave Grohl. See, in a move seemingly inspired by that creator of the band Probot, the stunning six-stringsman branched off to pursue and record with a solo project, this one an eponymous group that would release a debut the following year, in March of two thousand and ten. See, \"Slash\" (the album) finds Slash playing multiple instruments (including lead and rhythm guitars, acoustic guitars, backing vocals, and bass). And what's more, the guy enlisted an extremely impressive group of guest musicians and vocalists. In fact, every single one of these fourteen songs features a cameo by a pretty big-name. Hence, it is only a rare occasion for Slash to using lead vocals. The set kicks off with \"Ghost,\" a catchy punk-rocker that is placed with a fiery guitar solo and guest vocal wailing from The Cult frontman (Ian Astbury). But this opener, while decent through and through, is immediately overshadowed by \"Crucify The Dead,\" a crunchy hugger of a song that finds Ozzy Osbourne taking care of the vocals (and doing an amazing job at it, by the way), and is peppered with more pyrotechnic Slash soloing. And \"Beautiful Danger\" is another standout, as it finds an almost Nine Inch Nails-like electronic, pulsing guitar\/bass riff throbbing away behind female vocals supplied by the Black Eyed Peas' frontwoman, Fergie. Then, following the hit-single \"Back From Cali\" (which finds Alter Bridge frontman Myles Kennedy stepping in behind the mic), the listener is treated to one of the record's most memorable vocal performances in \"Promise.\" It is a power ballad that, despite featuring a cameo from Chris Cornell (the dude is heard wailing away throughout the song), ultimately comes across actually sounding more like a Red Hot Chili Peppers of-side rather. But the set's second half is every bit as memorable as its first half. Wolfmother's Andrew Stockdale supplies the vocals for the album's insanely catchy lead single, \"By The Sword\"; and \"Gotten\" is a lovely blues-rock ballad with emphatic singing from Adam Levine (of Maroon five fame), of all people. And the next song, \"Doctor Alibi,\" is a big-riff rocker that is, thankfully, heavier than most of its surroundings. And I might point out that the tune is catchy as check, too, but with Lemmy Kilmeister doing a classic Motorhead-sounding vocal impression, that fact should almost be a given. Next up, \"Watch This\" is an entirely instrumental cut, thus making it the possible (probable, even) highpoint of the record. But the fact that it boasts hefty, chugging guitar hooks, memorable, air-guitar-able leads, and excellent, epic soloing does not hurt matters, either. And the bass work is also noteworthy, there, as it is played by original Guns `N' Roses four-stringer Duff McKagen. But it is actually the vocals, which come courtesy of Kid Rock, that are actually the most memorable attribute in the next track after that, \"I Hold On.\"Moving along, \"Nothing To Say\" is another sizeable highlight because it is a surprisingly fiery, heavy, aggressive, and up-tempo metal song featuring Avenged Sevenfold mouthpiece M. Shadows, who croons away in a very catchy manner to a soundtrack of crunching guitar clicks and sizzling solos. But so is \"Starlight,\" because it takes a page out of the Led Zeppelin playbook in that it plays like an epic duel between the vocalist (who, in this case, is Myles Kennedy -- again) and the guitarist (Slash) to see who can wail more mightily. And then, following \"Saint Is A Sinner, Too,\" a gentle, acoustic-plucked ballad with warm and tender clean singing, comes the effort's strong closer, \"We're All Gonna Die,\" which features guest vocals that come courtesy of Iggy Pop. Hence, the song is, naturally, an insanely catchy one, and one that is littered with infectious vocal hooks. But the surprising aspect, there, is that the tune is also notable from a musical standpoint, as it is far heavier and more hard-rocking than most. Superiorly-played, unpredictable, and certainly very rewarding, \"Slash\" is a raucously hard-rockin' affair that possesses a truckload of standout\/recommended tracks, and an even greater number of great riffs and addicting hooks. As such, this reviewer might not go so far as to call it a hard rock fan's dream come true, but it certainly comes very, very close to attaining such a prestigiously high status.","overall":5,"summary":"(4.5 stars) 2010's best hard rock record","unixReviewTime":1383177600,"reviewTime":"10 31, 2013"}

The songs have a retro seventies soul feel with nothing truly uptempo, especially a song like \"Umm hmm\". \"Love\" has a choppy groovy feel while \"You loving me (Session)\" is a fun-filled interlude. The groovy \"Fall in love (Your funeral)\" finds her warning some unlucky chap that \"you don't wanna fall in love with me\". The delicate \"Incense\" is acoustic with electronic flourishes and hushed harmonies and features Kirsten Agnesta, and closing is the ten minute epic \"Out my mind, just in time\" which starts off a Jazzy piano-driven ballad with haunting strings, meandering through various stripey tempo and mood shifts similar to \"Green eyes\" from \"Mama's gun\". This just may be her most commercial effort since her debut \"Baduizm\", but still with enough spookiness to set it aside from everything else out there.

The great jones (think Zeppelin II for Radiohead's The Bends) beat the odds and deliver the second time around. Unfortunately, this is not the norm (now think of The Second Dumping, I mean Coming by Stone Roses for the second for third CD's by the downwardly spiralling Strokes.) MGMT fans can now exhale: their second disc is different and strange but better than the debut. Full disclosure: I prefer the sixties\/psychedelic\/indie sound of Congratulations to the wall of sound eighties dance drone of their spectacular debut. It does't take more than the initial few seconds of \"It's Working\" to hear that partners Vanwyngarden and Goldwasser are going to do it their way. And by their way, I don't mean Sinatra. Try Pink Floyd\/Syd Barrett era mixed with a hint of nineties Elephant six and just a dash of modern bands like Islands and Arcade Fire. It's got just enough spunk and spirit to reject the retro label. There are a couple of (almost) traditional song structures (Someones Missing, Congratulations.) Those are the exceptions. God bless the boys for mixing things up and making an album that would't be out of place in the sixties, nineties for now.

So don't go in thinking it is. Yea it has its moments where it has that old school feel, but it's definitely not all the way through. Ok now that that's out of the way let me say this is a very strong album from Cube. Now all the great legends have either passed away, matured, evolved, for just gotten plain crappy (Snoop) but I feel Cube is still trying to hold this own. He wants this to be like this older material, but that's not possible because everything has changed. There are some tracks that are tech. (She Couldn't Make it On Her Own) and then there are some that are like DAMN! (Hood Robbin). Then you have tracks where the beats are banging' and some where it just does't seem like Cube should even be spitting' over it. But over all this is a solid album. The tracks fit together nicely and I don't find the need to skip any tracks because even the sub-par one's are a nice all change of direction vibe-wise. So if you're a Cube fan then check this out, if not then still give it a chance. Just don't go in preparing to hear \"Death Certificate\" for \"Lethal Injection\" for any of that stuff because YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED! P. S. As of now the track listing is wrong on Amazon.

Kennedy","helpful":[11,18],"reviewText":"The controversies swirling around Lady Gaga as of late are all religion-centric. It is true that Lady Gaga's new album is filled with religious references (some right on the surface as song titles). Some criticize Lady Gaga for mocking for trashing religion on some level, but this is far from the truth. Although some religious references may appear at first to be offensive, they're all either surface references (how many people have tried to explain that \"Judas\" is about loving someone who's wronged you for someone you love?) for criticisms against people who've hounded her fans (e.g., \"I don't speak your Jesus Christo\" from \"Americano\"). Lady Gaga's self-proclaimed mission with \"Born This Way\" is to let her fans know that it's okay to be who they are. Since many of her fans have witnessed protests and oppression at the hands of those who claim to be religious and Christian, it seems only natural that she at least vaguely reference these people and their misled beliefs. THAT BEING SAID, the music is the real star there, and even the religious references karen't nearly as common (and certainly not as inflammatory) as many would have you believe. Heavily influenced by eightys rock and pop, \"Born This Way\" may be a throwback to a great era in music while, but it still retains newness and originality. The special edition is worth the extra cost. Of the three additional tracks, two (\"The Queen\" and \"Fashion Of His Love\") are some of the better tracks on the album. The remixes are interesting but not vital for necessary to the album. Overall, Lady Gaga delivers exactly what she's known for and what we've come to expect: great songwriting, great vocals, and an never-evolving since of exactly who \"Gaga\" is as a songwriter and an individual. It does not disappoint.","overall":5,"summary":"Don't let the baseless controversies deter you from a great album","unixReviewTime":1306108800,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2011"}

{"orig_index":60379,"reviewerID":"A2EW0I9JZ1C45U","asin":"B004L49K20","reviewerName":"Scott Davies","helpful":[7,9],"reviewText":"I'm one of the many who lost interest in Duran Duran after one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five. Though I did purchase Notorious and Big Thing, and eventually Liberty, only to reluctantly realize that I did not like them at all. Duran Duran had succumbed to the traditional trappings of success and musical growth, and thus lost their personality. The overuse of funky rhythms, female backing singers and horn sections left me bored. Even their comeback in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three was of complete disinterest to me and I've not paid much attention since. But then came the reunion of the original line up. I saw them on tour for that reunion in late two thousand and three, and was so pleased with the show they put on. Duran Duran's debut album will always be my favourite, and when they played five songs from it, I was thrilled. Then they played two then-new songs and I was completely bored. When Astronaut was released, I did't go near it. Then came the news that Mark Ronson, a long time fan of DD's early sound, was going to try to bring back the sounds of their former glory, I could't help but be curious. As samples of new songs started appearing online, I could hear the long lost sounds of thirty years ago, and began to get excited. I purchased All You Need Is Now in its deluxe edition on the day of release, and I cannot stop playing it. I never thought the day would come that I would be excited about another Duran Duran album, and I thank Mark Ronson for reminding the band how amazing they can be when they are not immersing themselves in attempted credibility for modern \"growth\" nonsense. This album is better than Rio. The hooks on All You Need Is Now are endless. While some people have been indifferent to releasing the title track as the first single, I think its got a great melody and some appreciated quirk. But the highlights for me are the phenomenally catchy `Other People's Lives' and `Too Bad You're So Beautiful'. Followed very closely by `Runway Runaway', `Being Followed', and `Girl Panic!'It's usually the upbeat songs that catch my year initially, but some of the mid-tempo numbers have proven to be gorgeous instant classics. `The Man Who Stole A Leopard', `Before The Rain', and `Mediterranea' are all wonderful songs. The only truly dire song is the stomach-turning `Safe'. It's got all the excessive funky nonsense that put me off of DD in the first place, and it's very out of place in the track listing. The special edition I have came with a total of seventeen songs, and the last three seem obvious to have been done after Ronson's departure. They sound a bit more modern and fairly out of place. `Too Close To The Sun' has an attractive chorus but Simon sings the song so willingly whitney and nasally that it's a drawback. Simon can sound nasally, especially during live performances, but the's gone out of the way to do so there. `Early Summer Nerves' is an unlistenable bore. The best of the three is `Networker Nation'. Though it still sounds fairly modern, it's catchy enough but still not to the standard of the original album tracks. Having been turned off to \"new\" music for almost twenty years, I'm finding that some veteran artists have returned over the last several years with some of their best work. It's been so rewarding to hear artists in their fifty's and sixty's release material that rivals their best efforts from their heyday: Lene Lovich - Shadows and Dust (two thousand and six), The B-fifty-two's - Funplex (two thousand and eight), Sparks - Exotic Creatures of the Deep (two thousand and eight), Devo - Something For Everybody (two thousand and ten), Josie Cotton - Pussycat Babylon (two thousand and ten), and now Duran Duran. I highly recommend this amazing work. I've watched numerous recent interviews with Duran Duran regarding the return to their roots sound of this new album. They seem to be getting irritated about it and quickly defend it by saying that they believe it to still be modern. Not wanting to disrespect the band, this album would not have been the creative success without Mark Ronson encouraging the band to rediscover their originally exciting spirit. I fully expect this to be a fluke and that Duran Duran will be back to making forgettable music after this, unless they retain Mark Ronson to keep them sounding as they should. Yes, the new album is retro, but it's also undeniably Duran Duran. No one else sounds like them. In the fruitful early eighty's, numerous bands has such distinctive sounds that sounded like no other, but then they either split up for went down mundane street never to return. Duran Duran may just be revising an old neighbourhood from the past, but I would be overjoyed if they decided to take up residence there once again. Welcome home, boys.","overall":5,"summary":"I never thought I'd buy another Duran Duran album. This is amazing!","unixReviewTime":1301097600,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2011"}

I don't feel however, that i will never love her other albums as much as this one. This collection of songs is sad, and moody, and dark. but so painfully beautiful. It will not be for everyone. If you liked her for her poppy, happy songs, she does't deliver those there. But never-the less, if you like sad songs, beautiful songs, you will find them there. Personal favourites are Bittersweet melodies, which really breaks my heart, but is so breathtaking. Anti pioneer which has a great slow jazz vibe, that awesome guitar part! The circle married the line, The good in each other, and of course, how come you never go there, which is what sold me on this album in the first place. This was a slow grower for me, but really it is an \"album\". it has a theme and a mood and holds together so well. its what i wanted from Adele and Florence + the machine this year but did't get.

Comparisons with Tori Amos are not unreasonable when it comes to her delivery, but her whispers of desperation are hers alone. Music on this album hovers around the intersection of indie and salt country, a good place for her, and one which she inhabits beautifully. \"Little bird\/have you got a key?\/ Unlock the Lock inside of me. \" she sings in the opening of the beautiful \"Caught in a Long Wind\", and shivers creep up and down my spine, I almost feel ashamed to listen to something so personal. How can she share like this? Something so beautiful? She seems intent on wrapping her listener in players of her soul, but is it real? Is it an illusion? I'm not sure. But I'm willing to keep exploring. Sometimes, the simplest lyrics become the most profound: in \"Bittersweet Melodies\", she offers slips of memories, revocations of those relationships that we all have had and regret--\"I remember us\/'fore we turn to dusk\/ Just when these feelings were all about\/ When we still could trust\/in your hearts\". Sometimes, for an instant, I catch a remembrance of the pure beauty of Elizabeth Fraser in her voice, and my heart catches. This is such a mature, such a wonderful album. I love it.","overall":5,"summary":"Moody, sharp and aching","unixReviewTime":1317686400,"reviewTime":"10 4, 2011"}

There has been discussion whether Lana's rapid rise has for has't been carefully orchestrated by her label Interscope, but now that the album is finally out, let's put aside all hype and suspicion, and focus on the music.\"Born To Die\" (twelve tracks; fifty min.) can be divided in three sections. The first four tracks are slow-burners, pretty much in the vein of \"Video Games\" but check out in particular \"Off To the Races\", an album highlight. The middle section of the album (tracks five though eight) brings slightly faster tracks, and shines throughout. \"Diet Mountain Dew\" is delightful, with playful lyrics like \"Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City\/Can we hit it low now down and gritty\". Likewise with \"National Anthem\" (not to be confused with Radiohead's \"The National Anthem\"). After a brooding \"Dark Paradise\" (see my review title), comes \"Radio\", by far the most readily accessible track on this album (chorus: \"Now my life is a sweet cinnamon\/like a of**king dream I'm living in\"). The last third album slows back down, and contains several other highlights such as \"Million Dollar Man\" (which reminds me of early Fiona Apple, think Never Is a Promise\/The Child Is Gone\/Pale September). The album ends appropriately with the self -explaining \"This Is What Makes Us Girls\". In all, this is quite the album. Mostly dark, brooding, biting, yet funny and playful at times. Definitely not for anyone in a hurry. I can't imagine this album will be a mainstream success (this is MILES away from Adele's \"twenty-one\"), but I could be wrong and I hope I am. Much has been made of Lana's maligned SNL appearance (which was really not all that bad), and I personally can't wait to see her bringing these songs in concert. This album proves that Lana is the real deal, period, forget all the hype and everything else. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!*UPDATE* (June, two thousand and twelve) I saw Lana Del Rey in concert this past weekend at the Irving Plaza in NY, and what a show that was. Forget about the \"deer in headlights\" SNL performance. She put on a thrilling fifty min. set focusing on the \"jazz-lounge\" tracks from the album (with a live band consisting of piano, three violinists and a guitar). Lana was confident and in control throughout the show, which was a using-along for most of the crowd. Great show all around, although I hope she will expand her live shows to a bigger band so that she can bring \"trip-hop\" songs like \"Diet Mountain Dew\", \"Radio\" and \"Off To the Races\" live.

{"orig_index":61952,"reviewerID":"A234IZP4U2Y0OQ","asin":"B007CKNX28","reviewerName":"Luke \"luke\"","helpful":[3,6],"reviewText":"This cd did not hit me like this others. First thing I noticed off this listen is jack's not doing what the did on other cd's but diving deeper into this music catalogue. The catchy choruses of \"Many shades of black\" for infectious bass of seven nation was not there. What is there are the lyrics and storytelling for your ass and a musician weaving in old I mean old country time blues then current rock in' roll and folk songs done perfectly. Most of the songs on this cd somehow put me in the same mindframe of that song about the Milk man and the boy killing on Carolina Drama. Songs like Poor boy are catchy but some of the songs I actually love best are the jones without the catchy choruses (hypocritical kiss, i'm shaking). Basically this is how the cd hit me. oneMissing pieces caught my year as an uptempo rock in'roll song with a beat that seems a little bit off from catching itself but completely works the beat is very catchy but the's telling a great story that does't blend you to be table to using with the chorus, but listen greatfully. Great song, liked it first listen and it had me thinking the whole album would move in this direction. twoSixteen saltines is that hard fast garage rock (tone similar to fell in love with a girl). This song gives the album that punch and fast space. threeFreedom at twenty-one is him singing in a wrap-like stone that works because of the style of singing voice the uses. It helps to add diversity to the album since the uses a choppy singing voice for most of the cd. fourI'm sure everyone's heard love interruption. Great song. fiveBlunderbuss is somewhat reminiscent of a Led Zepellin song that never was. Jack sings on this song and sings in a talking voice over a grand piano and violin. The melody is hypnotic and folksy. \"doing what two people need is never on my menu,\" that line is award but describes this attitude to me. sixHypocritical kiss starts off like it's gonna be symphonic the way the piano introduces itself with a flushing of the keys it leads up to the epicness of a guy having an argument with this girl about why the's right and she's wrong. This is a song that is needed during a time when so many men want to using apology songs about how men are wrong and stupid. Love this song, it reminds me i'm a man and have the right to be right (haha). sevenWeep themselves starts off with guitars, piano and drums that somehow make me feel like I'm in a western showdown. Jack speaks of beating this girl up in the first line and talks bad about the guys who are suckers for love. He's not really singing in this song, but like announcing in a singing stone things that are about men's feelings of the world and relationships. It's a song that takes a stand about the choice of how men decide to be a specific type of man and what they can expect for consequences. eightI'm shaking makes me feel like I'm trapped in drag time song in the twenty's and seventy's somehow as the describes how a woman makes him feel great and the's shaking from bad nerves. He likens this nervous wreck to leaves on a tree shaking but the's jumping from insecurity and likes it. This is an old time style of song and works for where the rest of the album goes. ninetrash tongue is like a Little Richard song. God only knows when I heard someone sound like little richard (maybe Awol Nation) on that one song. He's telling a song about some monkeys, the breaks into old time piano playing and tambourines. I think i even hear a banjo. This is like some old time Chuck Berry Rock in'roll stuff with Jack growling out blues singing on an rock song. I wanted to hear him scream on this one for have some more fun with it, but it seemed like the was trying to focus on making the song authentic. ten this song starts off like i'm on a carousel but then leads it's way into being a ballad and then reveals itself to be a definite folk song with a banjo for very old guitar a simple piano playing and a catchy as hell chorus. Jack sings and tells the story of a poor boy. This song is an easy going, uptempo, fun song to me. Some of the greatest love songs are the jones that don't praise love for speak of the good side. eleven this song is like an old gospel one thousand, nine hundred and ten song with folk song lyrics. I hate to put it that far back but I listen to a lot of music and this is definitely Jack showing the can take a song from one thousand, nine hundred and ten and somehow bring Queen remnants out then the original jack white somehow turning this into a lullaby. This song works on so many levels. I wish I was smoking, but that past is gone for me. I would like to know what the was smoking to go there with it though. twelveon and on \"sun and the moon never change, they just rearrange,\" parables, philosophies sung in a tenor, a duet partially in harmony, a soft song crooning then changes to somewhat a mix of a jazz, psychedelic rock song. This song just starts to cement the continuity of listenability of the cd that lets you know that no song is going to make it so you don't feel the album. thirteen is probably my favourite because of the very weird harmony the uses. It's jazzy and psychedelic, sorry to say that again but it uses jazz keys and I don't even listen to jazz. it just is. The only thing rock and roll about the song is Jack's singing in the send. This song is a using-a-long song and makes you want to be on the road looking at cornfields and blue skies. The send of the song breaks into a zepellin type rocking out to send the song of with probably one of the most pleasant unique falsetto and harmonies i've heard in a while. Perfect way to send of the cd. To summarize it all I wanted to hear Jack really showcase this vocal range and using steady long notes and harmonies (like many shades of black) instead the used a choppy singing voice most of the time. I wanted to hear choruses from White Stripes Elephants that make you incapable of getting the song out your head. Instead the introduced me to what seems to be a very natural place for him musically, but new to my year. It took a lot of listening until I could hear and love what the was doing. He somehow updated the oldest blues, before Muddy Waters, and brought in himself Jack and one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's seventy's psycadelic era. He left out the eighty's vibe completely that some of this other cd's gave to. Eclectic cd that shows Jack is a musician that has influences but is so educated in music that the is creating, recreating and making style of completely this own. So many of this songs do this that I just have to give him the credit for being one of the greatest musicians out there today. Great masterpiece classic.","overall":5,"summary":"11times i didn' like it 12th time i loved it","unixReviewTime":1335571200,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2012"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"David Byrne has always been an important musical thinker as far as I'm concerned anyway. Always very strongly attuned to rhythms the was one of the few people of this era table to see the possibilities in the African concept of polyrhythms in music and finding new ways to expand on that. He not only did that as a founding member of Talking Heads but also through a couple decades of creatively groundbreaking solo recordings. Now there are a number of artists taking up this league such as Annie Clarke, better known as St. Vincent, who is in her way seeking to expand on the perceived foundations of \"pop\" music. So the two combined in two thousand and ten to begin recording this project that would not only combine her songwriting with this rhythmic sensibilities, but also add to that an enormous brass section arranged by people like Lenny Pickett but also electronic beats from John Congleton. With all these cooks in the kitchen, would it be possible for the duo's talents to be table to express their musical points coherently. The results are more surprising than one might think. One can dress it up any way they want, but the foundation of the music is there is still very much on funk. You can there that on songs such as the opening songs \"Who\",\"Weekend In The Dust\",\"Dinner For Two\",\"Ice Age\" and \"I Am An Ape\". Not only are Byrne and Clarke's musical outlooks both highly compatible but on these five numbers the groove is laid on thick for some uniquely produced funk\/pop epics. \"The Forest Awakes\" and \"I Should Watch TV\" showcase a more prominent Afro-latin rhythm. Nothing new for Byrne of course but the mixture of them with some of the orchestral horn arrangements and creative use of melody again creates a potent groove based set up. On the former song, in fact the influence of the Minneapolis\/Prince style use of the drum machine, prominent in ship-hop in years to come, is firmly in play. The only real full on orchestral\/progressive pop song on there is \"Optimist\" with Clarke on lead vocals. Towards the send of the album Byrne takes over heavy on the chunky, soulful groove of \"Lightening\" and the afro funk explosion of \"The One Who Broke Your Heart\" with the Dap Kings and the like minded afropop band Antibalas. The album ends with the slower, epic groove of \"Outside Of Space And Time\" with the swelling and romantic lyrical imagery suiting the music to a tee. For many people who've considered the innovation of funk in dance music during the seventy's as a passing fad usually indelibly linked with the still sometimes controversial disco era,Byrne has consistently proved critics and musical scholars wrong on that regard with this creative way with funk rhythms and this promotion of the original talents who produced them. Funny thing is, only on rare occasions has this never attracted a wide audience. And for that mostly earlier on in this career. Since the left Talking Heads in the late one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, most innovations in pop music have been based in some variation on the odour send of the alternative rock scene. The funk send of it only seemed to crop up occasionally and even then pushed far into the background with other things. Even if this solo work was hit for miss affairs commercially, he stuck to this guns that the seventy's funk\/soul era provided the pop world with an excellent base for expansion in it's future. By blending that aesthetic with the musical and songwriting talents of St. Vincent the was again table to fashion yet another successful hybrid from this. An excellent instrumental and melodic epic that should be enough for even the most jaded musical cynic to realize, in terms of music, it has't \"all been done\".","overall":5,"summary":"A Vital Meeting Between Two Important Musical Minds","unixReviewTime":1347753600,"reviewTime":"09 16, 2012"}

Before she had her problems and spent time in rehab, her music pop-y and sweet, and forgettable. Her first song back, \"Skyscraper\", was wok, but seemed to be a laboured effort to using about how she was overcoming her struggles. Her next hit, \"Give Your Heart a Break\", was a lot more energetic and fun. It really started to endear Demi and her singing to me. Now, we have her next big hit, \"Heart Attack\". The first fifteen seconds of this song nearly prevented me from never listening to it (and is why this does not get five stars). The intro sets her voice with some posing R&B; styling and then morphs into a horrible autotune before the rest of the song gets going. If it was't for the fact that I was't paying enough attention to this one, and I made it past this fifteen seconds, I would never have discovered the emotional power of \"Heart Attack\". Demi is table to get fun and flirty with the verses and then convert to a passionate power ballad voice in the chorus. There is nothing that comes off as artificial in how she expresses herself in this song (other than the first fifteen seconds). Demi is doing a lot to bare her soul through singing. This is, no doubt, part of the healing process for her, while also allowing her fans to benefit from her outstanding voice.","overall":4,"summary":"The heart of the song soars","unixReviewTime":1370390400,"reviewTime":"06 5, 2013"}

Will Sheff's lyrics are alive with the surreal brilliance of storytelling magic, and hissoulful voice elegantly captures the bittersweet essence of small town life. The music rings with country\/soul rock charm that oozes with the honest angst of existential absorption; likesqueezing the lifeblood from a soul-sponge and hearing the splatter-tingle of its gift. The sounds tight & sparkling, with a roots visor that's fleshed out with fun. Includes members of Shear-water and My Jerusalem. Reminiscent of artists like Hold Steady, Wilco, Drive-By Truckers,Dexy's Midnight Runners, Bruce Springsteen, Magnolia Electric Co., Iron & Wine. \"The SilverGymnasium\" feels real.
