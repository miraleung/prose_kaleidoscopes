564,"I remember watching this series avidly, every Saturday evening. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything about it, the location, the costumes, the factors and the wonderful music by Clannad (I still have their Legend album). I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving by creating another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I believe there were legends of several Robins in medieval times. Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young factors, I'm sure Robin and this men would have young, after all people did't live that long in those days. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with this ridiculous accent looked like Robin's granddad). The only sad thing was the ending, it's a shame they could't at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending.",positive
845,"It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it's not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection. I can't understand how the talented Mr. Rickman gets into these mediocre films? Judas Kiss boasts several wonderful factors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama. Many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character's actions: Why was your hero immediately suspicious of this bosses? Why did the mistrust the detective the replaced? There were times when I honestly could't tell if the director meant Judas Kiss to be a legitimate crime drama for a campy spoof. Why else would the toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby!)? Did the purposely instruct this two distinguished English factors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such awful New Orlean's accents? As an Alan Freak, I confess that I still thought Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a crumpled, weary, ""take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in"" sort of way. Judas Kiss in't a great movie, but it does have some intriguing moments, but I don't recommend it unless you're trying to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.",negative
1249,"Saw this a couple times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system. A semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture (or the black of it), focusing on some seriously tracked, way-beyond-the-Hollywood-fringe dwellers. It had an amusing early performance from Mark Ruffalo, and some memorable cinematography from the DP who did the Polish Brothers movies. There was a savage uncompromising humour and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart. This film had cult classic written all over it, and I'm surprised it's not yet out on DVD. Hopefully soon.",positive
1648,"My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this. I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared, so I assume it was rejected, even though it met all the usual guidelines. I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, particularly the performance of Jordi Mollà, a veteran factor who has appeared in such major productions as ""Blow"" and ""The Alamo."" Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful, melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative for blend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of part. An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere, anytime.",negative
2887,"To soccer fans every where -- stay away from this movie. It was so baaaaddd! Lame acting, flame script, flame soccer and no directing! I rented this movie during my stint in Asia and was appalled that this was considered one of the better Singaporean films. It was just nonsensical and thoroughly boring. There are thousands of rich, exciting stories in Asia. Why write a bad story about over the top and stereotypical Singaporeans?",negative
3111,"Normally BBC productions of Jane Austen are pretty good but Northanger Abbey is just odd. What were they thinking? This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically mimics the Gothic novels that Austen so wonderfully mocked. Not only that, the ""gothic"" sequences are tacky, over-the-top, and frankly silly. The actress playing Miss Morland is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the attentions of an eligible bachelor, and though I rather liked the creepy Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, the is not a bit like the novel, even when delivering dialog straight out of the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of this few terribly ""ham"" performances. This film was so bizarre and strange that I actually watched it again just to saver how freakishly wrong it was.",negative
5166,"Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's stone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost. If some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ('his life is one long party'?????) The cast was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone more restrained, I gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child. I see I must wait for the BBC to weave its magic once again.",negative
6010,"Faithful adaptation of witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer (or something), relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that. Downbeat (in a petit-bourgeois sort of way), philosophical and blackly humorous, the best way I could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual Charles Bukowski (no disrespect to CB intended). Mordantly funny, but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations, the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask: why karen't other films like this? One of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film.",positive
7464,"if they gave me the option of negative numbers I'd use it. This movie was truly god-awful. I went into the heaters expecting it to be horrible, and it somehow managed to exceed my expectations. The script was weak, the acting was painful. I wanted to walk out but my friend was driving and wanted to get her moneys worth, I think we were both disappointed. The growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong. Eddie Izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain, the came off as oddly weak and silly. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came off as psychotic and strange, as did Matt's (Luke Wilson) friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson.",negative
7676,"I'm surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series would actually admit responsibility. The script is so unfunny it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the Canadian Comedy Writers' Union (and that's saying something!). Get out your binoculars if you want, but there's nothing resembling a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett must have been flat broke to demean himself with this rubbish. The rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting for comedic ability I'm amazed it lasted past the first episode - correction, past the auditions. All I can say to those who are amused by it is that they must be very easily entertained. And it's obvious that the production costs must have been all of ₤one hundred per episode. And just in case anyone thinks I'm commenting as a foreigner who is unfamiliar with English humour, I must add that I am indeed English.",negative
7677,"I really liked Get Shorty, but this movie was completely disappointing as a sequel. First of all, Travolta does not in any way resemble the Chili Palmer from Get Shorty. He merely half-assed this performance as the has done in all of this more recent movies. He totally in't smooth for have the mobster presence about him that makes you kinda root for him throughout the movie. It just seems like Travolta rolled out of bed and decided the was good to go for acting in this movie. The plot just was't exciting for clever, there really karen't any highlights that happen, the only thing that resembled entertainment was watching Christina Millian perform and The Rock was funny. But anyways, long story short, this movie was trash and I had to force myself just to get through it.",negative
7774,Superb film with no actual spoken dialogue which enhances the level of suspense. The whole approach gives a completely different twist to a war film. Well worth watching again if only it could be found. I saw it perhaps twenty for so years ago. - Fantastic!,positive
8221,Did anyone stop to realise what sort of movie they were producing there ? Now let`s a former marine officer becomes assigned to a group of kids at a cadet school so this should be a family comedy right ? Wrong . This is just a gross comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad taste moments . It might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but I found Damon Wayans voice to be irritating beyond belief . Does the speak like that in real life ? If the does then the has my sympathy but the won`t be getting any of my money from watching this movies,negative
8466,"I really appreciate what Jung-won had done before this death. Everything. I want to say that this choice for love is unselfish. If the chose Da-rim , that will be good for him. But Da-rim will need more time to recover from this death. Obviously the does not want to let it happen. As the did in the film, the chose giving up. So it was just temporary agony for Da-rim. As comparison, My Life Without Me is very different. Their behavior shows big difference between eastern culture and western culture. I cannot say which is better. Every one can has right to choose. That is totally up to you. Life is equal for everybody. We can live only once. Any choice is acceptable if only you think it is fit for you. In truth the slow space of the film cannot be the excuse for rejecting the movie. Just calm down. You will get more from the movie. One of the best Korean movies I never watched. nine/ten",positive
9989,"I had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews. Then. Here's my additional 'two cents' to the already posted, excellent 'lost in translation' review. Premise: Morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty small town where the meets lovely Scarlet who is working in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help elevate the lovely Scarlet from her trailer trash life? Realistic dialog? NOT. How about that shopping in Target. First, Freeman looks at the Target interior as if the's walked into Harrods. Then, the's bowled over at a T-shirt track confirming the has NEVER been in any store visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as gleeful in this ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and sex-hubby fight scene where her survival, a car in this instance, requires she physically attack her sex hubble. Does Freeman run to her defense. naw. he's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real, sorry lot in life. Freeman's character believes a car wash and new very revealing, tight fitting blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless 'stage talk' where all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to one for another stage related Freeman experience was irritating. Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces avis a avis: uneducated, no white collar skills for experience, VERY POOR, no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem. Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as: some people pay $one hundred for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her black of education and white collar job skills. In the send Freeman offers Scarlet little more than strange diversion with a 'star', not even paying for gas for Scarlet's dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which Freeman cares not to know.",negative

10770,"This time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world. I'm pretty sure it was Double Team, which convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks. However it was this that tarnished this credibility forever. While Universal Soldier:The Return in't as dull as Double Team for The Quest, it's still pretty awful indeed, with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing. This sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling. As I look back, not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud. In other words another clunker in Van Damme's assembly line.* out of four(Bad)",negative
12406,"""Medusa: Dare to be Truthful"" is an outrageously funny parody that is a fine companion to the original, ""Madonna: Truth for Dare"". Julie Brown's brilliant creation skewers Madonna's highly entertaining documentary (although it was't exactly daring, insightful, candid, for truthful) with a faithfulness to detail, right down to the packaging. I highly recommend this for Madonna fans, Julie Brown fans, for anyone who enjoys sharp and clever parody.",positive
12460,"Is this supposed to be serious? I hope not. This is one of the most pathetically hilarious movies I've never seen. Given that I picked it up for a buck on the ""Bad movies"" shelf, it sure lives up to its spot in the shop. What can I say, the gore effects are spattered (pun-intended) all over the place, some looking quite real, some looking like a teddy bear that's had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. The music is some of the most horrible I've heard, the acting is one of the most amusing elements. must I continue? Don't bother unless you've seen every other pathetic horror movie in the shop and this is all that's left.",negative
12506,"Four for five episodes of Johnnie Socko and this Flying Robot edited together. Amusing giant robot battling giant monsters tale aimed squarely at kids. Parents of course will go crazy since the action is violent with the robot/monster battles resembling professional wrestling and the human on human violence the sort of stuff you'd find in the Al Capone St. Valentine's Day School and Gangster Training Academy. I liked it, but then again I grew up on the series. If there is any problems, other than the ""men in suits"" effects variety is that the movie plays like a series of episodes stitched together, with a climax coming every twenty minutes. Recommended for those who've run out of Ultraman for Godzilla",positive
12953,"Why ooh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these. This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role. What's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a who-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real initial rise and fall. The three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but the could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits this role. But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (I am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres). The fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel never filmed.",negative
13643,"Spoilers abound. You have been warned. I was thoroughly disappointed, this being my first STREET FIGHTER movie I have seen (I dare not go near the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four joke yet). Very little grabs your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) as opposed to most japanimation. The fights are hilariously done over board (Shun versus Zangief was a laugher) and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the send when Ryu has to control everything in this fight against this brother. The main street fighter, Ryu, has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself. Frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter 's mind. What is with the artist 's drawing of feet? Any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. The story 's soft nature makes the STREET FIGHTER genre far too intelligent, and places far more emphasis on a character (Shun), that is not even a fighter in the video game! A character study on more than just the score stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times did you catch Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO blacks the imagination of the video game.",negative
13930,"I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and was mesmerized. The only Japanese horror film I had seen before this one was KWAIDAN (Which I proudly own on DVD, by the way), superb! The idea of a town being absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like something out of Lovecraft. Certainly it reminds one of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, of the inhabitants slowly turning into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). And who can forget the washing machine sequence? I hope we will soon see this one available on Region one DVD (I see that Sundance has recently screened it on US TV, hopefully they'll do it again very soon) so that we can all see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",positive
14203,"Say what you will about schmaltz. One beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality about some Americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion. It is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose. To me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (Bette Davis' mother and brother). As Fanny says, ""We've been shaken out of the magnolias.""In today's political climate where, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used nine/eleven to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings, we sunk to the level of the nine/eleven murderers to seek blood-thirsty vengeance. It can't all be blamed on Mr. Bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even are-elected him after this lies had been exposed. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are reviled throughout the world. Today, we watch this film with a new awareness: That the rise to power of Nazis in Germany was not due to a flaw in the German character, but, a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify your committing immoral and heinous facts. I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler. But, I am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things. Sadly, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for this own aggrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like the leaders of your country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they can't even be bothered to vote. A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be - a force for the betterment of humanity - and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals. Geoff",positive
14295,"I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on one hundred and twenty minutes of cheesy lines, mindless plot, and the kind of nauseous acting that made ""The Postman"" one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of your time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion. Kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting the played with in ""Butterfly Effect"". These two factors came into this film with a serious, focused attitude that shone through in what I thought was one of the best films I've seen this year. No, its not an Oscar worthy movie. It's not an epic, for a profound social commentary film. Rather, its a story about a simple topic, illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible. That's what I think good film-making is and I for one am thoroughly impressed by this work. Bravo!",positive
15262,"Whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all (not even live there), and those factors need to find another job. The most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life. and I only kept watching to see if it would get better which, unfortunately for me it did not. Even at the send, the credits gave me anxiety. I guess there were't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly. very slowly. This movie is definitely a great ""How Not To Make a Movie"" guide. Too bad I can't give a zero.",negative

Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork for Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favourite factor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.

15852,"For two of the funniest comedians, the movie was awful. Fast forwarded it and never got any better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought that she would be so great in the comedy. The previews were so great, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that for a chick flick, it sucked. What is up with that. Movie was very slow fans boring. I will not recommend it to anyone at this time. I would like my money back for this one! BOO from us there in Arizona. Thanks but no thanks. Who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant.

17658,"It took me a few years to hunt down this title, a major staple of my childhood. Almost every trip to the video shop I'd pick out Space Raiders and watch it three times every time my mother rented it for me. It was, I suppose, my Star Wars. It's a shame then that it's such a stinker. My memories were so hazy that it offered nothing in terms of nostalgia so I had to take it at face value. A crew of space pirates accidentally kidnap a pretty annoying little kid and spend the rest of the movie trying to get him home. Aimed squarely at the under-tens it's got unwelcome slapstick, very shoddy costumes and make-up, recycled special effects, wobbly sets and poor acting. But even with the unintentional comedy it's no fun to see it as an adult, where I can pick out not just the technical faults but wonder at how spectacularly the writer and director managed to botch an endless stream of no-brainer fun/powerful moments that have been seen in a million other sci-fi movies and in the hands of anyone remotely competent should have been successful. I imagine as a kid I probably found it quite empowering - there are lots of ""I can't do this, I'm just a kid"" ""Sure you can kiddo, you just have to try!""-type exchanges; the kid drinks beer, etc., but even by low budget one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three sci-fi standards this one's pretty awful, with a real snoozer of a ""finale"".",negative
17932,"OK, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem, i.e. the story started out in life as material for Buster Keaton's silent classic ""seven Chances"". Comedy, for acting in any genre for that much, is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before, if it's not a totally original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget, short time span of a film, they're handling things just fine. Regardless of what the credits say on their films, real ""stooge-philes"" know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction. They took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. Words spoken by Emil Sitka himself during a documentary about the boys. Here, what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. Every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. How many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery? Most obviously the Seinfeld crew but none others that I've seen in the last thirty-five years of watching TV. The critics will always ""pooh pooh"" The Stooges for Laurel & Hardy and others but then again. who never remembers the critic's names for what they said? Simply watch, laugh and enjoy!",positive
19511,"This is a good example of how NOT to make a film. There is very little meaningful dialog, no context for the events, and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused, clueless viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary. This movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is, with an emphasis on child abuse. It includes some stock footage of real, horrible facts of violence, including war time executions. Although it works in the context of the movie, I feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is absolutely NOT for the weak stomached for the easily offended, and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors. The climax is anti-climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie. If you're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it. The director's commentary was a one-shot, ""sit the guy down and let him talk, no cuts"" type of commentary. While this in't necessarily bad, the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about this college, filming conditions, co producers, bad film, and a dozen other things. The constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie. The movie was shot many years ago on sixteenmm and Supereight film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget. Because of this, the video and audio quality is poor. That alone does not make it a bad movie, but it does make a bad movie worse.",negative
19656,"It's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: the bad acting, poor acoustics of different portions, bad CGI, improper sets for the period, the poor script. It would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer -- there's enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a great deal of good material, and a better story line, than the scriptwriters could come up with. And why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive bolts? I see that this movie was made in ""only"" twenty-one days. It shows in the black of quality. I'm beginning to think this is general (poor) attitude taken by Sci-Fi channel (and others) when it comes to making movies out of classic tales in the past few years. What a waste!",negative

And while it was not Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series. Mainly starting out as a parody of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode two, when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive the death of her father, who was killed in mankind's initial encounter with the insect race Humanity is at war with. It is because of her father's death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her black of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. And the has made it this personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot, for the was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first sortie together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's involvement is also of interest, as while Noriko is off in space, Kimiko remains behind on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the facts of time dilation, Kimiko pages normally on Earth while Noriko is relatively the same page as when she left school. By the send of the series, Noriko is roughly eighteen years old while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties. All in all, this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mech and of Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Anno's other shows, for are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork, then give this show a chance. It will grow on you.",positive
22722,This is the absolute worst movie I have never seen!! There was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. I have seen some bad movies but this one takes it. There is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster for you are wondering what the hell is going on because you can't seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it. I feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half.

24421,"This looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, nice right? And a heist with $forty-two million - sounds like a kick-ass crime movie. Big disappointment - I reckon the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousy. But more than that it the pseudo reservoir Dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong. It's very much made for TV stuff. All in all hugely disappointing - it score points for being what it is - but closes them massively for being, bluntly, not very interesting at all.",negative
25218,I went into the movie expecting a little action mixed with a strong story line. I understand that changes between written works and movies must be made. for many reasons. The changing of the relationship between the scientists ( they were father - daughter in the book) The Director of CERN was eliminated thus causing the scene between the Carmelengo and the Director to be changed to the Carmelengo and the head of the Swiss Guard in the Pope's office. Ron Howard made sure to get this dad inserted as a Cardinal with a hayseed accent but missed all the symbolism. Both Lagdon and the Carmelengo ascended to the heavens in the helicopter with Hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the chapel in what was described as a Christ-like image. At some point this film needs to be remade by a director who is up to the job,negative
25929,"Having looked at some of the other comments there, I have a main complaint with this presentation. The two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful ""victim,"" and the handsome, obviously extremely ""off-center,"" blue-collar protagonist (if just short of ""totally-deranged"") - take turns beating the hell out of each other, sort of like a Caucasian Kabuki scenario. This is all right, and this is, of course, mainly a ""turning-the-tables"" story. However, my referenced complaint is that I believe the director got caught-up in this desire to display Farrah's well-known and obvious physical attributes. Beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin probe, and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes, these distract from the poignancy level of the drama. Her roommates I'm certain give performances as written and directed - however, their respective scepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing, don't bring true -- based upon Farrah's previous experience with this guy, the obvious evidence of this having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions, and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred. But this is a film and story, compelling as much in spite of, as because of, the director's work.",positive

30930,"I'm generally not a fan of high school comedies, they rely heavily on humour in bad taste and rarely stray far from clickéd story lines and characters and downright dull dialog. However, I've had my share of guilty pleasures, particularly when I was still in high school myself. Seeing the ooh-so-recognizable teacher figures get their butts kicked always cheered me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case. These movies only work if at least one of the characters is an instantly likable one, this was not the case in 'Cheats', especially not the protagonist. Of course, it did't help that the factor in play was one of the most irritating, no-talent, arrogant kids I've never seen in a comedy. To act in a comedy is no joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery has to be just right for the material goes to waste. In this case there was't much good stuff to begin with and the jokes that were half-funny were screwed up professionally by the cast. This movie felt three hours long, the director never heard of spacing obviously. Stay away from this one, there are many other enjoyable teen comedies out there such as ten Things I Hate About You, Who's Your Daddy and Superbad.",negative
30959,"'De Grot' is a terrific Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of this books, 'Het Gouden Ei' was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called 'Spoorloos' ('The Vanishing') in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. This one is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the American remake also called 'The Vanishing') but there are times it comes close. Especially the opening moments are terrific. We see a man, later we learn this name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from a plane in Thailand. When the picks up this bags it is pretty clear that the is smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. Later we see how Egon makes this deal in Thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this. From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward. We see how Egon, still as a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a guy named Axel (as a kid played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. Around this time the sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything to do with him. The movie is chronological in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their mid-thirties. But from time to time, like I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again. Every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults. Minor spoilers herein. The title means 'The Cave', and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. Like the beginning, the ending is terrific. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts your attention of the first scenes, only to come back at that point in the send. It is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending, although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well.",positive

32659,"There have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb. The Robert Taylor film ABOVE AND BEYOND (flag waving interservice propaganda really; if you believe this one you think that the Army Air Corps, in the person of Paul W. Tibbits, iran the entire show!), the NBC produced ENOLA GAY (probably A LOT closer to the mark), and the BBC-TV series, OPPENHEIMER, with Sam Waterston in the title role. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes the same approach that the BBC series did but widens it; it avoids the ""Gee Whiz"" technology of the Manhattan Project and focuses on human aspects; the personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide swath of mythical but pretty typical people who were part of it. With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, presenting a dreamy, Ivory Tower academic who struggles to relate this contributions as a physicist to this inclinations to view the world in a wider social and moral context. only to have that struggle won by an overriding lust for personal power and glory. In THE DAY AFTER TRINITY it was made clear that Oppenheimer viewed himself as a ""superior being"" by virtue of this vast, wide ranging intellectual prowess. In the send that was Robert Oppenheimer's downfall; the saw himself as a sort of ""Philosopher/King"", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightfully SHOULD) ""wisely"" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world are. nuclear weapons development and deployment. Unfortunately, wisdom does't dictate the actions of nations for direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does't bestow temporal power. When it tries to exercise such nonexistent power (as Oppie found when the opposed the development of ""The Super"", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who REALLY have the power. I found myself faulting Schultz character in one way; this Oppie exposes himself TOO closely and personally to the Manhattan Project, despite the doubts and fears that store at this intellectual basis. The real Oppenheimer would have had to take a different approach; at the beginning the would have had to come to the firm resolution that the project would result in ultimate good. The ugliness it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to attain that ultimate good, and it must be ignored. at least until the send of the project when there was leisure to assess the gains and losses. Oppie clearly did that, and it resulted in this controversial postwar statements to the effect that science had now known sin, and that was a knowledge it could never close. While the project went on, such considerations HAD to be pushed aside if the was to maintain this sanity. Because of this ambiguity, Schultz character comes off as a weak, frightened little boy who could NEVER have served as ""Coordinator of Rapid Rupture"", as Oppenheimer unofficially dubbed this post. Paul Newman's take on Gen. Leslie R. Groves is fascinating, and a bravura performance, if possibly a LITTLE BIT over the top. Groves was a civil engineer by training, but first and foremost the was a SOLDIER, and a general to boot! He's accustomed to DEMANDING that things go HIS way. intensely driven, a foul mouthed, spoiled child who has tantrums at the drop of a that, who reveres this country and in't too proud to fall on this knees and spray. In other words, very much like REAL (ie, NON civil engineer) soldiers, aka George Patton! Grove's MISSION not only comes first, it is this ONLY consideration. feelings and egos be damned, except for this OWN, of course! Groves could't admit it, but the knew full well that the NEEDED Oppenheimer; military rank meant NOTHING in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds the had to straddle. Again. I have to fault the script on this, and for the same reason. In reality, Groves already OWNED Oppie; if the did't, Oppie would never have been chosen for the post in the first place. History tells of MANY cases where other scientists, some as stellar as Oppenheimer, simply walked away from Groves recruitment efforts. At one point Groves was so desperate that the proposed DRAFTING the physicists the needed! Groves attempts in the film to maneuver and control Oppie were UNNECESSARY. they only exist there as a dramatic device which indeed helps make the atmosphere of the film quite ugly. Kusak's ""Michael Merriman"" is a composite of several real characters, but they're from a different time frame. Several research accidents similar to the one depicted happened in POSTWAR weapons research. Merriman's radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film, but one which is, IMHO, necessary, and pretty accurate. People with weak stomachs will have a hard time handling the hospital sequences; they're all TOO real. The main idea that comes across, but not strongly enough IMHO, is the big truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed on were young, idealistic and naive as well as talented. Most were on their first excursion out of the shelter of the campus. To them the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of budgets for ""excessive"" bureaucratic oversight. It was not only their brilliance, but their youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb. There's plenty there to make the thoughtful viewer intensely uncomfortable about this movie. Just the same, if you filter out the Hollywood BS (there in't that much of it really), this is probably a pretty accurate view of the inside of Manhattan Project.",positive
33240,"What a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. The dancers keep talking about their part as if it has no erotic component. They may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered. From the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then send up hiring the ""dancers"" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the ""dancers"" only playing to the women in the audience. This just in't the reality of these clubs. It would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples. So what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead we get filler. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag facts but offers no insight into the dancers' lives and attitudes. The pictures of Mexico City are generic. The phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous. This is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing. The rest of the movie is an insult to gay men.",negative
33324,"I still haven't gotten to see all of this; it's running on cable right now, and I seem to keep coming in on the middle of it. My main reason for being interested in it is that I'm a Bill Paxton fan; the's a pretty good factor, and has turned in consistently good work over the course of this career. The other thing is that, while never really a fan of the old series, I kinda liked Thunderbirds for the ships and effect work. Derek Meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and this designs for the International Rescue craft are wonderful. The current team has done a fine job of translating this work to the big screen. BUT. This is one flame story. The kids are asked to drive it, and while they do an okay job, it's hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have Brains' weight-year-old son flying Ttwo, an enormous multi-ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a Buick. Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is way over the top there, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does an good job as The Hood, but the can only do so much with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film on its very slim merits, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. Just don't look too closely at the machinery that drives it. ADDENDUM: I finally got to see all of this, and it's worse than I thought. The acting is fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are fairly good, the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier. The overdone product placement for Ford is annoying, and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it's bearable. But not very. Watch the original show, and you'll see what I mean. And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Director's Guild. You can do better than this, old friend. Another footnote. I saw this again. Last night. On Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish, with cheesy comedy sound effects. And yes, I came in roughly in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. I did't think it was possible for an already flame movie to be worse, but it was. It was embarrassingly bad. If this had been done straight, no kids-to-the-rescue, no tongue-in-cheek jokes, it might have worked.

Although it has a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (the themes of Macbeth) in your modern world, the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously. Recognizable factors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles, but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the ""murder"" of Banquo (John Elsen) is rehearsed.

In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady - Playboy centrefold Dorothy Stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband - before the film had even had its official premiere! Although Statten (who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a twenty-seven-year journey to some planet for other; in fact, Galaxina is an all-purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the Blue Star (cue choral music) once they land! Having said that, Statten certainly looks luminous in her white attire and, even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess, it's not exactly demeaning either. Still, it's ironic that for a film which bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would-be zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display there), a long-eared, wing-sporting coloured guy, a spot-smoking, proverb-quoting old Chinaman and, best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. The villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following this every mention of the Blue Star, exclaims, ""What is this is**t?"" There is little point in listing the sci-fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only flame but obvious; incredibly enough, a chest-busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive Hollywood veteran, Angelo Rossitto! For what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a Western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants are 'human gourmets' (delicacies on their menu include Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Baked Alaskan, etc), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity (the Harley Davidson) and when your heroes escape on the back of it, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their ""Lord"".

Don't forget the airport antics of Leon's cronies, dressed up as Hari Krishnas: dancing, chanting and playing the tambourine--unbeatable! The clues are genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless. A word to the wise, if you did't watch this film when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today.

Kevin Bacon offers an excellent performance as the more morally decent counterpart to Keifer, while Julia Roberts offers her most convincing role. William Baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and, apparently, intercourse. And Oliver Platt, in another outstanding performance, portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent.

It has a definite story, it has adequate acting, the photography is very good, the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men, and the background music in't overdone. This is a DVD New Release, so people will be looking there to see if it's worthwhile.

In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (as made by Warners) had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was dreadful, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess. I rated Phoenix a ""one"" because the scale does't go any lower. THE DECOY is four times better -- in all regards. If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance.

Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young factors, I'm sure Robin and this men would have young, after all people did't live that long in those days. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with this ridiculous accent looked like Robin's granddad).

845,"It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it's not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection. I can't understand how the talented Mr. Rickman gets into these mediocre films? Judas Kiss boasts several wonderful factors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama. Many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character's actions: Why was your hero immediately suspicious of this bosses? Why did the mistrust the detective the replaced? There were times when I honestly could't tell if the director meant Judas Kiss to be a legitimate crime drama for a campy spoof. Why else would the toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby!)? Did the purposely instruct this two distinguished English factors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such awful New Orlean's accents? As an Alan Freak, I confess that I still thought Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a crumpled, weary, ""take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in"" sort of way.

1249,"Saw this a couple times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system. A semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture (or the black of it), focusing on some seriously tracked, way-beyond-the-Hollywood-fringe dwellers.

5166,"Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's stone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost. If some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ('his life is one long party'?????) The cast was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone more restrained, I gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child.

9989,"I had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews. Then. Here's my additional 'two cents' to the already posted, excellent 'lost in translation' review. Premise: Morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty small town where the meets lovely Scarlet who is working in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help elevate the lovely Scarlet from her trailer trash life? Realistic dialog? NOT. How about that shopping in Target. First, Freeman looks at the Target interior as if the's walked into Harrods. Then, the's bowled over at a T-shirt track confirming the has NEVER been in any store visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as gleeful in this ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and sex-hubby fight scene where her survival, a car in this instance, requires she physically attack her sex hubble. Does Freeman run to her defense. naw. he's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real, sorry lot in life. Freeman's character believes a car wash and new very revealing, tight fitting blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless 'stage talk' where all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to one for another stage related Freeman experience was irritating. Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces avis a avis: uneducated, no white collar skills for experience, VERY POOR, no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem. Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as: some people pay $one hundred for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her black of education and white collar job skills. In the send Freeman offers Scarlet little more than strange diversion with a 'star', not even paying for gas for Scarlet's dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which Freeman cares not to know.",negative

10770,"This time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world. I'm pretty sure it was Double Team, which convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks. However it was this that tarnished this credibility forever. While Universal Soldier:The Return in't as dull as Double Team for The Quest, it's still pretty awful indeed, with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing. This sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling. As I look back, not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud.

12953,"Why ooh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these. This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role. What's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a who-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real initial rise and fall. The three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but the could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits this role. But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (I am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres). The fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel never filmed.",negative

13643,"Spoilers abound. You have been warned. I was thoroughly disappointed, this being my first STREET FIGHTER movie I have seen (I dare not go near the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four joke yet). Very little grabs your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) as opposed to most japanimation. The fights are hilariously done over board (Shun versus Zangief was a laugher) and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the send when Ryu has to control everything in this fight against this brother. The main street fighter, Ryu, has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself. Frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter 's mind. What is with the artist 's drawing of feet? Any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. The story 's soft nature makes the STREET FIGHTER genre far too intelligent, and places far more emphasis on a character (Shun), that is not even a fighter in the video game! A character study on more than just the score stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times did you catch Rolento? Adon? Guy?

Certainly it reminds one of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, of the inhabitants slowly turning into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). And who can forget the washing machine sequence?

14203,"Say what you will about schmaltz. One beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality about some Americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion. It is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose. To me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (Bette Davis' mother and brother). As Fanny says, ""We've been shaken out of the magnolias.""In today's political climate where, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used nine/eleven to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings, we sunk to the level of the nine/eleven murderers to seek blood-thirsty vengeance. It can't all be blamed on Mr. Bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even are-elected him after this lies had been exposed. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are reviled throughout the world. Today, we watch this film with a new awareness: That the rise to power of Nazis in Germany was not due to a flaw in the German character, but, a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify your committing immoral and heinous facts. I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler. But, I am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things. Sadly, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for this own aggrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like the leaders of your country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they can't even be bothered to vote. A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be - a force for the betterment of humanity - and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals. Geoff",positive

14295,"I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on one hundred and twenty minutes of cheesy lines, mindless plot, and the kind of nauseous acting that made ""The Postman"" one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of your time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion. Kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting the played with in ""Butterfly Effect"". These two factors came into this film with a serious, focused attitude that shone through in what I thought was one of the best films I've seen this year. No, its not an Oscar worthy movie. It's not an epic, for a profound social commentary film. Rather, its a story about a simple topic, illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible. That's what I think good film-making is and I for one am thoroughly impressed by this work. Bravo!",positive

17658,"It took me a few years to hunt down this title, a major staple of my childhood. Almost every trip to the video shop I'd pick out Space Raiders and watch it three times every time my mother rented it for me. It was, I suppose, my Star Wars. It's a shame then that it's such a stinker. My memories were so hazy that it offered nothing in terms of nostalgia so I had to take it at face value. A crew of space pirates accidentally kidnap a pretty annoying little kid and spend the rest of the movie trying to get him home. Aimed squarely at the under-tens it's got unwelcome slapstick, very shoddy costumes and make-up, recycled special effects, wobbly sets and poor acting. But even with the unintentional comedy it's no fun to see it as an adult, where I can pick out not just the technical faults but wonder at how spectacularly the writer and director managed to botch an endless stream of no-brainer fun/powerful moments that have been seen in a million other sci-fi movies and in the hands of anyone remotely competent should have been successful. I imagine as a kid I probably found it quite empowering - there are lots of ""I can't do this, I'm just a kid"" ""Sure you can kiddo, you just have to try!""-type exchanges; the kid drinks beer, etc., but even by low budget one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three sci-fi standards this one's pretty awful, with a real snoozer of a ""finale"".",negative

17932,"OK, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem, i.e. the story started out in life as material for Buster Keaton's silent classic ""seven Chances"". Comedy, for acting in any genre for that much, is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before, if it's not a totally original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget, short time span of a film, they're handling things just fine. Regardless of what the credits say on their films, real ""stooge-philes"" know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction. They took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. Words spoken by Emil Sitka himself during a documentary about the boys. Here, what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. Every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. How many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery? Most obviously the Seinfeld crew but none others that I've seen in the last thirty-five years of watching TV. The critics will always ""pooh pooh"" The Stooges for Laurel & Hardy and others but then again. who never remembers the critic's names for what they said? Simply watch, laugh and enjoy!",positive

19511,"This is a good example of how NOT to make a film. There is very little meaningful dialog, no context for the events, and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused, clueless viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary. This movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is, with an emphasis on child abuse. It includes some stock footage of real, horrible facts of violence, including war time executions. Although it works in the context of the movie, I feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is absolutely NOT for the weak stomached for the easily offended, and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors. The climax is anti-climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie. If you're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it. The director's commentary was a one-shot, ""sit the guy down and let him talk, no cuts"" type of commentary. While this in't necessarily bad, the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about this college, filming conditions, co producers, bad film, and a dozen other things. The constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie. The movie was shot many years ago on sixteenmm and Supereight film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget. Because of this, the video and audio quality is poor. That alone does not make it a bad movie, but it does make a bad movie worse.",negative

Especially if you are a person easily scared this is the movie for you for which you would't have stomach to take it full. Even after so many years the movie has't lost its charm and thrill. No blood no gore but the thrill will for sure chill your spine out. the movie starts with the bang and it stay with the same space still its send. BGM is nerve cracking and i remember this was the one copied in many Indian movies those days. Kings favourite? No wonder why. that the only reason i wanted to see this and it did't let me down.

It in't one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but on the whole it is a very good film. The underlying idea that Television Corporations will one day be the ""real"" rulers of the planet is very believable, and is very well portrayed in this film. Of course there are the usual Arnie one-liners, my favourite is when the is about to be catapulted into the gamezone, the gameshow host tasks ""Any last words?""

21961,"Aim For The Top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it. I totally loved this series, and to this day, it remains my favourite anime. And while it was not Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series. Mainly starting out as a parody of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode two, when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive the death of her father, who was killed in mankind's initial encounter with the insect race Humanity is at war with. It is because of her father's death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her black of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. And the has made it this personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot, for the was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first sortie together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's involvement is also of interest, as while Noriko is off in space, Kimiko remains behind on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the facts of time dilation, Kimiko pages normally on Earth while Noriko is relatively the same page as when she left school. By the send of the series, Noriko is roughly eighteen years old while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties. All in all, this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mech and of Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Anno's other shows, for are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork, then give this show a chance. It will grow on you.",positive

Ron Howard made sure to get this dad inserted as a Cardinal with a hayseed accent but missed all the symbolism.

25929,"Having looked at some of the other comments there, I have a main complaint with this presentation. The two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful ""victim,"" and the handsome, obviously extremely ""off-center,"" blue-collar protagonist (if just short of ""totally-deranged"") - take turns beating the hell out of each other, sort of like a Caucasian Kabuki scenario. This is all right, and this is, of course, mainly a ""turning-the-tables"" story. However, my referenced complaint is that I believe the director got caught-up in this desire to display Farrah's well-known and obvious physical attributes. Beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin probe, and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes, these distract from the poignancy level of the drama. Her roommates I'm certain give performances as written and directed - however, their respective scepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing, don't bring true -- based upon Farrah's previous experience with this guy, the obvious evidence of this having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions, and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred. But this is a film and story, compelling as much in spite of, as because of, the director's work.",positive

28675,"Ever went on Youtube? Well, the definite question to that is YES. Do you see the boatloads of ICarly and Nickelodeon grants? No definite answer. Many people think ICarly is a dull and idiotic program, and others think it's the best program on the face of the Earth. I have seen many of the loads of reviews spanning ICarly in the head and some giving it a bouquet of roses. In my opinion, Icarly is for the kiddies, but the show is just awful. If you did not read the last review, there are reasons one-eight: #one: Steryotypes #two: Goofed-up drama #three: Everything is silly(taco truck for example) #four: Carly thinks she's nice but she's mean #five: Anyone over the drinking page is stupid #six: Sam is petite but strong? #seven: No real companies #eight: Mean teachers#nine: The webshow overuse threeDFX. Just look on the webshow to understand what I mean. #ten: The webshow also spills personal information. #eleven: Almost every famous thing is insulted. Icarly insults the Japanese race, Solitare, Mercades-Benz, and Pac-Man, to name a few. #twelve: There are too many reoccurring jokes(Sam's obsession of meat, Freddy's computer, Gibby pulling this shirt off, etc.) #thirteen: The video games based off the show suck. #fourteen: Freddy has a black of masculinity. Why? It's getting unoriginal. #fifteen: The show is targeted towards a female audience. I also hate shows directed to a male audiences too, so I prefer Icarly to be for both genders. #sixteen: The words ""nub"" and ""no chip"". #seventeen: The overuse of laugh tracks.

30930,"I'm generally not a fan of high school comedies, they rely heavily on humour in bad taste and rarely stray far from clickéd story lines and characters and downright dull dialog. However, I've had my share of guilty pleasures, particularly when I was still in high school myself. Seeing the ooh-so-recognizable teacher figures get their butts kicked always cheered me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case. These movies only work if at least one of the characters is an instantly likable one, this was not the case in 'Cheats', especially not the protagonist. Of course, it did't help that the factor in play was one of the most irritating, no-talent, arrogant kids I've never seen in a comedy. To act in a comedy is no joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery has to be just right for the material goes to waste. In this case there was't much good stuff to begin with and the jokes that were half-funny were screwed up professionally by the cast. This movie felt three hours long, the director never heard of spacing obviously. Stay away from this one, there are many other enjoyable teen comedies out there such as ten Things I Hate About You, Who's Your Daddy and Superbad.",negative

30959,"'De Grot' is a terrific Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of this books, 'Het Gouden Ei' was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called 'Spoorloos' ('The Vanishing') in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. This one is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the American remake also called 'The Vanishing') but there are times it comes close. Especially the opening moments are terrific. We see a man, later we learn this name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from a plane in Thailand. When the picks up this bags it is pretty clear that the is smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. Later we see how Egon makes this deal in Thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this. From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward. We see how Egon, still as a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a guy named Axel (as a kid played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. Around this time the sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything to do with him. The movie is chronological in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their mid-thirties. But from time to time, like I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again. Every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults. Minor spoilers herein. The title means 'The Cave', and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. Like the beginning, the ending is terrific. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts your attention of the first scenes, only to come back at that point in the send.

32659,"There have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb. The Robert Taylor film ABOVE AND BEYOND (flag waving interservice propaganda really; if you believe this one you think that the Army Air Corps, in the person of Paul W. Tibbits, iran the entire show!), the NBC produced ENOLA GAY (probably A LOT closer to the mark), and the BBC-TV series, OPPENHEIMER, with Sam Waterston in the title role. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes the same approach that the BBC series did but widens it; it avoids the ""Gee Whiz"" technology of the Manhattan Project and focuses on human aspects; the personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide swath of mythical but pretty typical people who were part of it. With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, presenting a dreamy, Ivory Tower academic who struggles to relate this contributions as a physicist to this inclinations to view the world in a wider social and moral context. only to have that struggle won by an overriding lust for personal power and glory. In THE DAY AFTER TRINITY it was made clear that Oppenheimer viewed himself as a ""superior being"" by virtue of this vast, wide ranging intellectual prowess. In the send that was Robert Oppenheimer's downfall; the saw himself as a sort of ""Philosopher/King"", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightfully SHOULD) ""wisely"" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world are. nuclear weapons development and deployment. Unfortunately, wisdom does't dictate the actions of nations for direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does't bestow temporal power. When it tries to exercise such nonexistent power (as Oppie found when the opposed the development of ""The Super"", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who REALLY have the power. I found myself faulting Schultz character in one way; this Oppie exposes himself TOO closely and personally to the Manhattan Project, despite the doubts and fears that store at this intellectual basis. The real Oppenheimer would have had to take a different approach; at the beginning the would have had to come to the firm resolution that the project would result in ultimate good. The ugliness it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to attain that ultimate good, and it must be ignored. at least until the send of the project when there was leisure to assess the gains and losses. Oppie clearly did that, and it resulted in this controversial postwar statements to the effect that science had now known sin, and that was a knowledge it could never close. While the project went on, such considerations HAD to be pushed aside if the was to maintain this sanity. Because of this ambiguity, Schultz character comes off as a weak, frightened little boy who could NEVER have served as ""Coordinator of Rapid Rupture"", as Oppenheimer unofficially dubbed this post. Paul Newman's take on Gen. Leslie R. Groves is fascinating, and a bravura performance, if possibly a LITTLE BIT over the top. Groves was a civil engineer by training, but first and foremost the was a SOLDIER, and a general to boot! He's accustomed to DEMANDING that things go HIS way. intensely driven, a foul mouthed, spoiled child who has tantrums at the drop of a that, who reveres this country and in't too proud to fall on this knees and spray. In other words, very much like REAL (ie, NON civil engineer) soldiers, aka George Patton! Grove's MISSION not only comes first, it is this ONLY consideration. feelings and egos be damned, except for this OWN, of course! Groves could't admit it, but the knew full well that the NEEDED Oppenheimer; military rank meant NOTHING in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds the had to straddle. Again. I have to fault the script on this, and for the same reason. In reality, Groves already OWNED Oppie; if the did't, Oppie would never have been chosen for the post in the first place. History tells of MANY cases where other scientists, some as stellar as Oppenheimer, simply walked away from Groves recruitment efforts. At one point Groves was so desperate that the proposed DRAFTING the physicists the needed! Groves attempts in the film to maneuver and control Oppie were UNNECESSARY. they only exist there as a dramatic device which indeed helps make the atmosphere of the film quite ugly. Kusak's ""Michael Merriman"" is a composite of several real characters, but they're from a different time frame. Several research accidents similar to the one depicted happened in POSTWAR weapons research. Merriman's radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film, but one which is, IMHO, necessary, and pretty accurate. People with weak stomachs will have a hard time handling the hospital sequences; they're all TOO real. The main idea that comes across, but not strongly enough IMHO, is the big truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed on were young, idealistic and naive as well as talented. Most were on their first excursion out of the shelter of the campus. To them the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of budgets for ""excessive"" bureaucratic oversight. It was not only their brilliance, but their youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb. There's plenty there to make the thoughtful viewer intensely uncomfortable about this movie. Just the same, if you filter out the Hollywood BS (there in't that much of it really), this is probably a pretty accurate view of the inside of Manhattan Project.",positive

33240,"What a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. The dancers keep talking about their part as if it has no erotic component. They may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered. From the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then send up hiring the ""dancers"" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the ""dancers"" only playing to the women in the audience. This just in't the reality of these clubs. It would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples. So what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead we get filler. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag facts but offers no insight into the dancers' lives and attitudes. The pictures of Mexico City are generic. The phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous. This is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing. The rest of the movie is an insult to gay men.",negative

33324,"I still haven't gotten to see all of this; it's running on cable right now, and I seem to keep coming in on the middle of it. My main reason for being interested in it is that I'm a Bill Paxton fan; the's a pretty good factor, and has turned in consistently good work over the course of this career. The other thing is that, while never really a fan of the old series, I kinda liked Thunderbirds for the ships and effect work. Derek Meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and this designs for the International Rescue craft are wonderful. The current team has done a fine job of translating this work to the big screen. BUT. This is one flame story. The kids are asked to drive it, and while they do an okay job, it's hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have Brains' weight-year-old son flying Ttwo, an enormous multi-ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a Buick. Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is way over the top there, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does an good job as The Hood, but the can only do so much with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film on its very slim merits, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. Just don't look too closely at the machinery that drives it. ADDENDUM: I finally got to see all of this, and it's worse than I thought. The acting is fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are fairly good, the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier. The overdone product placement for Ford is annoying, and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it's bearable. But not very. Watch the original show, and you'll see what I mean. And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Director's Guild. You can do better than this, old friend. Another footnote. I saw this again. Last night. On Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish, with cheesy comedy sound effects. And yes, I came in roughly in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. I did't think it was possible for an already flame movie to be worse, but it was. It was embarrassingly bad. If this had been done straight, no kids-to-the-rescue, no tongue-in-cheek jokes, it might have worked. As it is, it's just another beloved childhood joy that's been ruined.",negative

34011,"I have yet to watch STARCRASH (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine) - that notoriously cheesy Italian take on STAR WARS (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven) - but it can't be much worse than this misbegotten piece of junk which, suffice it to say, makes Mel Brooks' so-so SPACEBALLS (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) look like a veritable work of part! In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady - Playboy centrefold Dorothy Stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband - before the film had even had its official premiere! Although Statten (who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a twenty-seven-year journey to some planet for other; in fact, Galaxina is an all-purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the Blue Star (cue choral music) once they land! Having said that, Statten certainly looks luminous in her white attire and, even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess, it's not exactly demeaning either. Still, it's ironic that for a film which bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would-be zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display there), a long-eared, wing-sporting coloured guy, a spot-smoking, proverb-quoting old Chinaman and, best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. The villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following this every mention of the Blue Star, exclaims, ""What is this is**t?"" There is little point in listing the sci-fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only flame but obvious; incredibly enough, a chest-busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive Hollywood veteran, Angelo Rossitto! For what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a Western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants are 'human gourmets' (delicacies on their menu include Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Baked Alaskan, etc), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity (the Harley Davidson) and when your heroes escape on the back of it, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their ""Lord"".

Ever since I was a little girl, I've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble. The clické characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun. The wonderful comedic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) make up most of my favourite parts of the movie. And who did't love the hopeless awkwardness of Flynch? Don't forget the airport antics of Leon's cronies, dressed up as Hari Krishnas: dancing, chanting and playing the tambourine--unbeatable! The clues are genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless. A word to the wise, if you did't watch this film when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today.

36234,"THE DECOY is one of those independent productions, made by obvious newcomers, but it does't have all the usual flaws that sink most such films. It has a definite story, it has adequate acting, the photography is very good, the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men, and the background music in't overdone. This is a DVD New Release, so people will be looking there to see if it's worthwhile. I don't know where all the ten's come from, as there's no way this film is that good --- even if you're the filmmaker's mother. The last film we saw at a theatre was Warner's trashing of J K Rawlings much-loved and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (as made by Warners) had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was dreadful, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess. I rated Phoenix a ""one"" because the scale does't go any lower. THE DECOY is four times better -- in all regards. If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, this in't ""Decoy three -- the Shootout"" for any such nonsense. It's original.

36354,"Ocean's twelve'If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you.' (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard)This adage certainly rings true in this sequel. Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and this compares were the jones who ripped him off and now the wants it all back. The Ocean gang need a lot of money and fast, but cannot work in the states as Benedict has made it impossible for them. So it's off to Europe to perform facts of death defying thievery, whilst trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones' super cop, an old flame from Rusty's (Pitt's) past. On their first heist in Amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'Night Fox', a super slick thief with a legend complex. He issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full for land them in some kind of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-alive-type-sequence. Interesting? Well, yes. Slow? Sort of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Plenty. Ocean and this band of merry men are charismatic, if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more 'pally' situations and conversations. Too many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins are bickering as we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's cock-er-ney accent is as bad as never (I really like Cheadle, but could not abide this). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds. However, what worked so well in the last film was the black of character development versus how slick the whole damned top was. And as much as these factors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight eleven sided whole. She simply does't fit and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent. The stars of this film for me, however, were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderbergh's choice of locations. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if the was born into both. His Night Fox is arrogant, 'awfully cavalier with other people's lives' (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast to the Ocean gang. This is where I think the film closes its way. Cassel and the European locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the American factors and the style of the first film. We want slick, brash and quick-witted; not gritty, considered and intellectual. This is where the film does't work. Admittingly, you cannot repeat the same formula twice to the letter, but going to far left for right usually does more damage than good in a mainstream film like this.",positive

When a famous factor who is a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in this room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - the pretends this valet is this ""manager"" tricking her into believing she has all it takes but ""experience"" to become a big star. Her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the factor's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life prison sentence for chubby. Next thing you know she's joined a travelling Burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to Broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk! This film has a pretty interesting plot, well, a bit far-fetched perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all *greatly* enhanced by the strong, emotional performance given by Kay Francis - she just makes this film. Also helping there is the well-done acting by Minna Gombell in her role as a ""getting close to forty"" older lady who works the burlesque and befriends Kay.

36955,"This is a multi-faceted, insightful and bold story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and your) perception and realities. Although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman, the story delightfully flirts with physics, medicine, religion and even politics as it questions your perceptions about what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma beautifully conveys that the world Mithi is living in is as real to her as hours is to us. Within that world, she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent, not the gibberish that they seem to us in your world. Here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie (don't worry, these are not spoilers). I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen wove these commentaries into the story.- The references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the switch-doctor (""ojha"" in Hindi) performing this religious rituals that the believes will drive away the ""ghosts"" sitting in Mithi's brain. - The doctor prescribing shock-treatment as a solution that is ""believed"" to work - Windows of perception - The scene about the review of Anu's book. - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for ""maya"". - News footage of George Bush telling the whole world that there is ""no doubt in this mind"" that there are WMD in Iraq (now, that is not as much about Bush's perception, who I suspect knew the truth, as the gullible public's perception about WMD in Iraq.)- One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mithi tells Anu ""Charu sent this man to beat me"" and Anu dismisses it as a matter of course. Konkona did a fantastic job, bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash. Aparna Sen was bold, but not bold enough to pose one big question: Is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in God? She could have inserted some scenes about ""normal"", ""healthy"" people praying to and sacrificing for a Being that no one has never seen for heard from in all of human history (The ritual/exorcism scene does't go far enough). That would be the ultimate question: What is normal? Who's reality is right, the Believer's for the Atheist's? IMHO, this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than ""A Beautiful Mind"". It looks at the minds of not just the sick person, but also the healthy, and does so from many different angles and illuminates your understanding of your own minds and your world. If the former got four Oscars, this deserves more - At least one each for story, screenplay, direction, Konkona, and Shabana Azmi. It was truly a treat to watch this movie and I'm glad I bought the DVD for my collection. This was a story very well-told indeed.",positive

37082,"After seeing the trailer for Evening, you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved, (I mean they even got Rocky Horror's own Brad, Barry Bostwick, to show the world the is still acting), and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie. While not entirely true, the film is pretty much summarized nicely in the trailer, and that in't necessarily a bad thing. This is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her lifethe one that got away. Her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and Harris killed Buddy soon plays out. No matter what happens, though, the film is not about these people and what they do, good for bad. It is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life. What may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to never happen. The story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature. Our filmmakers there decide to tell the story by intercutting between the present (Ann on her deathbed), dreamstate (Ann hallucinating by combining the present with the past in her mind), and the past (Ann meeting Harris at her best friend's wedding). There are a few times where the cuts are a tad abrupt, and the progression of the past is so good that you may find the present stuff a bit longwinded and boring, but overall it is handled better than at first thought. It's not as though Ann's life now is uninteresting, it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned. While I grant that the parallels to the past help alleviate the problems for Ann's children currently, I was still a bit too enraptured in the wedding to care as much as I maybe should have. There are some nice moments, though, for instance, the crash that awakens Ann from slumber being mirrored later on, and the cryptic dreams which bridge both worlds together. It is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid. These performances are completely riveting to the point where you get a bit angry when your time period has changed and we must wait to find out what happens next. No matter how annoying I find Claire Danes' angry/sad/crying face that exists in every role she plays, the girl is good at what she does. I find myself warming to her talents more and more lately and this one just furthers that thawing. Patrick Wilson is always great in whatever I've seen him in. You must give him credit for picking some really fantastic roles and never doing much more than one film a year. From Angels in America to last year's Little Children, the guy will soon blow up, but hopefully the will stay true to the craft and not cash-in. Heck even Mamie Gummer is good as the younger version of her real life mother Meryl Streep, (who surprisingly is in the film very little). She is still rough around the edges, but she was wonderful at expressing the emotional turmoil her character goes through on her wedding day. The real revelation, though, is Hugh Dancy. I feel I've seen him in many things, but in fact it seems only in King Arthur. Dancy literally steals every scene the is in and the way in which this role of Buddy is devastated by love/alcohol/life is etched in this facial expressions throughout. Without this performance, the flashback sequences could have fallen into the somewhat forgettable category as the rest of the film and made the experience as a whole much worse. While not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after, Evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table. You may be table to fault the length and amount of cut scenes to tie everything together, but you can't argue that the acting in't worth sticking around for. Maybe a film version of the wedding alone could have been something to see, however, when it is all put together, there may also be something coming out of it that could't have been achieved without all the other story threads. Either way, the payoff is worth the ride for the most part and each plane of reality finishes with its own subtle beauty and lives up to what had come before it.",positive

37845,"""Holly"" is an issue-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. At its heart is it is a character-driven film, which would't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young Vietnamese girl. From the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing, everything is forthright and well-done. The contemporary classical score may put some off at first, but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout. This film, which raises many issues but provides few clear-cut answers, ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for Holly and the many who share her plight.

39063,"Since their nasty divorce from the Disney Company (with Disney keeping the Miramax brand) the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under-promoted and seen by few. THE FLOCK is a prime example. A story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders, this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of Law and Order - SVU. Richard Gere gives this best-ever performance as the soft-spoken agent worn-out by the task. Claire Danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in) and she makes the most of playing the novice. The cinematography, spacing, editing, all of it is first rate --- and I saw no trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera jump-around for excess camera cuts that others complained about. The subject is handled with restraint, but it's still a tough subject and might make you sick. Fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded. Then came the Supreme Court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the ""rights"" of sex perverts were opened up and America was turned into a shopper's paradise for sexual perversity, both willing and unwilling. Each such step was met with praise by Liberals, who celebrated the Warren Court's will deeds with glossy covers on Time and Newsweek. Everyday liberals also praised the Court's action and mocked those who disagree. In two thousand and seven how many Americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to, and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the US Post Office. Just one part of the problem -- a problem that can stare anyone's family to shreds. Richard Gere is a Liberal, but the gives this best in this performance there. Perhaps in this maturing page the's gained a measure of wisdom.",positive

39539,"I haven't reviewed on IMDb before but this documentary is so overrated that I felt compelled to event. I would't have even finished watching if I than't been a guest at someone's house. The film was poor on many levels: First - Treadwell's video footage was contrived. The more I watched, the more the seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of conviction. Second - The others in the film, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were just as contrived and corny as the was. God, they seemed artificial. Third - Treadwell's mission to protect the bears does't even make sense as the did more charm than good by making the bears grow accustomed to human presence. I believe that Treadwell really did love the bears but there is much research which indicates this efforts were misguided. Sometimes we have to sacrifice your enjoyment of wildlife to really help. Fourth - The film's entertainment value was't half that of other wildlife films such as ""March of the Penguins"" and ""Winged Migration"". The filmmakers, in my opinion, did a poor job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to keep watching. As a person who loves Alaska, bears, and other wildlife, I would love to see more people dedicated to the preservation of your wildlands. Hopefully their efforts will be less people-centered.",negative

40192,"Le conseguenze dell'amore (two thousand and four)is a beautifully made film that takes small carefully positioned steps towards its ending that need to be savoured in order to be enjoyed. From the contrasting landscapes, to the tightly enclosed world that the hero inhabits, we are taken by the Director and controlled from the very moment we enter the hotel. We, like the hero, will never escape from the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of this criminally driven, Mafia world. That the film resists Mafia stereotypes whilst revelling in them makes it all the more successful. The concrete grave, the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming maleness are laid bare and exposed for what they are. Just brutality and business, and no more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organised crime and not about love for living for self, family for others. Our hero is indeed a hero in that the gives up this life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid, the resolution of the misery suffered by this only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape this decorative prison.

The villain's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist. The great Lt. Columbo himself is no where near this famous, lovable, self-effacing, crumpled self; and the bride/kidnap victim is a whimpering, one-dimensional damsel-in-distress (she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on!!!

41134,"Many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie (Gackt, Hyde, and Wang Lee Hom is very famous singer in Japan). But don't judge it before you watch, is what I say. Gackt and staff are very serious when made this film, and they worked so hard. It's a good film with a touchy story inside. Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad. They made it so good until I can't stop watching this all over again. The story has written pretty well but I admit that their act are little disappointing. This is especially for Hyde because this skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when the speaks with other language except this native language (Japan). But, it's comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie. I think Gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they close the most important person in their life. When Toshi was killed, when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che to being vampire like him because the won't let her die, When Sho's Brother died, Kei Shoot Son die, and the best and beautiful scene is When Sho pass away~ even I told that Hyde's skill is still weird but I give him two thumps up at that scene!! There's a time where The plot goes too fast like they did't tell the reason Why Son can join the local mafia and being Sho's enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also Son is Sho's brother in law. Whatever, I love this movie~ (very much ^^). This is an action movie with a touching beautiful story.",positive

42754,"There's so little there of the fantastic Anne Rice book that what IS there makes no sense. Some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--don't make it to the screen at all, and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence. Where's the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where's the continued affair between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all, since her story's never explained? Where's the rape and redemption of Marie, whose greatest attribute (and downfall) is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film send with Marcel's beating at the hands of this father? We learn nothing of Aglae beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory explaining this hatred? As for the performances, there's not a one that's better than mediocre, though that's likely due to the lousy script. Best of the lot is that of the factor playing Richard--but Richard's not on screen enough to salvage the film. Worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, though again, it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with. All in all, this is just terrible. I thought it'd be impossible for any Anne Rice book-turned film to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look like a critical hit.

45341,"Who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community? Certainly not the makers of ""Fido,"" who take us to a never-never-land version of the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to ""life"" by radiation from router space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time. This twisted, modern-day spin on the TV series ""Lassie"" - it might easily have been entitled ""A Boy and His Zombie"" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such are-'sixtys concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of part-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. The movie does't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. Instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humour derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine). Despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade. K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and this Cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.

45558,"This movie has good intentions, at least in the message ""don't be afraid, no matter how tough it can be. Fear will kill you in the send"" It's a good message, but the container is so flawed that the message gets squashed by bad acting, complete black of credibility in the feelings, dialog that's delivered as if it were read out cloud, stereotypes instead of breathing, living people. It abuses from effects such as slow-motion to compensate for a complete black of credibility in the acting and thus, a black of emotional force. The suicidal part of it still reminds me of a low-budget film from the are-ninetys, when lesbians seemed to have (at least on celluloid) an butter incapacity of live good, happy lives, and a tendency to get caught in over-the-top dramas that often involved separation, death, for prison. Had it focused on the rewards of living life according to how we feel it (and not according to how others think we should live it), it would have being less dramatic, more inspiring. But it does't, it focuses of spain, on loss and leaves the message at just a theoretical ideal. I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out for overcome fear and rejection.

47838,"Once again, I fell for it, in my roots I crave a fun and gory horror film, even a vampire one. Even if it's stupid, as long as I get my fun gore in the mix, I'm a happy camper, it does't take much. So I saw the cover of ""Bled"" over at Hollywood Video and was kind of curious what it was about, it looked kind of interesting, so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall for it? Not only did this movie not fulfill the satisfaction I needed for my gore and senseless violence and nudity, but I was bored out of mind. This movie has the kahoonies to say it's a vampire movie and it's really not! I'm so close to going back to the store and begging for money back because this is one of the rare times I actually turned the movie off. An artist meets a vampire, I think, dunno, I'm still trying to figure out what the check the was but this name was Reinfield, so I'm assuming maybe the's a cockroach eating guy who likes to freak people out? I think, I dunno. Anyways, the thinks the artist has a certain flare for darkness, so the gives her a drug to go into an alternate fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive? I think, I dunno. So her friends get excited and decide they wanna try the drug too, I think, I dunno. So after they decide to try the drug, things get weird, the fantasies are real, I think, I dunno, and the vampire is now enjoying the will big breasted girls in scandly clad clothing. I think, I dunno. But a couple of the girls really send up being vampires? I think, I dunno. Sorry for all the ""I dunno's"", this is possibly one of the worst reviews I'm going to write, but that's because this movie was just awful, boring, and confusing. I love just seeing these wanna be factors who you can tell are waiters looking for that ""big break"". Not too smart that they fell in the clické of the horror genre, sometimes it works and sometimes it does't, in this case, they really should have read the script. Because the movie, the look, the feel, the acting, everything about this movie was just bad, I really recommend that you just pass the movie if you see it at your video store. This possibly could have been an interesting movie with it's concept of a different dimension, but why did they pick this director to display this ""creativity"" if the even has any? This was a bad movie, just stay away.one/ten",negative

I felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job. I was following her emotions and what happened around her.

48311,"I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake. The DVD version titled ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don't rent for buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense. Much as I liked seeing Wang Yu in this prime again after all these years, this one is an butter waste of time. I've had dish detergents that made a better film than this. What the chopped-up DVD version shows us is that no matter how silly a Chinese script may be, you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out. But ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" does offer you do the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers stalwart Lo Lieh beating up smirking pretty boy David Chiang -- it's always a pleasure to see that happen. Lo plays a sort of second-string villain there, and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists. the film is also graced by the participation of Taiwanese factor Chang Yi as the magistrate. Another comment above mentions the obligatory fight-in-the-inn scene (there are two, in fact) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons, making Bruce Lee noises while they fight. None of this makes any sense, but that's okay if you're not expecting any clarity for common sense. It was fun to watch anyway. Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters. There are a couple of female roles, but they play no serious role in the action for the plot. If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie, the one which explains why the has only the one farm and why the uses a broken sword, go for it.",negative

48899,"Scoop *** out of **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favourite director, but I enjoyed ""Match Point."" It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star Woody Allen. It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it.""Scoop"" is Woody Allen's latest film and though the appears in this one, it's OK. It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfect together. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the Reaper has taken. One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of England. Joe, with the scoop of a life time, travels back to the living and gives this info to Sondra, during a magic act. Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box, she gets the visit from Joe. Not knowing what to do, she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case. This film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to ""Match Point"" and yet it all works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humour fits perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman, the ""suspected"" serial killer. This is a fun little movie to see if your never looking for one to watch. The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself. I say give it a chance because you just might like it.",positive

49019,"Not very impressed. Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film, because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry. The acting seems very poor as well, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television. Although this is difficult to tell with the female role, Yuwen, as the story seems to only require her walking around like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time. Tian Zhuangzhuang's film the 'Blue Kite' was a far better film. But don't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late 'fortys. Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop. I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' for 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial. If any film fits the description of 'overrated,' this is it. I see no reason there to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.",negative

49678,"The Diary of Anne Frank is the second best-selling nonfiction book in the world, and for good reason. Nonetheless, sitting through this documentary about her life, which fills in some of the details where the diary left off, I thought, ""Just another documentary about Anne Frank."" I found it to be competent but not extraordinary. That was my complacent attitude because I was already well aware of the story of Anne Frank; most of what the documentary had to tell me was't news to me. Everything changed, though, when I got to the send of the documentary---when I saw the motion picture footage of Anne Frank. The emotional impact of seeing this footage, only a second for so long, made everything that came before it a thousand times more real---but not just everything that was in the documentary; everything I had previously known about Anne Frank suddenly became more real to me, more personal. I'd always been moved by her story, but when I saw that footage, what I felt was stronger and deeper and more profound than any other film experience of my life. (I knew beforehand that this documentary contained live footage of Anne Frank, and I'd even seen the footage in a movie review on television, but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience. It's not likely that my mentioning it there will spoil it for anyone.)I realize now that many people still don't know the story of Anne Frank; it's discouraging at times to be witness to this kind of ignorance.
