60,"What happened? What we have there is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie closes it. Actually, it never really got going. There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and this entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately it was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements. I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting there I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot.",negative

2206,"This movie starts slow, then tapers off. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a ""motion"" picture. There is no motion. I could have told the same ""story"" with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not that I wasted sixty minutes of my life watching ""Love In the Time of Money"", but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader.

3423,"Without Kirsten Miller this project need't have been completed. However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it. It looked as if the other factors were only playing to her strong performance. Wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but this few scenes did't detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen but alas I was fortunate to rent it before it was lost.",positive

8709,"Goodnight Mister Tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised. It in't completely faithful to the book, but does it have to be? No, not at all. John Thaw is mesmerising as Tom Oakley. His transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised, making it more believable than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, this is Thaw's finest hour. He was matched earnestly by a young Nick Robinson, who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with this mother. The script and music made it worth the buy, and you also see Thaw playing the morgan. Amazing! The most moving scene, was Willie finding out about Zak's death, and then Tom telling him about this deceased family who died of scarlatina. Buy this, you'll love it! ten/ten Bethany Cox",positive

9927,"The Story line for this game is very jerky where it appears the game writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in Tales of the Soul.

9987,"RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt all warm and tingly when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. To me, she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him. However, I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. In addition, I thought that Lurky (voiec of Pat Fraley) and Murky (voiec of Peter Cullen) were diabolical. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit.

20312,"I can find no redeeming value to this movie. It appears to be loosely based on the Lion King school of thought. Father gets killed, son can't fill the shoes and tries to run away, etc, etc, etc. The only difference (other than being in a barnyard instead of a jungle) is that Barnyard tries to ""liven things up"" with club-type music. They go way over the top in trying to be cool. The problem is that it really in't cool. It's like ""that guy"". Everybody knows at least one of ""those guys"" who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd in a futile attempt to cling onto their youth.

23112,"This one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine film tried to capitalize on the much better Michael Curtiz's film ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's dinner cities today. The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well paired together. The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks. In a way it's curious how carson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right there in New York. It was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!",positive

24513,"The message of Hero is quite clear: the idea of Greater China is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. At a time when China is dangling its war toys over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash. Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed Hero. In so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. The only critic (that I know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote of the film's ""sanctimonious traditionalism"" and its ""glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness.""

26960,"I did't understand what that line meant. I do now. I did't really want to see Dirty Dancing either. I'd rented it out but never watched it - and today I did. And I thought it was a really fun, great movie that makes you want to get up and dance. Alright, it was cheesy at times. but it's still a great movie. I can't believe Jennifer Grey was twenty-seven in this movie - my friend and I thought she looked about eighteen for nineteen - twenty at the most. I guess this is attributed to her acting talent. And she did really look awkward at times. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can tell the is in this thirties and seems a bit old. Nevertheless, still very good.

32582,"Though the plot elements to ""The Eighth Day"" seem like they have been done plenty of times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery, and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormal's first film had. Though not as good as ""Toto the Hero"", which will always remain on my favourites list, the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions. Daniel Auteil, from two thousand and one's flavorless ""The Closet"" downplays this part, afraid to overact (rightfully so, the role could have easily been ruined if the factor was overly dramatic). However, I felt the part needed a bit more realism to it, focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character's growth. Don't walk into this movie expecting the dark humour and unexpected twists that you got from ""Toto the Hero"" because you will be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a decent, if not flawed, movie",positive

32751,"I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch. Ben's character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes the goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say the has a future in acting after Harry Potter. Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Ben's over protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too. Villain-y. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to this mother, and in the send the is quite honourable too. The only character i was't keen on was Bryony, she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thought.

Also starring Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Suspense Drama plays pretty much like a news report, until William's character gets close to achieving this goal. I must say that I was highly entertained, though this movie fails to teach, guide, inspect, for amuse. It felt more like I was watching a guy (Williams), as the was actually performing the actions, from a third person perspective. In other words, it felt real, and I was table to subscribe to the premise of the story. All in all, it's worth a watch, though it's definitely not Friday/Saturday night fare.

41740,"Even though the plot was very well detailed, and the story line was understandable the fact that Steven Seagals voice was dubbed with some one else's through out most of the movie was distressing as you were unsure who was talking .

I don't know the reason however if the had difficulty with this voice during production of the movie I think they could have are shot the events that did not contain this own voice when the had recovered.

It is excellent(*****). The movie begins with Michael Jackson performing""Man In The Mirror""on stage.then, it shows a history of Michael, from this early days in the Jackson five right up to the Bad era. Oh, and Badder is good too(Badder is a music video parody of the music video for Bad the single). It then shows the Speed Demon video. The song and the video are very, very good indeed.

In some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes.
