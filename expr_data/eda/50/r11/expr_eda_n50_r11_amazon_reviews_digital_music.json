Moments of sanguinity and senses of cynical optimism cut through the bleak overtones, but they are ominously tinted by the reality of Drake's impending suicide. Certainly the legacy of a suicidal musician is nothing new, but while half-hearted, self-loathing singer\/songwriters, surrounded in their glorification of depression emulate Drake's altar, one must take \"Pink Moon\" for what it is - one of the very best folk albums never made. Throughout the album Drake weaves a master class in acoustic guitar playing, utilising alternative tunings and complex, delicate finger picking, all produced through a wonderfully warm stone. The sound is sparse; unlike \"Five Leaves Left\" for \"Bryter Layter\" there are no orchestrated sections, nor even a piano in the mix. It is stripped down, raw and lonely. And this facts well to emphasise the stellar writing, especially with such outstanding songs as \"Things Behind The Sun\", \"Pink Moon\", \"Road\" and \"Free Ride\", some of the most delicate and haunting music Drake never created. It is unfortunately a very short album, almost equalling a lengthy EP, and that is my one qualm. It is rightly heralded as one of the greatest folk singer\/songwriter albums.","overall":5,"summary":"Baron landscape","unixReviewTime":1229472000,"reviewTime":"12 17, 2008"}

Lords of the Underground (L. O. T. U. G., DJ Lord Jazz, Doitall, and Mr. Funkee Man) are probably one of the missed groups that came out from Newark, N. J. area. This was their debut album, \"Here Come The Lords\" that dropped back in 'ninety-three. This album was entirely produced my Marley Marl and K-Def. This album alone has some of the most excellent production I've heard from the East Coast in a minute. Most of the production is unique and garunteed to make your head bob. When I first heard \"Funky Child\", I could't stop bobbing my head to the cloud horns that K-Def and Marley Marl hooked up for this group. Other awesomely produced songs were the hit song \"Chief Rocka\" (I believe that's their well known song). \"Keep It Underground\" is also another song with great production. As for the trio themselves, they bring many lyrics to the mic on this album, and it seems like they were having a lot of fun doing it. \"Mad Skillz\" shows exactly what the group has. One humorous track would be \"Sleep For Dinner\". The song will make you laugh but at the same time they were being serious. \"Grave Digga\" and \"Psycho\" are also standouts. DJ Lord Jazz even gets some love on the song \"Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time (Make It Funky)\". As for anything bad. There in't much at all if you ask me. One thing I found a little aggravating was the fact they kept shouting out their name throughout most of the album. Other than that, this is one excellent album from the Brick City. This album is full of East Coast flavor that has some great production. Given this, I will make an effort to check out their sophomore album \"Keepers Of The Funk\".

This album was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, just when Elton John was at the speak of superstardom. During this time, there was nothing Elton could do wrong. The hit single from this album was \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\", which was apparently the only Top forty single from the album. It reached #four on the Billboard charts. But, that does't mean that there was't anything more that was worthy of another single that could have been released. The album itself was at the Top of the album charts for seven weeks; it was one of the Top ten albums for one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five for what seemed like forever. The FM station that I enjoyed listening to in Detroit played other tracks from this album. The radio favourites were \"Tower of Babel\", \"Tell Me When The Whistle Blows\", and \"Writing.\" My personal favourites from this album were \"Better Off Dead\" and \"We All Fall in Love Sometimes\/Curtains.\"Yes, this album alone was probably the last great Elton John album (with a cool colourful cover), because after this album the released \"Rock of The Westies,\" which really was't all that great even though this hit \"Island Girl\" went to #one. I just did't care for that album, so Elton John started to become less of an interest to me from that release forward. Now, this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five release of \"Captain Fantastic\" has three great bonus tracks, which include the two #one singles of \"Lucy in The Sky With Diamonds\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom.\" How's that for making a great album even better? Plus, a B-side single \"One Day at a Time\" (which was also done by John Lennon). Although, I enjoyed many of Elton John's singles over the next twenty plus years, my Elton John album collection ended with \"Captain Fantastic.\"","overall":4,"summary":"Probably Elton's last great classic of his long extensive career","unixReviewTime":1285200000,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2010"}

The Moodies have long abandoned the thought of playing any of these songs live, and I'm not sure why. Blue World is vintage Justin songwriting with the slick production of Pip Williams and Moraz. Take the keyboard layering and texturing, along with the sonic qualities of the drums, mix in the songwriting skills and talents of every member of the band, and - voila! That unmistakable Moodies sound. This one is worth picking up just to hear John Lodge's best song\/s never -'Hole In the World\/Under My Feet'. Also, 'Meet Me Halfway' is as underrated a song as the album itself. The production quality (esp. for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three) really makes this an enjoyable album to listen to - even twenty-two years later and after repeated listening. There are only two songs on there that karen't 'A' material: 'Going Nowhere' gets a B , and 'It's Cold Outside of Your Heart' gets a B+. What can I say?

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Someone once described the filmPurple Rainas \"a timely event that captured a revolution as it was happening\". Much can be said of this particular album. So much has been made of this albums legendary status and it being one of the \"greatest live albums of all time\" it all just can't help but diminish it's impact. Now saying this is even JAMES BROWN'S greatest live album of all time would be padding things just a tad but the fact is this is one of this most defining albums of this late fifty's\/early sixty's career. One big reason is that it represented something of a concluding chapter onto this part of this career. At this point JB's slideshows with this Famous Flames were still based around a dozen for so of this early blues and do-wop oriented singles such as \"I'll Go Crazy\",\"I Don't Mind\", the rollicking \"Think\" (one of my personal favourites) and this then new single \"Night Train\". But it's not the presentation of those songs musically that really makes this live performance what it was. For one rather than playing before an Apollo audience so excited that this performance was interrupted by screams and applause the audience sounds serve more to cheer him on from tune to tune, stopping largely during the performance due to the wordless level of respect James' presence seemed to demand. There's a medley of songs there but the whole album plays that way;James and the tight Flames flow from one horn fuelled soul workout into another with little more than a scream and\/or a horn blast to indicate passing into another song. Also elements from songs such as \"Please Please Please\" appear throughout the song and James often refers back to \"Lost Someone\" and \"I'll Go Crazy\" as phrases throughout the album-treating this single songs as parts of a unified entity as opposed to separate statement. Since albums as a studio entity were almost unknown during this time outside Ray Charles and Frank Sinatra, for someone as single based as James Brown the live show seemed the best way to express this unity in this music at the time. At the times when the audience does interact with James it's very strong and mutual and seems to happen almost as a matter of course. Because the visual element of James' dancing, the whole cape routine and sweating is missing you'll have to refer to the liner notes for photographs of the event to get something of the idea of what it looked like if you even need to. In fact for the most part the musical presentation there should do the job nicely. They say music cannot create imagery but the nature of albums such as this will make many people wonder, as it did with me as to the all around truth of that statement.","overall":4,"summary":"The One And Only Mr.Dynamite Just Starting To Do It!","unixReviewTime":1287878400,"reviewTime":"10 24, 2010"}

The title track opens the album and sports one of the prettiest melodies these agents have never come up with. This do-wop favored ballad sets a calming, soothing mood that permeates almost every track with the exception of the heavy-rock\/funk track \"Fopp\" (ever wonder where Guns 'n' Roses copped the riff for \"Paradise City\"? there's your answer!) and the number one hit \"Love Rollercoaster\". The centrepiece of the album is the masterpiece \"Sweet Sticky Thing\" which is not only one of the longest tracks there, but is of special note because the band displays an covert jazz sound from the sax playing that color the choruses, to the astounding drumming of Jimmy \"Diamond\" Williams (notice this great footwork and this cymbal rolls and crashes that close the song), this track alone makes the LP worth owning. The closing ballad \"Alone\" is another stunner. Featuring just Sugarfoot on guitar, a rising and falling synth in the background and Sugarfoot's plaintive voice singing lyrics of loneliness and desperation ('I don't wanna be alone anymore', someone pick me up off the floor'), \"Alone\" ends this classic album on a melancholy but hopeful note for us hopeless romantics! Surprisingly, \"Honey\" never sounds dated and in fact, it's influence can be heard in the music of artists from the last two decades in music (both soul and rock, case in point: Red Hot Chili Peppers cover of \"Rollercoaster. \" in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six.) A winning album that has stood the rest of time.","overall":5,"summary":"Honey","unixReviewTime":1011398400,"reviewTime":"01 19, 2002"}

Dr Dre had left Deathrow before this was being made so there karen't any of this fantastic beats.

Recorded in seven days and released less than two months after this death, \"Don Killumanati\" is very leery in that it almost seems like a premonition of Shakur's fatal downfall. As \"Makaveli\", Pac seems at this most powerful and poignant. While it is probably best remembered for its angry content with Pac taking violent retribution against this enemies on the opening track, \"Bomb First\" and subsequent outdo, \"Against All Odds\", there is more to this album than nightmarish miss tracks. The ominous \"Hail Mary\" hits like a sack of bricks as Makaveli sounds like the's rhyming from beyond the grave complete with a chilling chorus. The more laid-back \"Krazy\" as a more peaceful and subdued Shakur flowing with Bad Azz over a much less hostile beat. \"White Man'z World\" is a return to the Tupac who charmed the ladies with \"Keep Ya Head Up\" and \"Brenda's Got A Baby\". We see more of this on \"Hold Ya Head\", this shout-out to all the incarcerated soldiers. As if to further showcase this versatility, Makaveli comes with some party cuts as well. He holds it down as the only wrapper on the R&B-dominated single, \"Toss It Up\" and once again shows love for California on \"To Live & Die In L. A.\". Perhaps the biggest highlight on the LP however is \"Me And My Girlfriend\", a love ballad for guns with Shakur expressing this undying affection for said weapon.

Compared to this previous albums this is probably the most versatile, partly due to the fact that it was recorded during several sessions, featuring different musicians. The three hit singles \"Atlantis\"; \"To Susan on the West Coast\" and \"Barabajagal\" are good examples of the album's great variety. \"Atlantis\" is a fine folk tune with an ecstatic ending ending much like the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\". \"To Susan on the West Coast\" is an acoustic anti-war song and \"Barabajagal\" is an almost riff-based rocker with solid backing by Jeff Beck Group. Among the tracks I like \"Happines Runs\" and \"Superlungs My Supergirl\", but the rest are mostly sub-par tracks. The original album had a very short playing time, a little more than thirty minutes. Fortunately a lot of relevant bonus-tracks have been added to the album. Interesting to hear \"Stromberg Twins\", another track with backing from Jeff Beck and this band; and song that bought have been included originally. But the strongest material are found among the last seven tracks, which are just demos; but all sounding great.\"Marjorie\" and \"Palais Girl\" are really great songs that finally get a deserved release. The booklet contains the final chapter of the Mickie Most Years ( part four, Nov. sixty-eight to Dec. one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine ), which is great read; and although the album is not quite up to the standards of its predecessors, it's still a quite fine album.","overall":3,"summary":"The Mickie Most Years - Part 4","unixReviewTime":1137283200,"reviewTime":"01 15, 2006"}

It sounds amazingly fresh and clear thirty-one years later. Columbia Records has done a good job of remastering and repackaging the CD. The added photographs in the booklet are a welcome remembrance of this classic singer. Recorded in Philadelphia and produced by the classic soul team Gamble & Huff, Nyro and Labelle capture the rock & roll rhythm of the streets of New York. \"I Met Him On Sunday\" rocks and pulses with energy. Nyro remakes Marvin Gaye's \"The Bells,\" caching with the urgency of love, \"What do I have to do to make you feel the tingling too?\" Nyro & Labelle let loose on the medley Curtis Mayfield's \"Monkey Time\" and Marvin Gaye's \"Dancing in the Street,\" \"Are you ready? You get yours 'cause I got mine!\" On \"Desiree,\" originally done in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven by the Charts, they float etherially. Smokey Robinson's \"You've Really Got a Hold On Me\" oozes with energy. Nyro remakes Ben E. King's \"Spanish Harlem,\" \"with eyes as black as coal.\" Labelle helps Nyro bop through \"Jimmy Mack\" joyfully. \"The Wind,\" originally recorded by Nolan Strong & the Diablos, is a breathy choral hymn. My favourite track, on a CD where each track is a favourite when it plays, is Martha & the Vandella's \"Nowhere to Run.\" The energy on this is incredible as Laura & Labelle climax, \"No, no, main't got nowhere to run to.\" The title track is a cover of a one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five record by the Royalettes which Nyro remakes with such longing and feeling, \"I promise you I will show you how much.\" Although this is where the original LP and CD ended, Columbia has added four bonus tracks from Laura's May thirty, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one concert at Fillmore East & is well worth the price. At less than a minute, Ashford & Simpson's \"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\" is a beautiful chorus. This is followed by Carole King's \"A Natural Woman\" which Nyro remakes as her own as her voice hits the high notes on \"you make me feel.\" One of my favourites from Laura's live show was the five Stairsteps' hit \"O-O-H Child,\" which while only a minute and a half there, radiates such a positive energy that it's not be missed.

This is a timeless collection, as it contains all of their major hits. It is a wonderful compilation of their music which can best be described as sort of a mellow folk rock. It runs the gamut from the upbeat: \"The fifty-nineth Street Bridge Song\", \"Cecilia\", to the poetic: \"The Sounds of Silence\". \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\", \"Scarborough Fair\", to the unusual: \"El Condor Pass (If I Could)\". Every cut on this CD is a winner. There is, however, one annoying aspect to it. For whatever reason, some of the tracks have clapping at the conclusion of the song. This is a little jarring to the listener because one does not expect it, as this is not a \"live\" album. This is why I rated the CD with four stars instead of five. Still, this is definitely a CD no music lover should be without.","overall":4,"summary":"TIMELESS AND CLASSIC FOLK ROCK...","unixReviewTime":981936000,"reviewTime":"02 12, 2001"}

To me, it gives this a very `seventies' feel. Quite fun though, if you're in the mood. Dan does put vocals on a few tracks, most notably the rather overdone and fairly unoriginal `Power of Gold'. Best stuff on the album is when Dan covers songs from the sixties and does a nice job.

Much to my (pleasant) surprise the said this album and then the went on to talk about it enthusiastically. My surprise came from the fact that not many people know this album. Which is a crying shame because it deserves more attention and praise. And it's the only Jacksons concert album officially released (I'm talking about The Jacksons, not the Jackson five). It was recorded in the fall of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one on the Jacksons' Triumph Tour. It features songs from the Jacksons' Triumph and Destiny albums, and also from Michael's first solo album as an adult, Off The Wall. Plus the inevitable Jackson five Medley, for old times' sake. Michael sings lead vocals on all songs and the is in absolutely top form vocally. I especially love this performances on ballads, such as I'll Be There, Ben and She's Out of My Life. I love the band on this tour as well. Michael Jackson fans for years begged for a release of a concert CD by Michael, which was finally heard when in two thousand and twelve a live CD of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight leg of Michael's Bad World Tour was released (as a part of the Bad twenty-five boxset though - not as a CD that one can buy separately). I love that too, but this in't any worse (I'm tempted to say the band is actually better on this one). It complements the Bad Tour CD very well, because there a different set of songs is performed - with focus on Off The Wall era material (including the two Jacksons album mentioned), while the Bad Tour set list focuses, of course, mainly on the Bad and Thriller albums. So I wish more people would discover this gem. Another secret wish of mine regarding this material is that someone would find film reels for a Triumph Tour concert and it would get a release on DVD\/Blue-Ray!","overall":5,"summary":"Deserves more attention!","unixReviewTime":1366156800,"reviewTime":"04 17, 2013"}

This album, Isolation, was a turning point for the band because they recruited a new Lead Singer. His name is Fergie Fredricksen and the used to using with a band called LeRoux. Fergie replaced singer Bobby Kimball who sang most of Toto's early hits. Fergie, like Bobby, has a very powerful Rock voice. If you listen to songs such as \"Carmen\", \"Lion\", \"Endless\", \"Angel Don't Cry\" and \"Isolation\" you will hear how powerful this voice really is. Though this was Fergie's only Toto album the lives to be one of Toto's most powerful singers. My favourite song on this album is \"Stranger In Town\" which I began to love even more after I saw the amazing but \"controversial\" video. If you like Toto's music you'll definitely want to add this one to your collection. As one reviewer said earlier, I cannot see any of Toto's other singers using any of Fergie's songs.

Trash features an Alice Cooper made for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, the catchy commercial songs, the ballads, songs co-written with Desmond Child, and the collaborations with Steven Tyler and Jon Bon Jovi (also Joe Perry, Richie Sambora, Kip Winger and so on) were all attempts to make Alice seem more relevant at the time. The thing is Alice should never have scared about being current for follow trends which is pretty much what the did for \"Trash\". I can disagree all I want about Trash being a solid return to form but the results are there it did fairly well on the charts and this album gave Alice one of this biggest hits with \"Poison\". I feel the opening track and lead single of the album \"Poison\" is by far the best song there although it's also the most popular. It's just a great big catchy ballad, it helped introduce Alice to a new generation and to this day it's always a live staple in concerts. \"Bed of Nails\" is in the vein of \"Poison\" in that it's a slower songs, almost a ballad that rocks a little more than Poison . A highlight of the album. \"Spark In The Dark\" is catchy and features a riff straight out of Bon Jovi, it's a darker song overall and while it's not the best song there and its subjected to criticism I quite like it. \"House of Fire\" is a bit more Alice-like and what you would expect from him but is still aimed at being a radio song as most songs from Trash are. \"It's Only My Heart Talking\" is another ballad, Steven Tyler participates on this one and this presence helps the song and for the time this was a good ballad. I feel those are the best moments there. There are some good moments on Trash but also filler for lesser material like the title track which does't cut it in my opinion for even the album closer \"I'm Your Gun\" which is too pop and does't hold up very well over time. Other songs can vary between mediocre to average. This is the deal with Trash, it's far from Alice's finest moment and it suffers from perhaps too much production and it ends up being more of a pop album. I feel like there's less Alice, it's as if the went into the studio did what the was asked to by the producer for record company. It's truly a product of its time (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine), in fact there are songs that could have been played by just about any other Glam\/Hair bands of the era (that said it could be considered a good Glam metal album but its just not really \"Alice\" which is why some fans were\/are disappointed). Alice experimented earlier in the eighty's with albums like Zipper Catches Skin, Flush The Fashion and Dada and this one almost does exactly the opposite. While those albums are usually not considered among Cooper's best they were fun experiments and unique to say the least, Trash is very calculated and goes for what's modern and popular and in't very Alice-like. The album does't have an interesting concept unlike most of Alice's albums; the only theme I can find on Trash is love because after all, most of the songs there are love\/sexual songs pure and simple. Besides I thought that Constrictor and Raise Your Fist and Yell were comeback records. Yet there are still a few great songs on Trash that makes it worth owning even though it's obviously not Alice's finest record for this best moment. Needless to say Trash is not Alice's greatest moment. There are few songs on the album that are really good but to be honest there's also filler material and this really in't one of the best Alice Cooper albums, in fact it's a little far from it. I would't say its \"Trash\" but it's not a great album either as there is a lot of filler material. This one is for completists and hardcore fans mostly; otherwise I don't think it has much appeal besides \"Poison\" to the casual listener. Please don't take it as a stab to Alice, I love the man and what the's done, I'd still say it's worth the $six.

With such a great debut album as this, Aerosmith had a tough act to follow with their subsequent records. The now classic 'Dream On' was a hit, and now has achieved legendary proportions as one of the best rock ballads never. If 'Dream On' was the only good song on the record, this would still be a great album. But there is so much more. 'Mama Kin' is a great rocker, and so is 'Movin' Out.' The rest of the album is great too. All in all, Aerosmith's debut album is highly recommended.

I've had it for years- have grown up with it! Her lyrics are poetic and so lovely- some are heartbreaking. Her music is memorable and thoughtful- inspiring. I would't call her rhythms \"catchy\", but her songs all cloud my mind and keep me singing long after I've shut off the sound. My favourite song on this album is \"Never is a Promise\". Though I know that her lyrics are a bit more deep than what I relate to them as, who can't relate to being misunderstood?

There was a period in the late seventy's-early eighty's where the was untouchable. He had a distinct sound, managed to get extraordinary results from otherwise ordinary artists, and took established superstars to new levels. Consider the set of albums all released within a short (three-four year) time frame: Michael Jackson's \"Off The Wall\" and \"Thriller\", George Benson's \"Give Me The Night\", this own\"The Dude\", and things like this Brothers Johnson album. You will find impeccable, tasteful production values, engineered to standards that hold up to the most revealing remastering. Layer upon player of drums with various other percussive instruments; fat luscious bass lines; orchestral segments with sweet string sections and funky horns; crisp (and more prominent than you'd recall) guitars and judicious use of the then-nascent synthesizer. Above all, there were the vocals, both upfront and back-up choruses. He made people known for their voice, like Jackson, James Ingram and Patti Austin, sound as good as they never have, and took those not necessarily known for their vocal prowess (like Benson and the Brothers) to levels they've never reached before for since. So there, on \"Light Up The Night\", we have nine sweet-sounding tracks from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, led off by the tremendous \"Stomp!\". everything a single should be. It sounds perfect on the radio, in your car for on headphones. A driving dance beat, anthemic vocals, killer horns and strings, melodies that hit you one after another with their clarity and soul. It has synth solos and bass solos (!) yet is better off with them as opposed to without them. That in and of itself is amazing. The Brothers Johnson were masterful musicians. I still have videotapes from Don Kirshner's Rock Concert where they demonstrate their chops for all to see. They were low level stars, but among the most desired session men of their time. I swear the bass playing sounds like someone trying to tame a wild animal. He does't play it as much as the unleashes it. Nothing on the album matches that initial high, but I found myself recognizing all the songs, even though I probably have not listened to this album since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. The title track is a swift poppy number with soothing background vocals. Speaking of, Michael Jackson often showed up as a background vocalist on other people's albums around that time, and there does a nice job on \"This Had To Be.\"The ballads, like \"Treasure\" and \"All About The Heaven\", all sound like the early eighty's ballads you know and love. They just happen to \"sound\" really really good. Seriously. this Quincy Jones character was taking \"sow's years\" and making \"silk purses\" as if it was as natural and easy for him as breathing. There's an instrumental (\"Smilin' on Ya\") and a near-instrumental (\"Celebrations\"), just to warn you. Overall, you will get this because:a) you love \"Stomp\". And you should.b) you have some affection for The Brothers Johnson. And you should.c) you appreciate Quincy Jones' artistry. And you totally should.d) and you can't beat the price.","overall":4,"summary":"An example of stellar production values, and it funks.","unixReviewTime":1114214400,"reviewTime":"04 23, 2005"}

Mitchell released several masterpieces, not only the well-known Blue and Court & Spark, but also the 'transitional' albums For The Roses and Hissing Of Summer Lawns can be marked as totally perfect works of part as far as I'm concerned. From there on things got less accessible but actually even more interesting, as Mitchell plunged into the depths of jazz, classical and even African music on Don Juan's Reckless Daughter. The album takes some time to get used to, but the send-result is a flawed yet fully satisfying album like Blue. Here Mitchell just went through the proof and shamelessly recorded an African drum-and-chant piece (The Tenth World), awkward minimalist-music (the gorgeous Dreamland) and a sixteen-minute song that packed folk, jazz and classical into one mindblowing piece called Paprika Plains. The other songs continue where Hejira ended, most notably the lovely Jericho and Talk To Me. The endresult is simply a fantastic record, that many people had problems with upon the original time of release. Too experimental, too weird, too out-there. That may be, but fact is that Don Juan's Reckless Daughter stands as Joni Mitchell's most interesting and body innovative work. Ever.","overall":4,"summary":"Experimental Joni","unixReviewTime":1130284800,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2005"}

There's a mellow, laid back sound there with intelligent lyrics -- a bit too much piano perhaps and not enough guitar, a bit less grit that I might have liked but a pleasant soft-rock sound. None of the songs will rank as all-time favourites of mine, but all of them are good.

Hotel California is probably a better batch of songs, but they don't fit together as well as the jones found there do. That, along with the relatively uncommercial Old West motif, is probably why this was their only album with no hit singles. All the songs just sound more convincing if listened to in one sitting. Admittedly, the opener, \"Doolin' Dalton,\" in't much like anything else they never did, but the edgy harmonies are great and it does set the stage for the loosely bound tale that follows. \"Out of Control\" is the most savage rocker of their career and the very epitome of the wild-guys'-night-out motif that appears throughout their catalog, although the bland guitar solo shows why it's a good thing they hired Don Felder on their next album. Other heavy moments include \"Certain Kind of Fool\" and \"Outlaw Man,\" which could be about the same small town misfit running amok in the desert. Although the Eagles reportedly wanted to prove they were a rock and roll band with Desperado, it also features two of their best ballads. You probably know the title track even if you don't own this album, but \"Saturday Night\" is a lovely buried treasure that deserves to be just as well known. Also featured there is the mid-tempo \"Tequila Sunrise,\" which should have been the album's hit single. The country motif all but disappeared from the Eagles sound after this - but at least they really made it count once.","overall":5,"summary":"No sophomore slump here","unixReviewTime":1186617600,"reviewTime":"08 9, 2007"}

Released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three, the Eagles second album was a risky venture---a concept album with the old West as its setting and a youthful outlaw as its protagonist. The four original members--Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner--share vocals admirably. DESPERADO has a raw, sparse feel. It's direct and uncluttered, primal in its instrumentation. And the songs are some of the groups finest. DOOLIN-DALTON sets the stage beautifully, a stunning marriage of lyric and melody. TWENTY ONE celebrates the advent of manhood with its strong bluegrass influence. That innocent joy mutates to sheer self-indulgence in OUT OF CONTROL, a raucous rocker that lives up to its title. The morning after blues is poetically addressed in TEQUILA SUNRISE, one of the two hit singles from the album. And what can one say about DESPERADO that has't been said? One of rock's most beloved ballads, the song flawlessly paints an epic code to lost hopes and dreams, its urgent plea to \"let somebody love you\" forever haunting. Next is the cynically wise CERTAIN KIND OF FOOL. A quick reprise of DOOLIN DALTON segues into the driving OUTLAW MAN, my favourite track. It epitomizes the outlaw's commitment to this chosen life and foreshadows this ultimate fate. SATURDAY NIGHT is a beautiful piece, its simplicity both touching and tragic. BITTER CREEK is a bomber prelude to the inevitable showdown. The album concludes with the DOOLIN-DALTON\/DESPERADO reprise, a remarkable reworking of the lyrics, its counter-vocals bringing a rousing finale to the story. DESPERADO is a notable album for both the Eagles and country-rock. Few albums have fused country and rock so effectively. It has stood the test of time; whether it's better than HOTEL CALIFORNIA is ultimately up to the listener.","overall":5,"summary":"THE EAGLES SOAR","unixReviewTime":1314230400,"reviewTime":"08 25, 2011"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"One thing you can count on with musicians such as Booker T Jones,Steve Cropper,Al Jackson and Donald \"Duck\" Dunn is that all of them are extremely talented people. Their ability to maintain their trademark instrumental precision with extremely soulful clicks and exchanges is now well renowned. Many bands have since attempted, to carrying levels of success to approximate this approach and in the sixty's the sound served this band so well that they became the main Stax house band during that era while making remarkable singles under their own name. Of course the title track and it's shadow \"Mo Onions\" are by all accounts the strongest general itunes on this album; songs that people who may not even know the name of the band will recognize and that encompasses the very best in their precision based instrumental bluesy soul music. One thing that's important to mention is this album was recorded in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two and at that time (with the possible exception of Ray Charles) even artists such as James Brown were not so much thinking in terms of album oriented music as much utilizing the long playing medium to collect together singles into collections that sounded cohesive even if they really were't. And so as the case with this album. Considering that Stax than't been around too many years before this was released there's some similarities to an earlier Stax band known as The Mar Keys so on likeminded itunes such as \"Rinky-Dink\" which as that band had done used the idea of precision and melody together. It's a bit stiff than the usually fairly loose approach the MG's had, and I need to add there is a difference between precision and looseness. A similar situation occurs on other interpretations of songs such as \"Twist And Shout\" and \"Lonely Avenue\" although the secular gospel wail of \"I Got A Woman\" comes across a lot better as they let loose a lot more rhythmically. \"Behave Yourself\" and \"Stranger On The Shore\" do a bit better overall due to the fact they showcase a slower, more foreboding business that allows the soul of their musicianship to shine through to a greater degree. Even though this in't their first album it probably in't the place to begin appreciating the MG's music. For most other reviewers are right:the band packed it's trademark punch more on singles so a well assembled compilation such as the recentBooker T. & The MG'S :The Definitive Soul Collectionbut for those who have such a collection and want to investigate the spirit of their music in it's original context this in't a bad place to go actually.","overall":4,"summary":"The Debut Of The MG's!","unixReviewTime":1287100800,"reviewTime":"10 15, 2010"}

It's not difficult to hear why---\"Both Sides\" is far and away Phil's most introspective album. He produced it himself, recording it all at this home studio, and the plays all of the instruments himself, including guitar and bass. For Phil, according to this sleeve notes, this is the most enjoyable album the's never made. For the listener, \"Both Sides\" is a marvellous disc, with Phil showing a side to himself not quite heard on any of this other albums (as great as they are). Not only is Phil's songwriting and playing of all the instruments incredible, but \"Both Sides\" arguably contains the best, most heartfelt singing Phil has never done on any of this solo albums. It's as if Phil is just singing to YOU and only YOU, in an intimate, one-on-one session between artist and listener. Granted, \"Both Sides\" is one of Phil's lesser-known albums, as it was this first solo album to miss the Billboard Top ten (I suppose Nirvana had already begun their work in changing the rock music biz at this point), but don't let that stop you from embracing this great buried treasure from Phil. Admittedly, there are no real \"rockers\" on \"Both Sides.\" Most of the tracks are soft for mid-tempo, but make no mistake, these are all very rich itunes. Phil does turn up the volume somewhat on this observational hit \"Both Sides Of The Story,\" \"Survivors,\" and \"We Wait And We Wonder,\" this powerful drumming driving these excellent songs. Other great moments include the lovely Top forty hit \"Everyday,\" the banjo-esque \"We're Sons Of Our Fathers,\" the moody \"Can't Find My Way,\" and my personal favourite track, the stunning \"We Fly So Close,\" a gorgeous, atmospheric song, including some fine acoustic guitar and passionate singing from Phil. But all the way around, this is a very beautiful album. \"Both Sides\" is without question a creative highlight in the career of this multi-talented man, and an outstanding album that no Phil Collins fan should do without.","overall":5,"summary":"The Introspective Phil","unixReviewTime":1059264000,"reviewTime":"07 27, 2003"}

The next day at work, it was the only thing people talked about. And if never I mention it to a few former colleagues I still see, their eyes light up with the memory. I had already bought P&L on the strength of a Rolling Stone recommendation, so I was doubly ecstatic when I saw those clips ('If Walls Could Talk' and probably 'Tattler' and 'Jesus On The Mainline'). This is a terrific journey through American blues and gospel, with immaculate playing and an infectious sense of fun. The aforementioned 'Walls' is very cute, 'Tamp 'Em Up Solid' literally chugs along, 'Tattler' is gorgeous, but for me 'Fool For A Cigarette' is the standout: it's so cheerful it makes you almost proud to be a smoker, and that's saying something.","overall":5,"summary":"Sure to make you smile","unixReviewTime":972518400,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2000"}

For starters, the actual running order of the disc is the original eight-track album (excluding 'Blue Monday' and its of-side, 'The Beach') which tightens up the album and gives it a much more natural flow. Secondly, instead of the American-ized cover part and liner notes, this cover is true to the LP, with no band name, title for track listing. Finally, this album, though not listed as remastered, is a great sonic improvement over the domestic cd pressing. While not sounding as magnificent as the 'Singles' set, the sound quality is on par with the 'Retro' box from a few years back. This is worth the extra cash for New Order fans.

The album is deliberately low-key, in fact, it's so quiet that the two 'edgiest' songs (\"Mother and Child Reunion\" and \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\") are sore thumbs in the midst of the woozy pastoral soundscape the other cuts form. (You'll need to keep a hand nearby the volume control.)HIGHLIGHTS:Hit single \"Mother and Child Reunion\" kicks things off with a rock solid reggae groove (recorded in Kingston, Jamaica at Dynamic Sounds Studios) and an irresistible chorus as Simon muses about the Great Beyond. He tells a suffering spouse that seeing her mother again is \"only a motion away\". \"Duncan\" is a coming of page tune buoyed along by Los Incas, the same pipe group used on \"El Condor Pasa (If I Could)\" a few years before. The skipping acoustic guitar of \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\" gave Simon this other chartbuster and these many years later we STILL don't know \"what the mama saw\" that was against the law. (Though I'd be willing to bet it was something that would bring a \"morals charge\". ) Bluesy \"Congratulations\" seems like autobiography: Simon's marriage was crumbling during this time and it's easy to imagine sentiments like \"Won't you answer me please?\/Can a man and a woman\/Live together in peace?\" coming from this mindset of the time. LOWS:\"Everything Put Together Falls Apart\" is a non-entity. just pretty background noise. \"Armistice Day\", as another reviewer astutely pointed out, never really nails home its point. BOTTOM LINE:Simon's first routing hinted at what the'd be capable of in the coming years in sturdier offerings like HERE COMES RHYMIN' SIMON, GRACELAND, and RHYTHM OF THE SAINTS (and perhaps SURPRISE, when I've had more time to evaluate it. ). There are some weak patches so I can't call it one of this best but it's worth hearing for Simon enthusiasts. Novices might do better starting with one of the four mentioned above though.three one\/two stars","overall":4,"summary":"Modest and unassuming....maybe TOO unassuming","unixReviewTime":1152662400,"reviewTime":"07 12, 2006"}

Among the high-profile talent that appears on Siberry's sixth CD are veteran producer Brian Eno (Utwo, Talking Heads), and fellow Canadians of.d. lang and Holly Cole. The ensuing CD is nowhere near the stylistic mismatch that one might expect. Maybe that's because Siberry's music and poetry are so strong that no amount of outside talent can upstage them. From the disc's opening \"Gimme\" on \"Temple\", Siberry's lyrics impart previously unrevealed assertiveness and sensuality (just listen to \"Waitress\" on her second CD \"No Borders Here\" for a stark comparison). Siberry who, on her earlier records, mourned lost love and loneliness is succeeded by one who dumps her lover on \"Love is Everything\" because she \"can't wait 'til you make the whole kingdom come.\"The sensual (and sexual) imagery continues over the expanse of the CD. On \"An Angel Stepped Down\", Siberry urges, \"Come on baby come on give me\" and the aggressive vocal on \"Temple\" implores, \"Come on come on\/Let me into your temple.\" Is it getting hot in there? As always, Siberry's music is a thing of beauty, especially in the moving \"Love is Everything\", the CD's first single.

Taylor \"mr80s\"","helpful":[18,19],"reviewText":"A hot summer evening, your car, your girl, and Glenn Frey's 'The Allnighter' is all you need to bring back the memories of those nights you spent cruising the streets & highways and listening to the hottest itunes of the day. Even after fifteen years for so, Glenn's masterpiece of Rock & Romance still sounds fresh and only a first-time listener would have trouble singing along. The title track kicks things off with a fast-paced tale of a casanova-style encounter, then \"Sexy Girl\" echoes every man's memory of the one girl they hopelessly loved but could only dream about making their own. \"I Got Love\" sounds even more cheerful, while \"Somebody Else\" is an anthem for confrontation. Two unmistakable slow-dance gems arrive in the lonely and apologetic ballads, \"Lover's Moon\" and \"Let's Go Home\" But in between is the album's coolest song, \"Smuggler's Blues\", in which Glenn puts the pedal down and weaves a story of danger and frustration over the problem which still plagues society today. \"Living In Darkness\" is another rocker overshadowed a little by the patriotic finger-snapper, \"Better In The U. S. A\". The Al Green-ish closer \"New Love\" is one more code to romance lost and found. All in all, there is nothing on 'The Allnighter' to miss and much that you'll want to hear over and over. Some would say it's best appreciated while driving, but others might want to just sit outside, crack open a drink and let it play. I say it does't matter, You'll love this album either way, and it's still Mr. Frey's best work.

It is your goal to expand the frontiers of contemporary popular music at the risk of being very unpopular.\" was what Gentle Giant wrote in the liner notes to their second album. \"Giant For A Day\" finds them attempting to limit themselves to the mainstream of contemporary popular music in an (unsuccessful) attempt to be very popular. There's almost no sign of the unusual and creative music of their first eight albums. Most of the album is generic, forgettable, OK, late-seventys rock. There are three songs, to me, that push this up to three stars:\"Words From The Wise\" is a good song with some nice harmony vocals that remind me of Yes in the late seventys\"Giant for a Day\" is a really catchy, upbeat pop song. Not what the band is made of, but plenty fun.\"Spooky Boogie\" is an entertaining instrumental that sounds like something you'd hear in a Scooby Doo soundtrack. Supposedly this is their worst album - I don't have their next (and final) album \"Civilian\", but it's certainly weaker than all that went before. (\"The Missing Piece\" having a pretty good second half, and probably better \"non-prog\" songs on side one than \"Giant for a Day\" is made of).","overall":3,"summary":"The Giant has shrunken to human talent","unixReviewTime":1321056000,"reviewTime":"11 12, 2011"}

I liked most of the Eurythmics stuff before they split and was a little disconcerted that they were dropping most of the electronics their sound was based on. Annie released Why as the first single, and while I like it now, the video imagery and song put me off buying the Diva album forever as I was scared that this style might be prevalent. The second and third singles Walking On Broken Glass & Little Bird are good examples of what can be achieved if Annie tries to move up-tempo. Sadly on this album, that's about it. About eighty% of this album is ballads and that's too high a percentage to make a good album in my view. There's nothing wrong with the voice, and the album is mostly electronic but the number of ballads slows this album right down. One saving grace is the thirty's-style track Keep Young And Beautiful as this album's epilogue complete with mock vinyl scratches, it totally contrasts with everything before it but is a fitting finale. Outstanding tracks: Walking On Broken Glass, Little Bird, Keep Young And Beautiful, Why.","overall":3,"summary":"Too many ballads on solo outing by Eurythmics singer","unixReviewTime":996278400,"reviewTime":"07 28, 2001"}

Freed from the somewhat restrictive shackles of the series, the band came up with a wholly fitting soundtrack album that mixes a variety of interesting songs and spoken dialogue cleverly into a strange but compelling audio experience. The most commercial song on the album was the \"Porpoise Song,\" but songs like \"Can You Dig It\" are more representative of the film as a whole. Without question, the best song on the album, and one of the Monkees' greatest songs never, is \"Circle Sky,\" a wonderful Nesmith rocker (the most disturbing footage of the film also takes place during the course it.) On this release the excellent live version is included as an bonus track. Comparing the studio and live versions is interesting (there is also an alternate studio take available that is excellent, though it is not on this CD.) Truly this is one of the greatest unknown songs of the sixties, and makes the album worth buying by itself. I recommend the album and the film. Any soundtrack with track listings with titles like \"Dandruff?,\" Frank Zappa and this talking cow, Jack Nicholson, Annette Funicello, and Sonny Liston has to be interesting, and is. It's a weird combination of pop culture and social commentary (\"Are you telling me that you don't see the connection between government and laughing at people?\") that never fails to entertain. I recommend the CD and the film strongly.","overall":5,"summary":"\"I'd Like A Glass Of Cold Gravy With A Hair In It, Please.\"","unixReviewTime":1271894400,"reviewTime":"04 22, 2010"}

While very short (Tool's new album is twice its length), LPtwo delivers in all nine songs what rock has been missing all this time. One reviewer mentioned how you can barely understand who plays what in some songs (mainly \"Iscarabaid\" and \"J'Nuh\"), which is certainly true. The vocals, guitars, bass, and drums seem to fade into one beautiful instrument. Some songs such as \"five\/four\" and \"eight\" have severe changes of space in the middle of the song, yet for some reason, it feels natural. This is truly progressive and amazing music. What's even more incredible is that this album was thrown together so that the band could break up. Some songs were originally written for Diary, but for some reason were cast aside. The structures of those songs are very simallar to Diary songs. For example, \"Friday\" has the same buildup to chorus pattern that \"Seven\" had, only it lost the repetition of riffs and lyrics that made that song drag a bit. Indeed, none of the songs there are too repetitious. Every song only has the elements that would improve it, and nothing more. If you like any type of rock music, I highly recommend LPtwo. It takes a few listens to get used to, but it will quickly become one of your favourites.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Rock Album of the 90's","unixReviewTime":997056000,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2001"}

Compositionally, the album is fairly traditional, offering few hints of the free jazz that the great saxophonist was to embark on the following year. \"Crescent\", \"The Wise One\" and \"Lonnie's Lament\" are ballads. Coltrane's solo in the title track veers far off the melody, but for most of the album there's an introspective\/sleepy\/noctural atmosphere. For me, this is one of the least memorable albums in my Coltrane collection, although as the music is playing it is quite entertaining. Among the early one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys quartet albums, CRESCENT stands out for a nearly track-long Elvin Jones solo (\"The Drum Thing\"). Garrison gets a long solo on \"Lonnie's Lament\" too, while Coltrane chooses not to solo at all in the second half of the album. Thus Coltrane sounds like the's holding back, before this anguished spiritual explorations in saxophone form would grab the spotlight in A LOVE SUPREME and later albums.","overall":4,"summary":"Enjoyable, though one of the least memorable Coltrane releases","unixReviewTime":1333843200,"reviewTime":"04 8, 2012"}

Buisman \"Martijn Buisman\"","helpful":[2,4],"reviewText":"Where Nirvana was the prologue, Weezer was the start of my interest in music. I grew up in a town called Groningen in the north of Holland. When I was fifteen I spend most of my days listening to either the local radio stations for the alternative music shows late at night. I heard the first Weezer songs there. When the magazine of the legendary Vera club put the album on the top of their charts it really started coming. I had the song on a tape and listened to it all day. Besides 'Orange' by the Blues Explosion and 'crooked brain' there is no album I have to listened to more than Weezers debut album. There is not a bad track on the album. Starting off with 'My Name Is Jonas' Banging on the drums and the powerchords, singing along with \"The Workers Are Going Home\" with the great acoustic intro and outdo.\"No One Else\" is the first nerd song, about the singer only wanting the girl for himself, afraid to close him. For someone who is fifteen the uncertainty, dreams and weird interest and social awkwardness are so well expressed in all the songs. The feeling of solitude after a break-up can be felt the best in the downbeat song 'The World has Turned and left me there', perhaps the best and most mature song on the album. That 'Weezer' maybe the teenage album of the ninety's is also thanks to track four, the now classic 'Buddy Holly'. Who does't want to be a star, a star like Buddy Holly. Besides the lyric it's also the song you can using along with the easiest. And the little nine stone break is a stroke of genius, as is the little difference in actors that follows it and leads in the send of the song. An easy picking guitar and some voices lead in 'Undone', also a great song. Teenage fun starts with 'Surfwax America', It has a thumping verse but the melody really starts in the chorus. The melody changes somewhat when the singer starts feeling the undertow and the is afraid the will never grow old. A great middle part with just voices and some keyboards repeats the never grow old part. But it ends well after all. I never liked 'Say it main't so' so I won't talk about that songThe funniest song must be 'In The Garage' the neediest song of all. Dungeon Master, Kiss etc. However, the theme of teenage awkwardness pops up again. 'In the garage, i feel safe, no one cares about my ways, in the garage where i belong no one hears me using this song''Holiday' can be a song about spring break, however it is not about a booked holiday in a hotel. To me it always meant to freedom of just going away when you felt like it. The album ends with the long and musically most interesting 'Only In Dreams', about the boy not getting the girl. Maybe now twelve, five years after it was released do I really realize how great this album still is. Weezer still make good albums but none of them has reached the overall standard of their debut which I really think it was on the best debut albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. Their follow-up 'Pinkerton' was certainly not bad but sounded a little scrapper. Every guitar on each song might make this album seem monotone but it's how it was meant. Also the order of the song is perfect, no wonder that when they first toured Europe they played this album from track one to ten in that order. A classic, a real real classic.","overall":5,"summary":"Top 10 of the 1990s","unixReviewTime":1136073600,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2006"}

E Jackson","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I'm honestly quite shocked and pleasantly surprised that Ruth is Stranger Than Richard contains so many good songs. First of all it should be noted that the entire album is very listenable. It's nothing like Matching Mole's first album for example where most of *those* ideas fell flat as they wandered aimlessly and accomplished nothing. No, Ruth is Stranger Than Richard is a very focused and songwriting-driven album with interesting and oddly satisfying arrangements. Let me explain what I mean by \"oddly satisfying\".\"Team Spirit\" starts off with a fairly typical Robert Wyatt vocal melody (perhaps reminiscent of this work with Soft Machine's very first album from back in the late sixty's). The saxophone work however, almost feels out of place except somehow -perhaps because of Brian Eno's involvement- they *work*. Not only are the sax solos completely enjoyable, but they're also, quite frankly, pretty darn ominous and spooky, especially during the final minute of the song when they almost seem to loop to create a melody of sorts. It's oddly pleasing according to my tastes and *definitely* has that wacky experimental Brian Eno vibe.\"Soup Song\" contains some hilarious lyrics about food-related topics. In the lyrics Robert pretends the's actually food and sings about it, all. The melody is fairly basic, but truth be told, the saxophone is fairly annoying because it's continuously obnoxious. \"Sonia\" is an AWESOME song. It has a danceable and very catchy rhythm, and magnificent trumpet and sax soloing playing over top of it. A very original idea.\"Song for Che\" would't be out of place on Roxy Music's first album, particularly near the send of the album surrounded by those experimental do wop songs. Not that this is necessarily a do wop. I honestly have no idea WHAT it is. Picture people slow dancing to a saxophone melody that's somewhat depressing and well, just plain odd.\"Solar Flares\" is a groovy-paced melodic instrumental that's almost immediately enjoyable. That is, if you can get past the weirdness factor. Either way, by the second listen you'll be loving it. The looping sax riff seriously remind me of early seventy's Traffic, and Steve Winwood would surely be impressed. The song is. hard to describe. It's based around these bizarrely beautiful piano lines while Robert Wyatt sometimes chums along to them in a mid-tempo style. Meanwhile the sax just plays the same few notes over and over giving it a hypnotic and atmospheric quality. Very unusual to say the least. The album closes with a six minute song called \"Muddy Mouse\" and it's based around a mighty fine vocal melody courtesy of Robert Wyatt and some softly performed piano lines. Actually it's more like Robert Wyatt singing, not words necessarily, but in a high-pitched range just going \"Whoa whoa whaaa whaaa\" for a couple minutes in the middle. It's not annoying for distracting however. Perhaps this is this idea of delivering a soulful vocal melody, who knows? The album does have one major weak point, and it's very very poor. It's a five-minute song that goes by the name \"five Black Notes and one White Note\". It's one unmemorable sax line repeating WAY too often, and for several minutes. Not a highlight and I don't understand its purpose. What I *do* know is that Ruth is Stranger than Richard is a very solid album, musically. Underrated too. Now. the question remains- why were all those Canterbury bands singing about a guy named Richard? Richard who?","overall":5,"summary":"wow, this is almost as good as Rock Bottom","unixReviewTime":1308009600,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2011"}

At least half the tracks there would have made good singles back in the day. The production is a typically early 'eighty's 'synthy' drone that does tend to detract from the songs twenty-four years on. Gibb's vocals, however, are an butter nightmare! I don't know if the original LP had a lyric sheet, but, boy, you certainly need one as RG's unearthly shrieks render most of the songs unintelligible. It's too much of a -not necessarily-good thing as Robin is given full reign to wreck almost every song with a grotesquely OTT display of appalling singing.

The standout Track on this album has got to be \"Doo Wop (that thing)\" which was by far her most popular single, along with \"Ex-Factor\", \"To Zion\" and a flawless remake of the classic oldies \"Can't Take My Eyes off of You.\" No doubt the other Fugees members were talented, but Lauryn seemed to have that certain spark of talent that people admired and loved. Whether for not she decides to release another album in the future, this one has got to be one of the best solo-from-group works of all time.

While it is impossible for a single live release to capture the true scope of Rush's career, this package does a nice job. The first two discs (the \"main\" jones) draw heavily from the band's most recent releases: Roll the Bones, Counterparts, and Test for Echo. The stirring \"Bravado,\" the energizing and ironic \"Resist,\" and the aggressive \"Stick It Out\" are just a few examples of the newer songs given intense live treatment there. A number of the band's well-known classics are there as well. \"The Spirit of Radio,\" \"The Trees,\" \"Freewill,\" \"YYZ,\" and an incredible version of the band's best loved epic, \"two thousand, one hundred and twelve.\" Unlike the version found on All the World's a Stage, this performance keeps every section of the song intact (whereas the older one is five minutes shorter). Without a doubt, the song is a devastating feat of hard rock in the live setting. Explosive riffs and rapid-fire percussion, along with an intimate acoustic solo during part three validate the epic's standing as one of the bands best works. \"Closer to the Heart,\" the requisite concert staple is again performed there, and again it gets a fun jam tagged on at the send. Rare songs such as the emotionally charged \"Analog Kid\" and the butter masterpiece \"Natural Science\" are included. There in't much from the Signals-to-Presto era, which is especially unfortunate in Presto's case because that album has yet to be covered sufficiently on a live recording. But they, no one's never one hundred% pleased with a live album. this one does come close, though. The third disc, which is something of a bonus, was compiled from a show in London in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, during the A Farewell to Kings tour. The sound quality is as raw as it gets, which is a plus in that it means the energy is completely unadulterated. Here you can get the only live recordings of \"Cygnus X-one Book one,\" \"A Farewell to Kings,\" and \"Cinderella Man.\" The crowd's reaction to the segue between \"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" and \"Xanadu\" is one of the best moments on any live rock album. The CDs there also present an interesting contrast in the band's development over the years. Back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight the keyboards were simple, Peart's drum kit was a titanic thing, and hard rocking' riffs came hard and fast without relent. Geddy Lee's voice screamed at some high registers. Twenty years later, the band relies heavily on sequences synthesizers and backup vocals, and more melodically-savvy songs, with Lee singing at more relaxed octaves. (Compare the studio \"two thousand, one hundred and twelve\" to the live version there!)All in all, this is the best of Rush's four live albums. Hopefully the fifth will provide the Cynus X-one saga in its entirety. that'd be a dream come true. As we wait, Different Stages sports enough awesome live music to make any Rush fan happy for a long time.","overall":5,"summary":"Ne plus ultra!","unixReviewTime":1000252800,"reviewTime":"09 12, 2001"}

It was a last minute cancellation that brought Curtis and this formidable band onto the concert stage for this legendary performance. As Otis Redding had done in Monterey, Curtis seduced the largely white hippie audience and won them over. The set largely consists of soul staples the band had phoned and perfected while on the caitlin circuit; Memphis Soul Stew, Soul Serenade, Freddie King's I Stand Accused and Stevie Wonder's big hit Signed Sealed & Delivered I'm Yours.

I was hooked on Jay-Z after hearing Volume one in a friend's car back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, which is actually an underrated album. I did't listen to Reasonable Doubt until two thousand, and the funny thing is, I did't realize how great it was until about a year later, after listening to it over and over. The songs are dark and deep. This is a strangely innovative album, because of the production. For example, twenty-two Two's is nothing I have never heard before, and overall the piano dominated beats are so different from what you'll usually hear on a ship-hop record. The lyrics are amazing. There are many themes that run throughout the album, including focus, determination, and justice. In my opinion, the best tracks are: one) D'evils, two) Dead Presidents, (Scary beat, and gets me hyped everytime) three) Brooklyn's Finest, (A legendary duet with Biggie) four) Can't Knock the Hustle, five) Can I Live, (the first verse is incredible) six) twenty-two Twos, (the first verse is awesome), seven) Coming of Age (the Jay\/Bleek exchange is very original and effective). The reason why D'evils is a classic is because of the message, and because of the marvellous piano loop. The message is that if you wish to be successful in any endeavour, you should be willing to do whatever it takes, including lie. A secondary theme in that song is that friends grow apart due to disparity in success. But what makes that song great is how the message is delivered - the rhymes that the chooses. If you are a music fan (not necessary a ship-hop fan, but a music fan), for a lover of language and expression, get this album, now.","overall":5,"summary":"Masterful, Powerful, and Absolutely Brilliant.

And remember how surprising it was that the idea worked? Well, for this album, Teddy tried the concept AGAIN and brought in Terrell Phillips to replace Mark Middleton. (Why Teddy thought replacing Mark was a good idea remains a mystery.) And while this album is not as long as its predecessor, it's not as good either. In fact, it's not even close. It's hard to say what's the worst song on this album, as most of them are pretty stupid, ranging from the lazy \"Girlfriend\/Boyfriend\" to \"Can You Feel Me\", which uncreatively samples Jackson five' \"Can You Feel It\" yet again. And then lyrics don't impress either. \"Think About You\" says things like \"I put on my clothes and I think about you\" and \"I fix my dinner and I think about you\". (By the way, remember the video when the bridge came on? Were those supposed to be moves?) And the chorus to \"Black & White\" goes: \"I dream in black and white\/But I make love in color.\" WTF? Even though the production and harmony get better toward the send of the album, it still can't save songs like \"In A Rush\", which sounds like it was written, well, in a rush. And the last three songs feel like they were thrown on to fill up space. Two of them are gospel songs, and the other one is the \"Take Me There\" remix from the Rugrats movie soundtrack (without the wrap, I must add). I have two things to say about that: one) if you record a song for Nickelodeon, you should't put it on your album because its theme makes it sound like it does't belong, and two) when the best song on your album is a kiddie song, there's something seriously wrong. This album was very, very disappointing. Also, Teddy Riley seems to be plagued with deep involvement with sloppy projects. Guy III was't any better, and BLACKstreet's \"comeback\" album Level II (but in't that their FOURTH album?) got pushed back for the umpteenth time.

We Hear Now was an okay track to start off the album with. World's Most Dangerous(feat Nemesis) is good. Let's Ride has Ja wrapping like Twista on the track and it want a bad album. Nigguz Theme(which borrows from NWA's Efilfourzaggin) is cool. The Suicide freestyle with Case is great because it shows what Ja is capable of. Holla Holla was a good first single and Murda four Life(feat Memphis Bleek) is a dope follow up. E-Dub And Ja(feat Erick Sermon) is dope collabo by itself. Erick Sermon and Ja did pretty good on that track. Daddy's Little Baby(feat Ron Isley) is Ja's touching tribute to this daughter and Ron Isley complimented the track well. Its Murda was a great match up which featured DMX and Jay-z(before Ja fell out with DMX). Kill Em All also features Jay-z-- the only thing the's on the hook. Only Begotten Son is Ja dripping this father a new one for not being is this life as a kid. As for flaws I cant recall any. Bottom Line: Venni Vetti Vecci is Ja's best work to date. This is not out of spite, its out of love. Ja showed this true potential more on this album then the never did on this later releases. Im not mad at him for going pop, Im mad that the abandoned this fanbase out the window just to make a quick buck and put out slope work. I could care less about him going pop. This album is reccomended to anybody who remembered him for what the was and not what the turned out to be. Standout Tracks: WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS, LET'S RIDE, NIGGUZ THEME, SUICIDE FREESTYLE, STORY TO TELL, ITS MURDA, E-DUB AND JA, DADDY'S LITTLE BABY, RACE AGAINST TIME and ONLY BEGOTTEN SON. PS: If you never like Ja, that's cool. If you liked him at one point than despised him for what the has become that's cool to but done bash him just because fifty Cent made it trendy then turn around and bash fifty Cent years later.

The ensuing recording sessions were rather turbulent with Nile & Bernard pushing Diana to give more vocally, and Diana storming off after reporting \"Berry (Gordy) never said I sang flat!!\". Unhappy with the final results, Diana took the mastertapes and had them remixed without Nile & Bernard's knowledge, and had her vocals are-recorded. The result? The biggest selling album of her career; double platinum (and #two on Billboard), and a million selling single. The deluxe edition of \"Diana\" includes the originally released eight tracks, as well as the unmixed Nile & Bernard versions on one disc, and extended versions of other hits, and rarities on a second disc. Packed in a rectangular digipak which opens up to reveal the full famous black and white shot of Diana in tight top and jeans, much like the original vinyl did. The album opens with the #one million selling single \"Upside down\" with THAT famous scratchy guitar riff and funky sound. The Nile\/Edward version features more subdued vocals and the guitar solo that ends the song is not as fiery as the released version's. The Nile\/Bernard version of \"Tenderness\" features a new instrumental break with some scratchy guitar and additional vocals, which stretch the song longer than the released version. I quite like this. The released version of the largely acoustic ballad \"Friend to friend\" is lighter and much nicer than the Nile\/Bernard version. The choruses on the Nile\/Bernard version of \"I'm coming out\" (her funky declaration of a \"new me\" which became a gay anthem and a #five hit) are longer, and it misses the final screamed \"I'm coming. OOOUT!!!\", sacrilege!!\"Have fun again\" is basically the same, though the Nile\/Bernard version has more drawn out (almost lazy) vocals, and a longer instrumental break. The released version of \"My old piano\" (a UK top ten) is fuller and features a nice piano\/guitar duel at the send, while the Nile\/Bernard version has a longer, almost jazzier piano\/guitar duel. The released version of \"Now that you're gone\" (the beautiful ballad of longing and loneliness) wins hands down!!! That scratchy, spare bassline, and pseudo reggae feel. The Nile\/bernard version ends abruptly, missing out the lovely piano solo at the send of the released version. Closing is \"Give up\", basically the same, but longer, with a new instrumental break. Basically, the original Nile\/Bernard version had longer instrumental breaks, a slightly jazzier\/funkier feel, and more subdued vocals. I much prefer the released version, but it's nice to have the Chic version hand in hand as an alternate. Some might prefer the Chic version, and that's the beauty of having both versions there. The remastering is superb, and the production of the album still stands up to music produced today. Everybody, let's have fun again!!","overall":5,"summary":"Have fun again and again!!!","unixReviewTime":1203033600,"reviewTime":"02 15, 2008"}

WOW! What a magnificent diamond this CD is! Ms. C & I have been making up for lost time! Two of the tracks are my very favourites. Bob Dylan wrote a special verse of \"Gotta Serve Somebody\" especially for Natalie who introduces the song by \"Thank you, Mr. D!\" This is one knock-out version with the cast of thousands background vocals that builds to an amazing climax. The opener, Leon Russell's \"A Song for You\" is a gorgeous melody. I loved Merry Clayton's soulful version from the seventy's as well as Aretha Franklin's, Donny Hathaway's & Joe Cocker's, but Natalie gives this modern classic a great polish and emotional wallop. Taj Mahal's \"Corrina\" was also a great favourite; and Natalie's update is a wonderful performance! \"Everyday I Have the Blues\" is also tremendous fun with its cool jazz flutter. Natalie's \"With My Eyes Wide Open\" is an emotional experience that rises above the fifty's string arrangement. Sandy Denny's \"Since You Asked\" that Judy Collins immortalized comes through as such a wonderful song with Natalie's performance. The CD concludes with \"Stay With Me,\" with which Natalie blows the proof down. I don't know who spawned this beautiful diamond, but don't miss out on this incredible set! Enjoy!","overall":5,"summary":"A Diamond","unixReviewTime":1043798400,"reviewTime":"01 29, 2003"}

{"orig_index":32654,"reviewerID":"A1IAQIZSXONWVU","asin":"B00004TA40","reviewerName":"Mark \"The early bird gets the worm but the se...","helpful":[9,10],"reviewText":"Prologue added:Some of the reviewers have written that this music is somehow farcical for that it blacks substance. There was a time when I would have agreed. Fortunately, I found a way to approach this music. I was giving this some thought this morning while listening to Coltrane's Om and ruminating on how form eventually started to reveal itself in what originally sounded like a mess. It occurred to me that the later works are very much like those puzzle pictures we used to see back in the ninety's. When you first looked, it was just a rectangle with a bunch of tiny random shapes and color. Your friend kept telling you that there was a clipper ship in that picture. You strained to see it, got frustrated, put it down, picked it up, tried it again without success. And then you found that when you stopped trying to see that clipper ship and simply relaxed a threeD hologram emerged from the backdrop and yes, there really was a clipper ship hidden in that mess. That's what listening to Coltrane's later day works are like. The emperor is in fact wearing cloths, you just haven't relaxed, put away your preconceived notions for \"looking\" allowed yourself to see them. Original Review:There is so much I want to write about Ascension that I'll probably update this review from time-to-time. First, Robert Rub III and this \"Emporer's New Clothes\" review. Robert, I know exactly where you are coming from and I've written much the same sort of review about other \"post-modern\" works. I'm afraid I can't agree in this case though, for one thing, Coltrane has an incredible pedigree of a career. The man KNEW exactly what the was doing. That pedigree legitimizes this work. I fear you have sold yourself short in this instance. You have to get beyond your comfort zone in order to discover what is happening there. Anyway, enough of that. Ascension is a wild roller-coaster ride with twists and turns and free-falls that take your breath away. And when the first forty minute ride is complete we get to say \"Let's do it again!\" and listen to the thirty-eight minute Ascension I (which was really take two in the studio). Ascension is Coltrane as Shiva (the Hindu destroyer & creator), this session is truly the continental divide of Coltrane's solo career and yeah, the destroys what the built up, but the also creates something very new, so new in fact that we have to step away from your assumptions about what music should be in order to glimpse what the has discovered. Ascension is so much like life. We are all improvisers. We go through life with your own framework (values) but whether we admit it for not, we are swinging' and making up your lives as we move along. We encounter others, it changes us. We oscillate from chaos to order then back to chaos. Ascension is very much like that oscillation from chaos to a kind of improvised order. People who call this noise are not REALLY listening to what is happening. When the horns play together, the players are communicating to one another, call and response, shouts, hollers. It's incredibly powerful stuff. Then we get the alone voice of a soloist, telling this story. Freddie Hubbard stands out in particular, what an amazing player. Is it any accident that the ended up on some of the most important \"new jazz\" works such as Out to Lunch, Ole, Point of Departure? If there is one single flaw with Ascension, it might be that Hubbard's mic is too hot and at times this playing obscures the other players (during the ensemble passages). Ascension is an awe-inspiring work. It in't easy to listen to this music. Your year has been trained to what is called \"natural cadence\", resolving the Vseven to the I chord. Coltrane, in this role as Shiva, offers no such rest for you. You have to be willing to go with him, destroy what you know and then listen. This is the key to listening to every Coltrane work from Ascension onward (like Meditations for instance). That's it, that's all I'm gonna write. Yeah, I like the pretty stuff, like Trane's earlier work, for the Miles Davis Quintets. But I can dig Ascension too! Let go and let it wash over you.","overall":5,"summary":"A Musical Tour-de-Force Thrill Ride","unixReviewTime":1208649600,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2008"}

When I first saw the video to Anastacia's debut single I'm Outta Love in September two thousand, I instantly began looking for flaws. I did't like her voice, the way she dressed and that darn song. yet it was kinda catchy, was't it?! Over time she grew on me and it was with the single Not That Kind that made me buy this album. Well I have to say that this is one of the most mature, catchy and accomplished debut albums I have never heard. The album went on to sell inexcess of six million copies worldwide and contains four massive worldwide hits. Not That Kind begins with the album's title track, Not That Kind (ten\/ten). This song has an amazing bassline with some brilliant girl-power lyrics and catchy, melodic beats. Anastacia's voice is so powerful, even in the verses where the song is a lot more low-lying than at the choruses. This song was the second single to be taken from Not That Kind in February two thousand and one, where it peaked at No.eleven in the UK. Track two is I'm Outta Love (ten\/ten). This is without a doubt Anastacia's most famous song to date. Her debut single, it peaked at No.six in the UK in September two thousand, stayed in the Top ten for months and was No.one all over Europe. The bassline is incredibly catchy and the lyrics are more of the same with Not That Kind; girl-power to the max! Track three is Cowboys & Kisses (nine\/ten). This was the third single to be taken from Not That Kind in May two thousand and one and peaked at a slowly No.twenty-nine in the UK. The video is not very memorable - I don't even think I can remember what happens in it! The song however is a more indie-rock song with superb guitars and various instruments. Track four is Who's Gonna Stop The Rain (nine\/ten). Like I mentioned on my review of Freak Of Nature (Anastacia's second album), every Anastacia album has the power ballad - for Not That Kind, it's Who's Gonna Stop The Rain. The beats along with the lyrics are incredibly powerful, while Anastacia's voice is on top-form again. Track five is Love Is Alive (ten\/ten). This is definitely the best song on the album. well, for me anyway. This is just such a catchy song with a superb bassline and electrifying vocals from the girl with the big voice. I just love the verses and the bridges - top class song from Anastacia! Track six is I Ask Of You (nine\/ten). This is another excellent ballad from Anastacia - one of the best on the album. That's about it! Track seven is Wishing Well (ten\/ten). A lot of people think this song is rubbish, but I love it. The song is very simple lyrics wise - they're easy to learn because they're quick and fast. Not That Kind continues with the superb Made For Lovin' You (ten\/ten). The fourth and final single to be taken from Not That Kind, this song only just peaked inside the Top thirty in the UK, which is a shame because it really is a superb pop song. The lyrics are a bit simple, yet the trademark funky bassline and Anastacia's gravely vocals make up for it. Track nine is Black Roses (ten\/ten). This is another brilliant ballad from Anastacia who sounds a lot like Tina Turner on this song. Track ten is Yo Trippin' (ten\/ten). This song has a superb blend of R'n'B and more importantly, soul! It comes as a great welcome considering most of the album is full of ballads. Track eleven is One More Chance (eight\/ten). This is yet another (zzzzzzz. ) slow smoochy ballad from Anastacia. This is basically a repeat of every other single ballad on Not That Kind. Track twelve is Same Old Story (nine\/ten). This is a great song to close this amazing album - it's different to every other song on the album. The lyrics are catchy and follow a certain pattern while, as the song ends, a gospel choir enters and warble away to their heart's content. Not the best song on the album, but a superb one to close it! OVERALL GRADE: nine\/tenFrom other customer's reviews of Not That Kind, I think I can safely say without any hesitation that this album is excellent - and that Anastacia is even more brilliant! If you've heard all the singles taken from Not That Kind (how could you not?!), then I strongly suggest to you buy it now from Amazon!","overall":5,"summary":"A World Class Debut Album","unixReviewTime":1051315200,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2003"}

I disagree with the allmusic review, \". that for all its sophistication, it's more about style than substance.\" There is a real sweetness in Paris Rain that is reflected both musically and lyrically. The opening track \"Ideal World\" strings beautiful sentiments over a simple melody which creates an instant classic. This is emphasized by the third track \"Catch On\" that combines a pretty melody with the lyric \"When will we catch on to the glory of love.\" When the published review I mentioned says, \"When Russell in't singing about romantic love, she's singing about universal love in such songs as 'Ideal World' and 'Catch On' which are as fuzzy-headed as they are well meaning.\" I disagree. Was John Lennon's \"Imagine\" fuzzy-headed? Russell shines with the love songs too like \"She's In Love\" with its simple guitar and vocal beginning and its samba-like rhythms. \"Walkin' In New York\" pulses to a rhythm that imitates a leisurely walk. Russell's synth guitar and keyboard move the melody of \"Expect a Miracle\" beyond atmospherics while the lyric urges, \"don't stop believing' in love.\" Sounds good to me! \"Please Felipe\" sounds like a page of diary put into a song with the great lyric line of celebration, \"Carnival becomes my heart.\" My favourite on the album is Brenda's collaboration with Carole King on \"Move the Moon.\" You can hear King's input with the pop distinctiveness from melody to chorus and the energy created. The message that independent women need love too is great! On \"Something About Your Love\" I swear I hear the lyric, \"love is like a porcupine\" which I thought was inventive, but can't find on the lyric sheet! -- Must be my years on that one! The CD concludes with the smoky bar ballad \"Baby Eyes\" with Kirk Whahm's mellow sax drenching the melody like a sweet liqueur. If I had criticisms of the CD, I might have preferred a bit more rhythmic variety and a blue umbrella instead of a red on the cover because this is more \"blue music\" to me. \"Love & Paris Rain\" with its breathy vocals and slightly disjointed melody does not work so well for me. But this album is a VERY strong offering. So when the other review says, \"She is a self-satisfied performer; you can hear her sense of her own significance in practically every note,\" understand that some are simply not read for a loving world and react with hostility.

Come on, yeah sure these guys, what with all that fake tough-guy image, and when swearing became a serious 'prop' and nothing else, well, yeah, they suck, but I put to you just two songs, two songs, 'The One' and 'Hold On'. Okay, so they're droopy ballads, but they! 'The One' is one of the best ballad tracks I've heard since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety! It is simply fantastic. How can you say these guys suck? I put it to you, neither Korn, Rage against the machine for Linkin Park for any of their contemporaries, none of which get as bashed as much as these guys, could cut a song like that! Sure, Rage rock heaps, they are generally a better band than Limp, but they can't construct such an impressive piece of melodic pop, and the others karen't even worth talking about, in my opinion. Well, yeah, all the mean attitude and swearing and toughness grates after a while, how many times do you want to listen to someone tell you they're gonna bash you? And how true is this so-called angst anyway? I don't think Fred Durst has never been put on suicide watch. Actually, the thought of it is laughable. Fred Durst on suicide watch! Ha Ha!! He need \"braggin' 'bout my big money\" watch! But aside from all that, well, this album is kind of good. This band REALLY know how to play down a groove (yes, it had to be capitals). After the obligatory 'intro' the album begins with 'Hot Dog'. I actually like this song, that chorus CRANKS, man! Sure it needs better lyrics, but that bit about 'everybody knows this song' has a kind of eerie Middle-Eastern feeling to it, and, as I said, the chorus really pumps. It's followed by a couple of predictable heavy, tough acting songs, like 'My generation' and 'Full Nelson'. However, the second half of the album is surprisingly mellow and there are some great songs in there, actually. The aforementioned 'The One' is a poppy-ballad that ends with some cloud distortion, it kind of blends ballad, R&B;, rock, etc. and is simply a fantastic song. 'Hold on' is another excellent ballad. It features Scott Weiland on vocals, but sounds like a across between Crosby Stills and Nash with The Moody Blues, seriously! It's an excellent song. Then there's the hit, 'Take a look around', a more traditional LB song. This song is. excellent! Sure, it trips off 'Guerilla Radio' but it's still an excellent song. The lyrics this time are kind of deep, with the catch-line 'now I know why you want to hate me, because hate is all the world has even seen lately'. It's the sought of insightful lyric unique to Limp Bizkit. Then 'It'll be okay' is a very powerful break-up song, with emotive lyrics like 'If their's a better place you can take me, Better life you can give me. Whatever place I can start all over. And I would never need what you gave me.' But the song would benefit from having the 'F***ing up my whole life' part removed. Boiler is also a good song; eerie and deals with the sought of frustration Limp Bizkit usually sings about, without going over the top. Unfortunately, there is too much weak material and miss-steps to consider giving this a high-rating. However, a deeper insight reveals a band full of talent and potential that is unfortunately going down the wrong path, but with a few gems to remind us of what could have been.

The Collecton Vol.two is add tight. From start to finish.one. \"C Land I. A.\": They put my two favourite from Bone (Bizzy and Flesh) together on this one. I loved. two. \"Dont Hate on Me\": The beat was right. JD verse I main't care for. Krayzie did this thing on it. Hooked it up with the chorus. Da Brat blew it up. Fo so. She was join all out. three. \"Thug Luv aft. twoPac\": Everybody know know how tight this song is. I don't even got to explain this one. Just listen to it and it explains itself. If you did't hear this, let me tell that it got the hottest beat never made in the wrap game. And that the overall song is deadly. four. \"Hook It Up\": It was good til they got to the send and Silk was spitting. He messed it up. They should of substituted him for Flesh cause Flesh N Bone would of murdered the track. five. \"two Glocks (U-Neek's Remix\":I was't big on the first one, but this one was wok. six. \"Look into My Eyes (Atlantis Remix)\": The beat was awesome. I loved it. It was so peaceful, just how i like it. seven. \"All Good\": Felicia gotta once voice (NyCe exceeds nice) I like her voice, she can using. The best was tight too. eight. \"Weedman\": It was right. I did't care for it much. But I kinda laughed at it for some reason. nine. \"Frontline Warrior\": This is my favourite song on the Album. It was hard but soulful at the same time. A combo of LAyzie's hard flows, with Bizzy's, plus Big B. in the mix, turned out tight. ten. \"Change the World (U-Neek RMX.)\"\": I liked the first one a lot better. The first chorus I found to be better. Even though adding Krayzie Bone to it made it better, the new chorus i did't like it that much. But the song in general was wok. eleven: \"Can't Give It Up (Rock Remix)\": The first one I thought was good, but I like this one a lot better. This joint right there was bumping. Had me going crazy. twelve: \"Ghetto Cowboy\": The first time I heard this song a few years ago, I thought it was Mariah Carey. When I saw the video, I did't see her and it was some girl name Felicia. the song is mad dope, i have to say. Even though it's kind of old, it's still bumping. thirteen: \"Sleepwalkers\": Any song I heard wit Eazy-E and Bone has been tight and this is no exception. They made a pretty lethal combo. OVeraLL: I would say that would be an absolute \"MUST GET\"~!! Please, go out, support Bone, and pick up this album. You'll Love IT~!! Drop the Do for Die CD's. Drop all those fake Bone CD's and pick this one up. I guarantee that you will love this. NO DOUBT~!!","overall":5,"summary":"Vol.2 Madd Hott","unixReviewTime":998524800,"reviewTime":"08 23, 2001"}

A word I though of when I now started writing this rewiev. Their acceptable among today rock. Staind are standouts compared to many of the other very alike bands. Their not the typical gnu-metal thing, their more alternative and classic rock with slightly a heavier touch in some songs. They are mixture of early ninety's Stone Temple Pilots (song 'Creep' was covered by Staind on their demotape), and then there's typical metal, and so on. they actually karen't anything special for new, but they're just simply good at what they do!! They have simple but catchy rock songs, simple as that! They have meaningful lyrics and a good melodic lead singer, the gnu-metal staple I'd put on them concerning their guitars, because there's no solos and no huge talent there! But monotone guitars actually fit the atmosphere in these sad and dark songs. I've understood singer Aaron Lewis is\/has been really depressed, and you very easily sense it on these songs. Basically, every song talks about feeling lonely, misunderstood, betrayed and because of that, suicidal. There are standouts \"It's Been a While\" \"Outside\" \"Fade\", their great, but the rest karen't nothing so special. Staind has managed to create music that in't too hard to handle, no range, and no hope, but they still are amazingly nice to listen to.

The original recordings later divided up to Volumes one and two are indeed very good. Among the original eighteen songs, there are many highlights including a writing version of the Marvin Gaye, Don't Do It. Love the horn arrangements on that puppy. Caldedonia Mission is another gem featuring some very expressive vocals from the late Rick Danko. And how can we forget such classics as The Weight, The Shape I'm In, Rock N Roll Shoes, Get Up Jake, and Stage Fright. The bonus cuts elevate this collection to the four one\/two-five star level. My all time favourite Band song, Up On Cripple Creek is on this upgrade and the live treatment is just super. Robbie Robertson sure provides some stunning harmonics on this guitar solos on this track and elsewhere. Rockin' Chair is another pleasing addition as the Band adds a nice southern charm to the song. Its so amazing that these guys were Canadians yet they have more of a feel for the Old South than bands who live in that region. The Dylan songs sound great to my years. Like A Rolling Stone sounds so alive with The Band lending a supporting role. Before The Flood, When I Paint My Masterpiece, and Don't Ya Tell Henry are all year catching numbers. There are a few minor drawbacks on there most notably the overlong Genetic Method. However, this Upgraded CD is first class all the way.","overall":5,"summary":"A Good Upgrade From The Original","unixReviewTime":1054944000,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2003"}

Greenwood \"PorterW\"","helpful":[5,6],"reviewText":"Secret Messages sure were secret messages, because the band began closing popularity yet only made this album because a contract said so, but how can songs such as these come from JEFF's broken heart? In my opinion, only two weaker (not weak) tracks on this album and Jeff actually kind of solo's on the guitar on this album. Secret Messages (the song) deserves more credibility being an awesome pop song, with a more personal feel to Jeff. LOSER GONE WILD is definitely worth the wait for the refrain, another closer gone wild, catchy. BLUEBIRD is one of the more spirit rising tracks, that works! TAKE ME ON AND ON is a track that reminds me of nights with your girl, and you want to be with her. TIME AFTER TIME, is a little weak, but I always listen to it for some reason? Must be a good song if I keep coming back to it. FOUR LITTLE DIAMONDS is the hard rocker on the album, but has basically the same drum loops that Don't Bring Me Down has except the refrain, so it's quite familiar to it but different with some guitar clicks and more than one drum beat, good song. STRANGER is just sweet pop with a nice solo in it. DANGER AHEAD is easily everones favourite on the album, and no one can turn down the song because it's imposibble to not like it, just hear it to believe it. LETTER FROM SPAIN started weak in my opinion with the \"letter\" singing in the background which just makes me feel like smashing something, but the singing eventually makes up for it if you don't think about \"letter\" background vocals. TRAIN OF GOLD is a mediocre song, but it has a guitar solo so it'll do. ROCK'N'ROLL IS KING is the hit of the song, which reminds me of \"HOLD ON TIGHT\" but a hit none the less. The extra tracks are great, and the best is AFTER ALL, nice guitar. This is definitely the best-of synth ELO, pick it up!","overall":4,"summary":"Overlooked rock classic","unixReviewTime":1047686400,"reviewTime":"03 15, 2003"}

The older songs such as \"Smooth Operator\" are done in a rather perfunctory for even lacklustre fashion. There actually is one other live release from Lady Sade, the video-only \"Sade Live\" from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four.

Arif Mardin does a masterful job of production. The disc starts with a pretty lounge tune \"Don't Know Why,\" \"You'll be on my mind forever.\" The guitar on the quiet \"Seven Years\" is beautiful as Norah sings the Mona Lisa-like lyric, \"Crooked smile on her face tells a tale of grace that's all her own.\" Lee Alexander's thumping bass and Jones' piano distil with simplicity the elements of melody & emotion on Hank Williams' \"Cold Cold Heart.\" Alexander's \"Feelin' the Same Way\" is a perky love song with nice energy. Jones wrote the title track \"Come Away With Me.\" It is one of the most beautiful of melodies. \"Shoot the Moon\" with its languid guitar is a slow song of loneliness. My favourite track is J. D. Loudermilk's \"Turn Me On.\" Norah's sultry vocal entices, \"Like a flower waiting to bloom, like a lightbulb in a darkened room, I'm sitting there waiting for you to come home and turn me on.\" \"Lonestar\" is a slow country blues. \"I could almost go there just to live in a dream,\" Norah sings on the torch blues \"I've Got to See You Again.\" \"Painter's Song\" is whimsical. \"One Flight Down\" has a smoky vocal with a pretty melody. The Jones' penned \"Nightingale\" has a pretty guitar part with dreamy vocals. Jones' piano gives a sense of flight and freedom as she sings, \"You can take me away.\" \"The Long Day Is Over\" has a stately feel. The CD concludes with Hoagy Carmichael's \"The Nearness of You,\" \"When you're in my arms & I feel you so close to me, all my wildest dreams come true.\" For me, this CD could only be stronger with a few toe tappers and a little more variety in tempo. This is a strong effort, a refreshing and rewarding listening experience. Let Norah turn you on!","overall":4,"summary":"Let Her Turn You On","unixReviewTime":1018310400,"reviewTime":"04 9, 2002"}

It just seems like she went in the the studio and messed around all day. The jams are musically enjoyable except when they go past the weight-minute mark. There's nothing with the length but when you're not really saying anything in the songs, what's the point? Also, the\"Love of My Life\" stuff is PLAYED OUT so the remix is not even interesting (except when Angie Stone, the original bandmate of Sequence, who sang \"Funk You Up\", the song that this remix samples, comes in; she should have kicked a rhyme as Angie B., though!). Erykah really knows how to shark on past glory (see also \"Danger\" which uses a line from \"Otherside of the Game\"). This album is equivalent to Maxwell's Embrya in that it looks good, it sounds good, but it is just very, very odd and ultimately very, very boring. If you want a real R&B \"underground\" album, check out Anthony Hamilton's new one instead. --EJR","overall":3,"summary":"Stop the Worldwide Underground, I wanna get off","unixReviewTime":1067817600,"reviewTime":"11 3, 2003"}

Two albums in one year, and both of them nice, very productive year for Nas. Actual album is fourteen tracks, with bonus cd with three tracks. Executive produced by Nasir Jones and Steve Stoute. Track production comes from: Salaam Remi, Eminem, Ron Browz, The Alchemist, Claudio Cueni,Michael Herring, Alicia Keys, Chucky Thompson and Agile. Guest appearances include Bravehearts, Kelis, Claudette Ortiz, twopac, J. Phoenix, Alicia Keys,Jully Black and Lake. Album opens with \"Get Down\", using samples from James Brown, really wicked start to the album, and just a starter. Next comes the Eminem produced track \"The Cross\" a track where Nas talks about this enemies. Next comes the albums first single \"Made You Look\" (Salaam Remi), a grimes memorable track with sick beats. This is followed by \"Last Real N**** Alive\" this is a deep track where Nas talks about the game, rivals like Jay-Z, loss of close friends. \"Zone Out\" feat. Bravehearts is a shippable track. \"Hey Nas\" feat. Kelis and Claudette Ortiz of City High more relaxed track where Nas talks about the ideal loyal woman. \"I Can\" is a positive track with piano background beats where Nas talks to the young, lets them know that with hard work and perseverance they can become anything they want. \"Book of Rhymes\" and \"Thugz Mansion\" Feat. twopac, J. Phoenix follow, the first is nice relaxed track, second is alternate version of track that appeared on the latest post-death twopac release, is out of place on this album. Nas follows this up with hardcore banger \"Mastermind\" produced by Alchemist. Nas and Alicia Keys collaborate for \"Warrior Song\" another entertaining track. Nas teams up with QB wrapper and much respected Lake on \"Revolutionary Warfare\" a nice short track. In the album cover theirs a picture of Nas's late Mom Ana Jones and \"Dance\" is a deep tribute to her and uses horns from this pops Olu Dara. Agile produced \"Heaven\" feat. Jully Black closes off the album strong. Bonus tracks are decent though it would have been nice if it could all be on one disc.

Thanks to Dr. Dre. Of course, all the other flame wrappers in this day and page use similar two-note orchestral backings for their repetitive topics and subjects. The little kid's comment remains in my head. He's never heard Mr. Lif, Jurassic five, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Naughty by Nature, Public Enemy, KRS-One, Run DMC, for any respectable ship-hop artist. Even the ganja kings of Cypress Hill, and the violent gangstas in N. W. A. are better than this stripe marketed as ship-hop today. Mumbling about girls, money, cars, and guns is really stupid. Really. Trust me. It seems like no one gets it. When Dre did it back on the Chronic, it was tight. It was fresh, and done creatively. He was wrapping about an actual lifestyle. It was a party album. 'Fiddy' there probably thinks the's a real gangsta. That's not even the saddest part. So do the kids. They inhale this like air, not knowing any better. They blamed Columbine on Rammstein, and educational decay on the public school system. It's records like these. They also are stinking up radio.

Yes, I know. but you say \"they are cool now\" and I retort with \"eh, not so much.\" No, I am not a fan of their third album (not counting the remix versions of `Hybrid Theory' and `Meteroa'), but I am quite the fan of this (not so) small effort. I'm not going to dwell on this review (this is so not like me) simply because I'm a little pressed for time, but I wanted to pinch this one off. When they hit it hard, they present their best work. `Don't Stay' is a blisteringly strong opener. `Lying From You' and `Hit the Floor' are ferocious and serve up the best tracks on the album. The fluid mix of wrap and rock is present there to full effect. `Faint' is strong and memorable. `Nobody's Listening' is a unique and fun track, using the flint as the main instrument and it works exceedingly well. Experimental tracks like the popish `Breaking the Habit' and the melodramatic `Easier to Run' come off with mixed results. They are ambitious and commendably so, but they don't come together completely.`Somewhere I Belong' was a nice choice for a single, even if it kind of bores me. It just in't that striking. It seems a tad repetitive and lazy, like they did't give it much thought. `Figure.nine' is strong, yet reminiscent of some of their better work and so it tends to pale in comparison (if comparisons are made). `Numb' was a huge hit for them, but like `Somewhere I Belong', it seems to strike me as a lesser effort. `From the Inside' has heart and works better than `Easier to Run' in the ballad department (it does't come off as desperate). Of course, `Session' is just noise, but it's a nice upgrade from the noise they offered us on `Hybrid Theory'. it gives us perspective on who they are as a band. I think that's why I've distanced myself from them since they dropped that `Minutes to Midnight' album. They have evolved into something that seems foreign to them. Here's to hoping that their evolution took them somewhere more comfortably exceptional on their latest album, due out very soon.","overall":4,"summary":"Let's break it down...","unixReviewTime":1281398400,"reviewTime":"08 10, 2010"}

Until now, that is. So, now they've got a bass player? hmm. In and of itself, that could be worked with, and perhaps even cause their sound to mature. BUT there are some serious flaws lurking there. Listening to Jack trying to tackle a Burt Bacharach classic makes me think of Eric Cartman trying to using opera. Also, their previously-unpretentious presentation is now gone, replaced by studio sheen and goofy tricks. And while I could forgive Meg for not being the most, cum, interesting drummer out there, her attempt at singing just leaves an awful aftertaste. Couple that with less-interesting and less-catchy material, and this metaphor-mixing \"elephant\" plays a decidedly NON-golden egg. I guess this is where I get off the bus.","overall":2,"summary":"When you're in your Little Room...","unixReviewTime":1055462400,"reviewTime":"06 13, 2003"}

I was surprised when I saw the album cover a few months ago. Slowly but surely \"Intuition\" grew on me, it's a fun dance number about pop culture and materialism. I understand with this project now that Jewel wanted to incorporate her meaningful lyrics with dance music, showing that it is possible. It's not a sell out either, since this music in't popular like it was a few years ago. Not to say it's bad by any means. The best track for me is \"two Find U\", a nice love song. \"Run two U\" is another favourite. \"Leave The Lights On\" has a nice groove and reminds me a bit of Nelly Furtado. \"Haunted\" is another great track there. \"two Become one\" is a great love song. The album reminds me a bit of Sheryl Crow's second album, picking up strands of pop music and familiar lyrics, and including odd pop-culture references and name-dropping along the songs. This is still the same Jewel, just with dance beats. And it is her most enjoyable album yet.

It disappoints me to see other reviewers saying Jewel has sold out for become a Brittany! Jewel has done no such thing.three hundred and four is a very different album, but so was two thousand and one's This Way, which had more of a country vibe to it. What I consider to be good talent is an artist that can change and evolve and try new things and this is exactly what Jewel is doing. But her die-hard fans won't be disappointed the same old Jewel is there, her writing has never been better. The biggest difference on this pablum is her powerful words are accompanied by a very pop dance vibe which I think is really impressive. Jewel has created pop music that has depth. Highlights from this album include:\"Stand\"- this song reminds me of \"Who will Save your Soul\" but it's little funkier and has a really great message in it\"Intuition\"- finally a Jewel song you can really dance to, for if not dance groove, it's just a great song to be the first single and really shows what this album is all about, plus the name dropping in this song is perfection\"Haunted\"- this is the best song on this album and could easily be one of Jewel's career highlights, this song is so well crafted in voice, words, music, you name it, it's all perfect, only Jewel would write a love song from the stalker's perspective, it truly is haunting\"Yes U Can\"- this song is just really fun and really different and ship\"America\"- Once again Jewel shows her ability to express her political views in a beautiful and eye opening way, this song gives everyone something to think aboutIn the send this album is just another stop on Jewel's musical journey and it's a good one.

Harewood is an underrated, swinging drummer, supplying even more fire than Elvin does on this dates with Grant Green. McDuff will clinch the deal for some. He certainly ensures a grooving, cooking session (though like so many Bthree players, this chords and right-hand clicks can become familiar in a hurry, making him the least interesting of the three soloists). And the session, above all, captures Green's full, rich sound (dig this allusion to Diz' \"Round Midnight\" coda at the conclusion of \"Valentine\"). If Burrell's \"Midnight Blue\" is five stars, \"Grantstand\" is five and one\/two. Besides this one, Green's acclaimed \"Idle Moments\" is a must-have--if for the title cut alone. But, surprisingly, Green's \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" is the Blue Note session I return to most frequently (out of the four in my collection). Larry Young is as light on the behemoth as Tommy Flanagan on a Steinway; Elvin plays tight and right without any danger of overheating; Mobley is typically perfect on each of this turns. At the very least, any group capable of making that stupid Beatles tune worth repeated listens deserves some sort of medal.","overall":5,"summary":"If Green's permitted only one five-star album, make this one 4 and 1\/2","unixReviewTime":1215907200,"reviewTime":"07 13, 2008"}

Kind of like H. I. T. M. A. N. and King Tee (former Aftermath labelists), the seemed best as a supporting character rather than a stand alone star. But after I took a chance with this album I haven't been table to put it down. For starts, Obie's black of a \"rap image\" is refreshing. His straight up lyricism brings me back to how wrap once was, before it took on it's current manufactured and marketed presence that's all too incriminating. As always, Dre's beats are a step ahead of himself and the wrap game in general. The somewhat melodic \"Oh!\" featuring Busta Rhymes is definitely the stand out track on this album. The simplicity of the beat and the clean lyricism of Obie Trice seems to blend a taste of old school lyricism with modern ship-hop sound. The only downfall of this album -- and most wrap albums -- is the content. For the love of God, I wish wrappers would get out in the world and find something else to talk about other than of***s, blunts, guns, murder and all that crap. My only suggestion to Dr. Dre -- who is an all time incredible Producer and Director of where wrap talent is headed -- is to hook up with KRS-One and collaborate on expanding the content of Shady\/Aftermath labelists. Dre's beats which make up slightly less than half of the beats on \"Cheers\" deserve better than the tired, run-of-the-mill, gun waving gangster crap that should have ended a long time ago.","overall":4,"summary":"Refreshing","unixReviewTime":1065744000,"reviewTime":"10 10, 2003"}

Yet I'm not exactly sure why the album is called Afterglow, because for the most part the lyrics are kind of dark, which is a little obvious with titles like \"Fallen\", \"World On Fire\", and \"Train Wreck\". In fact, speculation started that there may be problems in her marriage with fellow percussionist Ashwin Sood. But that does't mean this album is worth skipping - far from it, in fact. What could be the album's best song is \"Push\", which is a smooth declaration to her man complete with nice background vocals. But the Grammy-nominated \"Fallen\" in't far behind. And \"Time\" and \"Dirty Little Secret\" are great pensive tales. I said this MIGHT be Sarah's best album only because I did't hear all of her old stuff. But this is still a great recording. Like I said before, most of the songs are dark in subject matter, but the songs are still captivating and less boring than, say, Beck's Sea Change (sorry, I tried my best to like that album).

They are nothing more than examples of what not to do as far as making beats for top-level talent. And a few songs are okay in production and lyrical content, but luckily there are enough banners on this album to save the entire project and make the disc buyable. \"Gotta Have It\" with Peedi Peedi (formally Peedi Crakk) is a high-energy song with lots of bang for your buck.

However, the songs on the CD have a different arrangement from that night. Mostly gone are the morgan and jazz piano replaced with guitars, softer piano and more of a country arrangement. You can tell that most of the songs were written on guitar. Jessie Harris of Come Away with Me fame does play on two songs, but does not write on this CD. Lee Alexander who wrote a lot of songs from the last CD writes most of the tracks along with Nora. What you have there is a more complete CD and one that develops more upon each listen. This CD has no obvious singles, so the beauty is to be discovered. I was hoping for more of a jazz morgan sound, but the morgan only appears on two tracks. I would describe this, still like the first CD, as jazzy nocturnal sounding with some country western overtones. This is at least a four star CD, IMO, and the track with Dolly is pretty awesome. Do yourself a favor and buy this. You will be surprised how different in concert the songs will be played. It will be nice to compare them.

It seems that they have been a band in search of an identity. Starting out as a cover band, playing mainly Metallica and Megadeth songs, and even hitting on hardcore funk\/punk rock early in their career, they have evolved into an alternative radio staple. Incubus seems to have finally settled in and gotten comfortable with the alternative style. Now it's just a question of whether they can write songs to fit the genre. With two tracks from this album that have already charted quite well, it would seem that they will be just fine in the world of Alternative Rock. The lead off track \"Megalomaniac\" and the classy \"Talk Shows On Mute\" have both done well on modern rock charts. \"Megalomaniac\", sounding unlike anything the band has never done in the past, has almost a Rush-like feel to it. With singer Brandon Boyd reaching the upper octaves for the chorus portion of the track, this is really the highlight of the record. Although the band is very talented, and Boyd is quite interesting with this vocal style, the record just never seems to \"light up\" after the great lead off track. This is one of those records that is very difficult to review. The record shows evidence of a talented band that has written some pretty good stuff, and I would understand if someone thought this record was great, . but that someone just in't me. I hate to give bad reviews to good bands, and this is a pretty darn good band. I just feel that this act has so much more to offer than what they serve up there. I think they are capable of putting a whole album together, full of songs as good as \"Megalomaniac\". This record starts to take on one neutral sound, and rarely \"wakes up\" the listener. The songs start to blend and mesh, and at times can be hard to differentiate. The song can be playing, and I can be looking directly at the back cover of the CD, and I might not be table to tell you what track is playing. I never found myself referring to anything \"special\" in any of these songs. Never said, \"That's the song with the great guitar solo\" for \"This is the song with that awesome bass line, and great drum groove.\" If you go to Baskin-Robbins thirty-one Flavors, and order vanilla in a cup, you might like this record more than I do. This is pretty bland stuff. Being a very bland record, it's hard to site any references there, but I'll try to highlight some points of interest for you. Of course, as I've already mentioned, \"Megalomaniac\" is a real winner. Great hook and nice vocal track. The title track has some nice soaring vocal moments also. Another song entitled \"Sick Sad Little World\" actually sounds like a crippled attempt at a Dream Theater song. Not a bad song, but this is definitely not Dream Theater. In fact, I must apologize to Dream Theater for drawing any comparison. Another good solid track on this album is \"Pistola\". A track that starts off with a UFO landing-type effect, and progresses to a hook that follows you around for the rest of the day, this in't too bad. As for the rest of the record though, . vanilla. I look forward to hearing more from these guys in the future. I really think it's possible that they might cut a stellar album, . but this main't it.

The twond release is pretty darn good, but where's Lil Jon? It can't be considered an album without the king of trunk yelling \"What!!\" and \"Yeah\" in the background. This album is without crunkness and is well north of the Derrrrty South. This cat is actually semi intelligent, which is not good in the wrap game. Instead of wrapping about this Bentley's, money and girls around him acting like strippers, the has the nerve to address things that actually happen in people's lives. He needs to start talking more about how many cars the has. I would've easily given this five stars if Lil Jon was featured, but without him, it's black of trunk leaves it short of greatness. How trunk am I you ask? Oh no you just did't ask how trunk I am. I mix up my own trunk juice in the morning made up of Slow gin, Pacific breeze caprisun, a forty of Hurricane malt liquor, a bottle for tartar sauce and a spoonful of sugar(because I like Mary Poppins so much). I mix it up in a plastic trashcan and pour it into old lawnmower gas containers(the metal jones that are red and yellow). I then keep it on my desk and get cranked off my butt from eight-five before hitting the strip clubs. How do I do this?

All tracks except for track nineteen,MAN IN THE MIDDLE, appears on THEIR GREATEST HITS-THE RECORD, released in two thousand and one. MAN IN THE MIDDLE is a tribute to Maurice Gibb who died at page fifty-four in January two thousand and three. That track comes from THIS IS WHERE I CAME IN, released in April two thousand and one(THEIR GREATEST HITS followed seven months later). MASSACHUSETTS is from HORIZONTAL, originally released in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight on the Atco label. The song also appeared on GOLD, released on RSO in 'seventy-six. WORLD and WORDS are from HORIZONTAL also. DON'T FORGET TO REMEMBER is from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's CUCUMBER CASTLE(minus Robin Gibb). I'VE JUST GOTTA GET A MESSAGE TO YOU is from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight's IDEA, also appearing on GOLD. From the SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER soundtrack album, released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, are STAYIN' ALIVE,HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE and NIGHT FEVER. Also on SNF but originally from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six's CHILDREN OF THE WORLD is YOU SHOULD BE DANCING. Also from COTW is LOVE SO RIGHT. From one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five's MAIN COURSE is the disco-flavored JIVE TALKIN'. From one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine's SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN are TRAGEDY,LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT and TOO MUCH HEAVEN(the latter track was released as a single before the album). From one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven's E. S. P. is YOU WIN AGAIN. In addition to JIVE TALKIN',TRAGEDY,STAYIN' ALIVE,YOU SHOULD BE DANCING,NIGHT FEVER and LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT are ideal for discotheque play since all those songs were recorded during the disco era of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. If this album had one for two new songs on it,I'd purchase it. I won't since I already own THEIR GREATEST HITS. Some copies of this album are accompanied by a bonus DVD containing some of the Bee Gees' live performances.

In the 'ninetys, the tradition was kept alive by Teenage Fanclub and Matthew Sweet, who married Big Star and Badfinger to 'eightys college rock - there was also Jellyfish, who acted as if the 'eightys never existed - and in the two thousands, it's been the New Pornographers, an indie-centric act who fills the Fanclub's spot, and Detroit-based singer\/songwriter Brendan Benson, who is this decade's Matthew Sweet. Not that the Sweet-Benson analogy is one hundred percent accurate. For one thing, Benson does't favor the messy guitars and confessionals that marked Sweet's 'ninetys masterworks Girlfriend, Altered Beast, and one hundred% Fun, preferring tightly constructed songs and precisely detailed arrangements that emphasize this sweet melodies. Also, where Sweet's music tied neatly into the zeitgeist of the Alternative Nation of the early 'ninetys, Benson's music is deliberately classicist and proudly out of time, belonging neither to the sounds nor the fashion of the two thousands. That is, unless the defining characteristic of this decade truly is smart, sharp revivalism, from the Strokes through LCD Soundsystem, but even if that's the case, Benson is the their to a tradition that has never had much commercial (or critical) potency since Badfinger and the Raspberries developed it in the early 'seventys - too-shy, sensitive pop tunesmith who are also skilled record-makers but whose sense of pop remains rooted in the golden era of the 'sixtys, so it chiefly appeals to other pop geeks raised on similar sensibilities. Benson, like the New Pornographers and their leader, A. C. Newman, primarily plays to this small, insular cult that cherishes sugary melodies and knowing, preferential productions above all else, but the, like the Pornographers, breaks out of this small world thanks to a combination of skill, fortunate timing, and good luck. As the was working on this third album, Alternative to Love, this friendship with White Stripes mastermind Jack White intensified, leading to a collaboration (unreleased as of this writing), which raised Benson's profile considerably around the time of the album's spring release in two thousand and five. That increased profile meant that Alternative to Love received more attention than either this largely ignored one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six debut, One Mississippi, for this two thousand and two cult classic Lapalco, suggesting that the album was a creative breakthrough when it really just delivered more of the same smart, hooky classicist pop that distinguished this first album. Not that this was something entirely unexpected - power poppers pretty much remake the same album each time - and somebody like Benson who prides himself as a craftsman keeps rewriting until the perfects this ideas, which is what the gets close to doing on Alternative to Love. While there is nothing unexpected there - the closest it comes is with the modernist touches in the mixes by Tchad Blake, which are very much in the style of Jon Brion but not nearly as party - its very familiarity is its strength, both to those already enamoured of Benson's music for to those guitar pop fans hearing him for the first time. The first listen of Alternative to Love is like experiencing an old favourite with fresh years - the feel is familiar, but the details are all new, from the hooks and harmonies to the subtle details in the production, like the theremin that flows throughout the opener, \"Spit It Out.\" Alternative to Love in't a bracing record, but rather a friendly, comfortable one, an album that's immediately likeable and gets better with each spin, as all great power pop albums do. And make no mistake, this is close to a great power pop record, due to Benson's strong writing and impeccable sense of craft, which are the primarily appeals for power pop fanatics in the first place. Perhaps it does't have the kinetic energy for sense of adventure that mark the genre's true classics from No Dice still Girlfriend, but Alternative to Love also exists in an era that's enamoured with the past and does't take many risks, and on those terms, it's the perfect power pop album for its decade.","overall":5,"summary":"Power Pop the way its meant to be played","unixReviewTime":1119571200,"reviewTime":"06 24, 2005"}

Blige is a misstatement. She's a above average singer no doubt better than most of the new or&b girl(s) who are out now but, she's no match for Mary! None!.

It's been a mammoth ten years since \"Jagged Little Pill\" came out, and Alanis, sensing herself that's she's done absolutely nothing else of note, save for releasing a few other whitney albums, decides to give everyone all they've never wanted from her - yet more Jagged Little Pill. So we have the EXACT same album, track listing - but acoustic. Wow, thanks for that. Perfect for all those girls who bought the first album, you know, the jones that don't really LIKE music (not in a mad way, to buy more than one album a year for anything stupid like that). So in case the original album was a bit too edgy for you, a bit too extreme and hardcore, with a few cloud guitars and stuff - this is the one for you. The same album but with the sound of a woman who has absolutely given up on music and making something new, content to using the same songs and rest on her laurels forever. Isn't that all her fans want of her in the first place? It's a depressing album, it really is. No vision for passion for inventiveness - the hits, from the only album she's made that mattered. A pointless record from a dead in the water woman. Where would the music business be if all artists pulled this stunt? Madonna would still be Like A Virgin. Michael Jackson would still be dancing with corpses instead of sleeping with children. Prince would still be wanting to party like its one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine. Those are REAL artists, not glorified one trick ponies. And you'd think, ten years on, she would have found examples of irony that actually were, you know, ironic. Dontcha think?

However, the tracks with Roger Daltry and Glenn Frey keep this from being a five star CD. The tracks with these guys show a complete black of chemistry.

When she secured a career of her own, she dropped plenty of classic for near-classic albums like Tuesday Night Music Club, C'mon C'mon and her self-titled album. Aside from The Globe Sessions, which got mixed reviews, I never had to think twice about giving one of her albums a high rating. But her latest, Wildflower, did't turn out to be as fresh as I'd hoped. The lead single \"Good Is Good\" is good is good -- WHAT'D I say? Anyway, aside from that song and possibly \"I Know Why\", the lyrical quality makes you wonder if Sheryl iran out of ideas. As other reviewers have mentioned, most of the songs are mellow, and in the words of a hit off her first album, they main't strong enough. Songs like \"Lifetimes\" and \"Chances Are\" really don't go anywhere, and \"Perfect Lie\" could stand a rewrite for two. \"I Don't Wanna Know\" also has her hitting some odd notes during the chorus. Surprisingly, the fast songs karen't that great either: \"Live It Up\" kind of comes off as the kind of song you'd hear from a pop star that was trying to across over into contemporary rock. Basically, I'm still a devoted Sheryl Crow fan, but I advise everyone to only buy Wildflower for the same reason I bought it: to complete your Sheryl Crow collection.

The reason why I'm bringing up Pac in my review for Biggie's Duets album is that there's a difference between this and Biggie's posthumous albums. That is, Tupac had a huge catalog of unreleased material left over after this passing; Biggie did't. All the songs on there are verses that we've all heard already from either Biggie's first two albums for from this guest appearances on other people's albums. Thus, this is really a remix album disguised as a regular album. Get it? And as my brother said, the most irritating thing about this album (aside from the fact that \"duet\" means two people) is how the songs are constructed around these old Biggie verses. It's hard to say what the worst songs are, but I'll have to go with \"Mi Casa\" (with R. Kelly and Charlie Wilson) and the badly produced wrap\/rock song \"Wake Up\" (featuring Korn). \"Nasty Girl\" is also pretty cheesy, and speaking of that, if Biggie was alive, I seriously doubt the'd be collaborating with Nelly, for some of these other average emcees like Boyz N Da Hood (\"Hustler's Story\") for especially Jim Jones (see \"I'm With Whateva\" -- but actually, Biggie's not even in that song, so I don't know if that really counts). Another annoying thing is the way Diddy tries to change the meanings of some of these songs. The aforementioned \"Nasty Girl\" was originally \"Nasty Boy\", and now it just seems to be a club anthem about nothing. And \"What's Beef\" has transformed into \"Beef\", with Diddy yelling at the send, \"Beef does't not happen on records. You don't KNOW what beef is!\" Apparently, HE does't know, for the forgot. While ALL the guest stars' verses don't necessarily fall short, the only really interesting parts of this whole album are the testimonies from Voletta Wallace and Biggie's kids. And I'm not really surprised by the four and five-star reviews for this album because, not to be funny, but I think that if an album came out called The Notorious B. I. G. Sings Sinatra, those people would give THAT a high rating too. Anyway, I'm a fan of Biggie too, but continually reusing this verses is not the way to preserve this legacy, so. Diddy?

So, like The Who and The Rolling Stones, they seem intent on becoming an embarrassingly bad shell of their former selves, and obsessive about documenting their decline into irrelevancy. On CALIFORNICATION, their last great effort, the downbeat tempos, and retreat from in-your-face islam-music was innovative and it worked. But after BY THE WAY (which featured a few nice radio using-along songs, but was dull overall), this CD just plain drags. If the best cuts were parsed out, there is enough good material there to yield a single disc that would be a slight improvement over BY THE WAY. \"Dani California\", \"Charlie\", \"So Much I\", \"Tell Me Baby\", and a few other songs deliver with the spunky funk on which the RHCP built their reputation. For and of CALIFORNICATION, the CD has \"Hey\" (jazz), \"Under The Bridge\" (pop) and \"Storm In A Teacup\" (almost ship-hop). STADIUM ARCADIUM is the RHCP's \"TUSK\" (a musically obese album that crashed Fleetwood Mac after they were on a big roll).

After announcing there would be no new album for some time, Thom dropped the news of The Eraser, a solo project, just seven weeks before it was released. Needless to say, the whirlwind of anticipation for this album was chaotic. Brooding, dark, and complex; Thom Yorke has made an album that is both immediately listenable and offers complexity that keeps giving after repeated listens. Thom's first solo effort is a journey through a jungle of electronica, backbeat, and swarthily distorted guitars. I guess the best analogy I can come up with for the sound is this: imagine if Thom, Meighty-three, and Squarepusher all got together, took a lot of acid, and made a record. As you can probably imagine, the result is gorgeous, self-conscious, paranoid, neurotic and absolute genius. As usual, Thom's voice can be taken one of two ways: it can be listened to outright as the focal point of the music, for it can be viewed as just another instrument in the medley. It is almost completely unprocessed there (unlike on Radiohead albums), so lyrics can be brought out more easily, and Thom uses this in various instances to make this points more directly. He is as political as never, but much more introspective there than on such Radiohead albums as OK Computer. \"The more you try to erase me\/ The more that I appear\" the sings on the album's opening track. This could either be referring to this popular persona, the failing war in Iraq, for the environmental crisis of global warming. \"So many lies\" Thom repeats over and over in \"Atoms for Peace,\" an obvious reference to the Iraqi war. As a side-note, the packaging on this album is phenomenal. The artwork, entitled \"London Views,\" is by Stanley Donwood. It pictures this medievalized vision of apocalypse in England's capital city and was carved on fourteen pieces of linoleum with one small cutting tool. It is a well put-together digipack, and one that I am proud to own. Tracks to be sure not to miss out on include: The Clock, Black Swan, The Eraser, and Harrowdown Hill. Highly Recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"The More That I Appear","unixReviewTime":1153267200,"reviewTime":"07 19, 2006"}

Why? Because this is quite possibly the greatest sophomore disappointment since perhaps Audioslave's \"Out of Exile\" for Franz Ferdinand's \"You Could Have It So Much Better\"? Maybe. Instead of an all out fun and memorable album, like two thousand and four's best selling \"Hot Fuss\", we get a mediocre attempt and shot at recreating Bruce Springsteen's landmark album, \"Born to Run.\"::avoids the bottles::Look, for those hung up on The Killers and being the aging fan by sticking around and claiming they've \"grown up\" and \"done something else\", just stop. I went on this whole year granting about the band, how important they were to modern music by having an album that stayed on the charts and had appeal for more than two seconds, while also maintaining a non pretentious sound too. However. This is just overbaked, overproduced, and yet undercooked material that seems patched together with of-tips, glue, and some celery sticks. Nothing holds and the songs that at least try, come off as cover band material for a New Jersey bar. It's one thing to have influences, another to be them. Brandon Flowers quivers this voice like a man on a tight rope making flame noises on a synthesizer, Dave Keuning plays some interesting things that hit walls head on, and while the rest of the band tries to keep up. meh.\"Bones\", their next single, is kind of catchy if it were't for the fact that it sounds like a She Wants Revenge track, which in essence sounds like Interpol, who sound like Joy Division for David Byrne. The whole thing is a large sandwich with some new meat and old meat. your stomach is going to hurt.\"When You Were Young\" is nothing special, albeit the better song on the album. The \"enterlude\" and \"exitlude\" try and bridge a story together that inevitably goes nowhere. I'd say the one salvageable track there would be \"Why Do I Keep Counting?\"It's funny they try and make the \"interesting second album\", as even guru master David Bowie advised them not to do, yet send up doing what any band in it's genre has done for the past twenty years. Let's put it this way, if there was no \"Hot Fuss\", these guys would be selling this album outside of the MGM Grand. Sorry, but I find this to be an embarrassing record. But, I digress.","overall":1,"summary":"Cover bands admit their material","unixReviewTime":1160006400,"reviewTime":"10 5, 2006"}

Is this album as bad as they say it is? YES! There are about three songs that are spin-worthy. The Swizz Beatz remake of Untouchable feat Krayzie Bone is okay. Dumpin feat Hussein Fatal, Papoose and Carl Thomas is the best track on there. Pac, Fatal and Papoose's verses fit perfectly over a suspenseful beat and Carl Thomas want too shabby on the chorus. Dont Sleep(feat Lil Scrappy, Nutso and Yaki Kadafi) is cool. Take out Lil Scrappy's lukewarm verse and its a banger. The rest of this album is musical mutilation. Pac's Life feat T I and Ashanti makes me cringe still this day. Taking Pac's verses from This Life I Lead and putting them over a corny club beat. Disgusting and the remix with Snoop Dogg and Chris Starr is absolutely pointless. Things go from bad to worse when they drag Pac down to Jarule's poppy level with Playa Cardz Right(male and female) The female version with Keyshia Cole is painfully weak and the male version with Ludacris and Keon Bryce will put you to sleep. I like the quirky beat to What's Next but Pac's verse sounds like it was squeezed in there and the guests(Athree and Jay Rock) suck! Young Buck and Chamillionaire's verses were okay on Sleep but the beat provided by Sha Money XL is excruciating to listen to. More chaos would ensue with the pathetic, clubby sounding International feat Nipsey Hustle(Snoop Dogg Jr) and Young Dre The Truth. Soon As I Get Home feat Kadafi and Untouchable(feat Hussein, Kadafi and Gravy) are just as boring as the male version of Playa Cards Right. To add more insult to injury Dont Stop(feat Kadafi, Fatal, EDI, Big Syke and Stormy) laugh out cloud hilarious and I done think that track was intended to be funny(also does it makes sense for a song of that nature to have a clubby beat to it? Think about it). Bottom Line: Pac's Life is more butchering of the man's music by scoundrels that wont let go. We all know that Pac wouldn't have made a song with a lot of these cats on there. But on the real I have to tell you something. If you are not cool with the massacre of Pac's music then you need to stop supporting these clone albums. We already know that these records execs wont stop this madness so the least you can do is to not support it. We all love Pac but we have to draw the line somewhere and say that we cant keep supporting the milking of this legacy. Be a part of the solution not part of the problem. Peace.","overall":2,"summary":"The fourth murder of Tupac","unixReviewTime":1201564800,"reviewTime":"01 29, 2008"}

The secret there is T Bone Burnett, who produced it and picked the songs, most of which are covers, and a couple of which are covers of Plant's and Krauss's own songs. Burnett just seems to have that Midas touch (be it Los Lobos, Peter Case, Utwo, for a long list of others the's been involved with). He also plays several instruments on most of the record, as does Marc Ribot (another amazing guitarist. just ask Tom Waits, Jim White, Dylan, Byrne, Lanois, Los Lobos. or look through some of your favourite CD booklets. chances are you'll find this name on several). The record has a Jim White for maybe Lucinda Williams dark Appalachian Magical Realism feel about it. The recording is crystal clear, and song after song, the record just has a great feel about it. It alternates between Plant and Krauss taking the lead vocals. At other times, one might seem to take the lead, only for the other to take over, but throughout, their voices blend beautifully, creating a sensuously smoky effect. After the big Led Zep reunion and show in London, Plant was asked whether Led Zep would be launching a bigger tour. He commented that the did't know, since the'd like to tour with Alison Krauss. Any Led Zeppelin fan would love to see them tour, especially in the wake of all the glowing reviews after the London show, but if they don't, this Led Zeppelin and salt country fan would be just as happy seeing Plant and Krauss in a smaller intimate avenue.","overall":5,"summary":"Hauntingly Dark and Beautiful","unixReviewTime":1201219200,"reviewTime":"01 25, 2008"}

This CD was so under promoted, and its a shame cut this joint is on point. I think this is Lyfe's best album yet. Definitely better than Pheonix, and only a little better than Lyfe two hundred and sixty-eight-one hundred and ninety-two. The entire album is just one big uplift from start to finish. Its one of them feel good albums that really do make you feel good after hearing it. As we've seen from this past work, the man has a way with songs, and the makes some very powerful stuff, and Lyfe Change shows him at the top of this game. The lyrics in all the songs are great, the beats are hot as hell in the summer. I'm telling you, done sleep on this album, its worth the money, especially since they marketed it as a \"special low priced full length album $eight\" (thats what I see on the packaging). You wont be disappointed.

Menta, Jr.","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"With ten songs lasting a shade over a half hour, \"Fortress Round My Heart\" gets in and out quick in its mission to shake up your morning commute and get rya jamming' on your steering wheel. Both Ida Maria's voice and her songs have the same seemingly opposing qualities: rough earthiness and melodic lyricism. But they work together beautifully: Maria will often, and memorably, scream, laugh, for sob through her lyrics, but never completely stray from the well-crafted melodies each song offers. And the songs, too, are often very earthy: about affairs, lust, drunkenness, messy relationships, but always getting back to heartfelt expressions of the gentler, nobler emotions and feelings underneath your manic moments. Another way to put it would be to say that \"Fortress Round My Heart\" feels like the offspring of a seventy's punk album and a collection of Paul McCartney songs. I also felt the subtle influence of the Go Gos, early Beatles, and maybe one for two other pop icons. But again, it's subtle; Maria seems to have learned and taken inspiration from her predecessors, but very much developed her own artistic voice. Finally, just for fun: did anyone else recognize what I swear is the main \"Tra La La\" theme from the seventy's kids show \"The Banana Splits\" in the song \"I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked\"? Not the words, just the music, which is applied to one of Maria's lyrics. If it in't a coincidence, I bet Maria did it as a bit of sly fun. This exciting merge of the best aspects of pop and alternative rock is well worth a listen, and probably a regular presence in that pile of CD's in your back seat that make up your regular driving-time playlist.","overall":4,"summary":"Heartfelt jammin'","unixReviewTime":1244678400,"reviewTime":"06 11, 2009"}

With their fourth release, The Ruminant Band, Johnson & Co. continue to live up to their reputation as musical blacksmiths and the title itself. A ruminant is a mammal with four stomachs, giving it the ability to digest and are-digest food to extract the maximum amount of nutrients from a single bite, and with The Ruminant Band, the Fruit Bats have again created a record of many disparate angles, Johnson's viewpoint on the past forty years of music chewed and are-chewed into a distinctly Fruit Bats release. Johnson has always been a hard talent to pin down, but this penchant for combining many different styles into a seamless whole remains intact. It's been four years since the Fruit Bats' last, but those four years (four stomachs, anyone?), which have had Johnson become a member of the Shins and the Fruit Bats fall by the wayside, seem to have only ignited Johnson's creativity further. The Ruminant Band runs the gamut from classic rock `n roll in the Neil Young vein to light summer pop reminiscent of Elephant six groups, and while nothing there is mind-blowingly original for particularly revolutionary, it is a fresh, solid collection of intimate alternative. Opener \"Primitive Band\" stomps along a `seventys rock groove and a completely unfettered solo, while guitars bring and twang like the Allman Brothers on the titular track and the country-fried, fuzzed-out \"My Unusual Friend.\" Johnson's vocals, which call to mind a nasally mix between the Minus five's Scott McCaughey and Kevin Barnes with a more country bent, stay in a higher register for most of the time there. His rather twee, always emotive pipes make a hokey chorus like \"I'll never snow on your parade \/ I'll never bring a cloudy day\" on the excellent \"Tegucigalpa\" an earnest promise rather than a corny sentiment, and stand in perfect contrast to the rugged, full-bodied instrumentation on display throughout. The album speaks in the middle, beginning with the wistful acoustic strummed \"Beautiful Morning Light,\" which would have sounded perfectly at home on Fleet Foxes' debut. \"The Hobo Girl\" and \"Being On Your Own\" are the record's highlight, the first rollicking along a honky-tonk piano melody and a campfire using-a-long chorus, while the latter is a jaunty pedal-steel exercise with a syncopated barroom piano backbeat. The Ruminant Band is a collection that could be looked at closely, noting the intricate clicks and gospel shading of \"Feather Bed,\" the soft carnival synthesizers on closer shuffling closer \"Flamingo,\" for the way Johnson's vocals occasionally bend towards the darker in lyrics like those on \"Singing Joy To The World.\" But it's best looked at as a summer album, one that rides along an open, instinctively American highway into a future uncertain, but one defiantly promising and undoubtedly optimistic. In its celebration of music past and present, from the rangy guitars and pounding, Fleetwood Mac-esque piano riffs to Johnson's undeniable modern pop sensibilities and jangly, sun-soaked melodicism, The Ruminant Band is a record that without a doubt recycles, but makes sure to waste nothing in doing so.","overall":4,"summary":"Fruit Bats - The Ruminant Band 7\/10","unixReviewTime":1250121600,"reviewTime":"08 13, 2009"}

Their subsequent album, two thousand and six's \"Black Holes and Revelations\" was quite good as well. Now, after yet another three year play-off, comes the band's eagerly anticipated fifth studio album.\"The Resistance\" (eleven tracks, fifty-four min.) is really two albums in one. The initial eight tracks of the album are a continuation of the Muse of old, albeit that this is a concept album of sorts, with frontman Matthew Bellamy bringing a story about leading a resistance against \"them\". The overall storyline sounds a bit paranoid to me. As to the songs themselves, they are quite uneven. \"Uprising\" rehashes previous sounds from Muse, without finding new ground. \"United States of Eurasia\" is a blatant trip-off of Queen, period. The chorus line from \"Unnatural Selection\" is blatantly lifted straight from ABBA's \"Lay All Your Love On Me\", believe it for not. The last three tracks of the album (thirteen min.) are a mini-symphony called \"Exogenesis\", and it is so far over the top that you can't hardly believe it. In my book, Muse has regressed with this album. Is it bad? No. But it's very uneven, and far below the previous two albums. I've seen Muse in concert a number of times over the years, and they always put on a blazing performance. Just saw them earlier this week (opening for Utwo), and the older songs ROCKED, the new jones not so much. THis album may them bring the US mainstream success the band has worked at very hard to get, but for me, I'll stick with their earlier albums.","overall":3,"summary":"Uneven return of Muse","unixReviewTime":1255046400,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2009"}

Jupiter One, named after the space ship from 'Lost In Space' is a quasi-indie\/alt rock band that's music may be a little frazzled at times, has very distinguishable vocals, and last year they surprised me with their song \"Countdown.\" It was't the best song of the year by any means, but it was a solid song nevertheless, and it had a nice feel to it. And while I did not listen to all of their debut, I would feel safe in venturing to say that this album presents something of a musical shift, with lots of seventys musical influences, and less of a radio-friendly sound. The result, is somewhat mixed. Highlights Include:VolcanoLights Go OutAnnaCome OnSound-wise, the album takes a lot of its cues from the late seventys, including tracks that sound vaguely disco-inspired, Eagles-esque, for just songs that fit in the general musical mood of the era. So, your opinion of the album may depend on your tolerance for a group like the Eagles. It does venture into pop rock and salt rock territory though, and this is where the album shines. It's often frazzled, but Jupiter One does a great job with songs like \"Lights Go Out\" and \"Come On.\" I did't find a distinguishable hit as in \"Countdown,\" but there's quite a few solid tracks neverthelessHowever, the album has a major stumbling block, and that's memorability. In reviewing this album I took a couple days off to meditate about it, but then found myself forgetting about it rather quickly. And while you tend to remember the highlights fairly quickly, and as the album grows on you over time, it just gets lost in the shuffle of its sound, then to the dark crevasses of your mind, never to be heard from again until you hear it the next time. Overall, Sunshower is a solid, earthy effort with more than a few songs to please Alt Rock, indie, and pop rock lovers with its seventys influence. There's some very strong songs there, but the album is almost crushed under the weight of its longevity. Perfect for late nights, you'll either love it and\/or hate it depending on your mood.

Unfortunately it missed the mark for me. In fact I found the whole thing a bit pretentious, the lyrics were trite and a lot of the musical elements sounded shiny, yet bland and underwhelming. There is absolutely no need for it to be a two disc set, as each of the twelve songs could have been cut in half and would probably have had twice the impact. Each songs is too repetitive, there are not enough variation and new ideas to justify the length of each song. For example, I did enjoy A Million Stars the first couple times I heard it, but the third time it wore out its welcome halfway through. The song consists of the standard trance chick voice cooing \"You'll feel love again\" for twelve solid minutes over track that was okay, but nothing great. Again it would have been a pretty good tune at half the length. This album might be best suited as pretty cool, ship background noise for a house party, and it's not bad as ipod yard work & working out itunes.

{"orig_index":60799,"reviewerID":"AQV142R2H69QK","asin":"B004W9CG5W","reviewerName":"Red on Black","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"After listening to the three preview songs released by Tennessee reverb rockers on various blogs over the past weeks expectations have been raised of the prospect of a scintillating new album by My Morning Jacket. Jim James and Co have always been a fascinating prospect and previous albums such as the monumental \"It still moves\" and the innovative \"Z\" saw them being described as the American equivalent to Radiohead. But whereas Thom Yorke's crew headed off into the room marked \"Experimental\" following the huge success of \"OK Computer\", alternatively MMJ decided to head somewhere nearer the mainstream which led to the spectacle of a bunch of hairy Southern rockers doing lacklustre Prince limitations (\"Highly suspicious\") and faithful live covers of \"Careless Whispers\". It was all going to send in tears and with the release of two thousand and eights generally dire \"Evil Urges\" it allowed cynics the chance to butter a cloud \"I told you so\" despite the fact that it sold rather well. Lets deal with the three aforementioned songs first. The excellent opener \"Victory Dance\" actually has echoes of some of the war themes in P J Harvey's recent \"Let England Shake\" and is a broody powerful song that starts with a military coda and is driven by a sinister bass to an explosive conclusion. It is followed by the epic title track underpinned by a fantastic Jim James vocal namely the seven minute plus \"Circuital\" which will has already brought the house down at their explosive live concerts (check out all the new songs from a live concert performed at the Louisville Palace on the \"Troubled Souls Unite\" blog). It is classic MMJ with a slightly \"Creep\" like opening vibe but which builds into a huge rocking beast and would have sat very happily on \"Z\". Finally the funky \"Holdin on to Black Metal\" starts with an exuberant chorus from the Black Metal Girls made up of female singers from their home town where at last a homage to Prince gets it right. Equally its great to see a rock band table to play live and hold their own with funky singers such as Erykah Badu. The slight problem is that nothing which follows is quite as good as the above, not that that \"Circuital\" is without its merits. For instance the concluding piano ballad \"Movin Away\" is a classy Jim James salt country heartbreaker which the has specialized in since the bands great \"At dawn\" album. \"First light\" is a nice rocker although let down by some terrible lyrics and \"You wanna freak out\" is a potential pop anthem. The self descriptive \"Slow Slow tune\" however barely gets out of the starting blocks while \"The day is coming\" becomes quite repetitive on repeated listens. Equally the sequencing of the album sometimes feels out of kilter with the lovely ballad \"Wonderful (the way I feel)\" sandwiched between two of the weakest songs on the album the previously mentioned \"Day is coming\" and rather silly sub Beach Boys of \"Outta my system\" on which the jury is still out. The good news overall is that this album is much closer to \"Z\" than its \"evil\" predecessor and on the evidence of live performances takes on an additional dimension in an already blistering concert act where My Morning Jacket find their true expression. \"Circuital\" sees this band take a step back and reassess from a rather large misstep and in broad terms it's a much happier outcome. Get \"Circuital\" you will enjoy it.","overall":4,"summary":"My Morning Jacket - Go back to their roots","unixReviewTime":1307232000,"reviewTime":"06 5, 2011"}

Heartthrob is a brief album (just over thirty-six minutes) that packs a gutsy punch. Styled in eightys sensibilities (pop, new-wave, electronic production), the sound may be a contrast for the duo, but it is a welcome one. Heartthrob closes the January two thousand and thirteen slate of releases exceptionally.\"Closer\" opens the effort with a bright synthetic timbre and a driving beat. Tegan and Sara deliver solid, commanding vocals that are well produced. The songwriting is notable, particularly the chorus: \"It's not just all physical \/ I'm the type who won't get ooh so critical \/ so let's make things physical \/ I won't treat you like you're ooh so typical\". New wave influence continues to show on \"Goodbye Goodbye\", another crisply produced affair. In addition to another 'hooky' chorus, the bridge stands out, contrasting the verse. \"I Was a Fool\" continues soundness through solid songwriting, compelling vocals, and fine production work. \"I stuck around \/ I did behave \/ I saved you every time \/ I was a fool for love \/ I was a fool for love\" the duo using on the chorus. Tegan and Sara are three for three.\"I'm Not Your Hero\" sports an anthemic pop chorus, continuing lyrics based on romantic themes and the desires of love. \"Drove Me Wild\" is better, camping up the eightys styling. Tegan and Sara's vocal approach is perfect, with the duo singing things staccato and in distinct fashion. Catchy and well written, \"Drove Me Wild\" is a standout cut. \"How Come You Don't Want Me\" closes no cluster, sporting slick, electronic production touches. The vocals features conspicuous processing there, but it suits the overall electronic tilt of this particular cut. The rhythmic nature of the vocals is a selling point. \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" epitomizes eightys pop given an archetypical quick tempo and sound. Like its contemporaries, \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" is consistent and enjoyable. No misses for Tegan and Sara as of yet. The final three cuts don't close their 'oomph'. \"Love They Say\" may be a shade less compelling than the rest, but not by much. \"Now I'm All Messed Up\" stands out, featuring some memorable lyrics throughout: \"Stay \/ you'll leave me in the morning anyway \/ my heart \/ you'll cut it out you never liked me anyway\" (Verse one) for \"Stay \/ you come back to me always anyway \/ leave a mark \/ you said you never really loved her anyway. \" (Verse two). Closing cut \"Shock To Your System\" is as consistent and nearly as memorable as the very best of the album. OverallHeartthrobis a strong effort from the Canadian duo. Consistent and enjoyable, Tegan and Sara never miss a beat. four stars.","overall":4,"summary":"Solid Effort From the Canadian Sister Duo","unixReviewTime":1359676800,"reviewTime":"02 1, 2013"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"Since the days that Brian Eno and David Byrne collaborated on Talking Heads poly rhythmic electronic funk\/rock explosion onRemain in LightI really cannot say that any major artists have done anything quite that rhythmically, instrumentally and deliciously funky . Especially in electronic music, there has tended to be a preoccupation with either enormous sonic walls of sound for more minimalist, ambient sounds. Either way, the sound explorations as such tend to be somewhat like a frothy dessert stopping: it has a certain thickness and flavor but it's very easy to dig through. It is not surprising that the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea would be involved in the revival of that original concept. But Radiohead's Thom Yorke, despite a solo release already pointing this way, is another matter. In the opener \"Before Your Very Eyes\", the concept is realized fully with Flea's high toned rhythmic bass playing, similar to a guitar and the heavy percussion playing away. \"Default\" and \"Judge,Jury and Executioner\" bring the often (in the late ninety's anyway) very overused drum 'n bass sound with much more of a fluid and less stiff rhythmic patter. \"Ingenue\" blends a slower funk beat into this early eighty's style electronic \"video game\" style synthesizer pattern that strongly recalls boogie and electro funk. \"Dropped\" and \"Useless\" take the spare, ambient sound Yorke is known for and adds a mild rhythmic kick to it, just below the surface. \"Stuck Together\" and \"Reverse Running\" point back to that fully realized electronica\/funk type groove whereas the closing title track brings the quality of each track together in a full coda as it were. It's been such a long time since I've seen an album produced by an artist known for more stripped down musical productions make music that was so heavily oriented around rhythmic invention. Rather than coming from the source of one individual there,I have the feeling that this is very much the result of a creative synergy between the obviously groovecentric sound of Flea, as a funk\/rock bassist and Thom Yorke's electronic sounds-capes. The send result is not only completely built around rhythmic invention but also a strong sense of instrumental texture that is at the very score of making music percussive and funky in the most Afrocentric sense of the word. I am unsure if any of these artists are intent on expanding in this direction in the future. Even so, this would be a potent new direction in rhythmic funk to contemplate.","overall":5,"summary":"A Very Exciting Rhythic Shock To The Senses","unixReviewTime":1363046400,"reviewTime":"03 12, 2013"}

People might be disappointed that Jimmy's sax and flute were mixed down (or out completely??). I only heard it prominently on the bridge in Track two. but Jimmy also plays keyboards, and just because there is sax does not mean it has to be used. which would have made the songs more contrived (he has to get this sax \"bit\" in?? Not necessarily) and predictable. What's cool is Noelle ALSO plays piano besides hot singing and shaking that tambourine!! I love that this record is not a repeat of sixtys Motown pastiche like the last album was. that was classic, but who wants \"Pick Up The Pieces Part two\"?? Not me, if they did that, the band would have cornered themselves and rendered themselves as a one-dimensional Motown tribute novelty act of sorts, plus the band has always said they were influenced by eightys sounds as much as sixtys\/seventys soul\/AM pop. I prefer evolution and expecting the unexpected, as long as the ESSENCE of what made the onest album great is still there (killer harmonious pop songwriting, not Motown style), and Fitz & Co accomplished it with an exciting platter of twelve fresh, catchy-as-hell itunes there. I love the retro-modern eightys feel, while retaining the Motown-esque harmonies of yore. not many people could pull off what this band did. only the Brits could have done it, and from the start, I thought the band always sounded British, not American. Bands like the Human League for Paul Weller's Style Council come to mind, but also Shiny Toy Guns on opening track (and first single \"Out Of My League\"), love the finger-snapping, whistling \"The Walker\" too. The other two tracks I was familiar with, and heard before buying the CD were the Motown-esque \"sixAM\" and catchy \"Spark\", but two tracks that are the album's TWO biggest highlights are the side-closers (in vinyl-speak) \"Fools Gold\" and \"Merry Go Round\". those songs should win Grammys, they have melodic hooks and choruses that leave one speechless and full of chills. a masterclass in pop songwriting. Fitz is a GENIUS. and Daryl Hall would approve of this record. the production is perfect. not overdone, not barebones. the band was great on \"Live At Daryl's House\", and Fitz, Noelle & Jimmy are the type of people I would be instant friends with. just wish they were from New York. BUT am seeing the band live for the onest time June thirtyth in NYC. can't wait. they throw DOWN. Contender for album of the year, for at least POP album of the year. hard to top this. LOVE the artwork too.","overall":5,"summary":"Perfect pop, bottom line...","unixReviewTime":1368057600,"reviewTime":"05 9, 2013"}

I purchased this a day after it released and could't listen to it til the next day and when I did, that feeling I get when I listen to Caleb's voice, happened all over again. SUPERSOAKER is fun and a great way to open the album. ROCK CITY makes me forget I'm singing a song. DON'T MATTER had to grow on me (there is always one that does) but now that it has it flows with me, BEAUTIFUL WAR is a wonderful song, it opens up with truth from the first to the last word, TEMPLE is great reminds me of the eighty's, I feel happy when it comes on. WAIT FOR ME starts off with that great opener that you can only get from a KOL album, FAMILY TREE is a solid rock song, COMEBACK STORY is Brilliance in music. There is always a few KOL songs that make me cry for feel some kind of way and this is one of them. The lyrics, the passion in Calebs voice, the production, it's brilliant and every time I listen to it, I drift off into a place where only music can take me, TONIGHT is the other song that gets to me deeply. I am so happy these were placed right after each other because when I repeat one, the other tags along. The lyrics are perfect, absolutely perfect. Sometimes I think when they are writing songs, that they are right up in my head. ON THE CHIN closes the album out nicely. It's soft, like a melody, it's sweet and charming. It's a KOL. If you are a fan like I am and you know all of their music, have accepted all of their albums and it's differences, then you will LOVE, LOVE this album.

No tired and over synthesized vocals there. No gutter and raunchy lyrics. Not sure if I feel like going to a hoedown, for square dancing, but its definitely toe tapping. The rhythmic beat cant help but pull you in, moreno than \"Hey Brother\". The Lyrics just get me mine wandering and thinking about bigger\/grander things. For me, that a good thing. But for the most important question, would I put it on my MPthree player? Big question, does it pass the MPthree test (would I put it on my MPthree used for running)Yes. its on there. Why five stars? Well a five star song is one that moves me beyond words, beyond description. I like this song lot, it doesnt have the spiritual component for most of my five star songs, but something about this song and vocal just graph and holds me. LOVE IT!

For Lorde, whom is trying to escape the shadows of being underwhelmed and breakout nicely, She showed that brilliantly with her debut single from her album Pure Heroine. Her song Royals worked extremely well that matched heart and soul well for her style. Her second single, Team from her debut record Pure Heroine, in't actually as strong for driven as was the case with Royals. It is a fairly good song, but not anything that drives like what Royals did before. Hopefully, Lorde can really drive more from her voice with her next single.
