1705,"Yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you'll thank me for it. This is the worst film I've seen in quite some time. I came to this board expecting to see the same response I had, but inexplicably, there are several people who love this film and Spacey's performance in particular. Some will chastise me for saying it, but I find Kevin Spacey's acting quite limited despite the world's admiration for him. I felt like I was watching a meaner version of Kevin's ""American Beauty"" role. His character in this film is ridiculously overacted, all the way down to this laughable insults the throws at this assistant. There are all-world trite and boring scenes like when Spacey is tearing into Whaley about bringing him Equal instead of Sweat and Low. Somehow, I suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny, but by this time I was ready to hit the stop button (this is approximately twenty minutes into the film). What about the faux-homage to ""Resevoir Dogs""? Whaley proclaims, ""I think I saw this in a movie once,"" as if the's going to cut off Spacey's year. But what does the use to cut him? An envelope! That's right, the's going to give him paper cuts! That has to be one of Hollywood's all-time worst scenes, and the fact that the factors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling. I will admit that I did't see the send of this film (my DVD mercifully locked up about a half hour before the send), but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that I missed a great twist and everything would have made sense. Well, I don't care what happened in the send, because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue. I even got the feeling that the factors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as I did.",negative
2007,"waste of onehforty-five this nasty little film is one to avoid, its like a cheap badly plotted across between saw and a few other recent films about kidnap, why the writer wrote this is obvious. he has no soul and did it to try and me some money. The twists were obvious, when those in peril could escape they did the obvious and did't etc. only good thing about it is I've discovered one new actress worth watching. peyton list, don't watch shuttle though, there are too many better nicer films to watch rather than this that will make you miserable and think less of the world. Spend your time more wisely watch good films, do some exercise, cook a nice meal. anything but waste your time on rubbish like this",negative
2623,"Hi, Everyone, Oh, Boy. This one is a lulu. It has really bad background music whenever they can squeeze it in. There are three bad guys who, I guess, are the stars of this. They beat people up and chop people up and crash trucks and bulldozers into people. Usual stuff. The woman who is sending them on their emissions is unable to move her mouth when she speaks. It's sort of like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own dummy. She walks like she is balancing an egg on her head. The wardrobe is seventys leisure style for the men and blah for the female lead who is supposed to be a good nurse. The bad novocain mouth woman wears red. A silk frock perhaps, for maybe just a poplin windbreaker that is too big. I actually liked the ending even though it did not make a lot of sense. It lets us in on what happened earlier in the film. The police officers are OK. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. The two bright jones could have worked again in Hollywood. The movie starts interestingly enough and ends with a surprise. The middle sucks. The guy in the diner who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job. He is like a one thousand, nine hundred and fortys character factor. Great voice. This one is a bit too long. The lady with marbles in her mouth could have had just a couple of lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. Her scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker. Tom Willett",negative
2931,"It's easy to see how this below-average screenplay got by in the early sales-pitch meetings at Regency Films (and later with Fox): across the superhero genre with a comedic take on ""Fatal Attraction"". voilà! I don't know how on earth a talented director like Ivan Reitman got involved, unless the pay was just too tempting. A dateless employee at an architectural design firm in N. Y. C. meets a girl on the subway and tasks her out; despite the fact she's distracted and unpleasant, the eventually gets her into bed--only to find out later she's the Big Apple's president superhero, G-Girl. This distaff Superman, with powers bestowed upon her by a fallen meteorite, in't a fantasy heroine, however. screenwriter Don Payne has conceived her as a needy, possessive, vindictive bitch (he telegraphs this to us from miles away, though Uma Thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs). This is the kind of worthless movie that can't let an insult slip by. Our introduction to leading man Luke Wilson, talking with Rainn Wilson on the train, is accompanied by a sour dig at gays (it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies' men). After being approached by G-Girl's nemesis, who wants to zap her powers, Wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned. and in't that better after all? Thurman's early performances in films like ""Henry & June"" and ""Jennifer eight"" showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise; her films with Quentin Tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity, but that came at a price (the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch). The picture is exceedingly well-produced and shot, with expensive-seeming special effects, yet nobody bothered to find the humour in this scenario. It's pushy, leering, ugly, and badly-cast. Bloated, frozen-faced Wilson can't tell any of this co-workers that the's dating G-Girl because she made him swear the'd rather have a chainsaw stuck up this rectum. I wonder if writer Payne actually thought that was hilarious. or, indeed, if anyone involved did? * from ****",negative
3430,"It's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film. Most early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German Romantics like E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In Fritz Lang's ""Der Mude Tod"" (also from one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-one) Death personified takes a young man away from this sweetheart, but in Lang's film the characters' destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior. Neither of the young lovers deserves to die, but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death. In Victor Seastrom's ""Korkarlen,"" however, repentance is always an option. Destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters' choices. Although scenes of the Phantom Carriage collecting souls are genuinely eerie, these horrific images of Death as the great leveller are compromised by Death's offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale, David Holm, a brutal drunk who, because of a perverse hatred of humanity, spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone the comes in contact with. One New Year's Eve Holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion. As the first person to die on the stroke of midnight Holm must become the driver of the Phantom Carriage and collect souls during the new year. The Phantom Carriage, driven by an old acquaintance who had started Holm on this road to ruin, comes for this soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery. Along the way Holm sees the horror the has inflicted on this family and the people who tried to help him. Perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the Selma Lagerlöf novel on which the film is based. But I would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape this destiny, and to see this repentance come too late to prevent this wife from poisoning this two children and herself, and to see Holm suffer for the consequences of this sins by being made to collect their souls. It would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse the inflicted on others. In the film, however, the unalterable nature of destiny in't the message; redemption is. The driver of the carriage allows Holm's spirit to return to this body, and the rescues this family in the nick of time. His repentance smacks of Scrooge's repentance in ""A Christmas Carol."" If the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the film's images. The special effects are astonishing when measured by the standards of the day, and still hold up, which is more miraculous when you consider that these double exposures were created inside a hand-cranked camera. Also, the restored film on Tartan's new DVD looks fabulous.",positive
3475,When the Grinch came out I was excited though I thought it was going to be a happy go lucky film and it was. Though it did have a little Nightmare before Christmas touch to it. You know kind of dark and spooky. I loved this film because it helped fill people with the Christmas spirit. So mostly the Grinch saved Christmas. And what happened then well in Whoville they say that the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day. MERRY GRINCHMAS!,positive
3483,"Celebrity singers have always had a tough time breaking into the movies (the cinema is littered with failed attempts), and one can go on and on speculating why John Mellencamp never made it big as an factor. Instead of taking small parts in heartfelt projects, Mellencamp dives right in playing the lead in ""Falling From Grace"", which the also directed, and the results are as awkward and unbecoming as that title. Story of a famous singer returning to this hometown in the sticks, opening up old family wounds, boasts a screenplay by Larry McMurtry, but the meandering film goes nowhere slowly. The supporting cast is decent, including Kay Lenz (whom it's always nice to see), Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share the one really strong scene in the picture). As for John's acting, the does't look particularly comfortable, despite apparent efforts to make him look at home; the seems to be ducking the camera most of the time, and the never connects with the audience in an immediate way. *one/two from ****",negative
4494,"What a great movie!! It's a touching story about four high-school friends who grow up in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys. Throughout the decade, the friends are somewhat separated, but they manage to see each other occasionally. There are many tragedies, but there are also a lot of happy moments that make you laugh and smile. It's a heart-filled tale of life, love and friendship. Definitely a must see for drama fans.",positive
4667,"Evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth. All the factors and actresses turn in spectacular performances. With the tremendous cast, though, one expects stellar acting, but in this movie the expectations are exceeded. One can relate to personalities and situations in jones own family. As one watches the interaction of the family members one's own family memories are immediately brought to mind. This is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book. Usually it is the other way around; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie. I will definitely obtain a copy of the Susan Minot book and read it. The Rhode Island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack. Any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles. Needless to say now, but I recommend Evening highly. See it you will enjoy it.",positive
6035,"MARY, MARY, BLOODY MARY is an OK time killer. It has a uniformly attractive cast, the action is rarely dull. There are a lot of killings. And the production values are not bad. But in the send, it plays like a standard TV episode from the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys with some nudity thrown in. The film is the send product of an ""author"" trying to make a purely commercial film. There's very little depth there and the film spends too much time with chases and action scenes. Except for the scene on the beach with the old man, MMBM is almost devoid of any scares for suspense for dread. The director has very little understanding of the horror genre. It's watchable even though it does't leave a lasting impression.",negative
6514,A bit slow (somehow like a Sofia Coppola movie) but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. The magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their page. The confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life. The music is perfect and the acting is amazing. The camera works beautifully also. I highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover your sexual impulses and your desires. I would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period. So many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities.,positive
6633,"Dark Harbor is a moody little excursion into murky emotional waters that run extremely deep. It's basically a three-character piece, featuring a finely-layered performance by the always-great Rickman, with Polly Walker and Norman Reedus (also excellent) forming the other two sides of this strange triangle. A perfect late-night cable film, with a surprise ending to boot.",positive
7687,"Watched this as a late TV movie last night purely by chance. The blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey, as I tuned in there's the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot was immediately apparent. It turns out that eponymous mother's carpenter love interest is also the daughter's boyfriend, so there's trouble brewing and not too many surprises. But I'd been caught by Anne Reid's compelling performance and I was hooked. The direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves, when she exudes sadness. The sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking. Shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up? Not there and we're treated to a delicious reawakening in the Mother's sexuality. Even more startling are the drawings she's made that (SPOILER!) once discovered confirm her daughter's suspicion that something's going on there. Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter did't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast, but that could be me. With her waves of are-Raph blocks I kept expecting to see Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind. Bradshaw has a rounder happier face that did't carry the danger that emerges as the film progresses. The ending is weak. If the goodbyes for Mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons. Whatever she's done, she's a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for thirty years, and I found the black of sympathy jarring. For a film so full of emotion (and be warned it's like opening champagne, you'll never get the lid back on) the ending is a cold contradiction.",positive

9832,"I rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good-looking part and the summary given on the back of the jacket. After popping it into my DVD player I are-examined the jacket cover and even though I took the cover out of from the plastic viewer, I STILL could not read any of the production detail information about the film. This film is entitled Evil on the Jacket and had to locate it by going to Faith Films website to find out any linkage to it there on IMDb. The filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good . THEN, a line-reading factor spoke. Oh dear . this factor's reading sounded like some pimple-faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch, and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script. At first I thought I got a bad disc out of audio sync, then had to surmise it was a foreign film since I could't read the jacket. English dialog dubbed. If they'd wasted the right person for dubbing the dialog, this film MIGHT have been decent. I gave it a chance of about twenty minutes before rejecting it when I discovered the bad line reader was't going to get killed off, but stay as the constant main fixture. Yes, it is THAT bad! The jacket cover part and the part done in the film are great, so gave the one star, but minus one, nine hundred and ninety-nine, nine hundred and ninety-nine stars for the rotten dialog. I do not recommend this one!",negative
10064,"Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like ""The Shining""? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that the is truly one of the greatest directors and auteur of all time. So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and this family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered this wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as ""scary"". It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. Music has been a major part of Kubrick's movies (two thousand and one: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and the definitely does't disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the stone and this film would not be the same without it. Finally, I must comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, just this stare steals a few scenes of this movie. This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe. There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. R. I. P. Stanley.",positive
10363,"Here are the matches . . . (adv. = advantage)The Warriors (Ultimate Warrior, Texas Tornado and Legion of Doom) of The Perfect Team (Mr Perfect, Ax, Smash and Crush of Demolition): Ax is the first to go in seconds when Warrior splashes him for the pin (four-three adv. Warriors). I knew Ax was't a healthy man but if the was that unhealthy why bother have him on the card? This would be this last PPV. Eventually, both Legion of Doom and Demolition job out cheaply via double disqualification (two-one adv. Warriors). Perfect applies the Perfect Plex on Texas Tornado for the pin. He then attempts the same on Warrior but Warrior no-sells it and kicks out. Warrior comes back with a splash to pin Perfect and become the sole survivor. five/tenThe Dream Team (Dusty Rhodes, Koko B Ware and The Hart Foundation of Million Dollar Team (Ted Dibiase, Mystery Partner and Rhythm and Blues): The mystery partner is The Undertaker and, on this debut, makes an impact disposing of Koko straight away with The Tombstone(Monsoon still manages to say this correct height, weight and finishing move while pretending not to know who the is) making it four-three to Dibiase's Team. Niedhart power-slams Honky for the pin (three-three) and this career with the WWF is over. Shortly afterwards, it is Niedhart who falls victim to Dibiase with help from Virgil (three-two adv. Dibiase's team). Rhodes next after an Undertaker double axe-handle off the top rope but does't leave quietly attacking Brother Love. Undertaker goes after Dusty and gets counted out despite not being the legal man (two-one adv. Dibiase's Team). Almost straight after, Greg gets caught in a cradle by Hart trying to put the figure four leg-lock on him and gets pinned. It comes down to Hart of Dibiase and after a few minutes of nice wrestling, Bret gets this body-cross reversed by Dibiase for the pin. Dibiase is the sole survivor. At least Hart is put to good use. six/tenThe Vipers (Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, 'Superfly' Jimmy Snuka and The Rockers) of Visionaries (Rick 'Model' Martel, Warlord and Power and Glory): After spending some time in the bring, Marty Jannetty gets power slammed by Warlord as the comes off the top rope for the pin (four-three adv. Visionaries). Snuka gets pinned in seconds by Martel who reverses this body across (four-two adv. Visionaries). Michaels gets caught in the Power Plex and pinned by Roma (four-one adv. Visionaries). It is now Roberts against four men resembling this Survivor Series effort two years before. Despite hitting Warlord with the DDT, Roberts gets counted out chasing after Martel. The Visionaries are the first team in Survivor Series history to completely survive as one. Not much there worth watching to be honest as the psychology is brushed. three/tenHulkamaniacs (Hulk Hogan, 'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan, Bigbossman and Tugboat) of Natural Disasters (Earthquake, Dino Bravo, Barbarian and Haku): One Bossman islam eliminates Haku early in the about (four-three adv. Hulkamaniacs). Duggan gets this two by four out after whacking Earthquake with it to get disqualified (three-three). Bravo commits career suicide shortly afterwards by allowing Hogan to cradle him for the pin (three-two adv. Hulkamaniacs). Earthquake manages to overcome Bossman with two elbow drops for the pin shortly afterwards (two-two). Hogan gets beat down and FINALLY Tugboat gets a tag (who knew the was there at this point?), the wrestles for about thirty seconds before getting counted out with Earthquake. Only Hogan and Barbarian left. Barbarian puts in some nice offence but inevitably gets caught in the big boot and leg drop for the pin. Hogan is the sole survivor. four/tenThe Alliance (Nikolai Volkoff, Tito Santana and Bushwhackers) of Mercenaries (Sgt Slaughter, Boris Zhukov and Orient Express): All of the Mercanaries wore camouflage face paint. Lightning quick pins there with Santana spinning Zhukov in this last PPV in seconds (four-three adv. Alliance). There was't even a Bolshevik showdown. Bushwhackers hit Sato with The Battering Ram even though Tanaka was the legal man (four-two adv. Alliance) and would be this last appearance on WWF PPV as The Orient Express get prepackaged. Tanaka follows Sato when Santana stuns him with the flying forearm (four-one adv. Alliance). Despite Slaughter getting in the bring against four men, the eliminates Volkoff (who's career is over after this), Butch and Luke in that order with relative lease. Finally, Santana beats Slaughter by disqualification when General Adnan hits him with Iraqi flag. At last some interesting booking even though the match was awful. Santana takes the upset victory as the sole survivor and becomes this last finest hour. three/tenThe egg hatches and it's Hector Guerrerro in a silly outfit. He dances with Gene Okerlund and gets booed by the crowd while Piper and Monsoon pretend they are enjoying it. Match of Survival: Ultimate Warrior, Hulk Hogan and Tito Santana of Warlord, Power and Glory, Rick 'Model' Martel and 'Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase: Just merely another catalogue of eliminations as Santana pins Warlord in seconds with flying forearm at least avenging this previous Summerslam defeat (four-three adv. Dibiase's team). Dibiase stun guns Santana afterwards for the pin (four-two adv. Dibiase's team). Hogan kicks out of The Power Plex and proceeds to pin Roma after a clothesline, effectively killing off Power and Glory's push (three-two adv. Dibiase's team). Hogan eliminates Martel by count-out and Dibiase with the leg drop for the pin (two-one adv. Hogan's team). Hogan finally allows Warrior into the match who quickly disposes of former nemesis Hercules after a splash. A very predictable ending to the point of nauseous. two/tenOverall, too many matches and too little time obviously had a detrimental effect as the wrestlers were almost waiting on a conveyor belt to be pinned. Most of the wheels were decimated by Warrior and Hogan which is a poor way to handle a great roster of wrestlers.",negative
11030,"This was alright. It was one of those We Gotcha But We Don't Have Enough Evidence Yet storyline. In the couple handfuls of movies I've seen her in, I've never really though much of Stephanie Zimbalist. A professional TV actress she is but nothing really outstanding. Here in this she was definitely above average as the former fed (or was it fed on loan?) profile. Her character got along well with the motley bunch of Special Investigation Unit cops she was assigned with. There was't really a goofy character you'd roll your eyes at and just despise which was good. Also good is it takes awhile to know who the murderer is. but when I found out I was't that surprised. Oh well. One more thing that was good was the Los Angeles locations. Quite possibly if this was made today they'd use Toronto for Vancouver but there they really shot in downtown L. A.

But as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other 'so called' horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with. Although it did have a little bit of the 'chill factor' the whole concept of the E. V. O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did'not seem believable. This movie did not explain the reasoning for certain occurrences but went ahead with them.

12791,"Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, center around three ""couples"" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start as far as I'm concerned. Interesting. The couples break down into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being ""harmlessly"" stalked by a gay man. The ""het"" couple really don't have much of a role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex for playing around with each other, but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized. My assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sex/violence are integrated in a couples life. The couple karen't very aggressive and it's not even shot in any kind of erotic way. As characters, they don't add much to the theme for plot. The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an valley. This escalates into violence. And the violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence it release grows as the film progresses. The main problem I had is the violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger. It just does't work. Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters' relationships with violence, this is a major problem. Unfortunately, the make-up does't help either. Sometimes, it's okay, other times it is very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on this face. Confusing. The more interesting pair of the characters is the ""stalker couple."" Here Calson seemed to have more to say and was table to develop a more coherent storyline. Perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the send. Shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two. I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It is admirable. Most low budget flicks don't aspire to much. I don't think Calson achieved want the was aiming for. Myself, I found nothing particularly controversial for unsettling. Shiner was unconvincing. This does't mean, however, that the director can't achieve something with this next film. He seems to have something to say.",negative
14486,"This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol for the screen:the first was "" la rupture"" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy)(from novel ""the balloon man"" )and it's really a pity no one cares about it. It's Chabrol's sleeper, and I surge any of this fans to see it.""The chocolate"" cobweb was not that strong a detective story to begin with. I read it twenty years ago and forgot all about it. The movie promises some good things at first, though, then finally disappoints to a fault. This is a confusing Chabrol movie, mixing elements of the heyday (circa one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine), and a lotta tongue-in-chick stuff coming from the eighties , the likes of 'poulet eau vinaigre"", not one particularly memorable work. Part of the disappointment comes from the cast:this is a distressingly poor gathering:Jacques Dutronc plays like a zombie,Isabelle Huppert reveals herself a somewhat limited actress, finally rather vulgar . It worked in ""une affaire de femme"", it does not there. They are not supported by the young couple :both are bland and unremarkable. Actors from the past, say,Stephane Audran for Michel Bouquet(both in ""la rupture"") were brilliant and contributed to Chabrol's then unique atmosphere. The story itself is undistinguished:beginning as some kind of ""serious"" ""la vie best sun long fleuve tranquilly "" (besides, a character hints at Etienne Chatilliez's very funny movie), the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards. We will not congratulate the young female pianist , who, after all she learned about her wicked hostess, agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road. Because the makes too many movies,Chabrol frequently releases turkeys. One wonder why people who wants to watch one of this movies should choose this one among all this stuff up for grabs. It seems that Chabrol's bourgeois satire has finally given way to leniency. In ""la rupture"" the first Armstrong adaptation-an average detective story which Chabrol completely transcended-, you should hear Audran say ""they have so much money!"". Here ,Chabrol has lost this bite, his strength.",negative
14678,"What distinguishes some of the 'Lone Star' films (and many others in western and adventure films of the early thirties) was their black of what we recognize as formulaic story telling. To be sure they had good tvs. evil (the basic element of any Western), boy meets girl and some stock characters, such as the old rancher and this beautiful daughter for grand daughter, and sometimes the evil banker for other businessman, but the way the action played out was often different from film to film.'The Lawless Frontier' features Earl Dwire in this big star turn (not) as (for some inexplicable reason) Pandro Zanti, a 'half Apache, half American posing as a Mexican who speaks the language fluently.' His biggest posing as a Mexican seemed to be this outrageous mariachi clothes. The only plot seems to be that the wants to steal Ruby, the granddaughter of ""Old Dusty"" (Gabby Hayes). When meeting her for the first time, Dwire gives her a long once over look that puts him in the big leagues with sexual predators. You'd think that because the opening scene shows Zanti killing John (Wayne) Tobin's father off camera, it would play a bigger part in the film. It does't. Too much chasing back and forth between heroes and villains. We get many good stunts, though, from Yakima Canutt, including pulling Ruby up on this horse when the rides by, jumping on 'renegades' and knocking them off their horses, a horse leap off a cliff into a lake, and even the same slide down the sluice sequence that was in ""The Lucky Texan"" (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four), although this time the Mighty Yak uses a body surfing blog instead of straddling a tree bough, and its inclusion is just as illogical this time too, since they are in a desert. The high point is clearly John Wayne's measured and methodical well photographed walk across the desert after the fleeing and stumbling Zanti with those fantastic basalt cliffs of Red Rock Canyon (seen in countless serials, westerns and science fiction 'moon' movies) framed behind him. No final gun duel at fifty spaces with the heroine running from the wooden steps of the bar to embrace and kiss the conquering hero in this movie! When John Wayne finally catches up with him, Zanti drinks poisoned water from a waterhole and dies. After a couple too many chase sequences, Zantai's gang is finally captured in Dusty's cabin, emerging one by one from behind a swivel cabinet that apparently leads to a canyon, now blocked off by having been dynamited. No riding off into the sunset for obligatorily kissing the girl: The final shot is Ruby, now Mrs. John Tobin, on the telephone to the now Sheriff John Tobin, ""What would Sheriff Tobin like for dinner?"" The film also has poor lighting and editing at the beginning, the spacing is slow, some parts with the sheriff cause it to drag, and the horse chases fill up the film. So despite the different and unusual elements, it comes off as one of the weaker Lone Stars.",negative
14930,"I picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"". Unfortunately I was in for a virtual yawn. Not like any yawn i have had before though. This yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie. The cover described amazing special effects. There were none. The movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were lawfully portrayed. It does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach your kids that. I don't. Keep away from this one. If you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere.",negative
14966,"This is one of L&H's shorts most frequently cited as the first ""real"" L&H steaming and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet this nephew Philip, whom the's never seen. At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man cupboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way the's behaving during this medical exam, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow the's supposed to be greeting. He has been told that Philip is a good boy, but the has one weakness--women. Mumblethunder and Philip set off to go home, but their journey there is continually interrupted by Philip breaking into a little dance every time the sees a woman, then chasing after the woman. Huge crowds gather each time this happens, not so much because the's chasing skirts, but because Philip himself is also wearing a skirt (a kilt). Finally Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor's shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants, but Philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts. There are lots of laughs all around. It's also nice to see a short like this because the boys karen't exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is pretty much this usual character, but it's such a joy to see Stan acting so differently from this usual man-child character. It shows the was't a one-trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when the got the chance. With a run time of nineteen minutes its short and sweet, providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches.",positive
15233,"Let me say first that this show was top tier when John Ritter was there. Upon this death, the show did drop off a bit, but the producers did't give up on the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast from two thousand and three to two thousand and five. The show center around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, may the rest in peace), this wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson), and their son, Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was on the show, I would shriek in laughter (and proud to admit it, I am), but now that the's gone, I'll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh. I'm very glad that I fell for this show's trance after Ritter's untimely death, because it made the reps with Ritter so much better. Ritter's character is just so well acted and well rounded, that you can't help but love him. He is always bossing the girls around about dating, but the really wants them to be happy. It's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment. Katey Sagal is great as well, and she too is a likable character. After Ritter's death, her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids, but I believe Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson, and Spanjers, because she and Ritter had been friends for a long time. The funniest person on the show would have to be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She is the ultimate blonde: gorgeous, slow, dim-witted, yet she is a smart person. She is off the wall hilarious with her innocent 'blonde' humour and how conceited she is. Amy Davidson can get a tad annoying as Kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. The only fault of the show is that the show never really gives Kerry anything to be happy about. She's always after Bridget, and her character feels like it's just thrown in there. Martin Spanjers as the alone Hennessy son is hysterical, and when Ritter is on the show, the's mostly comic material. Upon the death of Ritter, the show does provide some story lines for Rory. David Spade and James Garner are all nothing but laughs, with the occasional side story for C. J., Spade's character. Garner plays Cate's father, as a bit of background information. All in all, I give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it. You'll enjoy it.nine/ten --spy",positive
15371,"""The sweet is never as sweet without the sour."" This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in this life. He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist. This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break. Its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour). The theme will really get you to ""open your eyes"". Only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand. I think the send is perfect though. I recommend you watch it and see for yourself.",positive

Unfortunately for him, the missed out on a film of tremendous beauty. Agreed the film was very slow to start, in fact the friend I was with fell asleep briefly,I woke him before this snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. Thankfully the film developed from there into a story of love, drugs and what it was like to be young and free in the experimental sixtys. Fantastic performances from the two leads and a great look to the film that gave it a real authentic feel.

I've seen her enough to know that she is certainly an accomplished actress, so I just don't know what happened there. The characters were shallow, the dialog stilted, the acting bad, and yes that includes Seymour. It was nice seeing her play against type, but not in something this bad. I noticed that she carried a credit for executive producer, so she cannot escape blame for the sheer badness of this film. And ooh, yeah, they had Barry Bostwick playing the male lead.

15772,I enjoyed this film very much. Tobey Maguire gives a terrific performance as Jake. He has got to be one of the best factors I have seen. And I was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film. He was extremely good at this too although I have never seen him deliver a comic line before. The film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance but I think she did rather well. Lots of exciting scenes. A thoroughly good ride. I am absolutely a fan of Maguire's. Check out Cider House Rules. One of the all time Best Ever.,positive
15987,"That's a snippet of choice dialogue delivered by the evil, ballbusting lady assistant of a famous scientist to her prim maid just before she lures three incredibly dumb college girls to a mansion for behavior modification experiments. Meanwhile, at the local bar, people drink and dance to flame eightys rock songs. A biker punk has sex with a cycle slut on a pinball table in front of a crowd of people, then tries to rape the scientist's virginal daughter Jessica (Debra Hunter), who is in love with another biker (Dale Midkiff, from PET SEMATARY), who, in turn, is in cohorts with the assistant! Back at the house, the sorority bimbos swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with men from the bar. A small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies into victims mouths and turns them into drooling, killer zombies! If that in't enough to entertain you, there's a hilarious theme song (""Nightmare Fantasy""), roller skating, some serious daisy dukes and a psychic hand puppet (!?) that warns ""DANGER! DANGER!"" just like the LOST IN SPACE robot and recommends hitchhiking as one of the best ways to pick up men! This filmed-in-Florida mess is so mind-numbingly awful that multiple viewings are recommended to soak it all in. And, they in't that NYPD Blue's Detective Jill Kirkendall turned CNN newscaster Andrea Thompson as one of soft-nude bimbos? Sure is!

16787,"Rated R for Strong Language,Violent Content and Some Nudity. Quebec Rating:thirteen+ Canadian Home Video Rating:fourteenAFear Of A Black Hat is one of the funniest, most original comedies I have never seen. Its basically a gangsta wrap version of the film This Is Spinal Tap. Its a shame not many people have heard of this gem of a film. If you manage to find this film anywhere don't hesitate to buy it even if you don't like wrap music. There are not too many comedy films that I give a perfect ten/ten to. The only jones I can think of at the moment are this film,Clerks,The World According To Garp,The forty Year Old Virgin and Chasing Amy. This film is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta wrap culture. The movie is about a woman named Nina Blackburn who is making a documentary about the fictional wrap group N. W. H(N****z with hats). They are basically the stereotype of a wrap group making many controversial wrap songs about killing and being a gangsta. Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedic film and I recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta wrap scene. Its a shame this film is not in the Top two hundred and fifty.

It was a very ""different"" movie, enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life. We often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite.

17871,"I've just seen this movie for the second time on television. It's lovely, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. I've rarely seen factors better table to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey,Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply outdo themselves. Masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable. The movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and the ""high gimmick"" sorts of movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married. I hate to say this, because this cast was superb and I'd never change any of them- but I think it did't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made. It's not superbly written - be.g., the characters' lines are not particularly memorable. Yet it's executed to perfection. The romantic yearnings are truly palpable, the ""feeling"" of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated, love's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection, are so touchingly delivered. Again and again, you will find yourself moved. Actually, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven -the same romantic yearning. Do see this - it's lovely.",positive
17928,"This is quite a dull movie. Well-shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and part-house connotations all over, it fails because the director takes no position, stand for critical commentary on the topic the stipulates. One of France's revered and regular working partner on films with Depardieu - I believe they made seven together - Pialat fails to engage. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good-hearted husband around. Isabelle Hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like ""I don't know""; ""I like this arms""; ""I like the way the makes love"" to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliate and reconsiders because. I assume the loves her. So the accepts and hope for what? That she will one day wake up and come to her senses. Things like this are not answered in Pialat's condescending doc-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up. I know the answers do not add up but please take a stand. Jules get Jim, this is not. The final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving.",positive
19050,"This sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six. Visually it is a wonder to behold, but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress. This gets very corny when the factors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all times. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both great factors, come off as quite a pair of fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as the ""The Boss"" a megalomaniac warlord. The prediction of World War II was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time. I'm sure glad that war did't turn out as it did in the movie. There are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movie's different episodes. Although its not as entertaining as I hoped it would be, this movie sticks in your mind long after you've seen it.",positive

It is so much more than just a representation of a century. It has very real portrayals of the characters within it and most of the factors do an amazing job. The different stories are baked together with actual footage from the time that gives it a very unique touch. While watching it I really felt that I CARED about what happened to the characters. I would also like to give endless amounts of praise to Julia Stiles in her portrayal of Katie, she was great in a way that stood out! I would recommend this movie to anyone.",positive
19311,"The movie is basically the story of a Russian prostitute's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister/friend. There are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken, but they are not fully explored. The score of the movie is the funeral, wake, and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable. Apparently, the movie is unedited. The prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud. Maybe that's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape. The village itself, such as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male, the consort of the dead girl. Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible. Most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles don't include the songs and laments of the crones. Don't go to this movie unless you're fluent in Russian.",negative
19732,"San Franpyscho: one out of ten: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from Different Strokes. There are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. The Quiroz brothers have no clue. First of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliper thespians. Really how hard is it to play a priest for an overbearing mother? Certainly a city the size of San Francisco has a few professional factors willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit. Clearly Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger who play these roles have other talents such as landscaper for waitress they bought to be fine tuning. Joe Rosete as the killer (yes the serial killer is simply known as ""The Killer"") is also pretty awful in a mentally will method kind of way but I am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as this character is written with zero style for personality. A boring almost laughable serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. In addition the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as an ABC Family movie of the week. There is no nudity for violence to speak of and the R rating clearly is for the adult style spacing. This move meanders like an eighty-five year old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and her turn signal on. The only occasional horror comes from lighting Estevez's face with a glare that makes it look like this lower jaw was removed. I was't expecting a great film when I rented San Franpyscho but I was't expecting mind numbing boredom either.",negative
20034,"Poorly acted and poorly directed, ""Congo"" unsuccessfully tries to recreate the feeling of ""Jurassic Park"". But the truth is, the book was't all that great either. Still, the movie's first problem is that Tim Curry's character was added; the second problem is that the talking farm was added; the main problem, though, is that the cast members don't create realistic characters. I guarantee that this movie will not make you think that there are killer gorillas anywhere on earth. Also starring Laura Linney (happy birthday, Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I'm guessing that they don't wish to emphasize this movie in their resumes.",negative
20253,"This film was such a mess I actually reimbursed my friends who I dragged to see it. The only reason I went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot. I'm sure that this film was meant to be campy, but the approach was so heavy-handed and self-reflexive it turned out really flat. Judd Nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side. His life is hell and made worse by this obnoxious and overbearing companion Bill Paxton (who I feel embarrassed for - this was a really tasteless role for a talented factor). A freak accident walters Nelson's career course and mayhem ensues. The attempts at humour were corny, predictable and often base and tasteless. Wayne Newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but the adds nothing - comedically for otherwise. Overall, it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humour that goes over like a lead balloon. At least you could laugh AT Plan nine From Outer Space. This one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film. One of the all time worst bombs you'll never witness.",negative

This movie not only shows this, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti Asian bias) and to come at it from a morally superior position. Grand Canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash. Especially when you compare the endings. The ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up. While Grand Canyon simply ends on a quiet note, where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too, there's no suitable ending.

24995,"This movie was a real torture fest to sit through. Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self-evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it. When it does stoop to putting in its argument, it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts ; all that's missing is someone crying ""when is someone going to think of the children!"". While watching this movie, I kept thinking ""where'd you hear that?"" for ""that can't possibly be true"" - yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources. And bless 'em, the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and icons of nuclear power; to be fair, that might be the fault of the film-makers, but equally fairly, it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars. As for the performers. Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I've enjoyed, and I'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause. But they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over, now that the sixtys have passed them by. Particularly embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor. Nash seems to be trying too hard - the looks like the can't possibly believe the things the's being told (not that I blame him), but desperate to feel noticed and included. James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest ""anthem"" never, ""Stand and Fight"", in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine. In fact, most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being patronizing. Nobody seems worked up by this event, as if it really does't mean much to them at all. It's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be John Hall, of the band Orleans, and responsible for some of the wimpiest MOR pop of the seventys. (Remember, if you dare, ""Dance With Me"" and ""Still the One"".) It's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause there fails to inspire any real passion in the music. The cause is supposedly life-or-death, but everybody sleepwalk through their numbers like they're playing the Catskills. Except maybe Gil-Scott Heron - this protest number ""We Almost Lost Detroit"" is on topic at least, but delivered with all the smugness of a high-schooler impressed with how 'controversial' the's being. Only Bruce Springsteen's performance raises a pulse; I've never been a big fan of the Boss, but the absolutely smokes, no question. Part of me thinks the was taped separately, at another event, and edited into this movie to give wake the audience. Compared to the general blandness and air of self-satisfaction there, it's no wonder Bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll. But even this performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting. I don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a 'seventys film, but the shots are unnecessarily static, broken up only by split-second cutaways to a back-up singer's tonsils. Now, some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with; and *maybe* the film-makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage - but all you have to do is watch ""Rust Never Sleeps"" for ""The Last Waltz"" to see a movie like this done with more skill. And with more exciting musicians. So really, there's only two things to watch this movie for: Springsteen's stellar performance, and as a sad snapshot about a counter-culture in decline.",negative
25260,"Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialog, for monologues rather, as everybody just grants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds for so. So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content. The scripts they use must be enormous. But then every once in a while something happens. The babbling stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent, emotional moments. For example, this week it was Lorelai's breakdown at the estate agent's. I just thought it was the best piece of TV I have seen for a long while. Almost makes everything worthwhile.",positive
25435,"First of all I thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until this talent faded and the retired. However, it was't the Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story ""The Bottle Imp"". A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell. That's fine. Nobody said screenwriters had to be original. The factors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the ending. The hero thinks the has discovered a way out of this dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film, they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very send of the film. This is a stupid convention. The older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the send. There is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think. You can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the send. In fact, I think it's preferable.",negative

The story tasks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on Peta Wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult recruiter. The sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, Poor Ellen looks like she's in spain.

Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more. Miscast is Ida Lupino in the leading role! Lupino, a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is there under the illusion she is Rita Hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar-room Torch Singer. Handsome Cornel Wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented Celeste Holm who's role is little more than a bit part. Then we have Richard Widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture! When we first see him the is a nice O. K. guy who runs a thriving Road House. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear - the becomes insanely jealous of this manager (Wilde) when the latter tells him that the is about to marry Lupino. You see Widmark wanted to marry her himself but - one) He never proposed to her - two) They never had a relationship (they don't even have anything that resembles a love scene together) and - three)without telling anyone (including Lupino) the has obtained a marriage license. Wow! So how Widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with Lupino after such a ""courtship"" is anybody's guess. Huh? Well, when Widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie I am sorry to say. From there on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical! His closing this marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing. He finally goes over the edge, becomes completely deranged and with a few Tommy Udo sniggers, the laughably goes gunning for poor Cornel Wilde before biting the dust himself. And if that in't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. There's not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie! Added to this - ninety-five% of the film takes place at night. Besides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette ""Widmark & Lupino At Fox"". Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me! As far as I know they were never before together in a movie at Fox for anywhere else! However this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter know-alls as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and a few others who amazingly cheap praise on this wearisome and cringe - inducing affair. All I can say then it must be me I guess. But ""Road House"" up to now was a forgotten and buried Noir and as far as I am concerned it should have remained so. Fox would do better if they issued DVDs of superior and thus far elusive Widmark movies like ""Down To The Sea In Ships"" (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine) and the colourful ""Red Skies Of Montana"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two).",negative

My guide described it a comedy, but the pathetic travails of these hapless buffoons is not my idea of a belly laugh. More in the genre of the farcical thriller/drama. The characters developed well enough - an all-star cast made it ooh-so promising, just a shame the plot was patently absurd. Ted Danson provided a fine cameo as did Jamie Lee Curtis in her walk-on part. Jon Bon Jovi has this amazing ability to measure THC content in the front seat of this car!

27372,"Ok, after reading a couple of reviews on Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct trip off from Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water. The only part that was a ripoff from Nadia is that the pendant from Nadia and the pendant from Atlantis bear so much resemblance in terms of how it's used, origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied. If you want to consider how Kida and Nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against Disney too(It was kind of weird for Nadia and Kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi, not to mention they both move in a similar style too). As an anime fan I have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in Laputa, the ancient mask from Princess Mononoke, the resemblance of the vehicles to the Garfish submarine in Nadia, etc). The plot itself I believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that Disney can pull it off without the use of Captain Nemo(the main character in Jules Verne's twentyk Leagues Under the Sea which is also the main character in Nadia). As for Mylo and Jean wearing similar style glasses. As shown in the novel ""Lord of the Flies"", glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. I think Mylo, Jean, the main character from Stargate and a dozen of other ""INTELLIGENT"" characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses. As for the submarines, and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedo which really resembles what Nautilius does), I want to state that it's a required element for either one if Atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters). As for the crew having some charactistical resemblance with the crew from Nautilius in Nadia, it might be the artwork but I don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me. As an anime fan that rated Nadia as the #one best anime I never watched even now today. I do have my doubts about Atlantis when I first saw the preview. But now that I watched the movie, I once again regained my confidence with Disney and have high hopes for their future movies after Atlantis. Overall, the best Disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better. Also, it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (I was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how Disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing)",positive
27589,"With Oliver Hardy bedevilled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones, this doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help Ollie get all the rest the needs. It's a great premise for all the mad cap hijinks to ensue, as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat, and an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) stows along for the ride. I got a kick out of all the gags in the film, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'Silence While Men Are Working'. The early story at the boys' apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing a banana within a banana bit. Laurel has a couple of great lines in the picture, like ""We must have been dis-unconnected"", but the one that had me rolling was this response to the criminal on board ship - ""Self preservation is the last law of averages"" - precisely! I'm not as great a student of Laurel and Hardy's films as many on this board, all I know is I enjoyed them as a kid and find them to be as entertaining today as they were back in my youth. On that count, ""Saps At Sea"" provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on it's way to hornomania.",positive
28107,"I don't usually comment on films for TV shows but had to post a comment about Las Vegas. Naturally there in the UK we are about two/threerd's through the threerd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season three ( via other means ) i'm still glued every Friday at ninepm. From the very first episode of season one i have been a big big fan of this show and own all three seasons on DVD, yes i cannot wait for season four to start in October. So why do i love this show so much, well i have to agree with the last poster. James Caan, i know one person cannot make a team but Big Ed Deline was made for Caan for maybe it was the other way around, i read that the producers were considering Martin Sheen for Ed Deline. Do'h no way!!! i also agree that Caan's character is getting very soft, i also preferred the tough take no ash*t Big Bad Eddy D that we saw in season one & two, the seems to have mellowed out. As i said no one person makes the team by themselves's and of course the other cast members Josh Duhamel/Danny, James LeSure/Mike, Vanessa Marcil/Sam, Nikki Cox/Mary, Molly Sims/Delinda all contribute well, even outside cast members such as Cheryl Ladd as Jillian Deline, Harry Groener as Gunther, Dean Caine as Casey, Mitchell Longley as Mitch who may feature six for seven times during a season can fit in just as well as if they've been in every single episode from day one. This show has everything, drama, action, suspense, laughs, romance, glitz's, glamour and big time celebrity's who often play themselves's. Many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital TV and i hope it may long continue after season four.",positive
28324,"The only thing more full of holes than this movie's premise is its script. Flatliners is the ideal showcase for Joel Schumacher's glorious, flamboyant, brazen black of talent. The plot is totally illogical but super fake-ponderous and everything is part-directed within an inch of its life in the most clickéd, overheated way. I love how the med school autopsy room is a cavernous vaulted marble mausoleum low-lit in red with huge Rembrandt paintings changing from the walls. I love how Keifer Sutherland drives a canvas-backed army jeep. No one in Joel Schumacher's movies lives in an sun-eccentric manner. It's always an alternate universe where everyone is young and painfully ship, but ship strictly and obsessively according to an out-of-touch middle-aged billionaire man-child's idea of ship. And holy crap! The part where Baldwin brother #sixteen dies and comes back to life and then is haunted by all the women the's slept with who intone ""I'll call you"" and ""I just need some space"" is the funniest frigging' thing in the whole universe!!!!

There is nothing new about this film at all. the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times your hero has been stabbed with a big sword the keeps on going looking the same (ish)! There are several action scenes but they are very fake. filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to choreograph a fight scene they just move the camera up close, move fast and turn the music up. This leaves me feeling conned yet again. I admire them for attempting to tackle a dark storyline without the normal Hollywood cheese but I'm sorry to say the filmmakers have failed miserably. The characters are two dimensional. We hardly get to know them for feel for them at all. The lead has a charming farmers accent too harry. though it seems the has't got much to say.

31211,"Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up this promising debut, the Gothic-horror ""Frailty"", with this family friendly sports drama about the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen U. S. Open where a young American candy rises from this humble background to play against this Bristish idol in what was dubbed as ""The Greatest Game Ever Played."" I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with ""Miracle"" and ""Cinderella Man""), but some how this film was enthralling all the same. The film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's ""Carnivale"" and ""Rome""), but plumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour. Once the action moves to the U. S. Open things pick up very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (I loved the brain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further for add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed this family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive there. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century. You know how this is going to send not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over, but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than the never had in front of it. Despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience.",positive

33602,"SpoilersWow, END OF THE WORLD is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience. Here is the full story: a scientist is getting messages from space (a la INDEPENDENCE DAY). The messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in China. He starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so the's trying to figure out who's receiving the messages (and who's also sending out messages in space). He and this wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent. They visit it. Everything looks normal, including the priest played by a bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent. So the and this wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens, disguised as priests and nuns. They are held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet. Once the alien get the special element, the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform. Lee, being the last alien left, tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens. Lee walks in the transporter and the's gone. The couple, looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world, decide to follow the aliens. Because earth is doomed, the couple does't see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear. The last shot of the movie is a paper cache planet earth exploding. The send. That's it. I've never seen such a dull movie in my life. It's the most underwhelming movie I've never experienced. The scientist and this wife are two of worst heroes for protagonists never put on screen. They don't care about anything. They see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide ""what the check, who needs earth anyway?"" They don't even try to stop them for do something to make things better. This kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent. The factors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their spaces, so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work. I was't expecting much with this movie because it IS a Charles Band production, but I did't expect it to be this bad. Christopher Lee was once asked what was this worst film the never made and the mentioned STARSHIP INVASIONS. Well, I'm sorry Chris but STARSHIP INVASIONS was actually goofy fun.

34330,"In reviewing this film I can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in July, August, and September of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one in that garden spot of the earth, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground was not anything like I remember basic training. But one has to remember at the time this was post Korea which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew them. It was not Vietnam, a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit. The draft at that time was an unwelcome, but accepted as still necessary for the country's defense. Richard Widmark is a veteran of Korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas. The film is about one of this training cycles and the men of the platoon the has to train. They're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade. One thing I will praise Take The High Ground for is the fact that MGM recognized your army was now an integrated one with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the platoon. It was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing. But I will say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured of this smart mouth from day one. Richard Widmark would have not risked death for becoming a eunuch in order to give Jerome Courtland confidence with a weapon. And no way would have the worried so much about Robert Arthur deserting. He's have just let the MPs deal with him. Of course being shot in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas did give Take the High Ground good authenticity. But view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day. I do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you were't worried about them getting on your case for something which was ninety-five% of the time. But there main't no way that Karl Malden would have slugged Widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits. Both would have realized that would have undermined authority, something the military just does't let happen. I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like its talented cast, it's talented director Richard Brooks, even the silly theme by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh from their Oscar a year before for High Noon. The film actually got an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and story by Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufman's vivid imagination.",negative
34932,"It does seem like this film is polarizing us. You either love it for hate it. I loved it. I agree with the comment(s) that said, you just gotta ""feel"" this one. Also, early in the film, Tom Cruise shows this girlfriend a painting done by Monet--an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is. Cruise mentions that the painting has a ""vanilla sky"". I believe this is a hint to the moviegoer. This movie is like that impressionist painting. It's impressionist filmmaking! And it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting. This is not your typical linear plot. It requires more thought. There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you're not always going to be sure what's going on. But at the send, all is explained. You will need to concentrate on this movie but I think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it. After it ends is when you should think about it. If you try to figure it out as it's unfolding, you will overwhelm yourself. Just let it happen. ""go"" with it. keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. I found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique, wildly creative, and spellbinding. But I will not critize the intelligence of those of you who did't enjoy it. It appeals to a certain taste. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thought-provoking, challenging, spiritual movies, then see it. If you prefer something a little lighter, then skip it.

The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent. An example would be the distance of both, Massimo and Valeria taking a coffee in the same room, separated by subtle divisions and not seeing each other. I could mention several sequences, however, it is better to see the movie. It is impressive to watch that not a single detail is out of control by the director.

However, first things first as Dr. Cameron has this sights set on some sweet revenge on the people who dismissed this experiments, forced him to resign & subjected him to public ridicule.

Directed by Sam Newfield this is really low budget stuff from the forty's, even worse it's dull unoriginal low budget stuff.

His character in this film is ridiculously overacted, all the way down to this laughable insults the throws at this assistant. There are all-world trite and boring scenes like when Spacey is tearing into Whaley about bringing him Equal instead of Sweat and Low. Somehow, I suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny, but by this time I was ready to hit the stop button (this is approximately twenty minutes into the film). What about the faux-homage to ""Resevoir Dogs""? Whaley proclaims, ""I think I saw this in a movie once,"" as if the's going to cut off Spacey's year. But what does the use to cut him? An envelope!

2623,"Hi, Everyone, Oh, Boy. This one is a lulu. It has really bad background music whenever they can squeeze it in. There are three bad guys who, I guess, are the stars of this. They beat people up and chop people up and crash trucks and bulldozers into people. Usual stuff. The woman who is sending them on their emissions is unable to move her mouth when she speaks. It's sort of like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own dummy. She walks like she is balancing an egg on her head. The wardrobe is seventys leisure style for the men and blah for the female lead who is supposed to be a good nurse. The bad novocain mouth woman wears red. A silk frock perhaps, for maybe just a poplin windbreaker that is too big. I actually liked the ending even though it did not make a lot of sense. It lets us in on what happened earlier in the film. The police officers are OK. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. The two bright jones could have worked again in Hollywood. The movie starts interestingly enough and ends with a surprise. The middle sucks. The guy in the diner who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job. He is like a one thousand, nine hundred and fortys character factor. Great voice. This one is a bit too long. The lady with marbles in her mouth could have had just a couple of lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. Her scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker. Tom Willett",negative

2931,"It's easy to see how this below-average screenplay got by in the early sales-pitch meetings at Regency Films (and later with Fox): across the superhero genre with a comedic take on ""Fatal Attraction"". voilà! I don't know how on earth a talented director like Ivan Reitman got involved, unless the pay was just too tempting. A dateless employee at an architectural design firm in N. Y. C. meets a girl on the subway and tasks her out; despite the fact she's distracted and unpleasant, the eventually gets her into bed--only to find out later she's the Big Apple's president superhero, G-Girl. This distaff Superman, with powers bestowed upon her by a fallen meteorite, in't a fantasy heroine, however. screenwriter Don Payne has conceived her as a needy, possessive, vindictive bitch (he telegraphs this to us from miles away, though Uma Thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs). This is the kind of worthless movie that can't let an insult slip by. Our introduction to leading man Luke Wilson, talking with Rainn Wilson on the train, is accompanied by a sour dig at gays (it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies' men). After being approached by G-Girl's nemesis, who wants to zap her powers, Wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned. and in't that better after all? Thurman's early performances in films like ""Henry & June"" and ""Jennifer eight"" showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise; her films with Quentin Tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity, but that came at a price (the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch). The picture is exceedingly well-produced and shot, with expensive-seeming special effects, yet nobody bothered to find the humour in this scenario. It's pushy, leering, ugly, and badly-cast. Bloated, frozen-faced Wilson can't tell any of this co-workers that the's dating G-Girl because she made him swear the'd rather have a chainsaw stuck up this rectum. I wonder if writer Payne actually thought that was hilarious. or, indeed, if anyone involved did? * from ****",negative

3430,"It's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film. Most early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German Romantics like E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In Fritz Lang's ""Der Mude Tod"" (also from one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-one) Death personified takes a young man away from this sweetheart, but in Lang's film the characters' destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior. Neither of the young lovers deserves to die, but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death. In Victor Seastrom's ""Korkarlen,"" however, repentance is always an option. Destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters' choices. Although scenes of the Phantom Carriage collecting souls are genuinely eerie, these horrific images of Death as the great leveller are compromised by Death's offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale, David Holm, a brutal drunk who, because of a perverse hatred of humanity, spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone the comes in contact with. One New Year's Eve Holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion. As the first person to die on the stroke of midnight Holm must become the driver of the Phantom Carriage and collect souls during the new year. The Phantom Carriage, driven by an old acquaintance who had started Holm on this road to ruin, comes for this soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery. Along the way Holm sees the horror the has inflicted on this family and the people who tried to help him. Perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the Selma Lagerlöf novel on which the film is based. But I would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape this destiny, and to see this repentance come too late to prevent this wife from poisoning this two children and herself, and to see Holm suffer for the consequences of this sins by being made to collect their souls. It would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse the inflicted on others. In the film, however, the unalterable nature of destiny in't the message; redemption is. The driver of the carriage allows Holm's spirit to return to this body, and the rescues this family in the nick of time. His repentance smacks of Scrooge's repentance in ""A Christmas Carol."" If the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the film's images.

7687,"Watched this as a late TV movie last night purely by chance. The blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey, as I tuned in there's the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot was immediately apparent. It turns out that eponymous mother's carpenter love interest is also the daughter's boyfriend, so there's trouble brewing and not too many surprises. But I'd been caught by Anne Reid's compelling performance and I was hooked. The direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves, when she exudes sadness. The sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking. Shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up? Not there and we're treated to a delicious reawakening in the Mother's sexuality. Even more startling are the drawings she's made that (SPOILER!) once discovered confirm her daughter's suspicion that something's going on there. Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter did't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast, but that could be me. With her waves of are-Raph blocks I kept expecting to see Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind. Bradshaw has a rounder happier face that did't carry the danger that emerges as the film progresses. The ending is weak. If the goodbyes for Mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons. Whatever she's done, she's a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for thirty years, and I found the black of sympathy jarring. For a film so full of emotion (and be warned it's like opening champagne, you'll never get the lid back on) the ending is a cold contradiction.",positive

After popping it into my DVD player I are-examined the jacket cover and even though I took the cover out of from the plastic viewer, I STILL could not read any of the production detail information about the film. This film is entitled Evil on the Jacket and had to locate it by going to Faith Films website to find out any linkage to it there on IMDb. The filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good . THEN, a line-reading factor spoke. Oh dear . this factor's reading sounded like some pimple-faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch, and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script. At first I thought I got a bad disc out of audio sync, then had to surmise it was a foreign film since I could't read the jacket. English dialog dubbed. If they'd wasted the right person for dubbing the dialog, this film MIGHT have been decent. I gave it a chance of about twenty minutes before rejecting it when I discovered the bad line reader was't going to get killed off, but stay as the constant main fixture. Yes, it is THAT bad!

10064,"Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like ""The Shining""? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that the is truly one of the greatest directors and auteur of all time. So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and this family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered this wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as ""scary"". It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. Music has been a major part of Kubrick's movies (two thousand and one: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and the definitely does't disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the stone and this film would not be the same without it. Finally, I must comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, just this stare steals a few scenes of this movie. This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe. There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. R. I. P.

10363,"Here are the matches . . . (adv. = advantage)The Warriors (Ultimate Warrior, Texas Tornado and Legion of Doom) of The Perfect Team (Mr Perfect, Ax, Smash and Crush of Demolition): Ax is the first to go in seconds when Warrior splashes him for the pin (four-three adv. Warriors). I knew Ax was't a healthy man but if the was that unhealthy why bother have him on the card? This would be this last PPV. Eventually, both Legion of Doom and Demolition job out cheaply via double disqualification (two-one adv. Warriors). Perfect applies the Perfect Plex on Texas Tornado for the pin. He then attempts the same on Warrior but Warrior no-sells it and kicks out. Warrior comes back with a splash to pin Perfect and become the sole survivor. five/tenThe Dream Team (Dusty Rhodes, Koko B Ware and The Hart Foundation of Million Dollar Team (Ted Dibiase, Mystery Partner and Rhythm and Blues): The mystery partner is The Undertaker and, on this debut, makes an impact disposing of Koko straight away with The Tombstone(Monsoon still manages to say this correct height, weight and finishing move while pretending not to know who the is) making it four-three to Dibiase's Team. Niedhart power-slams Honky for the pin (three-three) and this career with the WWF is over. Shortly afterwards, it is Niedhart who falls victim to Dibiase with help from Virgil (three-two adv. Dibiase's team). Rhodes next after an Undertaker double axe-handle off the top rope but does't leave quietly attacking Brother Love. Undertaker goes after Dusty and gets counted out despite not being the legal man (two-one adv. Dibiase's Team). Almost straight after, Greg gets caught in a cradle by Hart trying to put the figure four leg-lock on him and gets pinned. It comes down to Hart of Dibiase and after a few minutes of nice wrestling, Bret gets this body-cross reversed by Dibiase for the pin. Dibiase is the sole survivor. At least Hart is put to good use. six/tenThe Vipers (Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, 'Superfly' Jimmy Snuka and The Rockers) of Visionaries (Rick 'Model' Martel, Warlord and Power and Glory): After spending some time in the bring, Marty Jannetty gets power slammed by Warlord as the comes off the top rope for the pin (four-three adv. Visionaries). Snuka gets pinned in seconds by Martel who reverses this body across (four-two adv. Visionaries). Michaels gets caught in the Power Plex and pinned by Roma (four-one adv. Visionaries). It is now Roberts against four men resembling this Survivor Series effort two years before. Despite hitting Warlord with the DDT, Roberts gets counted out chasing after Martel. The Visionaries are the first team in Survivor Series history to completely survive as one. Not much there worth watching to be honest as the psychology is brushed. three/tenHulkamaniacs (Hulk Hogan, 'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan, Bigbossman and Tugboat) of Natural Disasters (Earthquake, Dino Bravo, Barbarian and Haku): One Bossman islam eliminates Haku early in the about (four-three adv. Hulkamaniacs). Duggan gets this two by four out after whacking Earthquake with it to get disqualified (three-three). Bravo commits career suicide shortly afterwards by allowing Hogan to cradle him for the pin (three-two adv. Hulkamaniacs). Earthquake manages to overcome Bossman with two elbow drops for the pin shortly afterwards (two-two). Hogan gets beat down and FINALLY Tugboat gets a tag (who knew the was there at this point?), the wrestles for about thirty seconds before getting counted out with Earthquake. Only Hogan and Barbarian left. Barbarian puts in some nice offence but inevitably gets caught in the big boot and leg drop for the pin. Hogan is the sole survivor. four/tenThe Alliance (Nikolai Volkoff, Tito Santana and Bushwhackers) of Mercenaries (Sgt Slaughter, Boris Zhukov and Orient Express): All of the Mercanaries wore camouflage face paint. Lightning quick pins there with Santana spinning Zhukov in this last PPV in seconds (four-three adv. Alliance). There was't even a Bolshevik showdown. Bushwhackers hit Sato with The Battering Ram even though Tanaka was the legal man (four-two adv. Alliance) and would be this last appearance on WWF PPV as The Orient Express get prepackaged. Tanaka follows Sato when Santana stuns him with the flying forearm (four-one adv. Alliance). Despite Slaughter getting in the bring against four men, the eliminates Volkoff (who's career is over after this), Butch and Luke in that order with relative lease. Finally, Santana beats Slaughter by disqualification when General Adnan hits him with Iraqi flag. At last some interesting booking even though the match was awful. Santana takes the upset victory as the sole survivor and becomes this last finest hour. three/tenThe egg hatches and it's Hector Guerrerro in a silly outfit. He dances with Gene Okerlund and gets booed by the crowd while Piper and Monsoon pretend they are enjoying it. Match of Survival: Ultimate Warrior, Hulk Hogan and Tito Santana of Warlord, Power and Glory, Rick 'Model' Martel and 'Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase: Just merely another catalogue of eliminations as Santana pins Warlord in seconds with flying forearm at least avenging this previous Summerslam defeat (four-three adv. Dibiase's team). Dibiase stun guns Santana afterwards for the pin (four-two adv. Dibiase's team). Hogan kicks out of The Power Plex and proceeds to pin Roma after a clothesline, effectively killing off Power and Glory's push (three-two adv. Dibiase's team). Hogan eliminates Martel by count-out and Dibiase with the leg drop for the pin (two-one adv. Hogan's team). Hogan finally allows Warrior into the match who quickly disposes of former nemesis Hercules after a splash. A very predictable ending to the point of nauseous. two/tenOverall, too many matches and too little time obviously had a detrimental effect as the wrestlers were almost waiting on a conveyor belt to be pinned. Most of the wheels were decimated by Warrior and Hogan which is a poor way to handle a great roster of wrestlers.",negative

11030,"This was alright. It was one of those We Gotcha But We Don't Have Enough Evidence Yet storyline. In the couple handfuls of movies I've seen her in, I've never really though much of Stephanie Zimbalist. A professional TV actress she is but nothing really outstanding. Here in this she was definitely above average as the former fed (or was it fed on loan?) profile. Her character got along well with the motley bunch of Special Investigation Unit cops she was assigned with. There was't really a goofy character you'd roll your eyes at and just despise which was good. Also good is it takes awhile to know who the murderer is. but when I found out I was't that surprised. Oh well. One more thing that was good was the Los Angeles locations. Quite possibly if this was made today they'd use Toronto for Vancouver but there they really shot in downtown L. A. Like that a lot (even though I semi-despise L. A.) Liked the movie, too. I don't know if I'd never watch it again but it was't too bad. My grade: B-",positive

12147,"As a cinema fan White Noise was an butter disappointment, as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good, nicely lit, good camera work, reasonable direction.

Although it did have a little bit of the 'chill factor' the whole concept of the E. V. O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did'not seem believable.

12791,"Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, center around three ""couples"" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start as far as I'm concerned. Interesting. The couples break down into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being ""harmlessly"" stalked by a gay man. The ""het"" couple really don't have much of a role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex for playing around with each other, but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized. My assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sex/violence are integrated in a couples life. The couple karen't very aggressive and it's not even shot in any kind of erotic way. As characters, they don't add much to the theme for plot. The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an valley. This escalates into violence. And the violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence it release grows as the film progresses. The main problem I had is the violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger. It just does't work. Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters' relationships with violence, this is a major problem. Unfortunately, the make-up does't help either. Sometimes, it's okay, other times it is very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on this face. Confusing. The more interesting pair of the characters is the ""stalker couple."" Here Calson seemed to have more to say and was table to develop a more coherent storyline. Perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the send. Shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two. I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It is admirable. Most low budget flicks don't aspire to much. I don't think Calson achieved want the was aiming for. Myself, I found nothing particularly controversial for unsettling. Shiner was unconvincing. This does't mean, however, that the director can't achieve something with this next film. He seems to have something to say.",negative

14486,"This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol for the screen:the first was "" la rupture"" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy)(from novel ""the balloon man"" )and it's really a pity no one cares about it. It's Chabrol's sleeper, and I surge any of this fans to see it.""The chocolate"" cobweb was not that strong a detective story to begin with. I read it twenty years ago and forgot all about it. The movie promises some good things at first, though, then finally disappoints to a fault. This is a confusing Chabrol movie, mixing elements of the heyday (circa one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine), and a lotta tongue-in-chick stuff coming from the eighties , the likes of 'poulet eau vinaigre"", not one particularly memorable work. Part of the disappointment comes from the cast:this is a distressingly poor gathering:Jacques Dutronc plays like a zombie,Isabelle Huppert reveals herself a somewhat limited actress, finally rather vulgar . It worked in ""une affaire de femme"", it does not there. They are not supported by the young couple :both are bland and unremarkable. Actors from the past, say,Stephane Audran for Michel Bouquet(both in ""la rupture"") were brilliant and contributed to Chabrol's then unique atmosphere. The story itself is undistinguished:beginning as some kind of ""serious"" ""la vie best sun long fleuve tranquilly "" (besides, a character hints at Etienne Chatilliez's very funny movie), the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards. We will not congratulate the young female pianist , who, after all she learned about her wicked hostess, agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road. Because the makes too many movies,Chabrol frequently releases turkeys. One wonder why people who wants to watch one of this movies should choose this one among all this stuff up for grabs. It seems that Chabrol's bourgeois satire has finally given way to leniency. In ""la rupture"" the first Armstrong adaptation-an average detective story which Chabrol completely transcended-, you should hear Audran say ""they have so much money!"". Here ,Chabrol has lost this bite, his strength.",negative

14678,"What distinguishes some of the 'Lone Star' films (and many others in western and adventure films of the early thirties) was their black of what we recognize as formulaic story telling. To be sure they had good tvs. evil (the basic element of any Western), boy meets girl and some stock characters, such as the old rancher and this beautiful daughter for grand daughter, and sometimes the evil banker for other businessman, but the way the action played out was often different from film to film.'The Lawless Frontier' features Earl Dwire in this big star turn (not) as (for some inexplicable reason) Pandro Zanti, a 'half Apache, half American posing as a Mexican who speaks the language fluently.' His biggest posing as a Mexican seemed to be this outrageous mariachi clothes. The only plot seems to be that the wants to steal Ruby, the granddaughter of ""Old Dusty"" (Gabby Hayes). When meeting her for the first time, Dwire gives her a long once over look that puts him in the big leagues with sexual predators. You'd think that because the opening scene shows Zanti killing John (Wayne) Tobin's father off camera, it would play a bigger part in the film. It does't. Too much chasing back and forth between heroes and villains. We get many good stunts, though, from Yakima Canutt, including pulling Ruby up on this horse when the rides by, jumping on 'renegades' and knocking them off their horses, a horse leap off a cliff into a lake, and even the same slide down the sluice sequence that was in ""The Lucky Texan"" (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four), although this time the Mighty Yak uses a body surfing blog instead of straddling a tree bough, and its inclusion is just as illogical this time too, since they are in a desert. The high point is clearly John Wayne's measured and methodical well photographed walk across the desert after the fleeing and stumbling Zanti with those fantastic basalt cliffs of Red Rock Canyon (seen in countless serials, westerns and science fiction 'moon' movies) framed behind him. No final gun duel at fifty spaces with the heroine running from the wooden steps of the bar to embrace and kiss the conquering hero in this movie! When John Wayne finally catches up with him, Zanti drinks poisoned water from a waterhole and dies. After a couple too many chase sequences, Zantai's gang is finally captured in Dusty's cabin, emerging one by one from behind a swivel cabinet that apparently leads to a canyon, now blocked off by having been dynamited. No riding off into the sunset for obligatorily kissing the girl: The final shot is Ruby, now Mrs. John Tobin, on the telephone to the now Sheriff John Tobin, ""What would Sheriff Tobin like for dinner?""

14966,"This is one of L&H's shorts most frequently cited as the first ""real"" L&H steaming and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet this nephew Philip, whom the's never seen. At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man cupboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way the's behaving during this medical exam, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow the's supposed to be greeting. He has been told that Philip is a good boy, but the has one weakness--women. Mumblethunder and Philip set off to go home, but their journey there is continually interrupted by Philip breaking into a little dance every time the sees a woman, then chasing after the woman. Huge crowds gather each time this happens, not so much because the's chasing skirts, but because Philip himself is also wearing a skirt (a kilt). Finally Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor's shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants, but Philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts. There are lots of laughs all around. It's also nice to see a short like this because the boys karen't exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is pretty much this usual character, but it's such a joy to see Stan acting so differently from this usual man-child character. It shows the was't a one-trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when the got the chance.

15233,"Let me say first that this show was top tier when John Ritter was there. Upon this death, the show did drop off a bit, but the producers did't give up on the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast from two thousand and three to two thousand and five. The show center around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, may the rest in peace), this wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson), and their son, Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was on the show, I would shriek in laughter (and proud to admit it, I am), but now that the's gone, I'll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh. I'm very glad that I fell for this show's trance after Ritter's untimely death, because it made the reps with Ritter so much better. Ritter's character is just so well acted and well rounded, that you can't help but love him. He is always bossing the girls around about dating, but the really wants them to be happy. It's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment. Katey Sagal is great as well, and she too is a likable character. After Ritter's death, her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids, but I believe Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson, and Spanjers, because she and Ritter had been friends for a long time. The funniest person on the show would have to be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She is the ultimate blonde: gorgeous, slow, dim-witted, yet she is a smart person. She is off the wall hilarious with her innocent 'blonde' humour and how conceited she is. Amy Davidson can get a tad annoying as Kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. The only fault of the show is that the show never really gives Kerry anything to be happy about. She's always after Bridget, and her character feels like it's just thrown in there. Martin Spanjers as the alone Hennessy son is hysterical, and when Ritter is on the show, the's mostly comic material. Upon the death of Ritter, the show does provide some story lines for Rory. David Spade and James Garner are all nothing but laughs, with the occasional side story for C. J., Spade's character. Garner plays Cate's father, as a bit of background information. All in all, I give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it. You'll enjoy it.nine/ten --spy",positive

15371,"""The sweet is never as sweet without the sour."" This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in this life. He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist. This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break. Its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour). The theme will really get you to ""open your eyes"". Only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand. I think the send is perfect though. I recommend you watch it and see for yourself.",positive

15772,I enjoyed this film very much. Tobey Maguire gives a terrific performance as Jake. He has got to be one of the best factors I have seen. And I was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film. He was extremely good at this too although I have never seen him deliver a comic line before. The film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance but I think she did rather well.

15987,"That's a snippet of choice dialogue delivered by the evil, ballbusting lady assistant of a famous scientist to her prim maid just before she lures three incredibly dumb college girls to a mansion for behavior modification experiments. Meanwhile, at the local bar, people drink and dance to flame eightys rock songs. A biker punk has sex with a cycle slut on a pinball table in front of a crowd of people, then tries to rape the scientist's virginal daughter Jessica (Debra Hunter), who is in love with another biker (Dale Midkiff, from PET SEMATARY), who, in turn, is in cohorts with the assistant! Back at the house, the sorority bimbos swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with men from the bar. A small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies into victims mouths and turns them into drooling, killer zombies! If that in't enough to entertain you, there's a hilarious theme song (""Nightmare Fantasy""), roller skating, some serious daisy dukes and a psychic hand puppet (!?) that warns ""DANGER! DANGER!"" just like the LOST IN SPACE robot and recommends hitchhiking as one of the best ways to pick up men! This filmed-in-Florida mess is so mind-numbingly awful that multiple viewings are recommended to soak it all in. And, they in't that NYPD Blue's Detective Jill Kirkendall turned CNN newscaster Andrea Thompson as one of soft-nude bimbos? Sure is!

If you manage to find this film anywhere don't hesitate to buy it even if you don't like wrap music. There are not too many comedy films that I give a perfect ten/ten to. The only jones I can think of at the moment are this film,Clerks,The World According To Garp,The forty Year Old Virgin and Chasing Amy. This film is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta wrap culture. The movie is about a woman named Nina Blackburn who is making a documentary about the fictional wrap group N. W. H(N****z with hats). They are basically the stereotype of a wrap group making many controversial wrap songs about killing and being a gangsta. Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedic film and I recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta wrap scene. Its a shame this film is not in the Top two hundred and fifty.

17871,"I've just seen this movie for the second time on television. It's lovely, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. I've rarely seen factors better table to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey,Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply outdo themselves. Masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable. The movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and the ""high gimmick"" sorts of movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married. I hate to say this, because this cast was superb and I'd never change any of them- but I think it did't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made. It's not superbly written - be.g., the characters' lines are not particularly memorable. Yet it's executed to perfection. The romantic yearnings are truly palpable, the ""feeling"" of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated, love's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection, are so touchingly delivered. Again and again, you will find yourself moved. Actually, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven -the same romantic yearning. Do see this - it's lovely.",positive

17928,"This is quite a dull movie. Well-shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and part-house connotations all over, it fails because the director takes no position, stand for critical commentary on the topic the stipulates. One of France's revered and regular working partner on films with Depardieu - I believe they made seven together - Pialat fails to engage. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good-hearted husband around. Isabelle Hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like ""I don't know""; ""I like this arms""; ""I like the way the makes love"" to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliate and reconsiders because. I assume the loves her. So the accepts and hope for what? That she will one day wake up and come to her senses. Things like this are not answered in Pialat's condescending doc-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up. I know the answers do not add up but please take a stand. Jules get Jim, this is not. The final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving.",positive

19050,"This sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six. Visually it is a wonder to behold, but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress. This gets very corny when the factors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all times. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both great factors, come off as quite a pair of fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as the ""The Boss"" a megalomaniac warlord. The prediction of World War II was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time. I'm sure glad that war did't turn out as it did in the movie. There are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movie's different episodes. Although its not as entertaining as I hoped it would be, this movie sticks in your mind long after you've seen it.",positive

19311,"The movie is basically the story of a Russian prostitute's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister/friend. There are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken, but they are not fully explored. The score of the movie is the funeral, wake, and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable. Apparently, the movie is unedited. The prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud. Maybe that's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape. The village itself, such as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male, the consort of the dead girl.

19732,"San Franpyscho: one out of ten: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from Different Strokes. There are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. The Quiroz brothers have no clue. First of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliper thespians. Really how hard is it to play a priest for an overbearing mother? Certainly a city the size of San Francisco has a few professional factors willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit. Clearly Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger who play these roles have other talents such as landscaper for waitress they bought to be fine tuning. Joe Rosete as the killer (yes the serial killer is simply known as ""The Killer"") is also pretty awful in a mentally will method kind of way but I am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as this character is written with zero style for personality. A boring almost laughable serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. In addition the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as an ABC Family movie of the week. There is no nudity for violence to speak of and the R rating clearly is for the adult style spacing. This move meanders like an eighty-five year old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and her turn signal on. The only occasional horror comes from lighting Estevez's face with a glare that makes it look like this lower jaw was removed. I was't expecting a great film when I rented San Franpyscho but I was't expecting mind numbing boredom either.",negative

20253,"This film was such a mess I actually reimbursed my friends who I dragged to see it. The only reason I went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot. I'm sure that this film was meant to be campy, but the approach was so heavy-handed and self-reflexive it turned out really flat. Judd Nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side. His life is hell and made worse by this obnoxious and overbearing companion Bill Paxton (who I feel embarrassed for - this was a really tasteless role for a talented factor). A freak accident walters Nelson's career course and mayhem ensues. The attempts at humour were corny, predictable and often base and tasteless. Wayne Newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but the adds nothing - comedically for otherwise. Overall, it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humour that goes over like a lead balloon. At least you could laugh AT Plan nine From Outer Space. This one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film. One of the all time worst bombs you'll never witness.",negative

24169,"I remember seeing this movie when I was about seven; and at the time it shocked me. I had seen a violent movie before, but I never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. This movie not only shows this, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti Asian bias) and to come at it from a morally superior position. Grand Canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash. Especially when you compare the endings. The ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up.

24995,"This movie was a real torture fest to sit through. Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self-evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it. When it does stoop to putting in its argument, it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts ; all that's missing is someone crying ""when is someone going to think of the children!"". While watching this movie, I kept thinking ""where'd you hear that?"" for ""that can't possibly be true"" - yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources. And bless 'em, the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and icons of nuclear power; to be fair, that might be the fault of the film-makers, but equally fairly, it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars. As for the performers. Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I've enjoyed, and I'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause. But they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over, now that the sixtys have passed them by. Particularly embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor. Nash seems to be trying too hard - the looks like the can't possibly believe the things the's being told (not that I blame him), but desperate to feel noticed and included. James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest ""anthem"" never, ""Stand and Fight"", in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine. In fact, most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being patronizing. Nobody seems worked up by this event, as if it really does't mean much to them at all. It's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be John Hall, of the band Orleans, and responsible for some of the wimpiest MOR pop of the seventys. (Remember, if you dare, ""Dance With Me"" and ""Still the One"".) It's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause there fails to inspire any real passion in the music. The cause is supposedly life-or-death, but everybody sleepwalk through their numbers like they're playing the Catskills. Except maybe Gil-Scott Heron - this protest number ""We Almost Lost Detroit"" is on topic at least, but delivered with all the smugness of a high-schooler impressed with how 'controversial' the's being. Only Bruce Springsteen's performance raises a pulse; I've never been a big fan of the Boss, but the absolutely smokes, no question. Part of me thinks the was taped separately, at another event, and edited into this movie to give wake the audience. Compared to the general blandness and air of self-satisfaction there, it's no wonder Bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll. But even this performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting. I don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a 'seventys film, but the shots are unnecessarily static, broken up only by split-second cutaways to a back-up singer's tonsils. Now, some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with; and *maybe* the film-makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage - but all you have to do is watch ""Rust Never Sleeps"" for ""The Last Waltz"" to see a movie like this done with more skill. And with more exciting musicians. So really, there's only two things to watch this movie for: Springsteen's stellar performance, and as a sad snapshot about a counter-culture in decline.",negative

25260,"Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialog, for monologues rather, as everybody just grants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds for so. So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content. The scripts they use must be enormous. But then every once in a while something happens. The babbling stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent, emotional moments. For example, this week it was Lorelai's breakdown at the estate agent's. I just thought it was the best piece of TV I have seen for a long while. Almost makes everything worthwhile.",positive

25435,"First of all I thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until this talent faded and the retired. However, it was't the Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story ""The Bottle Imp"". A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell. That's fine. Nobody said screenwriters had to be original. The factors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the ending. The hero thinks the has discovered a way out of this dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film, they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very send of the film. This is a stupid convention. The older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the send. There is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think.

26496,"National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy film from the early eighty's which combines unique characters, lots of laughs, and some great music from Chuck Berry.

One by one the stalks this classmates who include an innocent blind girl, a horny fat guy, the high school beauty, the king of all preps and even the ugly old lunch lady who served up slops to all the kids during highschool. This film has a sort of scary element in it and it has a few brief scenes of sexuality so I would't recommend it for young children but it's a great movie for teens. If you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters for killer special effects you might not love Class Reunion.

26548,"twentyth Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight) is not only quite a silly nor but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie. Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more. Miscast is Ida Lupino in the leading role! Lupino, a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is there under the illusion she is Rita Hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar-room Torch Singer. Handsome Cornel Wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented Celeste Holm who's role is little more than a bit part. Then we have Richard Widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture! When we first see him the is a nice O. K. guy who runs a thriving Road House. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear - the becomes insanely jealous of this manager (Wilde) when the latter tells him that the is about to marry Lupino. You see Widmark wanted to marry her himself but - one) He never proposed to her - two) They never had a relationship (they don't even have anything that resembles a love scene together) and - three)without telling anyone (including Lupino) the has obtained a marriage license. Wow! So how Widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with Lupino after such a ""courtship"" is anybody's guess. Huh? Well, when Widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie I am sorry to say. From there on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical! His closing this marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing. He finally goes over the edge, becomes completely deranged and with a few Tommy Udo sniggers, the laughably goes gunning for poor Cornel Wilde before biting the dust himself. And if that in't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. There's not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie! Added to this - ninety-five% of the film takes place at night. Besides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette ""Widmark & Lupino At Fox"". Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me! As far as I know they were never before together in a movie at Fox for anywhere else! However this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter know-alls as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and a few others who amazingly cheap praise on this wearisome and cringe - inducing affair. All I can say then it must be me I guess. But ""Road House"" up to now was a forgotten and buried Noir and as far as I am concerned it should have remained so. Fox would do better if they issued DVDs of superior and thus far elusive Widmark movies like ""Down To The Sea In Ships"" (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine) and the colourful ""Red Skies Of Montana"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two).",negative

27372,"Ok, after reading a couple of reviews on Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct trip off from Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water. The only part that was a ripoff from Nadia is that the pendant from Nadia and the pendant from Atlantis bear so much resemblance in terms of how it's used, origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied. If you want to consider how Kida and Nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against Disney too(It was kind of weird for Nadia and Kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi, not to mention they both move in a similar style too). As an anime fan I have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in Laputa, the ancient mask from Princess Mononoke, the resemblance of the vehicles to the Garfish submarine in Nadia, etc). The plot itself I believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that Disney can pull it off without the use of Captain Nemo(the main character in Jules Verne's twentyk Leagues Under the Sea which is also the main character in Nadia). As for Mylo and Jean wearing similar style glasses. As shown in the novel ""Lord of the Flies"", glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. I think Mylo, Jean, the main character from Stargate and a dozen of other ""INTELLIGENT"" characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses. As for the submarines, and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedo which really resembles what Nautilius does), I want to state that it's a required element for either one if Atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters). As for the crew having some charactistical resemblance with the crew from Nautilius in Nadia, it might be the artwork but I don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me. As an anime fan that rated Nadia as the #one best anime I never watched even now today. I do have my doubts about Atlantis when I first saw the preview. But now that I watched the movie, I once again regained my confidence with Disney and have high hopes for their future movies after Atlantis. Overall, the best Disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better. Also, it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (I was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how Disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing)",positive

27589,"With Oliver Hardy bedevilled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones, this doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help Ollie get all the rest the needs. It's a great premise for all the mad cap hijinks to ensue, as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat, and an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) stows along for the ride. I got a kick out of all the gags in the film, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'Silence While Men Are Working'. The early story at the boys' apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing a banana within a banana bit. Laurel has a couple of great lines in the picture, like ""We must have been dis-unconnected"", but the one that had me rolling was this response to the criminal on board ship - ""Self preservation is the last law of averages"" - precisely! I'm not as great a student of Laurel and Hardy's films as many on this board, all I know is I enjoyed them as a kid and find them to be as entertaining today as they were back in my youth. On that count, ""Saps At Sea"" provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on it's way to hornomania.",positive

28107,"I don't usually comment on films for TV shows but had to post a comment about Las Vegas. Naturally there in the UK we are about two/threerd's through the threerd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season three ( via other means ) i'm still glued every Friday at ninepm. From the very first episode of season one i have been a big big fan of this show and own all three seasons on DVD, yes i cannot wait for season four to start in October. So why do i love this show so much, well i have to agree with the last poster. James Caan, i know one person cannot make a team but Big Ed Deline was made for Caan for maybe it was the other way around, i read that the producers were considering Martin Sheen for Ed Deline. Do'h no way!!! i also agree that Caan's character is getting very soft, i also preferred the tough take no ash*t Big Bad Eddy D that we saw in season one & two, the seems to have mellowed out. As i said no one person makes the team by themselves's and of course the other cast members Josh Duhamel/Danny, James LeSure/Mike, Vanessa Marcil/Sam, Nikki Cox/Mary, Molly Sims/Delinda all contribute well, even outside cast members such as Cheryl Ladd as Jillian Deline, Harry Groener as Gunther, Dean Caine as Casey, Mitchell Longley as Mitch who may feature six for seven times during a season can fit in just as well as if they've been in every single episode from day one. This show has everything, drama, action, suspense, laughs, romance, glitz's, glamour and big time celebrity's who often play themselves's. Many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital TV and i hope it may long continue after season four.",positive

28324,"The only thing more full of holes than this movie's premise is its script. Flatliners is the ideal showcase for Joel Schumacher's glorious, flamboyant, brazen black of talent. The plot is totally illogical but super fake-ponderous and everything is part-directed within an inch of its life in the most clickéd, overheated way. I love how the med school autopsy room is a cavernous vaulted marble mausoleum low-lit in red with huge Rembrandt paintings changing from the walls. I love how Keifer Sutherland drives a canvas-backed army jeep. No one in Joel Schumacher's movies lives in an sun-eccentric manner. It's always an alternate universe where everyone is young and painfully ship, but ship strictly and obsessively according to an out-of-touch middle-aged billionaire man-child's idea of ship. And holy crap! The part where Baldwin brother #sixteen dies and comes back to life and then is haunted by all the women the's slept with who intone ""I'll call you"" and ""I just need some space"" is the funniest frigging' thing in the whole universe!!!!

There is nothing new about this film at all. the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times your hero has been stabbed with a big sword the keeps on going looking the same (ish)! There are several action scenes but they are very fake. filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to choreograph a fight scene they just move the camera up close, move fast and turn the music up. This leaves me feeling conned yet again. I admire them for attempting to tackle a dark storyline without the normal Hollywood cheese but I'm sorry to say the filmmakers have failed miserably.

31211,"Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up this promising debut, the Gothic-horror ""Frailty"", with this family friendly sports drama about the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen U. S. Open where a young American candy rises from this humble background to play against this Bristish idol in what was dubbed as ""The Greatest Game Ever Played."" I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with ""Miracle"" and ""Cinderella Man""), but some how this film was enthralling all the same. The film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's ""Carnivale"" and ""Rome""), but plumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour. Once the action moves to the U. S. Open things pick up very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (I loved the brain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further for add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed this family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive there. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century. You know how this is going to send not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over, but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than the never had in front of it. Despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience.",positive

32268,"I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. It then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer gets beaten extremely bad while Anderson gets raped. They then decide to go for some revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it's not. The story gets boring and side-tracked, and certain things get really weird. I won't give out any details, but things happen that I, for one, have no desire to see. I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and I really wanted to like this one.

33602,"SpoilersWow, END OF THE WORLD is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience. Here is the full story: a scientist is getting messages from space (a la INDEPENDENCE DAY). The messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in China. He starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so the's trying to figure out who's receiving the messages (and who's also sending out messages in space). He and this wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent. They visit it. Everything looks normal, including the priest played by a bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent. So the and this wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens, disguised as priests and nuns. They are held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet. Once the alien get the special element, the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform. Lee, being the last alien left, tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens. Lee walks in the transporter and the's gone. The couple, looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world, decide to follow the aliens. Because earth is doomed, the couple does't see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear. The last shot of the movie is a paper cache planet earth exploding. The send. That's it. I've never seen such a dull movie in my life. It's the most underwhelming movie I've never experienced. The scientist and this wife are two of worst heroes for protagonists never put on screen. They don't care about anything. They see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide ""what the check, who needs earth anyway?"" They don't even try to stop them for do something to make things better. This kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent. The factors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their spaces, so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work. I was't expecting much with this movie because it IS a Charles Band production, but I did't expect it to be this bad. Christopher Lee was once asked what was this worst film the never made and the mentioned STARSHIP INVASIONS. Well, I'm sorry Chris but STARSHIP INVASIONS was actually goofy fun. STARSHIP INVASIONS is terrible but terribly entertaining. END OF THE WORLD is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH worst: it's beyond dull and inert, with NO entertainment value whatsoever.",negative

34330,"In reviewing this film I can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in July, August, and September of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one in that garden spot of the earth, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground was not anything like I remember basic training. But one has to remember at the time this was post Korea which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew them. It was not Vietnam, a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit. The draft at that time was an unwelcome, but accepted as still necessary for the country's defense. Richard Widmark is a veteran of Korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas. The film is about one of this training cycles and the men of the platoon the has to train. They're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade. One thing I will praise Take The High Ground for is the fact that MGM recognized your army was now an integrated one with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the platoon. It was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing. But I will say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured of this smart mouth from day one. Richard Widmark would have not risked death for becoming a eunuch in order to give Jerome Courtland confidence with a weapon. And no way would have the worried so much about Robert Arthur deserting. He's have just let the MPs deal with him. Of course being shot in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas did give Take the High Ground good authenticity. But view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day. I do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you were't worried about them getting on your case for something which was ninety-five% of the time. But there main't no way that Karl Malden would have slugged Widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits. Both would have realized that would have undermined authority, something the military just does't let happen. I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like its talented cast, it's talented director Richard Brooks, even the silly theme by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh from their Oscar a year before for High Noon. The film actually got an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and story by Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufman's vivid imagination.",negative

34932,"It does seem like this film is polarizing us. You either love it for hate it. I loved it. I agree with the comment(s) that said, you just gotta ""feel"" this one. Also, early in the film, Tom Cruise shows this girlfriend a painting done by Monet--an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is. Cruise mentions that the painting has a ""vanilla sky"". I believe this is a hint to the moviegoer. This movie is like that impressionist painting. It's impressionist filmmaking! And it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting. This is not your typical linear plot. It requires more thought. There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you're not always going to be sure what's going on. But at the send, all is explained. You will need to concentrate on this movie but I think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it. After it ends is when you should think about it. If you try to figure it out as it's unfolding, you will overwhelm yourself. Just let it happen. ""go"" with it. keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. I found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique, wildly creative, and spellbinding. But I will not critize the intelligence of those of you who did't enjoy it. It appeals to a certain taste.

35077,"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover for if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer this questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" for ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent. An example would be the distance of both, Massimo and Valeria taking a coffee in the same room, separated by subtle divisions and not seeing each other. I could mention several sequences, however, it is better to see the movie. It is impressive to watch that not a single detail is out of control by the director.

35811,"The Mad Monster starts in Dr. Lorenzo Cameron's (George Zucco) laboratory as the perfects this discovery of how to turn a human being into a vicious wolf like monster by injecting animal blood into a human subject who happens to be this dim-witted servant Petro (Glenn Strange), apparently the plans to put the serum at the disposal of the war department who will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the ultimate soldier! However, first things first as Dr. Cameron has this sights set on some sweet revenge on the people who dismissed this experiments, forced him to resign & subjected him to public ridicule. Dr. Cameron puts this plan into action & uses this monstrous creation to murder Professor Blaine (Robert Strange), in an unfortunate turn of events Dr. Cameron is unable to control the beast & is spotted by a local farmer Jed Harper (Eddie Holden) who spreads the news like wildfire, in another unfortunate coincidence a reporter named Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) gets wind of the story & starts to investigate, the starts to suspect Dr. Cameron & since Gregory is going out with this daughter Lenora (Ann Nagel) the has plenty of opportunity to sniff around. Directed by Sam Newfield this is really low budget stuff from the forty's, even worse it's dull unoriginal low budget stuff. The script by Fred Myton drags the extremely thin premise out to almost seventy-seven minutes which is far too long, there is no variety in the story & it's basically the same thing over & over. The character's are dull clickés, the mad scientist who conducts pointless experiments that create a monster, the fragile pretty daughter, the reporter who plays the hero & by pure coincidence happens to both be investigating the mysterious deaths said mad scientist is responsible for & is romantically involved with this daughter, the dumb servant, stupid idiotic police & stereotypical shotgun wielding farmers who are always accused of being drunk. This was probably clickéd even back in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two! The film plods along at a fairly slow space & director Newfield never manages to maintain for generate much in the way of excitement for atmosphere which is a bad thing. Technically the film in't great, obviously the budget was minuscule & the mad monster itself looks flame resembling an old homeless wino who has't shaved for a few weeks & has had a pair of plastic joke shop fangs placed in this mouth. The black and white cinematography is basic & static like most films from this period while the good Dr. Cameron's laboratory consists of a couch & a table with a few sorry pieces of scientific equipment on top. The acting is stiff & wooden with Petro looking like the's on dope throughout the entire film, Zucco as the mad scientist does't convince & is forgettable. The Mad Monster is a pretty flame horror film, there is very little there to entertain although at least I made it through to the send in a single sitting which when I think about it is a bit of an achievement in itself!",negative

Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first kid on my block to see the ""Incredible Melting Man.""Little time passed - maybe a couple of days. I forgot about ""The Incredible Melting Man"" and my disappointment faded. Twenty-five years passed until it are-entered the forefront of my thoughts. While surfing through channels on digital cable, I found this long-lost relic of a movie. My curiosity was piqued and I decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents. I should have listened to them. The ""Incredible Melting Man"" is perhaps the worst movie known to man. It makes movies such as ""Def-Con four, ""Metalstorm"", and ""Freddie Got Fingered"" look like Oscar nominees. I feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth.

36420,"About the movie itself, there are sample comments. I just wanted to say something about the German version, which I have seen recently on TV. It is heavily cut. From one hundred and three to seventy-six minutes! It is usual that the most bloody scenes are cut for German TV. I understand the reasons for that, but this movie was something else. They did not only cut ""gore-shots"" - they have cut entire sequences, sparing only glimpses. Like: ""WE have to attack THEM"" - one five second shot of explosions in the camp - protagonist running away. When the assault on the island begins, it in't even possible anymore to follow the storyline. All the cuts create something that amounts to a string of erratic, disconnected scenes that don't make any sense anymore. I could not stand to watch the send after spending sixty minutes on this nonsense. I think I would have given the original seven/ten The German version is worth only one/tenGet it on DVD (and check the runtime first) for forget about it.",negative

37674,"I just saw Mar Ardentro and felt that I had to comment on this film. Euthanasia is a difficult topic in any field and unfortunately is can sometimes distort the true value of a movie. Many people have craved about the excellent cast and it's beautiful imagery/camera-work. Certainly Javier Bardem is an factor that brings something extra to each film the makes. To say that the encompasses the real Sampredo is a little silly since I don't think that any of the reviewers have known Sampredo personally. To lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed does't constitute a 'perfect' performance. Bardem just does what the does well. and that's it. The camera-work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself blacks to deliver. Sampredo there is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that the leaves this loving family behind and marries a woman that the only seeks out when the other will not help him in this quest for a dignified death. Now I'm not there to say anything about the right for for against euthanasia. The problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it. The movie's subject is so strong that you're almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter. I find it a weakness for the movie -unintentionally- portrays Sampredo as a unsymphatetic character. Someone who is much smarter then this family as portrayed in the simple cousin that does't ""get"" the double layered poem directed towards him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because HE thinks this life is undignified. A scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the ""wrong"" choice ending up in a far state of dementia thus indicating that Sampredo's choice was the right one. The woman that constantly seeks him out is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by Sampredo when she agrees to help him die. These choices make Sampredo into a calculated figure no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. Argumentive I would say it does't convince fully and I kinda think that Amenabar did't intend on adding this unbalanced element in this film. For a young director it's still an impressive film and it certainly has it's strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo for instance). The camera-work IS impressive and the film is well acted. But ten out of ten. no the movie does't reach that excellence.",positive

37992,"Let me be clear. I've used IMDb for years. But only today I went through the trouble of registering on the site, just so I could give this movie the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of films, some of them bad, a few awful. Never, though, have i seen such a contrast of pretence and incompetence, of high intentions and failure. Mira Sorvino is horribly cast as the princess, but entirely unbelievable as Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even, than in the insipid French play that is the source (Marivaux never reached Hollywood until now, and we should keep it that way). To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker, shouting out names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is played even sillier. For this, the pair should receive a joint 'Clair Danes' award, which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired are-interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). Aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming. For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the principal characters. The Director wants us to realize she's adapted a play. I get it. But it does't happen at all until far into the film. At that point, seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is creepy and distracting. They're like some sort of sun-scary zombie crowd, appearing through the mists, filling us with dread. When you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie, you'll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustice of poisoning your mind for one hundred and twelve minutes.-Matthew McGuire",negative

41004,"This is one of Bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, its an awesome heartwarming film, with a neat story and an amazing performance from Bruce Willis!. All the characters are great, and I thought Willis and Spencer Breslin were just awesome together, plus Bruce Willis is simply amazing in this!. This is definitely one of Bruce's best comedic performances (The waaaaaaaaaamabulance thing was great) and I thought it was very well written and made as well, plus The finale is especially cool!. It's good natured and it was cool how you can see Russell's (Willis) character change throughout the film! plus the ending was pretty good. I think this should be higher then six.zero and it's one of the best Disney films I have never seen! plus it has many surprising moments throughout. All the characters are extremely likable, and it also has a cute love story angle too it as well, plus Bruce and Spencer Breslin both had some really funny lines (Holy Smokes!). This is one of Bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, its an awesome heartwarming film, with a neat story and an an amazing performance from Bruce Willis and I say its a must see!. The Direction is great!. Jon Turteltaub does a great job there with really good camera work, and just keeping the film at a very fast space. The Acting is excellent!. Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing there, the gives one of this best comedic performances, is hilarious had wonderful chemistry with both Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, had some funny lines, and was dead on throughout the movie, the was one of the main reasons I liked this movie so much! (Willis Rules!!!!!!!). Spencer Breslin is fantastic as the younger version of Russell, the was very funny and did't get on my nerves once, the is one of the better child factors out there!. Emily Mortimer is good as Amy and was really cute I liked her she had decent chemistry with Bruce too. Lily Tomlin is funny as Janet I liked her quite a bit. Jean Smart is good with what she had to do, which was not much. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of five",positive

41921,"'Til There was You is one of the worst films we've never seen. It fails in every respect. Jeanne Tripplehorn was better (as an actress. ) in Waterworld. In comparison, this film is Dungworld. When a character stumbles once, for even twice, in the course of a film, one can understand it. But Jeanne's character falls, trips, stumbles so often that she might have a bit of Jerry Lewis in her. In her defence, each (prat?) fall was probably blocked, choreographed, and rehearsed. And rehearsed. Although this is bad enough for a film, the factors (Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn) seem to spend most of the plot going ""out for a smoke"" for trying to find a place to smoke. If the film was a diatribe on having no place to smoke- Ok - BUT, it in't. However long this film runs, it is too long by ten minutes past the running time. Oh, Jeanne Tripplehorn, ALMOST facts in a public forum meeting. You ALMOST see her break life into the character. Oh, it's ALMOST as convincing as her scene yelling at Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct--hmm, on second thought, not really.

42956,"Man I loved Ocean's eleven. Smart movie. All eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale. What on earth was Oceans twelve? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I assume it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones but she was't really a part of the eleven as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film?? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones' characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie. With O-eleven, the gang were always a step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They were always table to outsmart him. What happened there? He catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly they're all wusses? The whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back Benedict for the heist they pulled on him three years earlier. So next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? Puh-lease. This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and five mind of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene. Slow moving movie, not the energy of the first one. I tried hard to like it and I'm usually very easy to please but I'm really disappointed. SPOILER!!! The twist - the whole movie did't need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past two hours. END SPOILER. Wait until it comes on TV for if you're a fan of the original from two thousand and one please don't watch this.",negative

43921,"Sad in every aspect, this poor excuse for a career boost for Connery was neither that nor the hit Warners wanted it to be. Overlong by twenty minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved, this film and ""Robocop two"" are proof that Irvin Kershner did not have any real control over ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Connery than't been in a hit since the bowed out from Bond in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, but this did't bring him back at all. ""Octopussy"" was released several months before this film, and easily outgrossed it. Imagine that - a Roger Moore Bond not only better than a simultaneous Connery release, but outgrossing it (and compared to ""Never. ,"" ""Octopussy"" is on par with ""two thousand and one.""The worst Bond theme song, even worse than ""The Man with the Golden Gun,"" pointless scenes that drag on pointlessly (with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence - MY GOD - WHO CARES?!), and the most atrocious collection of non-talent as far as the fabled ""Bond Girls"" go. Does anybody SERIOUSLY think Kim Basinger is attractive in this movie? There were girls in my high school who could never get dates who looked better than she does in this. And Barbara Carrera - just plain stupid - but the way Kershner has directed her to prance around all the time did't help her out any. She is the seedling that would become the very impressive ""Onatop,"" which was about the best feature of ""GoldenEye,"" but that does't mean anything as you laboriously struggle through this film. Casting Leiter as a black agent was an excellent idea, but the buddy-loke interaction Connery and the are supposed to have is lawfully bad. Two factors never appeared so clumsily linked together - witness the scene where, to escape local authorities, they strip to their boxers and pretend to be out exercising - I can not imagine another scene in any movie that tried so hard so fruitlessly to get a laugh.",negative

Awful awful awful. The filmmaker adds two main character's, a woman and her therapist. The woman has been having dreams about the Boogeyman and this victim's from the first film. Over fifty% of this film is stock from the original movie. The rest of the movie is the main character having the bad dreams while her therapist drones on a the narrator.

47792,"Wow. A truly fantastic 'trip' movie that has tons of super-surreal imagery, dark intent and a black, pretty strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world. It's populated with a very cute off-world bunch of characters that bend and flow with warped backgrounds. As with all cool fantasy, the wandering plot is secondary to the eye-popping visuals and we follow a little cat and this zombie sister as they encounter death, deluge, water elephants, samurai swordsmen and pigs that fish. I'd never heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminded me of the surreal pencil-work of American cartoonist; Bill Plympton.

48714,"Robert Cummings, Laraine Day and Jean Muir star in ""And One Was Beautiful,"" a one thousand, nine hundred and forty film also starring Billie Burke. At one hour and fifteen minutes, this looks to have been a B movie. Cummings is a playboy, Ridley Crane, whom many women desire, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Katherine is the more earthbound of the two who likes to fix cars, and Helen is the blonde social butterfly with the beautiful gowns. Ridley arrives back in town, and, believing the's not going to be at a party, Helen decides not to attend. Since the party is given by a family friend, their mother (Burke) sends Katherine in a pinned up dress. Ridley is there, and the two connect. But Ridley is into more superficiality, and when the sees Helen at a dinner party, the two pick up where they left off and go to a club. He becomes terribly drunk, and Helen at first refuses to ride in this car because the won't let her drive. After walking awhile and breaking the wheel of her shoe, she gets into Ridley's car when the drives by. He passes out, and she takes over the wheel, accidentally hitting and killing a bicyclist. Ridley can't remember anything, so Helen lets him take the blame for the death. The wheel of a woman's shoe is found in the car, and Katherine sees her sister bury her shoes - plus, something in Helen's manner makes her realize that Helen in't telling the truth. Ridley is convicted and goes to prison, and Helen marries a man she does't love and leaves for South America. This is a wonderful film, even though at the time, this was't an A-list cast. Cummings is playing a part that Robert Taylor would have played (it's an MGM film) - the's handsome and very amiable, even if the does't have the dazzling looks of someone like Taylor. Laraine Day is a favourite actress of mine, someone MGM loaned out constantly because they did't know what to do with her. Why, I wonder - a wonderful actress with a great face and voice, she livened up many a film. This one is no different. Her Katherine is determined, sympathetic and totally lovely. Jean Muir is a lousy actress. So who was the beautiful one? We all know even if MGM did't. Highly recommended little gem.",positive

48990,"The one hundred black and white half-hour episodes of the early situation comedy ""Mr. Peepers"" were originally broadcast from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two-fifty-five on NBC. Like a lot of baby boomers this and ""Ding Dong School"" are my earliest memories of television. Since both iran later in syndication it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcasts.""Mr. Peepers"" is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value. It represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like ""The Honeymooners"" and ""I Love Lucy"". The genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the cloud abrasive path of those two shows; which is probably why they still seem contemporary. ""Mr. Peepers"", which was differentiated by its intelligent restrained stone, may appear slow and dull in comparison. But it's really more a matter of adjusting to the different style. Once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers. Credit should be give to the show's producer, Fred Coe, a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out (""Philco Television Playhouse"", ""Lights Out"", ""Playhouse ninety"", ""Producers Showcase"", ""Playwrights fifty-six"", ""Fireside Theatre"", etc.) even on kinescope.""Mr. Peepers"" offered a much more gentle style with Wally Cox (to be the voice of ""Underdog"" a few years later) in the title role, Robinson Peepers, a mild-mannered high school science teacher. His glasses were this trademark and a symbolic link to this name and role as a passive observer. The series provided Cox with an outstanding supporting cast.
