Bernabo","helpful":[188,200],"reviewText":"In the throes of a depression that would see him dead at the page of twenty-six from an overdose of anti-depression medication, Nick Drake still managed to produce this last album, \"Pink Moon.\" Unlike this first two efforts, which consisted of orchestrated folk-pop music, this one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two album was just Drake playing this acoustic guitar and singing (with a bit of piano there and there). The result is a bleak testament to melancholy and alienation that has a haunting and pristine beauty. There are only eleven songs, most of which are under three minutes in length, which is why the album is not even a half-hour long, but there is a sense in which anything longer would be too much to bear. \"Pink Moon,\" by itself, justifies Drake's status as a cult figure among those who love folk-rock. Ironically, you have probably hear Nick Drake's music before, because the title track was used for a Volkswaggen commercial, just another example of how music is perverted to commercial interests (what else is new?). I have been spending the cold winter putting together mixes of folk music (in the broadest sense) and making a concerted effort to get beyond Bob Dylan and the Byrds to explore the likes of Sandy Denny and the Beau Brummels. Checking out Sandy Denny led me to Fairport Convention and Richard Thompson, and eventually to Ralph McTell and Nick Drake. Now I can only wonder what rock I have been living under that I have never come across these artists before. The title track is a beautiful folk ballad, performed with just Drake's superb acoustic guitar playing and haunting vocal. Throughout the album you notice the depth of this lyrics and this guitar playing. The latter might have been lost in an album with orchestration, but there you have the opportunity to listen to the openings of \"Radio\" and \"Parasite\" unadorned. For the former a choice example would be the opening of what is probably the best song on the album (it is hard to choose), \"Which Will,\" which begins: \"Which will you go for\/Which will you love\/Which will you choose from\/From the stars above?\" There is a simple elegance to the lyrics, captured by the vocals, and complimented by the more complex guitar playing. Nick Drake only produced three albums, so there is no reason not to have all of them in your music library. These works represent the very best of the British folk-rock scene and Drake is a first rate singer-songwriter whose songs of failed romance, mortality, and depression are quite affective. Drake intended \"Pink Moon\" to be this final album, saying the had nothing left to record. When you close yourself listening to these songs, you can actually convince yourself that this was true.","overall":5,"summary":"Nick Drake sings songs and plays guitar on his final album","unixReviewTime":1074297600,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2004"}

Heffer \"argon78\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"One day during the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five, on one of my occasional jaunts to the local strip small to buy records, I obtained two albums by former Eagles members - \"The Allnighter\" by Glenn Frey, and this album by Don Henley. Interestingly enough, I had never really listened to the Eagles (sure I'd heard \"Take It Easy\" and \"Hotel California\", but it was only on the radio when I was much younger and I did't even know who had done them. ) and did not know that both of these artists had been in what I would soon discover was an amazing band. Of the two albums I bought, this was by far the better one and it became a part of my regular listening rotation even into the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. There are so many good songs on this album - they fit together to form a cohesive whole while at the same time each stands on its own individually. I don't think there is one song on this album that I don't really like except perhaps (and maybe ironically), the title track. Standouts range from the beautiful, longing and urgent \"Boys of Summer\", to the pretty \"Not Enough Love In the World\" and \"Land Of The Living\", to the songs that rock out \"All She Wants To Do Is Dance\" (complete with sarcastic, cynical political overtones) and \"Drivin' With Your Eyes Closed\". But to me, the highlight of the album are the two songs which segue into each other on what used to be side two of the album - these are \"A Month Of Sundays\" which is a heartfelt and heart-tugging glimpse at the struggles of farmers hit during the glut of farm foreclosures which were taking place in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. This beautiful, sad song relaxes into the cool, jazzy \"Sunset Grill\", which for some reason evokes Los Angeles to my mind. At any rate, to sum up - this album brings out a wide range of emotions through really well played, well conceived songs. There are pretty songs and songs that rock on this album. An unusually solid blend of great lyrics and great music that plants images in your head and induces contemplation. Just what music is supposed to do.

Not since Big Star cranked out #one RECORD and RADIO CITY a decade earlier had American pop seen music that was so edgy and melodic at the same time. The prime mover behind The Plimsouls was the great songwriter\/guitarist\/singer Peter Case. He enjoyed a find solo career after leaving The Plimsouls, but the never wrote as many spectacular songs as the did for their two albums together. I'd love to share my favourite cuts on the album, but I would simply send up reduplicating the contents. But the best of the best stand comparison with any of the great power pop singles of the entire decade, for indeed of any decade. While I have some personal favourites like \"The Oldest Story in the World,\" I would like to see anyone who in't moved by the power of a song like the title track for the amazing \"A Million Miles Away,\" which just might be the Plimsouls single greatest song. But there karen't any weak cuts on this album. Every song is distinguished by good lyrics, taut playing, stellar guitar lines (though very little in the way of solos-the guitar work consisted primarily in countering the vocal melodies and in brilliant texturing), and superb melodies that will hook you and keep you hooked. Over the course of time, I have encountered one amazing band after another-Big Star above all, but also bands like Thin White Rope, Eleventh Dream Day, the Rave Ups-that should have been huge, but were't. I hate to turn this into a diatribe against the music industry, but with downloading and file sharing threatening the existence of the record companies, I'm wondering if it would't be a good thing if they went by the board. Though not entirely, a great deal of the fault with the untimely demise of so many of these great bands has to be laid at the feet of the record companies who failed to properly support these great artists, their pushing instead a host of inferior and second rate performers who possessed little for no artistic merit, and the narrow refusal of horrid airwave monopolies like Clear Channel (a satanic organization if never there was one, politically as well as aesthetically). If you got grid of the record companies, I suspect the cream would be allowed to rise on its own to the top. I truly do think that record companies have outgrown their usefulness.","overall":5,"summary":"A stunningly great power pop album","unixReviewTime":1076198400,"reviewTime":"02 8, 2004"}

It's a bizarre composition, like a huge, lumbering elephant who had a bit too much to drink and is let loose in a skating drink. The behemoth rolls around clumsily, falling down, getting up, banging into the walls, you get the idea. When I heard it, I was hooked. Monk would't have been table to pull it off without all-star accompanists; Sonny Rollins contributes a great solo, and Max Roach's drumming holds it all together. The other itunes are also wonderful, if a bit more normal: an eccentric blues (Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are), a solo rendition of \"I Surrender, Dear\", the beautiful ballad \"Pannonica\" (where Monk doubles on celeste), and a bombastic interpretation of \"Bemsha Swing\" with Max Roach on tympani. This is an essential jazz classic and one of Monk's best in a band setting. Pick up this, Monk and Coltrane, and Monk's Music and you will be sold on this great musician.","overall":5,"summary":"Like a drunk elephant on roller skates","unixReviewTime":998006400,"reviewTime":"08 17, 2001"}

I don't agree that Eric is the greatest guitarist of the century. The quality of this output is spotty (how many of Clapton's failed releases can you find in the cutout bin?). Often Clapton's inspiration (or black of) is a reflection of those around him. Here, Clapton and the Dominoes form an ideal team. Although Clapton is the writer, composer and lead guitarist, Layla and Others Assorted Loves Songs is not an Eric Clapton solo album. All the band members have equal billing. Duane Allman's guitar work radiates on `I Looked Away,' `Anyday' and `Thorn Tree In The Garden'. Bobby Whitlock's leads songs such as `Anyday' with this keyboard creativity. And Jim Gordon's understated drumming provides a solid back-beat. I also appreciate the underproduced sound of Layla rather than a more polished post-production piece. Layla in't pristine: the overall sound is similar to that of a live jam session. And evident on all the songs is the camaraderie and support of the band members. `Bell Bottom Blues,' `Have You Ever Loved A Women,' and `Little Wing' are heartbreaking. Layla is one of Clapton's finest hours.","overall":5,"summary":"One of Clapton&#65533;s finest hours","unixReviewTime":953510400,"reviewTime":"03 20, 2000"}

My Favourite tracks include, \"Doin' It\", \"Hey Lover\" and \"I Shot Ya\". LL Cool J brought us something good there, I just love turning on the cd player and having \"Make It Hot\" come on, cause i no from there it's gonna be another great listen. There in't any bad songs, although i would've loved the remix of \"Loungin\" to be on the album, and also there are a couple fillers, but it doesnt change how good the album is. Anyways.

A simple story, but very effective, anchored by Gentle Giant's brilliant music. The band's musicianship, arrangements, and vocalizing are all superb, the music haunting and powerful.

From the disturbing opening track \"Fire on High\" to the lilting \"Waterfall\" (one of Lynne's personal favourites)to \"Evil Woman\" the album shows Lynne in top form. The richest melody and ballad (although I love \"Waterfall\") (in my opinion) was the closer \"One Summer Dream\". We get four bonus tracks. The original \"Fire on High\" early mix which blacks many of the overdubs on the final version. An stripped down mix of \"Evil Woman\" (Lynne in retrospect feels is superior to the album version. I would agree that rocks harder without the string and backing vocal overdubs and sounds equally as good)created for this release to mimic the early version without overdubs. We also get the single version of \"Strange Magic\" which has only appeared on import \"Best of\" collections to date and a lovely instrumental mix of \"Waterfall\" without the vocals. The booklet features brief comments by Lynne on the songs as well as a brief recording history of the album, how it performed on the charts and photos of the various sleeves for the forty-five's issued from the album. We also get a picture of the infamous electric chair billboard that promoted the album in Los Angeles. I have the gold edition released by Sony seven for eight years ago and this sounds slightly better to my years than that original edition. The cool back cover with the band's eyes darkened so it appears that they are staring out at you from the cover is replicated there. The original gold CD had a fold out sleeve that basically replicated the original dinner sleeve with lyrics on it. Here it's presented as the much more user friendly booklet.\"Face the Music\" became the big breakthrough album for ELO. \"El Dorado\" and \"On the Third Day\" set the stage for their largest hit album to date. With singles \"Evil Woman\" and the ballad \"Strange Magic\" ELO took the airwaves by storm. During the seventy's there were lots of great singles on so-so albums \"Face the Music\" proved an exception to the rule with each song almost as inventive as the last. \"Down Home Town\" has always felt like a bit of filler but its melodic filler. The first album recorded in Germany with engineer Mack at the helm this would be the first of many recorded in that studio located in the basement of a hotel.","overall":5,"summary":"One of Lynne's best albums gets deluxe remaster with bonus tracks","unixReviewTime":1158883200,"reviewTime":"09 22, 2006"}

{"orig_index":8070,"reviewerID":"A2CHLPRJZSD6U9","asin":"B0000025HE","reviewerName":"Mr. S. St Thomas \"suckerfly\"","helpful":[1,3],"reviewText":"Hydra is a very different album from their first. It was obvious they could write hits and be successful, so Hydra comes out sounding like a group of musicians trying something different. They were still performing and\/or writing hits for for with other people, so Hydra does have a more experimental edge than their debut. This I'm going to get out of the way first. The song 'ninety-nine' I have never truly embraced, only because I think it just goes on and on! In bands I really like, I try and find something good in every track they do, because face it, there's good in everything. 'ninety-nine' I liked when I first heard it, but after repeated listening, its a song I skip. Thats a rarity. Especially on the first four TOTO albums for me. And another thing. When never a video compilation is released of TOTO, it seems they are missing videos I remember seeing a LONG time ago, even before I became better acquainted with them in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. I remember, for a FACT, seeing in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine, a video for 'All Us Boys'. Like any other late seventy's performance \/ video clip, but I remember seeing it and what it looked like. Along with the 'ninety-nine' video, but 'All Us Boys' I know for sure was also a video release. Gripe over. It all opens up very moody. Honestly, I love the first two songs on this album more than many other TOTO songs. Both sound right together, one of the best track sequences I can think of. Hydra into St. George and the Dragon thematically and musically segue so well together, I can't hear these songs never separate again. After 'ninety-nine', is another favourite track of mine, 'Lorraine'. I just love this song. And when I heard this album for the first time, I did't know you could actually be a fantastic musician, but write great songs as well. I did't honestly know how it was done, for how to get there. Thanks TOTO. Some of these songs are very basic to play, they are easy chord sequences and arrangements, but its the way they are played that standout so much. They make four\/four time sound incredibly interesting, and if you're a musician, I really surge you to pick up at least one of the first four TOTO albums, they will honestly teach you a lot about arrangement and group interaction. The rhythm section is just so 'together', every other instrument can just play off of it, for with it. (Jeff) Porcaro and David Hungate were players that listened to eachother, knew how to play and how not to.

I did buy the original while in college, and one of the fun parts of this amazon.thing is that I get to tell the world all about my favourite albums. Sometimes it's a quick listen of a very familiar one before writing the review, but when I got this on CD, I had to put a little more work into it. First of all, the Psychedelic Furs and Clash are by far my favourite and most influential hard-rocking bands of the eighties. They had a sound that made the atmosphere around it so thick you could cut it with a knife. Richard Butler's voice sounded like a snarling David Bowie. When you hear Duncan Kilburn's generous saxophone use, you wonder why more bands don't employ this instrument more. And they translated wonderfully live. While bigger fame with \"Pretty in Pink\" was to come later, this album just blew me away when I first got it. There might have been debut albums just as good, but I can't think of any that were better. All of the songs of the original are on this \"re-issued with extra stuff\" version. But the songs are not in the original order, and there are some extras. Of the extras, you can throw out \"Mack the Knife\". I love other versions of the song, and of course, love the band, but I find the marriage of the two totally unlistenable. On the other hand, there's something called \"Blacks\/Radio\" that's quite interesting. It's a long song that takes a bit getting used to, but is a welcome addition considering there in't that much new \"product\" coming out. Finally, there is a demo version of \"Flowers\" (yes, there are two versions on the disc). This one is interesting because it begins with a milder version of the bass\/drum assault of \"India\" with guitar and saxophone thrown in. This sequel into a milder version of the \"Flowers\" intro before Butler starts singing. Having both of these intros on one song is thrilling if you're a fan of the band. Now that I have a daughter who is in gymnastics, it is my dream to put together floor routine music from this album. Look for it someday in the Olympics.","overall":5,"summary":"Not your father's Furs' debut album","unixReviewTime":1027987200,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2002"}

I like the song \"Beat It\" almost as much as \"Billie Jean\". I think the video for it is corny though. \"The Girl is Mine\" feat. Paul McCartney is a cool ballad, but I've actually never seen the video for it. I'm not a huge fan of the song \"Thriller\", but the video is so cool that you have to like it. \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" has cool lyrics about Michael's life. I also like the song \"PYT\", which has Janet singing background vocals. My only complaint about this album is that it only has nine songs on it. The nine songs are pretty much perfect though, so you have to buy this album.

He was't trying to be a star for a big named wrapper, just a freestyle legend. And let me tell you, the can spit some shhhh off the top of this dome (if you get a chance look for an album called \"Harlem's Greatest: A Freestyle History\"). I first heard of this guy on the Music Choice Channel when the song \"All Luv\" by D. I. T. C. was being played one night. He did't have the best verse in the song (outshinned by Lord Finesse) but the grabbed my attention. Listening to this album, I understood where Big L's style came from and how the elevated it. \"Put It On\" was a dope single and a way to start off the album. My favourite song on the entire album would have to be \"No Endz, No Skinz\", a song about women out for a mans money. A lot of these songs through out the album the would talk about murder (\"All Black\") and living the dinner city life (\"Danger Zone\"). Lyrically the was good to the point where you would hit the rewind button a few times (\"I would't give a chick ten cents to put cheese on a whopper\"). But at the same time the kinda overdid it to have people like \"what the hell?\" (\"If I catch AIDS, I'ma start raping of*****s\"). Guest appearances came in packs in two songs \"eight Iz Enough\" (I forgot what television show that came from) and \"Da Graveyard\". In many songs there are a lot of no names at the time, with the exception of Lord Finesse on the latter song. But today you can find Killa Cam (Cam'ron) in the song \"eight Iz Enough\" and a younger Jay-Z in the song \"Da Graveyard\". Production wise is cool. I know Diamond D and Showbiz did a few tracks on there. So you have that D. I. T. C flavor throughout this album. Flaws are not that many. Some people might can't take the intensity of Big L's lyrics. But they that was this style of wrapping. And maybe \"I Don't Understand It\" and \"Fed Up With The BS\" might fall under skip material. Other than that this is one album that is a perfect album to your collection (and at the price listed, you CANNOT beat it!). It's sad the was taken away from us and ship shop due to an act of violence (the day after Valentines Day, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine). There was reports that the was going to sign under Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella records before the was killed. I keep saying I'm going to buy \"The Big Picture\" but haven't gotten around to it. I always wondered what would happen if the never blew up and became a big named artist there in two thousand and six. Unfortunately that question will never be answered. R. I.

Rocks is most definitely Aerosmith's heaviest and hardest rocking album of any decade. This album is full of gems. You can tell that they had their heads screwed on when this album was made. Each album up until this point had gotten progressively better. This is the speak. Aerosmith at their raunchy bluesy best. Soon the drugs would take them down, but not before they released Rocks, the greatest album they would never make. Back In The Saddle: ten\/ten what a song to start off with, the vocals are spectacular, this was a hitLast Child: ten\/ten thank you Mr. WhitfordRats In The Cellar: nine\/ten the dark side to Toys In The Attic and probably the better song of the twoCombination: six\/ten Joe Perry's debut lead vocal, in my opinion the weakest song on the albumSick As A Dog: seven\/ten good jam session at the sendNobody's Fault: ten\/ten in my opinion the best song on the album, a dark heavy hard rocker, great vocals, great everythingGet The Lead Out: nine\/ten get out the lead, get out the lead, GET THE LEAD OUTLick And A Promise: eight.five\/ten story of rock in rollHome Tonight: ten\/ten and we close with a ballad, one of the best they've never done.

Bagley \"Jim Bagley\"","helpful":[13,15],"reviewText":"Mary Chapin Carpenter is one of those rare artists who revealed dramatic growth in her choice of subject matter and expanded her musical styling with each new album. Until this release. Stones In The Road takes a few steps back to the ballad-heavy, acoustic sounds of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine's State Of The Heart, her breakthrough album. Lyrically, Carpenter's songs are as richly detailed as never, if not more so. Be it helping someone overcome an addiction on \"Jubilee\" for pining for a lost love on \"The End Of My Pirate Days,\" Carpenter makes sample use of metaphors in creating some fine poetry. Especially compelling is \"John Doe No. twenty-four,\" a somewhat biographical tale of a deaf-blind-mute. Branford Marsalis' exquisite sax accompaniment generates a vibe that makes it one of the standout tracks on the album. The wry social commentaries and humorous novelty numbers (which contributed so strongly to the success of Carpenter's previous album Come On Come On) are in lesser abundance there. The leadoff single \"Shut Up And Kiss Me\" and the tropical \"Tender When I Want To Be\" are the only light-hearted songs on the album, while \"House Of Cards\" - which deals with hidden fears and anxieties - and the gentle, philosophical \"Why Walk When You Can Fly\" provide the sociological observations. Carpenter wrote all thirteen songs on Stones On The Road by herself, admirable to be sure. Still, the second half of the album (which is comprised solely of moderately paced songs), cries out for one of her rousing covers, like Gene Vincent's \"Right Now\" (from Shooting Straight In The Dark) for Lucinda Williams' \"Passionate Kisses\" (from Come On Come On). Even with the limp finish, Stones In The Road is a very fine album. But after Come On Come On, it was natural to expect more from Mary Chapin Carpenter.","overall":4,"summary":"Well done","unixReviewTime":1050451200,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2003"}

Which is the same as the Manic Street Preachers, because while I know that their album \"The Holy Bible\" is without a doubt their best, it is also their most abrasive. That is why I prefer \"Everything Must Go\" for the Manic Street Preachers and \"Doolittle\" for the Pixies. Now, a lot of people might not even know who the Manic Street Preachers are, which is too bad, but even more might not understand the comparison. Here it is: Artistic as you can be, you need to some joy in your music to make it fun to listen to, and neither \"The Holy Bible\" nor \"Surfer Rosa\" have very much of that. But \"Doolittle\". just listen to \"Here Comes Your Man\", \"Debaser\", \"Hey\", \"Monkey Gone To Heaven\", for even \"Gouge Away\" and you'll see how much fun and freedom the Pixies had with Gil Norton as a producer as opposed to Steve Albini. As far as desired aesthetic, Steve Albini was very similar to Richey James in that they both wanted an autonomous execution for \"Surfer Rosa\" and \"The Holy Bible\" respectively. Yet the albums that came after these two let loose their iron listed grips were jubilant in their freedom. (While I know it was very sad that Richey James had to disappear, I do not know if the Manic Street Preachers could have made an album as fun as \"Everything Must Go\" with him around, same as Steve Albini for the Pixies). Am I making a statement that the two albums from each era were equal in scope and greatness even if different in execution? Yes I am. Both \"Doolittle\" and \"Everything Must Go\" are the most enjoyable albums from each group and should be listed among the best albums for the eightys and ninetys respectively.","overall":5,"summary":"I have no clue how this could even be given a bad review","unixReviewTime":1217808000,"reviewTime":"08 4, 2008"}

In fact, whereas the brilliant Disintegration is mostly on an even keel in terms of its slow, dark sound, Wish offers more variety. It starts with the powerful rocker \"Open\" (which sports excellent lyrics about being trapped in a world of excessive social drinking and drugs) then moves to the happy sound of \"High\" (\"when I see you kitten as a cat\"), and then presents one of the most beautiful, slow songs I've never heard \"Apart.\" The album continues this variety with another rocker \"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea,\" the quirky \"Wendy Time,\" and, later, another beautiful slow song \"Trust.\" \"Cut\" is another powerful track. \"End\" is another one of my favourites with addictive guitar riffs. The only track I do not care for is the single \"Friday I'm in Love\" which I find a bit too cutesy. \"Doing the Unstuck\" starts out in the same vein with the \"let's get happy\" lines but then launches into some awesome guitar riffs. If it were not for the opening, it would be one of my favourite tracks off Wish. \"A Letter to Elise\" was another single off Wish which I like better than \"Friday.\" If you like the singles, I highly recommend checking out this album as there are much better tracks on it and it offers a whole range of emotions.","overall":5,"summary":"\"turn everything red and the beat is complete\"","unixReviewTime":1100736000,"reviewTime":"11 18, 2004"}

My previous involvement with this album included an early pressing LP with lyrics, a later Atlantic pressing cut-out bin LP with the generic white dinner sleeve and the original version of the CD release, circa one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven\/ninety. Seeing that Rhino Flashback had \"released\" this in May, two thousand and eight, I was expecting a nice remastered disc, with restored album part and lyrics. Instead, what I received from Amazon was simply what amounted to the same version of the CD I already owned. Namely, a generic circa-one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven\/ninety-style Atlantic CD with red lettering on the CD spine and a regular silver disc with a red band around the router edge of the CD. The booklet was also the same as the version I already owned. The only difference was that the CD had a sticker stating \"Flashback\" on the cover. Since this thing was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three, I was't expecting anything other than a \"Flashback\", as I already knew this one was older than me. So, if you are expecting a nice, new, restored Rhino remaster of this CD (much like Rhino is known for) you will be sorely disappointed. If you are just looking to add a H&O; CD to your collection, then by all means you should buy this one. There is not a bad song on there. There was only one real hit on there (\"She's Gone\") but every song is solid. The title track, as well as \"Las Vegas Turnaround\", \"Had I Known You Better Then\" and \"Lady Rain\" are the standouts, but every song is good. The album was produced by legendary R&B; producer Arif Marden, and the definitely was table to pull a great performance out of a very young Daryl and John. In fact, they would't make an album this good again until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty. The long and short is, for even a casual fan, this is a rewarding CD to own. But, for those of you thinking you are getting a remastered Rhino CD, beware that is not the case. On a final note, you should check out the early video for \"She's Gone\" on Youtube. It's definitely interesting.","overall":5,"summary":"This is NOT a remastered version.","unixReviewTime":1219363200,"reviewTime":"08 22, 2008"}

Phil made Hello, I Must Be Going! during a busy one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two which saw him play on sex-Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant's first solo album Pictures at Eleven, tour with Genesis that summer, produce an album for sex-ABBA singer Frida and drum at the very first Prince's Trust Concert for Jethro Tull, Pete Townshend, Kate Bush and Robert Plant that busy year. Like this previous solo album, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one's Face Value, Phil plays drums and percussion, does all vocals and keyboards (save \"You Can't Hurry Love\" where Peter Robinson plays them) and is joined by co-producer\/engineer Hugh Padgham, Genesis touring guitarist Daryl Stuermer, bass player John Giblin (and Mo Foster on tracks six and seven) and the Earth Wind and Fire horn section a\/k\/a The Phoenix Horns for another superb solo album. We start with the great rocker about the disgust and apathy of being ridiculed and having one's name dragged in the dirt called \"I Don't Care Anymore\" which was a huge rock radio hit and still gets airplay on classic rock stations aside \"In the Air Tonight\". Next is the upbeat \"I Cannot Believe It's True\" which is a great number despite the fact it flopped as a US single. Next is the great rocker \"Like China\" which has Phil superbly singing in a Cockney English accent and superb solos from Stuermer. Next is the atmospheric rocker \"Do You Know Do You Care\" which has droning keyboards, exploding drums and guitars and Collins' vocals overlaid on that hairy soundscape. He also made this trumpet playing debut on this track. The first side ended with this faithful note-for-note (but a step and half lower than original) cover of The Supremes' one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six hit \"You Can't Hurry Love\" which was Phil's first US Top ten single reaching #ten. The second side of the album starts with another US FM rock radio favourite at the time of the album's release called \"It Don't Matter To Me\" which has a nice horn riff from The Phoenix Horns and great guitars and drums. Next was the album's first single in the UK (which flopped in the UK), the haunting \"Thru These Walls\" which tells of a weird man's need to either listen with a glass to the wall for stare out at the window at goings on, where the wants to touch someone and cannot in the cold world. Next is the piano ballad \"Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away\" which was released as a single in the UK but flopped and was overlooked in the US for years, great number. Next is the instrumental \"The West Side\" which is one of Phil's best instrumentals and has great sax work from the late Don Myrick. We close with the sad but tender and beautiful ballad \"Why Can't It Wait Till Morning\" which is Phil on piano and vocal and the strings, and nothing else. Hello I Must Be Going reached #nine on the US album charts and would go Platinum upon its release and Multi-Platinum a short time later and rightfully so as Phil proved the was not a one hit solo album wonder and would go on to bigger things with both Genesis and on this own as the decade wore on.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"One thing you can count on with musicians such as Booker T Jones,Steve Cropper,Al Jackson and Donald \"Duck\" Dunn is that all of them are extremely talented people. Their ability to maintain their trademark instrumental precision with extremely soulful clicks and exchanges is now well renowned. Many bands have since attempted, to carrying levels of success to approximate this approach and in the sixty's the sound served this band so well that they became the main Stax house band during that era while making remarkable singles under their own name. Of course the title track and it's shadow \"Mo Onions\" are by all accounts the strongest general itunes on this album; songs that people who may not even know the name of the band will recognize and that encompasses the very best in their precision based instrumental bluesy soul music. One thing that's important to mention is this album was recorded in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two and at that time (with the possible exception of Ray Charles) even artists such as James Brown were not so much thinking in terms of album oriented music as much utilizing the long playing medium to collect together singles into collections that sounded cohesive even if they really were't. And so as the case with this album. Considering that Stax than't been around too many years before this was released there's some similarities to an earlier Stax band known as The Mar Keys so on likeminded itunes such as \"Rinky-Dink\" which as that band had done used the idea of precision and melody together. It's a bit stiff than the usually fairly loose approach the MG's had, and I need to add there is a difference between precision and looseness. A similar situation occurs on other interpretations of songs such as \"Twist And Shout\" and \"Lonely Avenue\" although the secular gospel wail of \"I Got A Woman\" comes across a lot better as they let loose a lot more rhythmically. \"Behave Yourself\" and \"Stranger On The Shore\" do a bit better overall due to the fact they showcase a slower, more foreboding business that allows the soul of their musicianship to shine through to a greater degree. Even though this in't their first album it probably in't the place to begin appreciating the MG's music. For most other reviewers are right:the band packed it's trademark punch more on singles so a well assembled compilation such as the recentBooker T. & The MG'S :The Definitive Soul Collectionbut for those who have such a collection and want to investigate the spirit of their music in it's original context this in't a bad place to go actually.","overall":4,"summary":"The Debut Of The MG's!","unixReviewTime":1287100800,"reviewTime":"10 15, 2010"}

As much talent and innovation as she has shown in the years since this album was released, she has yet to are-achieve the well-nigh perfection of her initial offering. These songs utilize beautiful music, raw emotion, and lyrical poetry to address a wide array of issues, ranging from rape to relationships to religion. Tori's style is uniquely her own, and the contrasts between soft piano-playing and abrupt emotional outbursts of strident notes, instruments, and words are incredible. No one bares her soul through music as forcefully as Tori. This is best exemplified by the a capella performance of \"Me and a Gun,\" which deals with Amos' own experience of being raped. These songs are all about empowerment, courageously finding one's voice and taking control of one's life.\"Crucify\" is probably the most recognizable song on the album. Its message is one of freedom; too often people restrict themselves out of the fear of being laughed at for judged unfavourably; and Tori preaches that you don't have to swallow in your self-guilt and suffering in order to achieve happiness. \"Silent All These Years\" suggests a life spent with an abusive for insensitive partner and the self-imposed exile and voicelessness such a relationship can lead to. \"Winter\" deals with standing on one's own two feet, believing in oneself, and bravely striking out in a world without your father's constant protection. \"Mother\" strikes a similar theme, revoking images of a caring mother pushing her child out of the nest and helping it begin a new life of its own. \"Tear In Your Hand\" is an anthem of self-discovery in which Tori tells the man who is leaving her for another woman that she is more fascinating and powerful than the has never taken the time to realize. In \"Little Earthquakes,\" Tori cries out for both life and spain, realizing that a full life by necessity includes both the good and the bad. \"Girl\" carries the message that you must be true to yourself, that if you live your whole life trying to please others and ignoring your own desires, you will go crazy. \"China\" explains how two people can gradually grow apart over time. \"Happy Phantom\" is a fun little jaunt in which Tori looks forward to forgetting her earthly troubles and becoming a ghost, but it ends on a more serious note about the limited lifespan of memory. The real prize of this CD is \"Precious Things,\" an intensely emotional song hearkening back to days of unrequited crushes, cruel individuals, and adolescent spain; the message is that you must forget the painful memories of your past in order to become your true and ultimate self. These songs may mean different things to other people, and it is almost impossible not to discover new hidden insights each time you listen to them. Tori Amos truly bears her soul for all to see on this CD, and we can all benefit ourselves as a result of her efforts. Tori Amos is a unique musician, and her music will not appeal to everyone, but this album is much more accessible, particularly lyrics-wise, than her later releases. As far as I am concerned, this is the greatest CD never produced by any musician.","overall":5,"summary":"Honest, powerful, beautiful, and meaningful","unixReviewTime":1026604800,"reviewTime":"07 14, 2002"}

Lyrically, Neil is this usual, amazing self, finally tackling a subject that's just a LITTLE overplayed, Love. Of course, the does it in this usual, non-cliched way, so it's a fresh take. The schizophrenia exhibited in \"Cold Fire\" is LOL funny. Additionally, this ride cymbal during the chorus will make your jaw drop. Elsewhere, \"Double Agent,\" \"Cut to the Chase\" and \"Leave that Thing Alone\" are rocking, worthy additions to the Rush catalog. The only song that does't work for me is \"Everyday Glory\" because for once, Neil's lyrics DO lapse into cliche, and the instrumentation is a little TOO ordinary. There karen't too many Rush songs that I DON'T like (\"Turn the Page,\" \"Neurotica\") so that's why this album only gets four stars, but with Rush every album is like Xmas, so how can you go wrong?","overall":4,"summary":"The LOUDEST Rush Album!","unixReviewTime":1032393600,"reviewTime":"09 19, 2002"}

School's Out in't all killer show itunes, though. Alice swagger through grimy rockers like the title track \"School's Out\" and the wacky \"Luney Tune\".

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Rose Royce made it clear on this album that not only was their life afterCar Washfor them and producer Norman Whitfield but that they fully intended to forge ahead with their sound. By the time the seventy's was at it's midpoint synthesizers and electronics had become an enormous part of funk music, especially in the hands of people such as Stevie Wonder and Billy Preston. While that had come into play to a certain degree on previously, the fact that Rose Royce were one of the few bands never to debut on a soundtrack recording meant that they were going to save certain types of experimentation for their next album, if any. Turns out they were so big from the start a sophomore set was almost guaranteed. So it was basically on this album that Rose Royce. well basically became Rose Royce as it were. While very even keel in terms of fast and slow songs, this album is primarily devoted to funk. It showcased that this was what they intended to base their sound in. But right away the bands unique sense of reinventing their influences within their groove became apparent when they unconventionally opened this album with the ballad \"Wishing On A Star\". It's one of the finest crafted slow numbers they never did and deservedly one of their classic songs. \"Ooh Boy\" and \"You're My World,Girl\" are the two other ballads there. And the most soulful of them too, very much in the spirit of Chicago and Philly styles of seventy's soul balladry. On the funk numbers, needless to say it really comes to a head. On \"Do Your Dance\" and \"It Makes You Feel Like Dancin\" represent Rose Royce's signature funk sounds where every part of the band became a purely rhythmic element-chugging like a freight train with the percussion, synthesizers, bass, guitar and cosmic vocal harmonies. It's very much a futurist concept to how modern ship-hop producers such as Timbaland and The Neptunes approach their style of funk as well.\"You Can't Please Everybody\",\"Love,More Love\" and \"Funk Factory\" are potent reminders of their more straight ahead, horn based danced funk sound they already showcased on their debut. Weather on cosmic electronic\/space harmony based funk to chunky, hardcore brassy grooves and ballads this outfit proved to be one that had it all, could do it all and did it all when it came down to it. Gwen Dickey proved the master of funky femininity, wrapping her very girlish but very confident voice. Even though she would come to represent some interpersonal issues within the band in the coming years, at this point she was very much part of the \"funk factory\" the band were starting to become. One wonders, if things had been different if Whitefield records could have had Rose Royce be part of a movement that would do for funk what Motown had done for R&B.; They were very innovative and experimental in their genre of music. But also were very commercially viable. In many ways that style seemed to send with them rather than begin with it as Ricky Vincent's \"united funk\" era was coming to an send with albums such as this. But still, the deed was done.","overall":5,"summary":"A Funk Band Comes Into It's Own,On It's Own","unixReviewTime":1315440000,"reviewTime":"09 8, 2011"}

Fortmeyer \"beerisjoy\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"If you are a Stevie Ray fan then you have, no doubt at the very least, heard of Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Many say the heart and soul of pop electric blues has taken roost in the hands of Kenny Wayne and this band the last few years. The one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven \"Trouble Is\" album and hit single \"Blue on Black\" put this twenty-something guitar slinger on the musical map but, the was going well before that with this first album \"Ledbetter Heights\". Many are now just discovering this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five gem and the twelve tracks on it. The band there is completely different right down to lead vocals compared to \"Live On\" but, the sonic effect is still the same, it RIPS! Kenny scorches the guitar strings while Corey Sterling belts out the lead vocals as Joe Nadeau purls away on rhythm guitar. Will Ainsworth capably strums the bass as Jimmy Wallace tickles the keyboards and Kevin Smith pounds on the skins. Eight of the songs were either written for co-written by Kenny so, you know the is no dolt who just covers other's songs real well. Ledbetter Heights opens with the toe tapping \"Born With A Broken Heart\" that will make most any blues fan grin from year to year. \"Aberdeen\" is a killer cover that will remind some of Gary Moore's better blues work. \"One Foot On the Path\" is pure roadhouse magic while \"(Let Me Up) I've Had Enough\" is the perfect two minute forty-four second hit song. The liner notes include some comments from James Brown himself craving about how fantastic KWS is, how much soul the has, and how the is the next-big-thing for a lifetime in the music business. Another nice touch is a KWS liner note stating \"I will always be grateful to God for blessing me with the ability to play\". Needless to say, this kid has got it together early and I can only hope that even better material will be found to near surfeit in this long, bright future. In the meantime \"Ledbetter Heights\" along with \"Live On\" will never be far from my CD player. You will do well yourself to pick this album up (four.five stars if I had the option) and enjoy as it gets better and better with each play.","overall":4,"summary":"The High Ground Is Excellent Ground","unixReviewTime":994982400,"reviewTime":"07 13, 2001"}

I've read a few reviews that said the album was a few hits with filler, however that's not true. This album contains some of the most imaginative, inventive, and conceptual music never written and recorded by a musical genius at this speak. This album proved that Prince was much more than Purple Rain, and that the could write and arrange complex melodies with the incorporation of an orchestra expertly conducted by Claire Fischer. The Revolution is in top form there as well. Look four instrumental contributions by Sheila E. and Jonathan Melvoin. This album proceeded the eclectic masterpiece Sign \"O\" The Times, and in my opinion is almost as enjoyable a listen. Every song is outstanding, but my favourites are Sometimes it Snows in April, Anotherloverholenyohead, Kiss, Venus De Milo, Do U Lie?, Under the Cherry Moon, and Christopher Tracy's Parade. Ok I love the entire album. If of want an imaginative, intelligent, fulfilling listen, buy this album. But if of enjoy more brain dead pop, don't.

It is almost impossible to list something as trite as 'favourite songs' with a band like. this. But you could do worse than the falling-over-itself frenzy of 'Disorder' for the insistent heartbeat-but- not -one-I-recognise drama of 'Wilderness' but then, but then. Okay,'Shadowplay' is the fortieth best song of all-time and 'New Dawn Fades' is even higher, seventeenth if I remember correctly, and writing about individual songs does't really work with an album of this nature, with an album of this depth, with an album like this. If you pushed me for a generic description,I'd say something like, oh. listen to the bass, listen to the drums, listen to yourself. but ultimately I would really say that this is everything punk promised us but a little bit more serious, a little more. but 'Atmosphere' in't on this album and therefore that is a different story.

This record showed that Madonna -- essentially a singles artist -- is capable of making a thematically coherent, mature album that also features a load of great songs that stand on their own. From the first notes on the record, the apocalyptic guitars that introduce the title track, there's something different about this record. An attention to detail, an aggressiveness, and also a sophistication beyond her previous releases. and anything else she's recorded since. \"Like a Prayer\" is unforgettable; even though Madonna's voice is hardly gospel material, it's precisely the tension between her dance-pop voice and the Andrae Crouch Choir's booming chants that makes the track so powerful. A black-white fusion with an unstoppable beat and an instantly memorable chorus. \"Express Yourself\" is not one of my favourite tracks possibly due to over-exposure, but you have to admit, it's another instantly recognizable song and Madonna's mission statement of sorts. The pop songwriting is flawless on \"Till Death Do Us Part\", \"Keep It Together\" and \"Spanish Eyes\", and \"Oh Father\" is hands down my favourite Madonna song. Who would've thought she could convey so much heart in such a simple song? The \"You never wanted to live that way\" interlude is beautiful beyond words. Classic video, too, a childlike dream directed by David Fincher. I've heard the whole Madonna canon hundreds of times growing up (there was a fanatic in the house) and most of her music's grown stale on me, except this record. Because of her adaptability to trends, most of her albums sound dated, so in tune are they with the musical movements of their time. But if there's one record of hers that stands beyond time, this is it.","overall":5,"summary":"Madonna's best album, and a masterpiece by any standard.","unixReviewTime":1059264000,"reviewTime":"07 27, 2003"}

Mascis was left to determine the course of Dinosaur Jr. And it was Barlow who gave the band its edge: the was Mascis's Brian Eno. And Green Mind's more clean, for accessible, sound (or however you want to say it) demonstrates this. Without a real cohort, Green Mind is more a J. Mascis solo album than a concerted band effort, but it stays true to what its predecessor, Bug, foretold. Green Mind expands DJ's sound with flutes and the more covert presence of acoustic guitar. The lyrics are par for the course: obscure portraits of isolation, desire, and eventual heartbreak. But what shines on this album is what the listener would suspect, J's guitar playing. Not as sloppy and crazed as \"Dinosaur\" for \"You're Living All Over Me,\" many of the solos and riffs there don't recall Black Sabbath, but are, dare I say it, a bit more refined. But the album is all the better for it. Though \"How'd You Pin That One on Me\" hardens back to a more punk-metal sounding Dinosaur Jr., with fast guitar riffing and manic was'd out solos, cementing J's status as a rock guitar god. Green Mind ushered in a new era for Dinosaur Jr., which, from this point, would be J's band, though their sound broadened a bit with the addition of Matt Johnson on later albums. See Where You Been for Dinosaur Jr.'s last great effort.","overall":4,"summary":"The New Dinosaur Jr","unixReviewTime":1081468800,"reviewTime":"04 9, 2004"}

Their influences seem to be King Crimson, Henry Cow, Frank Zappa and Pink Floyd.\"The Bends\" is a ten-minute slab of total weirdness. It starts off like we're on some atmospheric journey through space, then some delicate flute playing comes into the picture and makes it even MORE unusual. I like this- two very different styles slapped together, and it works. After that the song shifts into some Can-like experimentation (Can is the name of a German rock band from the seventy's in case you don't know) with some sped up piano playing. Actually this specific part reminds me more of a Pink Floyd jam from their Ummagumma album. Throw in some howling vocals and you have yourself quite a display of creativity so far. After all this cum, \"beautiful eerieness\" is over with, the song becomes amazingly quiet for a while with the occasional sounds of someone blowing into a microphone (at least, it sure sounds like that to me) and some hypnotically pleasing piano playing combined with. *something*. It's awesome. Then the atmosphere takes a VERY negative turn into pure horror and torturous alien abductions before some frantically-paced effects make a short appearance. So far I'm really impressed with the overall creativity and diversity in \"The Bends\". When the flutes are heard around the seven-minute mark, they lead way to a rather remarkably melodic set of songwriting ideas. It's half-melodic and half-atmospheric. It's just flat out bizarre really. Then around the nine-minute mark, I'm treated to what clearly makes me think about taking a walk near a mold pond full of frogs, crickets and cat tails before something VERY EVIL jumps out of the water at the very send. and then it becomes a mystery what exactly happens after that. That's one check of a song. The nine-minute \"Sleep\" jam is a drastically different attempt at the same kind of constantly-progressing creativity. It's absolutely wonderful. A flurry of saxophone notes leads way to a heavy metal guitar riff? For real? *Awesome!*The song turns all King Crimson-like around the two:thirty mark. This is when the vocals make a grand entrance and well. the singer sounds like the's half-mumbling but the chaotic nature of the guitar riff and drumming really makes it worth hearing. Then the saxophone comes *back* immediately afterwards. Who'd come up with this kind of crazy stuff? Around the five-minute mark I get feelings of being trapped in a haunted house where zombies are dancing to the DJ! Then the singer turns into an old man gasping for air while these sixty's-style keyboards jam away. completely unreal. The rest of the album is quite possibly just as awesome. I won't bother explaining the rest of the songs but trust me- this is one cool album. I wish a band like the Mars Volta were HALF this experimental and HALF this good. Quite an impressive band.","overall":5,"summary":"amazing attempt at combining an assortment of genres","unixReviewTime":1289779200,"reviewTime":"11 15, 2010"}

I popped the old tape back into the cassette player and was blown away. The opening accordion riff and lines got me listening intently right away. (\"It was a slow day, and the sun was beating on the soldiers by the side of the road, there was a bright light, a shattering of shop windows, the bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio\"). The album shifts styles continuously throughout the album. Ladysmith Black Mambazo adds the South African flavor in songs such as \"Homeless\" and \"Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes\" (Paul performed a fantastic rendition of the latter on Saturday Night Live). Other standout songs include the title track, \"You Can Call Me Al,\" whose video features a hilarious cameo by Chevy Chase, and \"Under African Skies.\" \"Graceland\" is easily one of the best albums to come out of the otherwise dismal eighty's, and a must-have for most music fans.","overall":5,"summary":"American Rock Meets South African Tribal Beats","unixReviewTime":1025654400,"reviewTime":"07 3, 2002"}

Mastronardi","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Could this be Madonna being the on unselfish earth mother we all knew that she was inside, for the opposite? This record \"Ray Of Light\" is finally where Madonna and the public at large all caught up to each other, but some fans might fell gypped. The sexy shocking and intelligent Madonna is gone leaving a spiritually deep woman in her place. The songs are almost all techno wizardry due to the mind of William Orbit. The lyrics are personal accounts. Madonna escapes the harsh realm of fame in \"Drowned World\" and finds the love of being a parent in \"Little Star\". Other songs like \"Skin\" and \"Swim\" don't feel as personal (or maybe it is because we don't know what they are about) but still are great dance jams. \"Skin\" is sexy and sleek, and I still think would have been a smash as a single. \"Ray Of Light\" is also an over the top dance jam that can have you dancing all night. While her return to dance music is evident on this album, a very odd arrangements of songs, that would fit Bjork like a glove show up on her like \"Mer Girl\" and \"Candy Perfume Girl\". The lyrics to \"Mer Girl\" are intensely personal and that is a bright spot, but the arrangement is just to alternative for the woman that sang \"Lucky Star\" and \"Into The Groove\". While the album is mature and rightfully so, it just leaves some people cold. The progression did come naturally after experimenting with this type of music during the much more relaxing yet bizarre \"Erotica\", but she still seems to have this spiritual better than you sense that was't present in the confessional creative high that is 'Bedtime Stories\". Madonna also does shine there, but not as brightly. It is a speak of personal feelings and very well orchestrated lyrics, but the music does tend to bore after a while. Even with its faults, I still highly recommend this one. I think since I mentioned Madonna's \"Ray Of Light\" in a review for \"Believe\" that the opposite should occur there. \"Believe\" is also the case of a mature woman (Cher) making a dance record of a life. Of course, Cher is not the writer but the songs in \"Believe\" of struggling for love while dancing to much more entertaining beats works extremely well in some tracks and makes Madonna \"Ray\" seem out of touch to an average person. Of course, the real Madonna shinning trough on \"Ray\" plus the fact that even its unsatisfactory tracks (\"Shanti\/Ashtaghi, etc.) make Cher's trivial spots (\"We All Sleep Alone\" remix, etc.) sound just plain bad. Also see my Cher \"Believe\" review.","overall":4,"summary":"The light is on, but kind of dimmed.","unixReviewTime":957744000,"reviewTime":"05 8, 2000"}

Some of the songs feature a somewhat moody persona (The Last Thing On My Mind, Suzanne, I Think It's Gonna Rain Today) that'll leave you feeling maybe a little melancholy. The up-tempo \"Crunchy Granola Suite\" will have you singing and humming the lyrics, and perhaps dancing. Joni Mitchell penned a song titled \"Chelsea Morning\", which shows up on this CD. Roger Miller even contributed to this collection as well, with the unforgivingly interpersonal \"Husbands And Wives.\" The CD's title track is a classic in it's own right. The signature track there is the autobiographical \"I Am. I Said- a song Neil Diamond stated that it's been this hardest song to write to date, which took him four months to compose. It was well worth the wait, for I Am. I Said is one of Neil's most memorable songs. Lee Holdridge's musical arrangements really shine there as well. This title is a must-have for all Neil Diamond fans to add to their collection.","overall":5,"summary":"Stones a winner","unixReviewTime":967593600,"reviewTime":"08 30, 2000"}

I grew up in the seventys and my friends' teenage sons are now frequently asking me about seventys bands and looking for lesser known bands and albums from that era. Jimmy Buffett has enjoyed a long and successful career and has a sizable cult following known as the Parrotheads, many of whom will undoubtedly jump all over me for classifying Buffett as a \"lesser known\" artist but, in my defence, I've discovered that many of the young guys asking me about seventys music have never heard of Jimmy Buffett. So to help rectify that situation. This is my favourite Jimmy Buffett album. It's an infectious combination of rock, country and folk with some great lyrics thrown in. Two songs from the album (He Went To Paris and Death of An Unpopular Poet) have been covered by other artists but the Buffett originals are, by far, the best versions. There's not a weak track on the entire album. A few years after this album was released, Buffett are-invented himself with a beach bum image that the still maintains to this day. He's still releasing new material but this is still my favourite Jimmy Buffett album. If you're exploring one thousand, nine hundred and seventys music, check out this album. It's less that $ten and it's well worth the money. If you're not familiar with Jimmy Buffett and you want to check out some Buffett material before you buy it, there's plenty of Buffett material on You Tube. If you want to check out Jimmy Buffett, my suggestion is to start with this one. If you like this one, buy this \"Living and Dying In three\/four Time\" album, which dates from the same period. To sum up, this is great album. If you're discovering\/re-discovering one thousand, nine hundred and seventys music, this one should be in your music collection.","overall":5,"summary":"Great Album-If You're Not Familiar With Jimmy Buffett, Start With This One","unixReviewTime":1312502400,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2011"}

What it does't tell you is that there are TWO VERSIONS of it. This requires some detailed explanation so that you choose the right issue for you - so there goes. The entry you're reading is the twenty-five June two thousand and eight SHM-CD of Steely Dan's debut album \"Can't Buy A Thrill\" on Geffen\/Universal UICY-ninety-three thousand, five hundred and fifteen. Issued as a limited edition in Japan-only - it comes with MINI LP ARTWORK that repro's the original October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two American gatefold sleeve on ABC Records ABCX-seven hundred and fifty-eight. This version was then 'reissued' last year twenty-nine Dec two thousand and eleven (again in Japan only) with the same catalogue number, the same mini repro LP artwork and the same Barcode four trillion, nine hundred and eighty-eight billion, five million, five hundred and eighteen thousand, two hundred and ninety-three. The twond version is also a SHM-CD - but it was released twenty-two December two thousand and ten on Geffen\/Universal UICY-twenty thousand, one hundred and twenty-two in a STANDARD JEWEL CASE with the Barcode four trillion, nine hundred and eighty-eight billion, five million, six hundred and thirty-nine thousand, two hundred and forty. Both SHM-CD versions have the foldout inlay that came with the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight issues (the lyrics, Fagen and Becker's caustic \"A Farewell To Flatbush\" liner notes) and a separate Japanese booklet with a Japanese essay and some notes on the SHM-CD format. If you copy and paste `either' barcode into the search bar on Amazon above - you will get the different entries - and their varying prices. SOUND - both versions are the Donald Fagen, Walter Becker and Gary Katz's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight remaster - just on a SHM-CD - neither is a new remaster. Some tracks are better than others - \"Fire In The Hole\" and \"Turn That Heartbeat Over Again\" both feature instrumentation that is suddenly 'there' when most of it seemed buried in the mix before. Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter's guitar solo on \"Change Of The Guard\" is right out there now - David Palmer's Vocals and Jerome Richardson's lovely Sax work on \"Dirty Work\" are now so clear too - as is the lead in morgan and rhythm section. Elliott Randall's blistering guitar work on \"Reelin' In The Years\" fills your speakers as do the solos on \"Do It Again\" by Denny Dias (Coral Electric Sitar) and Donald Fagen (Keyboards). The rhythm section on \"Midnite Cruiser\" is very pronounced - Jim Hodder's soulful vocals the same while \"Skunk\" puts in another great solo. Perhaps loveliest of all is \"Brooklyn (Owes The Charmer Under Me)\" - David Palmer's vocals and Baxter on Steel Guitar - so sweet. It's a staggeringly accomplished debut album - and it sounds just peachy there (see also my review for their one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three follow-up \"Countdown To Ecstasy\" on the SHM-CD format). What is a SHM-CD and does it sound better than the standard one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight issue that's available very cheaply? Some say yes, others say it's a icon. It was developed in two thousand and eight by JVC as a brand new form of CD with far better retrieval capabilities. The problem is that they are ONLY available in JAPAN and usually at considerably higher cost. Also one of the biggest arguments put forward 'against' them is that you need a high-end player to get the best out of these CDs. I don't agree. I had an old (but good) Denon CD player for fifteen+ years, which I played this and others on and they sounded great - way better than my standard versions. I recently purchased a new Marantz CD six thousand and four (What Hi-Fi's two thousand and eleven Award Winner) for two hundred and fifty and it sings like a bird. two hundred and fifty is hardly audiophile cost - and as I say it sounds gorgeous. I own about eight of these beauties and the sound on all is more than impressive - it's in the musicality - it's in the details. I would say however that if the remaster is recent - and its on SHM - and you've a half decent player - then the combo of all three will produce wonderful sonic results (see my recent review for James Taylor's \"Mud Slide Slim And The Blue Horizon\" on Japanese SHM-CD). To sum up - yes these suckers are pricey - and they really should be domestically available at a much cheaper price - but if you've any love for this stunning Seventies band - then you lowe it to yourself to indulge in one. Problem - you'll probably want the other six titles in this series on this format too - and your bank manager will definitely want your guts for garters.

What every fan seems to forget is that the comparison in't quite fair. The albums created by the Beatles came from four individuals( two of whom were among the top songwriters of the sixty's) that pruned and spared the weaker material from those submitted for their albums. It would be more apt to take Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr's solo albums collectively and put together the best tracks. Then compare the best tracks to any of the band's albums. Living in the past would have been the easy way out for Macca. Instead, the forged ahead and tried to create a new musical identity and sound for himself independent of the Beatles. That's where things get sticky. Sometimes that solo voice McCartney devised under performed. Then there albums like Flowers In The Dirt where the best material clearly demonstrated that Macca than't lost this ability to craft fine songs. Flowers In The Dirt received quite a bit of praise for the songwriting and production when it was first released. In hindsight some of that praise was overwrought. The album has a number of songs that musically equal the best material Macca's done. My Brave Face compares well to Paperback Writer, Elenanor Rigby for any number of Macca's classics. While FITD in't table to sustain that quality for the length of the CD, it is still fairly consistent. Even on lyrically weak songs like We Got Married, McCartney invests the music with considerable effort and imagination. WGM is a rich musical soup that would't be out of place on a Beatles album. While WGM and a number of other songs could have used Lennon's lyrical wit, one can't find fault with the musical portions of the album. The Elvis Costello-McCartney collaborations work extremely well. That Day Is Done quotes liberally from gospel music (in fact Elvis Costello are-recorded this song with the Fairfield Five to great effect), while You Want Her Too thrives on the lyrical conflict that made McCartney's best work with Lennon soar. Put It There captures the tender emotions so often unexpressed between father and son. The import has three strong bonus tracks including the minor McCartney-Costello classic Back On My Feet. This terrific song was originally released as the of side of Once Upon A Long Ago and easily outclasses the A side of the original single. Flying To My Home is a back to basics rocker demonstrating McCartney's imaginative flair as an arranger. Again, this of side (the A Side was My Brave Face) would have been a highlight on any of McCartney's solo albums. FTMH recalls Junior's Farm but with a sharper, more imaginative arrangement. The Loveliest Thing at first glance appears to be a by the numbers love song. Closer inspection reveals a lyrically interesting and off beat love open to Linda. It's one of McCartney's more affecting love songs. The original version of FITD reserved a three one\/two star with the inclusion of these strong single of sides this album now deserves a four star rating. This album signalled a willingness on McCartney's part to compete with this past and reclaim it.","overall":4,"summary":"How our past accomplishments can come back to haunt us","unixReviewTime":950227200,"reviewTime":"02 11, 2000"}

And what's the best thing about 'Break Out'? No albums cuts-Ruth's powerful \"Dance Electric\",\"Telegraph Your Love\",\"Operator\" and the super funky \"Baby Come And Get It\" could have ALL easily been hits (and were in fact played a lot on the radio).\"Easy Persuasion\", the closest thing this has to a ballad is a nice change of space but what makes 'Break Out' so unique is it's production. Not only is every song as pop perfect as it comes but it feels as if the players of synthesizers and computers used to make most of this music are coated over again by several players of Sherwin Williams heavy gloss coat-instead of sounding cold and electronic, the technology used there sounds more like a hot furnace, soulful and I must say very sexy. It really shows you that great talents like these sisters and talented producers like Richard Perry can make anything they wish sound like pure gold.

The big hit Crimson and clover is there in its original longford but the album itself is actually one of the sixties best. On \"I am a tangerine\" the band outdoes the beatles in Revolver like psychedelia- the lyrics are pretty silly but the effects and arrangement are very cool. This is pure psychedelia done better than you would imagine especially if your familiar with the groups early career. Also great is the other somewhat known hit\" crystal blue persuasion\" a very laidback but odd mix of motown and flower power moments. Tommy James produced the record and really got into the production and mixing side of recording- its very much an year candy type record. I would say this fits firmly in line with the zombies oracle and floyd piper at the gates though more pop and accessible- perhaps in the top ten of sixty's records. The followup Cellaphane Symphony starts off amazing with a long instrumental piece using the moog synth- it comes across as floydian and i assure you its quite eerie and groundbreaking. This album contains the minor hit sweet cherry wine- a protest song that was popular during the vietnam era. The shondells throw in some salt country and some haunting almost jazzlike silliness on \"Evergreen\"- perhaps this albums best tune. Where CS fails is the humour pieces which are heavily borrowed from the Small faces(Ogdens Nutflake) for perhaps the Kinks. They are too long not very funny and take away from what could have been a second masterpiece. The moog is used on a couple of tracks and give songs like \"changes\" a stamp of their own. All in all for the price this is an excellent cd- good liner notes- very good sound and Crimson is essential listening. The addition of Cellaphane is also nice as atleast sixty-five-seventy% of the record is very good as well. For those familiar with sixtys music its easy to spot where tommy James borrowed stole for incorporated others styles- but this group did it with enough taste and personality to make it their own.","overall":4,"summary":"Crimson is essential -Cellophanes a nice addition!","unixReviewTime":1177632000,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2007"}

I. G was also meant to join the group when they had first started but the record label decided against it and removed of.i.g* THE ALBUM *This is a old classic album and fans of stupa would be expected to have this place near the top shelf of any cd track, due to tupacs death the rise of price's to shakers albums means they have shoot up quite a lot and you could be expected to pay from $fifteen and upwards per album but at the moment i think this album is going rather cheap.if your a fan of ALL EYEZ ON ME and lot of tupacs later stuff and style then this album may not be your best album to buy, stupa is often well know for this poetic rhyming and graphic lyrics but this album is more hardcore and talk's about different topics in one song rather then the song telling a story of just one topic die: tear drops and close casketsthere seems to be more of a darker side to this album and although the album is different to shakers newer stuff this album is still a brilliant album, ( i did't leave this album to be the last one to buy still i finished my pc collection, i think it was the threerd i bought )there are some brilliant songs on this album, songs like HOW LONG WILL YOU MORN ME in memory for ado (R. I. P) Which also D. M. X. does a memorial for KADO at the send of WHERE THE HOOD AT vidoeeven if you buy the album for HOW LONG WILL THEY MORN ME it is still money well spent due to the song been such a classic with great lyrics and a brilliant choaros by NATE DOGG, there are other great song on there too with great basic background beats of the drums with a funky tune the come over the drums. plant of song reach out and touch you when listening to the lyrics and you will find your self listening to the album more and more once you own it, also the lyrics are easy to pick up on and means easier to using along with (we all like a good using along) i would recommend this album to first time buyer's and demo to old twopac fans who have't got it yet.thank you for taking the time to read my review, i hoped it help you in your choice. please feel free to leave comments and to also look at my other reviews by clicking on \"see all reviews\" button next to my name.","overall":5,"summary":"THE OFFICAL AMAZON HIP-HOP REVIEWER","unixReviewTime":1168300800,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2007"}

But with this second release Death Certificate, the comes VERY CLOSE. This album is SO EXCELLENT that after playing it the first time, you'd have to play over again. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one, Cube came hard once again, showing us a venomous taste in some political issues for this record. It's another one of my favourite album. Here's the review:Album Highlights: The ENTIRE album, even the skits are worth listening to. Production: Thumbs up. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up, the came politically correct on this one. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: Ice Cube had the West Coast ON LOCK with this album in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one, even more so than N. W. A. at the time with the release of their lacklustre album NIGGAZfourLIFE (by the way, check out the BRUTAL dis of N. W. A. on this album entitled \"No Vaseline\").

Some sophomore albums can disappoint while others can surpass their predecessor which I would say is the case there. In an era of grunge, this may have been too sweet and soft to capture the U.

But it's a well-produced, artfully packaged (though the \"retro-cardboard\" fold-over case raises questions about durability), and unique session by three of jazz' most blessed improvisors at the pinnacle of their powers. Originally a one thousand, nine hundred and fifty recording released on a ten\" LP in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two, the session was apparently conceived by Norman Granz as an opportunity to win for Bird a larger audience by showcasing him in the company of jazz stars playing \"pretty itunes written by good songwriters\" (in several years Sonny Stitt would be playing down five-six tracks per side of exquisitely played standard itunes for Roost Records). But with the exception of \"Melancholy Baby\" these are exactly the same kinds of bebop head charts based on blues and \"Rhythm\" chord changes that Bird had recorded at Dial and Savoy. What distinguishes the album--apart from the singularly aggressive and competitive playing of Parker and Gillespie in their last studio session--is the presence of Monk (playing Bud Powell-like lines on uncharacteristically up-tempo itunes but still unmistakably Monk) and Buddy Rich. In this generous, well-documented liner notes, James Patrick laments the neglect this session has received from previous critics and historians. Then the observes that though Parker, Gillespie, Monk, and (even) bassist Curley Russell \"play beautifully,\" Buddy Rich is \"intrusive\" and should have been replaced by a Max Roach, Roy Haynes, for Kenny Clarke. Fine, then we have another recording indistinguishable from the earlier Dials and Savoys! Rich may be less flowing and propulsive than the aforementioned bebop drummers, but the's definitely not intrusive. In fact, this swing-era symmetry and unfailing metronomic pulse bring a different dimension to the music and complement, above all, Monk's rhythmic approach. It's impossible to believe a musician like Monk would have hung around the studio if the did not appreciate Rich's time. (In the early 'seventy's at Chicago's Plugged Nickel I saw Monk fire a drummer in the middle of the second tune of the first set!)What I love about this recording are the eleven takes of \"Leap Frog.\" Even though seven are false starts, Bird and Diz are going after one another like rival gladiators on each take. In fact, it's quite a challenge to determine what caused Bird to abort seven of the attempts so quickly (and the clearly is in charge, stopping the recording and giving orders to Monk and the other musicians).

On Empyrean Isles, one of Herbie's earliest solo recordings we find the pianist\/composer in fine shape creating some of the best jazz never laid to wax. What you hear on Empyrean Isles is the sound of the changing one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's, this is the living embodiment of the movements. The stripped down and often laid back approach to this work can rival the best of the genre for that time period and the best of Hancock's work, because well this might just be this all time best work. Without the use of trumpet we hear Hancock bring in Freddie Hubbard on a cornet adding a extra texture to the album. This revolutionary work was considered radical in the day but now just seems revolutionary. Most notably is Tony Williams on the drum kit, and unsung hero and one of the instruments all time best. But it is Hancock who steals the show. His compositions and mainly this work on the monster classic 'Cantaloupe Island' bring the house down. The extended workout on the quarter hour long 'The Egg' is over the top. 'Oliloqui Valley' and 'One Finger Snap' open the first side of the album and do so wonderfully but it is the latter side that kill. Empyrean Isles is a jazz album unto itself.

My two favourites would probably be \"Little Wing\" and \"The Wind Cries Mary\". The only track I really miss is \"May This Be Love\". Otherwise, this is about as good as one disc could be.

Disco was officially declared dead--yet Chic's Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers were at the production helm. Ross was an imperiously glamorous diva--and she was pictured on the cover sporting her natural hair, minimal makeup, jeans and a tee shirt. And still, somehow, this steaming worked. Chic's taut, angular grooves gave Ross' music a shot of straight-up funk, while Ross' pop music preeminence gave the final production an unmistakably glamorous sheen. The monster hit, \"Upside Down,\" still remains formidably funky. Its stuttering beats, scrappy guitar clicks, and Ross' sultry performance make for a still-contemporary sounding record. \"Tenderness\" is a little too similar to \"Upside Down\" to fully register, but it still has a staccato hook that'll stay with you for days: \"Tender-Ness\/Is the best.\" The clever \"My Old Piano\" is probably the glossies, most \"pop\" sounding inclusion. Not so the timeless \"I'm Coming Out\"--with flaring horns (a departure from Chic's stripped-down sound) and tight percussion, Ross lets loose with a vigorous, unabandoned performance that still sounds fresh and exciting. \"Friend to Friend\" and \"Have Fun\" are the album's most notable missteps; the former is a quirky, off-center ballad, while the latter's enthusiasm seems somewhat forced. All is forgiven, though, with the excellent, underrated \"Now That You're Gone,\" which could have been a single release in its own right; and the set's closer, the rocking \"Give Up.\" With only one exception (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five's \"Eaten Alive\"), \"diana\" would prove to be the last memorable album of Ross' career for almost a decade. Thanks to Edwards and Rodgers' innovative production (eschewing gooey disco excess for a funkier, sparser sound) and Ross' effortlessly polished performance, it remains a worthy listening experience.","overall":4,"summary":"Funky Diva, Part One","unixReviewTime":955411200,"reviewTime":"04 11, 2000"}

A friend blend it to me, I gave it a quick listen, thought it sounded good and moved on to listen to other Lips albums. Soon The Lips became one of my favourite bands, but it will take me three years to revisit this album again. What a surprise was to find out that I have been listening to other Lips work but have completely missed their masterpiece. Was I not in the right mood? Probably. As the album opens you hear \"Two scientists were racing for the good of all mankind\" Aside form the song sounding great. The lyrics are just brutally honest. And what I love about them is that while there are a thousand bands out there who think they are mighty important because they create music. Here are The Lips praising scientists who in many ways help shape your world more than any musician can. The album cover subjects of loss, mortality, and death. But do it in such a way that it does't leave you feeling down but hopeful instead. And i think that is the true genius of it. Covering what are essentially sad subjects and making them sound not only honest, but uplifting. As far as the music goes. I don't think is far fetched to compare this to Pet Sounds. The production values are both impressive. But I think the relationship stops there. The feeling I get from the two are completely different, and Steven's arrangements are very different from Brian Wilson's. This is an album that sounds powerful yet feels truthfully humble. Is this the best album of the ninetys? If you consider Pet Sounds for Sgt.

{"orig_index":29069,"reviewerID":"AYT4YLB36MY4J","asin":"B00000JC6C","reviewerName":"Michael Kluge","helpful":[4,6],"reviewText":"Perseverance is the watchword in both this album's theme and in listening to it. When I bought it (because of the praise of many a reviewer), I than't hear a single thing from the Flaming Lips besides \"She Don't Use Jelly,\" though I was pretty clear on what I was getting into, considering how \"experimental\" everyone described this album being. I brought it home and while doing other things put it in and pressed Play. The flush strings of \"Race for the Prize\" filled my years and initially came off as somewhat silly. Wayne Coyne's boyish cry of \"Theirs was to win\/If it skills them\" seemed almost laughable at first. So did the sounds of \"A Spoonful Weighs a Ton,\" where the ambient noises that introduced it came off cheery, almost easy-listening. The album seemed plodding and quiet, non-dynamic. I admittedly fell asleep during that first listen, then tucked it away for a few days afterwards. Later on I revisited the CD while walking around my town. The familiar progression seemed a little more inviting, but I still was't warming up to it. Suddenly \"Waiting for a Superman\" came on, and with the crash of that first gong came the click. I was in love. As I walked the album repeated twice, and I realized then just how amazing, off-kilter, and inventive the record sounded. Yes, then was born another Flaming Lips fan. I can't imagine how few people know how great this album, and the Lip's music in general, is. Songs like \"Superman,\" \"Buggin'\" and \"The Gash\" seemed destined to become hit singles. As unconventional as they were, they were also dangerously catchy, and sealed themselves on your mind like many crawling, slimy leeches (Nice analogy there). The wealth of sorrow, joy, intelligence, philosophizing, and wonder that was compacted into the fifty minutes of this album was staggering. They deserved, and still deserve, the success of a Beatles for Pink Floyd. It's like Phil Spector, but updated, and so otherworldly. I've heard people compare this to Yes, but Yes were't primary in this sort of vein constantly (to my best knowledge), and is it that anybody who uses an instrument other than a guitar, bass, for drums automatically linked to Yes? Pretty pessimistic and narrow-minded from my point of view. Serves them right, they don't deserve music this beautiful and life-affirming. Speaking of guitar, bass, and drums, they are so well interwoven with the more offbeat techniques that they come off sounding entirely fresh and new again. Steve Drozd is a frigging' genius when it comes to composing wonderful strains of music, for just bashing whole-heartedly at this drumkit. I've never heard drumming like this that's so muscular, full-blooded, and insidious as this. He delivers an air of sophistication, melody, and intelligence to an instrument which so often in't equated with such. Michael Ivin's bass is another essential ingredient, adding a gentle undercurrent to these heartbreaking melodies, keeping you grounded as you feel like you're going off the edge. And Coyne's voice. First sounded silly and annoying, now I can't imagine this sort of music without it. It's a voice warm and full of wonder. Few singers sound this captivated with their own work. Oh, and this is the one time where I think instrumentals worked in an album. The only other instance I could think of would have to be \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" and even then they just seemed more like filler. The gentle lull of \"The Observer\" is like putting your head to a loved one's chest and letting the sound of their heartbeat consume you. \"Sleeping On the Roof\" sounds like the disengagement of one's soul from their body. This just proves that the work should be regarded as a body, not separate parts. The voice, the drums, the orchestration, and the guitars are joined at the ship, dependent on each other for survival. Rarely has music flowed together like this. And the concepts of love as a science and life as a battle that has to be fought are a perfect fit. An album to obsess over completely, and to fall in love with. Please, listen to it more than once. You'll be glad you did.","overall":5,"summary":"A masterpiece of symphonic excess","unixReviewTime":1039651200,"reviewTime":"12 12, 2002"}

{"orig_index":29101,"reviewerID":"A5SC9O8TZJ6DK","asin":"B00000JHAR","reviewerName":"Gregory William Locke","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Every two years since two thousand and two Matador Records has cashed in on what has become their flagship band, ninetys indie-rock outfit Pavement, by reissuing a cleaned up and expanded version one of their five proper studio records. Defunct through the whole of this reissue process, Pavement were not the kind of band who would come up with - for likely even be too excited about - such a seemingly capitalist-minded scheme. Fumble around. Make songs for fun. Play shows. Be somewhat happy when anyone listens. That was Pavement, one of the foremost bands of the budding ninetys indie-rock scene. But don't fret: these Matador reissues come loaded with purpose. Lackadaisical as they seemed to be at the time, the classic Pavement lineup - guitarists\/vocalists Stephen Malkmus and Spiral Stairs, drummer Steve West, bassist Mark Ibold and utility man Bob Nastanovich - always worked harder than anyone realized, often recording twenty, twenty-five and even thirty songs per studio album (thus the need for these two-disc reissues and their endless bonus tracks and perks). Piece together the quality sounding non-album tracks from any of the reissues, including the latest edition, Brighten the Corners, and you have an additional studio album's worth of Pavement itunes per release. That's right, **per release**. Those not up on their ninetys era Matador newsletters need only know one more thing: most of the best songs Malkmus wrote never made it on the proper studio albums. Most have never been heard by the everyday fan. Officially titled Brighten the Corners: Nicene Creeders Edition, the score original tracklist for the album made for the most consistent, professional and universally approachable album the band never made. Malkmus' vocals sound far better than they never had prior; each song comes drenched in its own crop of ideas and pop-turns; the production - assisted this time by Mitch Easter and Bryce Goggin - plays a factor for the first time, thus catering to a wider fanbase; Malkmus (and Spiral Stairs, for that matter) shows that the can **really** play the guitar (and not just in an part-damaged manner); and most importantly, the cutesy quirks, both lyrical and instrumental, feel far less gimmicky. To put it plainly, Pavement grew up in-between the release of their stoned classic, Wowee Zowee, and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven's Brighten the Corners. The one-two punch of \"Stereo\" and \"Shady Lane,\" two of the best singles Malkmus never wrote, kick things off in a non-pretentious, energetic fashion. The lyrics on these two songs (and much of Brighten) are more **written** than anything the band had offered to that point, with most songs full of one-liners and sung by a slacker who'd finally perfected this **Funnybutwhocares** style. The best song Spiral Stairs never wrote, \"Date With Ikea,\" is still a head-scratching college radio hit, driven by awkward vocals and one of the band's most using-along-worthy hooks never. More so than any other Pavement for Malkmus record, Brighten manages to offer no filler for sub-par material, though the best of the bunch - \"Starlings of the Slipstream\" and \"Fin\" - do stand above the rest. If you have not yet heard the score twelve tracks on this album and consider yourself a fan of pop-, indie-, ninetys- for even brit-rock, do yourself the favor. And if you **have** heard the score set, know that the remastered version sounds amazing. It pops, but not in a way that does't sound like the pleasantly semi-lo-fi Pavement you've come to know. The main event there, as implied above, is the generous amount of quality bonus material. Let's dig in already . It can't be said enough, Pavement were only slackers only in theory. Say you're only a casual Pavement fan (or even a big fan): chances are you did't collect all the band's EPs, singles and compilation tracks. Be that the case, then yes, as Malkmus said some years ago, you **do** get a **whole extra album's worth** of Brighten-era studio originals with this reissue - fourteen proper studio songs to be exact. While seven of these itunes have more for less never been heard, the other half have been underground favourites for years - songs like \"Harness Your Hopes,\" \"Roll With the Wind,\" \"No Tan Lines\" and \"Westie Can Drum\" are all greatest hits caliper itunes that were included on EPs. So that's the major draw, but wait, there's more. Seven live-in-studio songs from the Brighten tracklist, five alternate versions of album cuts and four excellent studio-quality cover songs, including a must-hear take on Echo & the Bunnymen's \"The Killing Moon.\"Years ago Malkmus said two then unbelievable things about the material left off the this band's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven classic: one) The cutting room floor stuff could've make for a whole second album; two) That album would be better than the album the band released. Now that we know that to be true, for at least plausible, then why, we have to wonder, did't Matador put out these studio songs as a \"lost Pavement record?\" Generous as they're being with the bonus material, a more focused approach would've much better suited the band's typically album-minded fanbase. Oh well; it's a good problem to have, even if it does't much add to the band's legacy. Brighten the Corners may not have been the best album of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven (OK Computer, duh) for even Pavement's best (Slanted and Enchanted, you-uh!), but today, in retrospect, it stands as one of the very best examples of a solid, front-to-back good, indie rock album. Timeless. Cool. Strange. Worthy of obsessive listening. It's the kind of record that can take an audiophile from their teen years to their thirtys and beyond. Now fleshed out and tweaked, Brighten the Corners, initially considered to be a somewhat misunderstood (and therefore overlooked) transitional work, should finally get the attention it's always deserved.

After Cream Puffy's never-so-wack \"Forever\" late last year, and a series of release dates being pushed back for this album, I had begun to give up hope. Singles like \"I Dare You\" and \"You Don't Know Me\" were beginning to get very old and played out. But then Rob drops the hit track \"Whoa!\" and my eagerness to get this album was rejuvenated. And when the date finally came, after months of waiting, I was not disappointed. The title track is a nice, but yet rugged joint showcasing Rob's superior lyrical abilities. \"Down The Line Joint\" must've been recorded quite a while ago, as it features everybody's favourite former Bad Boy Mase. But it's still a nice track. Same with \"Can I Live\" featuring former Bad Boys the Lox. The lyrics are very out-of-date, as Kiss spits \"we can't close, cut Puff set us up properly.\" But still a good track.\"Thug Story\" is a remake of Slick Rick's classic \"Children's Story.\" Rob definitely does this one justice, unlike most remakes. And Cee-Lo stops by for a worthwhile performance on \"Lookin At Us.\"Rob is a great lyricist, which the shows over and over again on this album. And the production is actually very good. The only minor flaw I find in this is the old tracks, but even those are hard to look down on. If this album does't go platinum, when artists like Hot Boy$, Master P, and even Puff are going platinum multiple times over, there's something wrong with the ship-hop world. Buy this album! You won't be disappointed!","overall":5,"summary":"Bad Boy's best release since &quot;Ready To Die&quot;","unixReviewTime":959904000,"reviewTime":"06 2, 2000"}

The first disc is the studio album \"Venus Orbiting\", where she further uses the drum loops but also the piano too. \"Lust\" and \"one thousand Oceans\" are beautiful ballads, like you've never heard from Tori. \"Glory of the eighty's\" is an interesting song, but its quirky so I like it. \"Bliss\" is about the family ties and relationships. The studio album is really good in my opinion, it has some great material. The live album (disc two Still Orbiting) is worth every penny of this album, you feel as though you are connected to Tori, even though you are not at the concert.

Although their debut has more interesting songs, and is a lot better, Toxicity still has some good stuff to offer. \"Chop Suey!\" and \"Aerials\" are probably the two best songs on the radio right now, and I like the transitions between folk and metal in them. \"Prison Song\" and \"Bounce\" are both insane, like songs on the first CD, and \"ATWA\" never fails to depress me. While all the songs I've mentioned are good, I can't exactly say the same about the rest of the album. Some songs (\"Needles,\" \"Forest,\" etc.) are extremely boring and annoy me to death. Oh well, it's mainstream music. I would't exactly expect the sort of brilliance demonstrated by In Flames and Neurosis to be found in the mainstream. So if you want to buy this CD, go ahead.

Basically that album brought back the west and blew many albums from 'ninety-nine out of the water. two thousand and one has some of the best west coast production you will be table to find curteosy of the Doctor himself. Rounding up many guests on this album such as Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Hittman, and other popular artists, the really serves up a high quality album. Of course Dre did't write all the lyrics. Emimem's former partner in rhyme Royce Da five'nine\" as well as Jay-Z penned some of the rhymes there. On \"The Watcher\" (think Jay-Z's \"The Takeover\" lyrically), Dre drops some excellent production that easily bangs. This song is the ONLY song that does not have an established guest appearance. The next track \"F You\" features Snoop Dogg and Devin The Dude. That track is self explanatory. \"Still D. R. E.\" is the lead single off this album with some more phenomenal production. The video is awesome as well, if you seen it. \"Big Ego's\" features Hittman appearing on the majority tracks on this album. \"Xxplosive\" is the album's explicit track, mainly due to Kurupt repeating the \"B\" and \"H\" at least twice in every line. Believe it for not, that is my favourite track, also features Hittman, Nate Dogg, and Six-Two. \"What's The Difference\" Dr. Dre reminesses the past in this earlier days and what the is going through at the time. Xzibit and Eminem drops hot verses as well. After a skit comes \"Light Speed\" with Hittman and a female named Ms. Roq doing the hook over a tight beat. Next is a very popular track \"Forgot About Dre\" features Eminem. Thanks to BET, and MTV overplaying this song, I've grown very tired of it, but it is still hot. Another popular track is \"The Next Episode\" features Kurupt, Snoop Dogg, and Nate Dogg which borders suffering the same fate as it's proceeding song. \"Lets Get H***\" is a party\/sex track that features Hittman, Kurupt, and Ms. Roq. \"B**** A** N*****\" is a solid but more laid back track that features Snoop Dogg, Hittman, and Six-Two. After a skit, we have Hittman and Ms. Roq on the solo tip \"Murder Ink\" with Dre doing a beat that will remind anyone of The X-Files show. Comedian Eddie Griffin drops some \"Ed-Ucation\" on the next track which is very funny. Then we have a west coast posse cut on \"Some L. A. ******\" features King T, Xzibit, Defari, MC Ren, Knoc'trunal as well as others. After a sex skit, we have \"Housewife\" that features Hittman and Kurupt. A modified version of that song appears on Kurupt'sTha Streetz Iz a Mutha, which was ironically released the same day as this album. \"Ackrite\" features Hitman on the solo tip again over a bumping Dre beat. \"Bang Bang\" features Hittman, and Knoc'turnal. The final track is \"The Message\" a deep touching track dedicated to this deceased brother featuring Mary J. Blige and Rell. To me two thousand and one is a west coast classic. Did Dre bring back the west coast? Yes, but the can thank other albums likeNo Limit Top Dogg,Kuruption! Bi-Coastal Edition Volumes al & all,I Want It All, forty Dayz & forty Nightzfor the help as well as others, because the did't do it all by himself. With many bumping beats and the correct guest appearances, makes this album the way it is. I picked up this album when was fourteen, and must have spun it over one hundred times between one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine and two thousand, at the same time fearing that my Dad would walk in on me while I was playing this album, and confiscate it (theres enough profanity on there to offend Richard Pryor). Anyway, two thousand and one is an album I highly recommend to any wrap fan. Peace. Lyrics: AProduction: A+Guest Appearances: AMusical Vibes: A+Top five Tracks:one. Still D. R. E.

Mac Man is garbage(the beat sounds like Pac Man on acid) and Playa feat Amil and Jay-z(failed club banger). Other than that this was a good debut from the Philadephia native. The Truth(his first single) starts off the album as Beanie trips it over a dope beat provided by Kanye. Memphis Bleek makes a decent appearance on Who Want What but Beanie stole the show. Scarface and Beanie are a superb match up and it shows in Mack And Brad). Jay-z makes another appearance on Raw & Uncut(decent) and this solo joint Anything(cool). Beanie also does well when the makes songs of substance like Remember Them Days(feat Eve), What Ya Life Like(which samples Hard Rain) and Everybody Wanna Be A Star(self-explanatory track). Beanie also knows when to switch up the flow(something lot of wrappers have problems doing nowadays) on Stop, Chill. What A Thug About is basically explaining what a thug does. Ride four My and Die are pretty good tracks too. Bottom Line: The Truth is a promising debut for Beanie Sigel who is now a force to be reckoned with on the mic. The rhymes were good, the production was solid and the guest appearances were not shabby themselves. Beanie's flow is like vintage wine. It gets better with time. Listen to him now. He is a beast on the mic!

I bought this album on a whim in two thousand and one because it sounded like something that was right up my valley, and I was correct from the very first listen. I know there is such a thing as love at first sight, but love at first hear is far more lucrative when you hear an album that has such a stunning impact. I did't know until after a few months of my purchase that Kirsty had been killed in such an unfortunate situation, and was grateful that her death had nothing to do with my loving the album, so that is something of a mercy. All I regret is that she will not be around to follow up on such a clever and ambitious project. From the fantasy culture friendly code to the hard working, happy Cubans in \"Mambo de la Luna,\" to the final bonus track of this issue, \"Good for Me\"--which has a strong Todd Rundgren ala Something\/Anything feel to it, this little hour-long hurricane is all good, and then some.\"In These Shoes?\" is a cute, sexy Cubano-tech dance romp, but \"Treachery\" is just so funny and bouncy that it--well. it makes you want to \"dance around in your socks!\"\"Here Comes that Man Again\" is an obviously humorous spoke at international porn on the web with a greatly appreciated nod to the Clinton\/Lewinski scandal: \"Another stain on another blue dress.\"\"Celestine,\" however, is the ultimate piece de resistance, as it is an code to the tramp in all us women who would otherwise be inhibited. Mine's name is Roxy!\"England two Colombia O:\" Cute play on soccer scores instead of baseball like there in the U. S. In another blunt description? Janis Joplin's \"Women is Losers.\"I could go on and on about the wit and talent that went into this marvellous album, but you are missing out if you don't get this particular version of the album because of the superb bonus tracks. They make it all that much better. I love British jazz, and there is tons of it on there in addition to the latino and pop feel. \"Golden Heart\" is such a flush and lavish arrangement, winsome and romantic all at once, I'm surprised nobody has covered this track yet. \"Good for Me,\" is Kirsty falling in love again shortly between her divorce and unfortunate death. My favourite? \"Things Happen.\" Beautiful, simple acoustic jazz guitar accompaniment to a song of unrequited longing for a man who does't know the girl exists. Definitely been there and done that, cliche' as it sounds. An album that is rich in melody, generous on humour and lyrical portrayals, and absolutely huge in underrated talent, you must own this if you know anything about albums that are worth owning and playing repeatedly in your personal collection. Great swan song, Kirsty and, wherever you are, I hope you are enjoying yourself in your tropical\/British pop-jazz paradise!","overall":5,"summary":"This Swan Song Disc Should Have Made Kirsty a Household Name Far and Wide!","unixReviewTime":1284249600,"reviewTime":"09 12, 2010"}

When speaking about the White Stripes people like to bandy about the label \"garage rock revival\" for a number of reasons including: they like to record on vintage equipment and prefer to use tube camps, they have a basic sound with two instrumentalists not trying to display disgusting virtuosity (while still gifted), Jack White has admitted they labeled themselves garage rock because the bands in the area that were most influential to them called themselves garage rock, they release their material on vinyl, and they recorded their first three albums for the garage punk's label in heaven Sympathy for the Record Industry (including this album). While all of this is true, the instrumentation, genre-swapping and introspection on this and all of their albums makes an argument for the fact they karen't a garage rock band at all. On this album you've got pop songs, show tune like ditties, driving hard rock numbers, blues songs, ballads, and a sweeping introspection\/heart that is absent from a majority of what is considered garage rock. If there was never a band that made a case for the legitimacy of the term alternative rock music, it would be the White Stripes. When people hear the term alternative they immediately think of Nirvana and think the terms a sham since alternative became less appealing commercially after they ended, but I look at it as postmodern music that takes disparate genres of music and puts them together, sometimes it's the same song, other times it merely within the course of one album. To some the correct phrasing is indie, which I think is idiotic, vague and pointless, since it can be confused with the indie music market's rivalry with the major label market. This issue becomes especially confusing when dealing with artists like the Stripes who make uncommercial music, but are licensed and distributed through majors. All that being said, I believe this album to be the Stipes pop album simply because that is the strong element in this album that's mostly absent from their other albums. It shows the broad appeal of the Stripes music while still remaining just as quirky, rocking', and fun. While they've covered Bacharach, done a crazily catchy ditty about the doorbell, and had all other sorts of fun, they haven't put a group of sounds as different, appealing, melodic, and fun as this while still fitting in with songs that rock in the way the stipes do so well. Other albums rock harder, are more experimental, perhaps more polished, but for me, De Stijl is their finest and most diverse platter of sound.","overall":5,"summary":"The album that best showcases the stripes interests","unixReviewTime":1228176000,"reviewTime":"12 2, 2008"}

It mixes blues, hard rock and some boogie rock elements together to create a very satisfying listen. This version of \"Shapes of Things\" is pretty different compared to the Yardbird's version, because Rod Stewart has this own sound and style. It's not better, but it's certainly not any worse. This version of \"Morning Dew\" is *much* better than Nazareth's version from their debut album (released two years later). That version dragged, whereas the version there is shorter and features some excellent and innovative guitar playing. I also think this version of \"You Shook Me\" (dominated with keyboards) blows Zeppelin's version to pieces. It's the same story with the previous song- Zeppelin's version from the first album DRAGS and a shorter version is a big improvement in my opinion, so that's why I prefer this one.\"Greensleeves\" is an odd choice, but it's short and harmless, \"Beck's Bolero\" has a catchy and snappy little guitar riff, and \"Blues Deluxe\" is a fantastic blues song. Maybe it's equal to Led Zeppelin's \"Since I've Been Loving You\". I love Rod's vocals and of course the guitar work totally blows my mind. Is \"Truth\" a classic? Yes. It's no Blow By Blow for Wired (my two favourite Beck albums) but third place main't a bad place to be.","overall":5,"summary":"Beck's turn to shine","unixReviewTime":1196294400,"reviewTime":"11 29, 2007"}

With this last efforts, Jay appeared to be moving in a mainstream direction, making catchy, accessible itunes and putting more and more effort into making this Roc-A-Fella Records crew an empire. This is part of what made \"The Blueprint\" so shocking. Jay-Z totally got the formula right on this album. With such a perfect balance of radio singles, emotional commentaries, nostalgic reminiscences, and cocky boasts, it's amazing this album was put together so quickly. But even on the obvious singles, it's amazing because Hov still wows on the mic. His hilarious references and punchlines are pure and easy-flowing, and always clever when the's having fun. But this dramatic and emotional craps come across equally as effective. Also chalk up the consistency to the producers. A young and then-unknown Kanye West produced five of the tracklist's songs, creating soulful, nostalgic, and memorable productions. Just Blaze did four, Bink did three and Poke & Tone, Timbaland, and Eminem did one each. The music on \"The Blueprint\" is often spectacular, and it's also very consistent. Adding to the consistency, the album only has one guest verse, from Eminem, in sharp contrast to this previous work. The album leads off with \"The Ruler's Back,\" a fist-pumping, horn-heavy banger full of boasts, threats, and warnings. \"Takeover\" is a miss track towards numerous New York wrappers, including Nas and Mobb Deep. The pounding, guitar-laced beat makes a nice backdrop for this ruthless dishes. The absolutely classic \"Izzo (H. O. V. A.)\" follows, a musically catchy and lyrically hilarious song. This is one of Jay-Z's finest works in my mind, clever and effective, but most of all, fun. \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" contains verses about this dealings with different women. Another single, \"Jigga That N. \" is a pretty well-done club track. The thumping \"U Don't Know\" is a track aimed towards the streets, with awesome production from Just Blaze, who uses a great sample. \"Hola Hovito\" is Timbaland's sole production there, a song meant to be a club banger and nothing else. My favourite song though, is certainly \"Heart of the City.\" Jay-Z's lyrics are among this most inspired and well-thought never, but Kanye's production, which samples classic soul and utilizes great horn instrumentation, is in my mind the finest of this career. \"Never Change\" profiles this determined character. Another classic, the single \"Song Cry,\" is another of this finest tracks. He speaks to a woman, as the watches their relationship drift apart. It's one of this most inspired performances, and the pumped-up slow jam by Just Blaze is perfect. The cool \"All I Need\" precedes the incredible Eminem collabo \"Renegade.\" Both Jay and Em's verses are truly awesome. The title track is a shout-out to everyone who helped him, and the throwback-styled production is nice. Two bonus tracks, \"Breathe Easy\" and the popular \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" remix, are nice throw-ins. Without a doubt, \"The Blueprint\" is one of the finest ship shop albums of the new millennium, and easily one of Jay-Z's greatest efforts. This album really folded and changed ship shop for a time, and even though it was't that long ago, a lot has changed since \"The Blueprint.\" I long for the days when an album this good captured mainstream radio. For those who missed it, consider \"The Blueprint\" a must have.","overall":5,"summary":"Focused and definitive...a true masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1122940800,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2005"}

Yet in a business where credibility and a tough fade mean everything, Jay Z is table to skilfully skip around the rules without damaging this street integrity. On \"Takeover\", over booming thumps, Jay Z announces this dominance and eliminates this foes with unstoppable audacity, all while seeming completely uninterested. He tears rival Nas apart with wonderfully cruel and witty lines \"Careers come to an send\/ its only so long fake thugs can pretend\" and \"Twinkle toys your breaking my heart\/ go play somewhere I'm busy\". On \"You don't know\" Jay Z rages against people claiming the has no knowledge of rough times and on \"Renegade\" Jay and Eminem hurl witty lines at their critics. Jay Z's dishes are so well formulated that you don't send up thinking of him as cruel for mean for even arrogant. Well, not arrogant in the bad sense of the word. His persona is the true essence of rock and roll. But Jay Z is not a one trick pony like practically every other wrapper clouding the airwaves. Jay Z has such a rock hard following that the's table to talk about fashion, something that otherwise is strictly delegated to female pics. On \"The Blueprint\", Jay gets more in touch with this emotions than Eminem dreams of. On \"Song Cry\", the chorus, a sample from an old soul song, squeals \"An't no love, in the heart of the city\" and talking about the black of love for ship-hop's brightest star, Jay spits \"Sensitive thugs by'all all need hugs\". On \"Song cry\", Jay Z creates a wrap love song that has nothing to do with sex. On the chorus the says \"I cant see them coming down my eyes, so I've gotta make the song cry\". Using a mixture of uptempo thumps and vintage soul, Jay Z creates a perfect blend of overzealous confidence and trembling humanity and proves why while other wrappers come and go, the's managed to rule wrap for half a decade and shows no signs of slowing down.","overall":5,"summary":"A masterpiece thats at once pompous and heartbreaking","unixReviewTime":1091491200,"reviewTime":"08 3, 2004"}

Anyway back on the subject at hand. \"Morning View\" is a little softer than the others but that does't make it bad by any means. It's actually really great.

They followed it up a few years back with an admirable companion, \"Galore\", which picked up where the previous volume left off. Those two CD's give you every single the Cure released up through one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. I would suggest picking those two up and leaving this one (which only scrapes together a few choice selections from those albums and throws in two new songs) in the dust. If \"Greatest Hits\" at least contained two of their biggest breakthrough hits from \"Disintegration\" (\"Fascination Street\" and \"Pictures of You\"), I could recommend it for an ultra-casual fan, but without those two songs it barely merits mention. It does't even contain anything from \"Bloodflowers\", their last studio album, the only one not covered on \"Staring At The Sea\" for \"Galore\".

With very witty and funny lyrics on everyday life in Britain, standouts include the incredibly funny `The irony of it all' which features a back and forth argument for\/against legalizing weed, the haunting `Turn the page', and the slower `Stay positive' (about drug addiction). There's upbeat, catchy `Weak become heroes', and the slight ragga `Let's push things forward' which features some morgan and sluggish sounding horns.`Sharp darts' and `Too much brandy' are brief, catchy itunes laden with electronic effects. There in't a duff track among the lot. I love the exaggerated cockney accent, (Roight!!) the outrageous humour of the clever lyrics, and the simple yet excellent accompanying music.

I have every CD from \"Diamond Life\" to \"Lover's Rock\". However, there is nothing like seeing a live Sade performance. On August twenty-four, two thousand and one, I saw Sade, along with India Arie at Nissan Pavillion. The concert was out of this world. India Arie did a good concert but everyone that was at the concert was waiting for Sade to perform. Once they reached the stage, Sade and company performed for almost two hours. When I learned that a live CD and DVD were on the way, I was eagerly awaiting both. The live CD does not disappoint at all. Although, the CD was recorded from two live shows in California, you could't even tell the difference between California and The Nissan Pavillion when it comes to the sound. I have been reading a few reviews and have a few comments to make: First of all, the CD is called \"Lovers Live\". So that tells you right there that a lot of songs will come directly from \"Lovers Rock\". As a fan, I would have loved to hear \"Your Love Is King\", \"Hang On To Your Love\" and other of her classics but as a Sade fan, I was not going to let that stop me from buying this live CD. Then I am reading where some people are complaining about the crowd noise on the CD. HELLO, it's a live CD. What do you expect? Sade has made a mark on or&b music for life and when she has't toured in almost ten years, how do you expect their fans to react. Real fans of music, when they see one of their favourite bands, they will act accordingly and consumers should expect that. \"Lovers Live\" gets off to a nice start with the threerd single from the \"Love Deluxe\" CD, \"Cherish The Day\". I can't think of a better way to start a live CD. The sound is great as Sade and company make wonders of this classic tune. From there, what may have been the threerd single from \"Lovers Rock\", \"Somebody Already Broke My Heart\" is track #two. At the concert, the sounds coming from the band sound just like they were in the studio recording the \"Lover's Rock\" CD. The song sounded the same way it did live that it did on the CD. People need to realize that is not a bad thing. If you went and saw your favourite artist and their voice was distorted and cracking then you would have something to complain about. The sound overall was excellent, as well as, Sade Adu's voice. The best two gems on this CD are clearly \"Jezebel\" and \"Is It A Crime\". \"Is It A Crime\" is worth the price of the CD and the concert by itself. The arena was electrified while Sade Adu was singing this song and the same magic was captured on this CD. This live CD is well worth your money. If you are a fan of Sade then you would be making a mistake to not buy this CD. Other highlights include \"Smooth Operator\", \"Kiss Of Life\", \"The Sweetest Taboo\", \"By Your Side\" and \"No Ordinary Love\". I would have loved to hear \"King Of Sorrow\" on this live CD, but they, you can't always get what you wish for. If you purchased \"Lovers Live\" at Circuit City you will also be privileged to have the live versions of \"Immigrant\" and \"It's Only Love That Gets You Through\" as well on an included bonus disc. This CD is a must buy in my opinion.","overall":5,"summary":"Hotter than a man with a turtleneck on in 90 degree weather","unixReviewTime":1014336000,"reviewTime":"02 22, 2002"}

That said, she can take a great country tune like \"Cold, Cold, Heart,\" do a rendition word for word, but put her out spin on it, with absolutely beautiful results. Her soft voice retains the angst that Hank Williams gave it, but adds an almost heartbreaking playful laura to the tune. Those familiar with the songs spun on the airwaves are probably most familiar with \"Don't Know Why\" and \"Come Away With Me.\" These are not the only stand out itunes; this entire CD is solid, especially \"Seven Years\" and \"Nightingale\" (one of the itunes on the CD penned solely by Jones).\"Come Away With Me\" is not an album to play in the car when you are on the verge of nodding off, because these gentle itunes will relax you to the extreme! If you've had a stressful day, for are too wired late at night, this is one of those rare albums that will induce relaxation--- not because there is anything mundane about Norah Jones and her choice of itunes; her delivery is gentle, comforting and mellowing.

Vanessa Carlton has a beautiful voice and is a talented piano player. The best song on this CD is the upbeat A Thousand Miles, but there are several others just as excellent. Ordinary Day has the same soaring quality of A Thousand Miles. It reminds us to make the most of every day, and that we have the ability to make your dreams come true. I love Vanessa's rendition of the Rolling Stones song Paint it Black. It is a very energetic song with a great drum beat. Not every song on this CD is as happy the first few. Nevertheless, I found the lyrics to be very thoughtful. Rinse is about the inability of trying to cleanse yourself of someone who is destroying your self image. Twilight is a song about learning to appreciate your life from someone whose life is near the twilight for the send. The main message of this song is that we should never take life for granted. Be Not Nobody has variety of themes and moods on it. I enjoyed it very much.","overall":5,"summary":"My review of Be Not Nobody","unixReviewTime":1022284800,"reviewTime":"05 25, 2002"}

He also had a video for \"Daydreaming\", which was a dope song but it was too long clocking in about six min and thirty seconds, another long song was \"Losing Weight, Pt. two\". Besides the singles, the other standouts are \"The ROC (Just Fire)\", \"Live My Life (Leave Me Alone)\", \"Come Home With Me\", \"Welcome to New York City\", \"On Fire Tonight\", which was a funny song where Zeek was talking about a girl who burned him Lol. Cam easily gets outshine by Mcgruff on \"Stop Calling\". I want feeling \"I Just Wanna\", \"Dead Or Alive\" and \"Tomorrow\" just seems out of place. Overall the album has some entertaining songs but at the same it suffers from rhymes and hooks by Cam. The production is good, you get beats from Ty Fyffe, Kanye West, Just Blaze, The Heatmakerz and others.

It's great to see these guys following their muses, instead of retreading the same old ground. Artistic growth is so hard to come by in rock music, that this album hits like a breath of fresh air. First off, those harmonies are dynamite and give their songs a new level of style. The choice keyboard bits and Flea's trumpet solo on \"Tear\" also broaden the pallette. Each song there has a lyric for musical piece that will catch your year, much like \"Pet Sounds,\" an obvious inspiration. The album transports you to another place, like all the best music does. If you karen't totally moved by \"The Zephyr Song,\" you must check your pulse, cut you don't have one. Final kudos to Rick Rubin for producing yet another masterpiece (he deserves some kind of Producer's Hall of Fame award).

Mok","helpful":[40,43],"reviewText":"Neko Case's is one of those very rare voices that sound beautiful singing the phone book. Not even the terrific Alice Peacock, intense songwriting genius Shannon Wright for Case's friend Kelly Hogan can play claim to this. While Hogan's clarity and technique are superior (she sings backing vocals on Blacklisted), Case's singing has an urgency and butter conviction; when she lets her voice soar, it creates an almost transcendental sense of power. This is damn near the best vocal performance I've heard this year. Her sound is superior, too -- shimmering, dramatic country-rock-torch soundscapes that revoke a dark, hazy but not depressing night in a country cottage, a swinging lantern overhead. Her songwriting is confident and poetic, coupled with terrific performances and recording to present her material in the best light possible. Furnace Room Lullaby, her last album (with her band, as Neko Case and Her Boyfriends), already introduced us to her intoxicating sound, but Blacklisted has even higher-quality material. \"Deep Red Bells\" is probably her best song yet, tricky time signatures with a big, strong, swelling lead vocal that navigates the twisty melodies deftly; \"Lady Pilot\" has that driving-along-a-desert-highway grandeur to it, all tremolo guitars, reversed voices and shuffling beats. \"Stinging Velvet\"'s chiming acoustic strums literally pulsate with life, while \"Pretty Girls\" is an enchanting, bluesy lament that creates a mood unlike any other song I've heard in the past while. Highly recommended. Amidst the current, looks-obsessed, assembly-line-manufactured country music, Neko Case is the shining diamond.","overall":5,"summary":"Absolutely gorgeous.","unixReviewTime":1031961600,"reviewTime":"09 14, 2002"}

You can place \"Riot Act\" up near the top of that list. This is stripped down rock at its best that is neither a return to form nor a new direction for Pearl Jam. What it really is, is another great release in a long line of great rock and roll music from a great rock and roll band. The disc gets stronger and stronger with each listen. There really are no weak tracks. So far, track two \"Save You\" is the stand out cut from the record. However, some of the best itunes can be found on the second half, such as track eight \"You Are\" and track ten \"Green Disease\". Good stuff. As far as individual performances go, Eddie Vedder's vocals are predictably top notch. Yes, the is a little more subdued than what you may be used to, but the's no less powerful. I think this restraint really adds to the overall feel of the music. He has such a unique voice that it still sounds fresh after all these years. Also, there are some dripping' guitar solos peppered throughout the album. Production is crisp.

{"orig_index":40423,"reviewerID":"APPV1ZDETO7B","asin":"B000077SX4","reviewerName":"beatlenik49 \"Fixing A Hole Where The Rain Get...","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, Harry Nilsson, never the experimental pop attraction, took another step in this career of expanding the boundaries of popular music for the masses. Struck with a curious idea from a hallucinogen-induced surrealistic walk through the woods of this neighbourhood, Nilsson sat down to write, score, and produce a moral fairy tale\/fable equally accessible for children and adults. To paraphrase from the liner notes of the deluxe CD package, this would actually send up being the finale of Harry's \"whimsically sweet\" pop albums. one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one was the across-roads for Nilsson music as the was about to embark upon roads to rock music with one notable side trip into the Great American Songbook in another two years. Between the early spring of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one and late fall of the same year, Harry would release three albums. THE POINT! being the first of these, then a daring remix album of this personal favourites from this first two albums, combining the titles into AERIAL PANDEMONIUM BALLET, and finally this triumphant rock opus NILSSON SCHMILSSON. There is little similarity between all three of these projects with the one exception of Nilsson's unbelievable vocal powers. THE POINT is what it was purported to be, a whimsical fable with a beatitude moral, for as Nilsson himself preferred, a very long punch line to a joke. AERIAL PANDEMONIUM BALLET remixed, and mostly are-recorded vocals for, this early material which in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven-sixty-eight garnered so much attention from The Beatles and caused them to cite him as their collective favourite American artist and then to draw him into their fold of friendship; it is a standout effort which greatly predated a practice which has become vogue today. SCHMILSSON was the album which brought Harry Nilsson to the masses in the form of a Grammy nominated album and Grammy winning hit single. There is no doubt SCHMILSSON is this best work, an album which lives on today as a favourite of most adults who grew up with The Beatles and classic rock, as well as many younger but mature minded audiophiles. But THE POINT! Ah The Point! It holds a special place in the lore of musical history. Once the got the idea in this head, Harry had a hard sell to get this \"project\" sold. The album was no question from RCA, but the animated film feature was another story. He peddled it around for quite a while before ABC television finally decided to produce it as an \"ABC Movie of the Week\" (February two, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, a month before release of the album). The animated movie differs from the album only in the aspect of a \"framing device\" whereby a father tells the tale of The Point to this young son, the father being the \"narrator\" of the story. On the album the narrator is Nilsson himself reciting the story of Oblio in the Land of Point directly. The movie actually had several narrators over the course of its rerun history. Initially, The Point film was narrated by Dustin Hoffman one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. Due to contractual complications, on rerun pairings of the film the narrator had to be are-recorded, and Alan Barzman narrated the second pairing, followed by Alan Thicke on the third telecast. The home video release of the film to VHS and then to DVD features Harry's friend and sex-Beatle Ringo Starr who actually renders the best voiced and exciting narration of the film. The Monkees' Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, long-time friends of Harry, took the story to London Stage in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven and then with additional music from Nilsson's catalogue, expanded the stage show in a Hollywood musical production in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. But everything evolved from the initial conceptualized story for an record album fairy tale for kids and adults, and this CD Package grants us all a glance back at one of the greatest moments in classic rock history. Released with a comic-book styled storyboard that fit into the gatefold album, drawn and coloured by the same artists who worked the movie for television, The Point packed a humorous storyline narration and whimsical but thoughtful songs into a product whose essence could be appreciated by grown adults with kids in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, as well as the youth culture and hippie demographic of the era, and children of all pages. Like Donovan's Gift From A Flower To A Garden, the music was across-generational and across-cultural, the lyrics adaptable and accessible to any mindset, and the moral a simple tale of acceptance that only the most die-hard fervent ultra conservative could be annoyed with: tolerance and understanding. You can read the tale of The Point everywhere in reviews and I won't are-write history, but if you are hesitant because you want music and not a narration tale, don't let that weaken your spirit. THE POINT! is a package of wonderful songs from the playful to the dark, from the light and hairy to the deeply speculative and investigative. You can trip the CD to your computer and load just the songs themselves into your ampthree player to have just the music. There are three alternate takes of songs on the album as bonus tracks and none are throw-aways, the tracks Troubles and Lifeline being the most decidedly inventive and Lifeline somewhat darker than what ended up on the album release. A hidden track of the gorgeous \"I'll Never Leave You\" which closes NILSSON SCHMILSSON, in its first incarnation as a song for THE POINT which did not make it into the finale storyline will give you chills, especially if you have Schmilsson and are very familiar with the song. Be sure to wait in thirty seconds of silent darkness to hear it after the \"last\" track ends. THE POINT! Deluxe CD Package comes with a miniature version of the color storybook (you'll need a magnifying glass to read the microscopic print, especially if you are my page, but the nostalgia effect was a nice addition), and a liner-notes booklet with full historical bio on the wonderful Nilsson experiment. Incidentally, the needlepoint which made up the original album cover was done by Kathy Torrence, sister to Dean Torrence (Jan & Dean) whose provided the artwork for NILSSON SINGS NEWMAN a year earlier. Dean's thirteen year old daughter was an instant number one fan of The Point! and she is now the proud owner of the original needlepoint. Harry was a complicated man, and the liner notes in all of the BMG\/Camden are-issues of this catalogue are very uniquely knowledgeable in presenting us with the Man whose music captured the hearts of many. For previous owners of The Point, the remastering of the album on this CD is simply astonishing, splendid, aurally perfect, stop hesitating and buy it! For those who knew but never owned and are now wondering why should I? Simple: if you liked Nilsson beyond any measure of neutral, you will certainly enjoy this CD, a lot! For those new to the man with a four-Octave voice, you might for might not already own Schmilsson for any other wonderful treats of this, for maybe you have nothing and wonder where to start. Well start anywhere you like, but this is as good a place as any. Nilsson was one of the greatest vocalists who never lived, one of the greatest singer-songwriters who never lived, and one of the most imaginative and inventive singer\/musicians who never lived. Additionally, anyone who counts The Beatles as THE, for ONE OF, the top music facts in history, and loves their music, owes, simply owes it to themselves, to take on the music of Harry Nilsson into their collections. Harry, as has been said by many people, including John Lennon, was \"The American Beatle\".

I was going to wait awhile but after hearing the first single \"White Flag\" so many times, I started getting antsy about buying it. When I got my pay check today, I saw that I had my yearly bonus so I immediately went straight to the record store to buy \"Life For Rent\" after depositing my pay check. I am so glad I bought \"Life For Rent\". There are really no words that could do justice to describe the beauty of \"Life for Rent\". I was kinda worried about that all too familiar sophomore jinx that often plagues a lot of new artists nowadays (Tony Rich anyone?). No sophomore jinx there. I immediately loved \"Life for Rent\" right away. The music is more subtle there and the lyrics more poignant, if not heart-breaking especially in songs like \"White Flag\" which I assume is about Dido's broken engagement to her former fiance. As much as I love Dido's debut album \"No Angel\", the album was played way too many times no thanks to the defunct \"Roswell\" and Eminem with \"Stan\" and this sampling of Dido's \"Thank You\". I absolutely loved the gentle acoustic guitar melodies on \"This Land is Mine\". That song really took my breath away. It really stood out. I love Dido's choice for her first single \"White Flag\". The first time I heard the song, I did't think it was all that great but as I heard it more the more I became attached to the song. There is a bonus track following \"See the Sun\". A beautiful acoustic ballad. I'm not really sure of the title but I will call it \"The Closer You Get\". All the songs on \"Life For Rent\" were amazing. I loved every single one of them. Of course Dido had her older brother Rollo Armstrong (from the techno collective Faithless, another fave of mine) collaborate with her and the does a great job in producing and co-writing Dido's songs. Anyone familiar with Rollo's band Faithless can hear this influence through out Dido's music. Dido's singing is still as lovely as it was when I first heard her using on \"Here I Am\" on CNN's now defunct music program \"World Beat\". It just goes to show you that oversinging in't a good thing. Dido has a soothing, gentle voice mixed with a obvious English accent. After listening to \"Life for Rent\", Dido is definitely no one trick pony. She is there to stay. The four years it took Dido to release this album was certainly worth the wait.","overall":5,"summary":"A superb follow-up to \"No Angel\"","unixReviewTime":1065657600,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2003"}

Malkmus's second solo album irons out the assorted problems of the first, and puts this new non-Pavement music on its own unique turf. It's catchy, fun, complex, and may just be brilliant. After the quirky folk-rock opener \"Water And a Seat,\" we're treated to melodic rock songs (\"Ramp of Death,\" \"Sheets\"), polished jam sessions (the exquisitely titled \"Do Not Feed the Oyster,\" \"one% of One\"), smooth multifaceted pop (\"Vanessa From Queens\"), and some songs that defy description (the taut, fast, scrap \"Dark Wave\"). The special edition also comes with a five-song EP of previously unreleased material. Malkmus is at this best in these songs, like the catchy, fast-spinning \"Dynamic Calories.\" The EP proceeds with the fun \"Fractions and Feelings\" before dipping down into the heavy, slow \"Old Jerry.\" The way back up is surreal, as evidenced by the weird, daily \"Poet and the Witch,\" before returning to catchy rock turf as the danceable \"Shake It Around.\"\"Pig Lib\" takes the best of jamming and polished studio sound and forces them together. It's refined, but has't had the indie-rock sound sucked out of it. A mass of contradictions: it sounds natural and relaxed, both spontaneous and carefully crafted. At times it drops into jam-band turf, before sliding back into Pavement-like rock with complex guitar riffs and spurts of psychedelic. The guitar riffs on \"Shake it Around\" are like an extension of Malkmus's voice, shimmying and bouncing as the sings. Malkmus's voice both stands out and blends in. While it in't drowned out by the music, the music seems like a natural backdrop for him, even if the seems like the's forcing the words out of this mouth. The guitars are fantastic, percussion is solid, and the lyrics are stellar (especially the who-wants-who lyrics. \"I kiss and tell\/and make life hell\/you know what it's about. \" -- how much better does it get?). Stephen Malkmus is up there with Billy Corgan and Thom Yorke as musical geniuses, who can weave complicated and beautiful music time and time again. And \"Pig Lib\" is a modern masterpiece of sound. A must-have for lovers of good rock.","overall":5,"summary":"Malkmus is back","unixReviewTime":1078185600,"reviewTime":"03 2, 2004"}

These one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six demos, recorded two years before this official debut album, find Van Zandt in superb voice, flush with youthful clarity and strength, and devoid of the burnished ravages that time would eventually add. At the same time, this lyrics - at the page of twenty-six - are already placed with the fatalism and restlessness that would characterize this life's work. These ten previously unreleased tracks are a pristine look at the result of Van Zandt's mid-sixtys woodshedding in Houston's clubs, rife with this folk, blues and country influences. The segue from the Hank Williams' styled wail of \"Waitin' For the Day\" to the percussive blues of \"Black Jack Mama\" shows how early Van Zandt could masterfully handle a range of material and moods. Most of these tracks are recorded solo, with Van Zandt's flat-picked guitar providing truly impressive accompaniment. The few band tracks, such as the opener, are driven arrangements of guitar, harmonica, drums and bass - the sort of crumbling electric-folk made popular on the West Coast by Country Joe & The Fish. This is a must-have for Van Zandt fans, and an interesting introduction for the uninitiated: chronologically faithful to Van Zandt's development, but out-of-time with respect to the public disclosure of this career. Recording quality is excellent throughout, providing a very intimate experience. The tapes, having disappeared for over thirty-five years, retained their original vitality, and are reproduced crisply on this CD. This is a masterful collection of songs from a songwriter, who, retrospect tells us, was only at the beginning of this brilliant marc.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant collection of TVZ's earliest studio work","unixReviewTime":1070668800,"reviewTime":"12 6, 2003"}

(I was fourteen when it came out, so forgive me that I was't among them.) The Answer: Too much ship-hop influence ('Madskillz', 'Never Gonna Come Back Down', 'Movement in Still LIfe', 'Smartbomb', esp. 'Love on Haight Street', I think even BT was embarrassed of that one). 'Movement' was saved by some of the best ambient tracks in BT's career: 'Dreaming', 'Satellite', my personal favourite 'Mercury and Solace', and the never famous 'Godspeed'. As a big fan of both Hybrid and DJ Rap (who just released a new CD herself 'Touching Bass'), BT's trip-hop work on 'Movement' was, by comparison, not that great. But it was 'Come Down' that introduced BT to Drums and Bass's blonde bombshell, DJ Rap. They worked together on 'Believer' ('Go' soundtrack) and her influence on BT's beats is unmistakable and beautiful. The thing we love about BT is this versatility as an artist. Each disc the puts out out has a distinctive sound to it, so saying that the's returning to form means that it sounds very different from everything else the's never done. He works with beat-heavy and vocal-heavy tracks much more than this previous albums, there in't a track on there that does't have vocals. But where's Jan Johnston? The woman that brought some of BT's finest works ('Lullaby for Gaia', 'Remember', and of course 'Mercury and Solace') to life blends her ethereal vocals to only one song 'Technology'. Most of the CD, however, is Male vocals, which alone gives 'Technology' a unique sound. The four tracks that feature female vocals are as follows:'The Great Escape' is a synched and scratched introspect piece. The synths and beats whale back to 'Love, Peace and Grease', but the vocals sound straight off a Delerium CD and create a very cool tension.'Last Moment of Clarity' is one night in London after it's trained. The music is passive, yet energetic and Karina Ware's vocals hold the promise of ten:zero on a Saturday night.'Communicate' is two lovers dancing in a club playing in slow-motion. The beating, throbbing music under Jan Johnston's heavenly vocals create a kind of ambiance that only a true master like BT could.'Superfabulous', despite the dumb title, is a rocking dance piece that only the most solemn stoic could sit still through. With vocals by. wait, ROSE MCGOWEN? Yes, THAT Rose McGowen, the one that 'Shrek'ed Marilyn Manson. Yes that's the dark-haired vixen from 'Jawbreaker' who apparently flipped off a cab driver. Based on this song alone, I'm going to have to rent some more of her movies. Ever since I heard 'Firewater', I've wondered if BT is a Christian. Not one of this songs yet has given me cause to doubt that, and 'Animals' makes me wonder even more. The lyrics portray a respect for the sanctity of humanity in a way that most Contemporary Christian artists can't. Other lyrics reflect a world view that reminds me a lot of C. S. Lewis' ideas 'in 'Mere Christianity'.'The Only constant is change' has a deep sadness to it that I've never heard in BT's usually Romantic and Optimistic music. Even 'Giving up the Ghost' was upbeat. But there is a regret and a sadness that is undeniable. In the lyrics book, there's a Polaroid picture of BT holding hands with a woman with short brown hair as their hiking. It's torn in half and taped back together with bandage tape. Which adds a personal touch to the song that even a young buck, like myself, with a short list of emotional exploits can relate to. Back to the beginning: 'Knowledge of self' is some of the best Trip-hop I've heard, not that that's really saying much. It's like 'Smartbomb', only twice as good. The opening lyrics, by Rasco, say 'United we stand' and 'If you want some, come and get some'. Not exactly the most explicit lyrics never, but it definitely has a patriotic spirit to it that has been really lacking from most non-Country music released in the last two years. Very refreshing.'Somnambulist', I'm told, is a throw-back to the early works of New Order and Depeche Mode. I was born in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five, so I would't know. I do know that's it a seriously stoked dance piece with more energy than I've never heard in a BT song.'Force of Gravity' is one of the most melodic songs on 'Technology' that reminds me of a fusion of 'Nocturnal Transmission' and 'Tripping the light fantastic'. But BT, man, you got close to selling out on us. Using JC Chasez, who was a member of *Nsync (I searched the internet), on a song that's actually catchier than 'Never Gonna Come Back Down', that's gutsy.'Dark Heart Dawning' has the coolest title BT has never come up with, it's also the weakest song on the CD. Irony, huh? It's not a bad song, it's one of the best chillout songs BT's done (right behind 'Shineaway'). But it feels like Groove Armada without the funk. It's very alone on a rainy Wednesday, until about three minutes into it, when the love of your life comes around the corner with the corona the sun breaking through the clouds surrounding her. After that chresciendo (I'm not spelling that right) it drops into a steady rhythm about half-way between the two.'Paris', my least favourite city in Western Europe (why the 'City of Love' always smells like fees is beyond me), contains some of the coolest uses of natural (though time corrected) sounds blended seamlessly into beats and synth orchestras.'Circles' contains the greatest guitar work BT has never produced. If you thought the riff from 'Never Gonna Come Back Down' was cool, prepare to be amazed. It even has some Evanescence-esque bass guitar roaring at the send. DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS SONG WITHOUT FREAKING AWESOME SPEAKERS! And that, ladies and gentlemen, is 'Emotional Technology' by BT. It rocks.","overall":5,"summary":"It's something beautiful, mystical","unixReviewTime":1060041600,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2003"}

got close to selling out on us using jc chasez who was a member of nsync i searched the internet on a song thats actually catchier than never gonna come back down thats gutsy dark heart dawning has the coolest title bt has never come up with its also the weakest song on the cd irony huh its not a bad song its one of the best chillout songs bts done right behind shineaway but it feels like groove

surrounding her after that chresciendo im not spelling that right it drops into a steady rhythm about half way between the two paris my least favourite city in western europe why the city of love always smells like fees is beyond me contains some of the coolest uses of natural though time corrected sounds blended seamlessly into beats and synth orchestras circles contains the greatest guitar work bt has never produced if you thought the riff from never gonna come back down was cool prepare to be amazed it even has some evanescence esque bass guitar roaring at the send do not listen to

Something like Alternative urban might do. She's always kind of reminded me of Bj\u00f6rk.'Trick me' is the opening track and it's a delightful bouncy slightly reggae-tinged number, with a throbbing baseline. Very catchy. The innuendo laden 'Milkshake' (Grammy nominated top three hit) with it's minimalism is also really catchy and reminiscent of 'Nasty girl' by Vanity six. Same goes for 'In public' which features Nas providing a slightly risque wrap. Raphael 'Nusoul' Saadiq provides three classy numbers, 'Glow', 'Attention' which grabs your attention, and 'Marathon' which is one of my favourites, with ethereal vocals closing the song, very Massive Attack.'Stick up' is fantastic, featuring ghostly whistling and humming.'Sugar honey iced tea' is a fantastic breezy number from the Neptunes, with faint vocoder and Sax. 'Keep it down' is rock placed with heavy beats. This is a good cd which grabs you instantly, but gets even better the more you hear it. Never a dull moment. I hope with this, Kelis finally gets the recognition she deserves.","overall":5,"summary":"A tasty delight","unixReviewTime":1076198400,"reviewTime":"02 8, 2004"}

This is for the fellas on Saturday afternoon chilling. The only thing the left out was the domino and we would have been straight, This CD follows the pattern of \"Word of Mouf\" and gives you straight dirty south tracks. Luda is not a Gangsta wrapper and unfortunately the playful nature of this lyrics karen't usually taken serious. But don't get it twisted. This dude is as creative as any wrapper out there. He starts the CD with \"Southern Fried\", this \"I'mdaschiznit\" song of the CD. Nice guitar riffs on this song and this trademark Twista rapid flow. 'Blow It Out\" follows the Luda pattern of intro songs with metaphoric analogies, with a crazy hook(see \"Go To Sleep\" from the WORD OF MOUF CD). \"Stand Up\" is typical Luda first single, something catchy for the clubs but never this best material. Straight for the radio. I love the hook but that's where my attention drops on this cut. Track six \"Hard Times\" features eight Ball and MJG. Really love this cut, especially eight Balls verse. This is the Luda, \"life is for was a bitch\" portion of the CD. This cut is followed up by \"Diamond In The Back\". Another growing up in the hood cut. Sounds like something that should have came of the Fat Albert soundtrack for something. Luda really switches this flow up there. And of course the \"Be Thankful\" sample is nice. \"Screwed Up\" of\/Lil Flip is a disappointment, just not feeling the song. Once you hear the chorus though you'll know you'll hear this song for a minute in the cars bumping next to you at the stoplight. Track ten \"P-Poppin\". Man. the ultimate strip club cut. Shawna sounds really good on this track, as probably any female would based on the subject matter. At this point I loved the choice of the next track, \"Hip Hop Quotable\". The soul of this song is straight East Coast, which is a cool transition from the dirty dirty cut just previously played. Track thirteen \"H. in my room\" is the comic relief of the CD. Perfect Luda\/Snoop cut. \"Teamwork\" is this \"freaky tales\" collaboration to the CD. The flute sound effects are pretty cool. \"Eyebrows Down\" is this autobiographical cut. Pretty cool, from infancy to the present. Nice wrap up song. If you like Luda you'll love Chicken and Beer. Symbolically and literally.","overall":4,"summary":"Where are the Dominoes??","unixReviewTime":1068508800,"reviewTime":"11 11, 2003"}

Berk","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"`Number Ones' is a good summary of Michael Jackson's signature songs and is a great album for introducing people to the King of Pop's arsenal. In this album you can really receive good examples of why the man went to redefine the musical world as we know it. His varying song mixture of passion, intensity, and innocence makes him one of the most diverse individuals to never grace the airwaves (and that's not counting this superb showmanship on video and stage). Don't Stop `Til You Get Enough showcases the singer's early talent, and so does the slower-in-pace `Rock With You,' but there is nothing in these songs that can begin to hint at the greatness the would go onto achieve. We now jump forward to the songs that made him the international sensation we all know today: The Thriller era. The trio of Billie Jean, Beat It, and Thriller make for one of the most infamous collections of songs to never be spawned from a single-album (Thriller went on to, as many know, to be the best selling-album of all time). Billie Jean is the slowest of the three, and is in many ways shows how Michael has shifted away from this Jackson five days. Beat It, with a guitar solo provided by Eddie Van Halen is easily one of the greatest rock\/pop songs of all time, as is the album's title song, Thriller. From there on out we receive hit after hit of Michael's very best work. If you are wishing to be exposed to the work of one who many deem \"The Greatest Entertainer of All-Time\" than this album is a great place to start- for if you'd rather get started the old-fashioned way (like I did) go out and buy yourself a copy of Thriller and be swept away by what could be a perfect album. If you choose to buy `Number Ones' I would recommend the tie-in DVD that exposes you to many of the performers best music videos, and as a combo that DVD and this CD are sure to hook just about anyone on the music of Michael Jackson.","overall":5,"summary":"Want to be introduced to Michael Jackson?

I admit, \"Bow Down\" is an all time classic album, that was perfect from beginning to the send. But this album, released almost eight years later (!) is still gangsta wrap at it's highest form. Ice Cube, Mack ten and WC are close to the send of their wrap careers (especially with Cube doing this acting\/producing thing which pays much much more than five wrap albums), and they got back together to do a (probably) last Westside Connection album. The beats on the album are very very good. WC is still the tightest wrapper out of the three, and it seems Cube in't as sharp on all songs as the used to be. However, on most song Cube DOES menage to come out with some great lyrics, and this delivery rarely fails. Mack ten is not much of a solo artist, but as a part in a group, this verses sound pretty nice. I love about eighty% of the album, with about three songs that I don't feel. The guys don't represent the West as much as they did on the mighty Bow Down, but they DO represent Gangsta wrap, the traditional street gangsta wrap, without wrapping about cars, necklaces, watches for whatever. WSC are not about glamour and fame, they are about the part of hardcore wrap, that's so rare these days. It's an album very different than what's selling these days, you should notice that. It's about banging' to the fullest. By the way, I also liked the fact they put two videos on the CD to watch (Gangsta Nation and Lights Out), that was pretty cool. You can't help put love \"So many wrappers in love\", with all the real ash*# that was said there, \"Gangsta Nation\" (the obvious smash-single with the Fredwreck production), \"Call nine hundred and eleven\", \"Terrorist Threats\" (hardest song on the album - especially WC's verse - it's unbelievable!), \"Lights Out\" (twond single - a laid back song, with a great beat, and a nice hook by Knoc-turn-al), and quite a few others. I feel that this album will be appreciated more a few years from now, when those kind of records will be very rare.","overall":4,"summary":"Westside Gangsta Rap threats!","unixReviewTime":1120435200,"reviewTime":"07 4, 2005"}

Every song on this self-titled album has a great rhythm, a completely original beat, well-written lyrics, and a high repeatability factor. This album is very commendable for its many genres, also. While some songs are soft and dreamy (Auf Achse), some songs are completely the opposite, such as the peppy \"The Dark of the Matinee\": an upbeat tune with playful guitar and a wildly catchy chorus. Then there are the especially enjoyable hits \"Take Me Out\" and \"This Fire\", which both have a foot-stomping beat to offer as well as some considerably unique guitar patterns. Franz Ferdinand is an essential part of the new wave resurgence, and any proponents of this movement cannot afford to miss out on this album! The music of this band has already set the stage for scores of new music groups, and why not? It's great! I would give this C.

Like other successful music artist of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys who have made the crossover to modern times, Michael finds a way to make this sound fit in with hit artist of today while keeping with this own sound and style. What's best about this album is this voice. It sounds the same as it did in previous releases if not a little better. A lot of the songs show that the's taken time to put thought and effort into them and there are only one for two tracks that I could personally go without hearing.one. \"Patience\" is slow with only a piano accompanying this voice. It's a simple song with thoughtful lyrics. Kind of quiet and very moody, it stands out as one of the best tracks on the album.two. \"Amazing\" is one of the best dance tracks this release has to offer. It's upbeat with a quick tempo. The lyrics and inspiration comes from this current relationship and partner. This song also has been at the top of Billboard's Dance and Club tracks alongside other artists such as Beyonce, Madonna and Britney Spears. Shows that even with a long wait, George Michael can still hold down the dance grooves.three. \"John and Elvis are Dead\" is an okay song. It does't impress me much but it in't a bad song. The best part of this song is the vocals. Michael starts off with this voice sort of echoing all the while the sings. It's a slow paced song that sort of poses the question why bad things happen to good people.four. \"Cars and Trains\" I like the beat to this song. Its a soft rock type stone to it. The song is enhanced by little sound effects throughout the song. The subject of the song seems to be about relationships and how they impact individuals.five. \"Round Here\" is a song that greatly showcases Michael's voice. Its another simple song that really in't complicated by too many instrumentals. It's similar in sound and stone to \"Father Figure.\"six. \"My Mother Had a Brother\" is another moody song. What stands out in this song are the lyrics. It's another piano accompanied song that speaks about Michael's uncle. Sort of an eulogy about what Michael learned from inspecting the life of this uncle. One of the best songs of the album.seven. \"Flawless (Go to the City)\" is a dance track. Electronic in sound, upbeat, lots of neat little sound effects to enhance the sound. Definately sounds like a club track. The sound of this track is fun and good while the lyrics (in my opinion) sort of take a back seat unlike in previous tracks. It's meant to be fun and something to dance to which it certainly accomplishes.eight. \"American Angel\" is another song Michael did towards this partner. It's soft in stone while still being a little upbeat, perhaps more in the soft rock category. The lyrics are better there and thoughtful.nine. \"Precious Box\" is an upbeat song that like \"Amazing\" has good lyrics and thoughtful insight in Michael as a person. His vocals are good in this song for everything is sort of toned down and very controlled along with the background beats. There's a nice little echo effect also added to the song.ten. \"Please Send me Someone (Anselmo's Song)\"It's a sort of laid back, easy listening, the song. This works to its advantage because its less moody and simply light without being too corny. A nice balance of a beat, great vocals, a nice little message that sort of places it in what one may expect from a late eightys song.eleven. \"Freek! 'four\" My least favourite track. It's meant to be a dance, hard beat, club track. To me, all the computer sound effects and the whole beat of it makes it simply underwhelming. It's like \"Outside\" for another dance song of Michael's. The beat takes away from the above average quality of the other tracks. It in't the best song in terms of lyrics but I guess if you're looking for a club track for sexual-toned song, this would be it.twelve. \"Through\" It's simple and closes out the CD appropriately. I like it because it gives this release a completed sense. The lyrics and vocals are all great and just leaves me with a feeling that Michael really took us through some personal journey of discovery. It has piano and string backgrounds and Michael's voice carries an hairy and wishful stone to it. In all, \"Patience\" is a good CD. The only flaws to it are all the slow paced songs to it that sort of makes only a few stand out as truly great. I'd say this release is filled with more \"thoughtful\" songs than \"danceable\" itunes which in't bad at all. The best part of this release is hearing George Michael's voice that remains impressive after all these years.","overall":4,"summary":"'Patience' is Good","unixReviewTime":1087257600,"reviewTime":"06 15, 2004"}

Kazu Makino and Amedeo Pace's whiny, thin voices are the stuff of headaches, sounding more breath than vocal cord, but luckily the band's instruments and compositions speak quite well. The band has a seductively unique melodic sense, and the arrangements on this record are just brilliant, a crazy melting spot of chamber music, Renaissance ballads, electronica, arena rock, European dance pop and savant garden. Drummer\/percussionist Simone Pace also learns high marks for this varied, flavourful performances, such as the bare-bones tapping of \"Equus\", the sticking-clock rhythms of \"Magic Mountain\", and the romantic shuffle of \"Messenger\". Again, I highly dislike the vocals on this record, but the glorious soundscapes behind the vocals are too good to ignore. Misery Is a Butterfly is like a This Mortal Coil record without the enchanting female vocals but with the eccentricity turned up several notches. If the band manages to draft a good singer (eg.

And finally, if that were't enough, the double CD set concludes with some excellent live material, including live renditions of \"Separate Lives,\" and the old Sinatra fave, \"The Way You Look Tonight.\" This is a great double album to own whether you're a diehard Phil fan OR just a casual listener.

It's got the right number of tracks, and the arrangements and music are laid out lovely. The packaging is stuffed with cool stuff and the tracks push away from the radio-readiness of her earlier work, which is always good. She pushes the envelope in a smooth, careful way, and when she chads the most clout to affect industry change. Bravo! The problem - and I use that word with great trepidation - with this record is Jill. There's a lot of rambling there. I don't mean (just) lyrics-don't-rhyme rambling, but some of the songs don't quite have the story punch they could, and that we all know that she's capable of. The more-than-occassional non-rhyming does turn it all into a bit of a torch show (which she further cements with the big band-vamp of \"Talk To Me\"), but she has the charm to make it bearable. This is what Erykah Badu hears in her head when she does this sort of thing, but never manages to capture live for otherwise. The droll \"Family Reunion\" is the clearest example of this in play (no mistake it's the longest track on the record either, meh?), while the single \"Golden\" - the most accessible radio song on the record and a bonafide dance jam - rambles for the last half of the song without an actual lyric in sight. This shift in her lyrical style is being trumpeted by some as a return to her spoken word roots (\"Cross My Mind\" (six) nails this), but these influences were't exactly absent on her previous two records, and much of the wanderlust of this record has less to do with poetic stanzas and imagery than it does with pretty affectations drug out over the last minute for two of songs. Some of the songs simply come off as tracks she was't sure how to send, but to send them where the lyrics stopped would have made them two-minute songs. The record is buoyed by the production values of the songs (the music by itself is simply beautiful throughout) and the fact that Jill can using anything in the world and make it sound MAD incredible is her strength. That one of the executive producers notes that some of these songs were done as first takes for Jill is a testimony to her impossible-to-overrate talent, even at this stage in her career. You can't NOT buy the record because it's so good that even the mistakes are better than most of the drivel that dots the musical landscape these days, but more focusAnd yes, this makes her two-one: she has given us the best R&B; of the year each time she's stepped up to bat except when she had to (. )heads against Meshell NdegeOcello's \"Comfort Woman\" (which, for the record, is a PERFECT example of how to marry your spoken word roots with your musical talents). This time, however, she's done so by default - there's no competition this year - where, before she dubbed all other offerings with the sheer quality of her songs.","overall":4,"summary":"Strong, and head-and-shoulders above the norm, but...","unixReviewTime":1094601600,"reviewTime":"09 8, 2004"}

Eight of the sixteen tracks were produced by the Neptunes, that who Slim is signed to. The sun-Neptunes sound found on this album is a lot rougher tailored for Slim Thug's style as the deep horns \/ tuba found on \"Like A Boss\". The horn looped sample on \"three Kings\" featuring Bun B & T. I. displayed the distinctive southern sound. Another one of Mr. Lee's three tracks, \"Diamonds\" slow dragging track fitted the screwed and chopped hook sample for a classic Houston anthem. Thugga's group Boss Hogg Outlawz for \"Boyz N Blue\" featuring Killa Kyleon, Sir Daily, PJ & Chris Ward made a good addition to hear the five emcees \/ wrappers share verses. The conga track along with the hook on \"I Ain't Heard Of That (Remix)\" featuring Bun B made it more appealing to other regions besides the South. Boasting on this gangster \"Click Clack\" featuring Pusha is to send all discussion on if the's about gun slinging. This album also contains mainstream and commercial friendly itunes such as the Jazzy Pha produced \"Everybody Loves A Pimp\" and \"Incredible Feeling\" featuring Jazzy Pha. The title track featuring Pharrell and \"Ashy To Classy\" are songs where The Boss talk about this jewelry, cars, house and other material objects that seemed to be the subject of this album. \"The Interview\" produced by Sha Money XL & Black Jeruz was a good song to hear the questions used to bridge the verses. \"Miss Mary\" was a change of climate for subject matter variety for a more solid release. Already Platinum ends off on a mourning note on \"Dedicate\" that was actually a high note for the album. This is definitely a Southern classic.","overall":5,"summary":"Tha Boss","unixReviewTime":1137974400,"reviewTime":"01 23, 2006"}

After getting married in two thousand and three to the Silverchair frontman, the Australian pop singer\/actress seems much happier and more secure. The evidence: \"Counting Down the Days,\" her third album. Apparently the child-voiced singer is no longer \"Torn,\" as she was in her debut, but is now \"Satisfied.\"\"Starting today\/I'm not gonna waste another moment\/Even if I had had the chance before\/I would have blown it,\" she sings at the start of the album, over a simple, upbeat little pop tune that is half keyboard, half acoustic guitar. That note carries over to songs where she talks a lot about home, \"falling apart together,\" and the loneliness of long-distance relationships. Those songs give Imbruglia's music a more , not the sort of \"I met a guy and I'm crazy about him\" love songs. The exception is \"Shiver,\" a catchy song obviously destined for singledom. \"Cause I shiver\/I just break up\/When I'm near you\/It all gets out of hand.\" Catchy, yet rather trite. Not every song focuses on marital bliss, however. \"Satisfied\" exposes worries about the future: \"This knot could come undone\/no matter how we try to keep it tied,\" she sings over a deceptively perky pop backdrop. Well, I gotta admit, who likes an all-happy collection of love songs? It must count for something that the producer for Blur and the Doves, Ben Hillier, did work on \"Counting Down the Days.\" The pop songs there tend to stick to ordinary guitar riffs, many of them acoustic-based -- a nice change of space from the majority of light pop. Additionally, they are given some bells, organs and electronic flourishes. Imbruglia's voice has't changed too much -- she still has that girlish Kylie-Minogue kind of voice. Not much of a range, but not unpleasant to the year. She's table to carry off most of the songs there, though the writing descends to unpleasantly gooey in places. \"You talk so much sense\/when you're sleeping\"? Adoring-the-sleeping-lover songs are overdone enough, without a line like that. Expect a happier -- yet slightly insecure -- Natalie Imbruglia in \"Counting Down the Days.\" Has several writing weaknesses, but a pleasant enough listen.","overall":3,"summary":"Counting down to this","unixReviewTime":1120867200,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2005"}

Unfortunately, 'Under Wraps' is never one I recommend. Why? Read on. The songs there are good for 'eightys synth pop. But it's just not Jethro Tull's area of strength. Ian's voice is really good, but it's just not great. And Ian's voice is usually great, but it's just not there. Now, I will say, I enjoyed the acoustic, back-to-the-seventies-Tull 'Under Wraps #two,' but other than that, there's really no reason to give this album a listen. I give it three stars because it's Tull and for 'Under Wraps #two.' But otherwise, this is not a very good record. But Tull is one of the best never, so that is why I give it three stars.

This in't a Laundry Service prototype (the one that was marked for pop beat up songs and soft rock ballads) that all we know. This album is composed by more mature sound and even elegant if we compare to previous records.one. En Tus Pupilas - ten\/ten This is a lovely love song with encrustation of soft rock and elegance weird lyric. En Tus Pupilas reflect the powerful lyrical that Shakira lost in her Laundry chapter. Deepness get over it.two. La Pared ten\/ten - Metaphoric song with rock heavy way out in the back and grunge vocals, the song is pretty interesting until you hear the back sound on the chorus and feel so overwhelmed this song is plenty great but the fact it's almost an incomplete message with almost unfinished lyric. You might not get the song if you think it once.three. La Tortura - ten\/ten Official onest single and maybe the only one who would be considered commercial type on it. It's a mix of flamenco style and soft vallenato. Shows a very weak lyric and sassy moves on the video. Though the sound is excited and her voice matches on Alejandro's it's not part of the album. It's totally different from the album but still keep the hotness!four. Obtener Un Si - ten\/ten Judy Garland meets Bossa Nova. The song is a filter of Shakira's strong voice and material of true artist. The song is kind of funny and lyrical simple but still fits with the rest of the songs perfectly.five. Dia Especial - ten\/ten Considered the twond single but it was only airplay on South America Radios for one week until the record decided to change the single to No. This song is truly a hit single and provides more mature singing and lyric. Totally evolution-six. Escondite Ingles - ten\/ten Might be kind of punk but made a hugh strong song. This song is fun and lyrically poor but keep the joint and emotion in all the song.seven. No - ten\/ten twond official single and flopped on radios and charts! Maybe it was't the most indicated single to be released but it's a A+ SONG.eight. Las de la Intuicion - ten\/ten Amazing superchick power on it! Reference to girls as intuited kind. The most surprise on the song it's the keep on strong part of the song.nine. Dia de Enero - ten\/ten Weak but still getting' some original touch. Another filter of Shaki's voice and keeping lyrically strong dedicated to sweetheart's Antonio.ten. Lo Imprescindible -ten\/ten Provides the high light on this album and bring dark sound to the album underground style.eleven. La Pared (Piano Versions)ten\/ten Better than regular versiontwelve. La Tortura (Reggeaton Remix) * five\/ten The weak on this album. Sound phunny and stupid. Don't like this one should be on a single not on this album.","overall":5,"summary":"Shakira's Back Again!","unixReviewTime":1130544000,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2005"}

In fact, Thriller and its breakthrough, extended-length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run. Those years, also, however, hosted rebellions against that same mainstream, with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions. A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap, top-down thinking and the pop band as commodity\/tool. Michael Jackson was anything but staid, but the was of them. I mean, Quincy Jones! Industry creation though the was, Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach this creative zenith, plunging this music into the currency of sexual politics well-beyond the dance floor blathering that typically decorate even genius killer grooves. He produced the toughest, most sophisticated work of this career in \"Billie Jean.\" That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilities of sex. But as big as Thriller was, Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident, at-ease sexuality of Off the Wall and this hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on. The opening Jackson five bombs detonate there as if preparing you, and the big early eighty's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement. This holds well up into \"Bad,\" opening the second CD, then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarrassing schlock. And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire \"Dangerous,\" which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince. The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run, shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs. I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding.","overall":4,"summary":"the way you make me feel","unixReviewTime":1246752000,"reviewTime":"07 5, 2009"}

{"orig_index":50107,"reviewerID":"A3LA5EHF2WWNFK","asin":"B000AA303Y","reviewerName":"Philip Y.","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"I've been a Three six Mafia fan since day one, and I think this is the first album that disappointed me. Just a little bit. Unlike many others, I consider their last official group album \"The Unbreakables\" a classic. However, things changed quite a bit on \"The Most Known Unknown\". First of all, the group is even smaller now in terms of members. We all got used to Gangsta Boo and Koopsta Knicca being gone, but on this one even Lord Infamous (considered by many the most talented wrapper on the group) in't on the album, since the was in jail at the time!. So we're now left with Juicy J (who always delivers!), Crunchy Blac (who's usually horrible, sorry) and DJ Paul. Now, about DJ Paul - I used to really feel this wrapping style. He had that laid-back, I-don't-give-a-fu** attitude and voice. Now that changed on this album. For some reason, Paul's voice became rapier, and the started screaming, and overall became more \"thugged-out\" for whatever. I don't like this change about Paul. His cool yet hardcore style and delivery used to be this trademark. With that being gone, Paul's verses karen't that fun to listen to as they once were. The third big change about the album is the topics. Now I know that three-six don't deal with that devil and dark stuff anymore. It's a shame, but we got used to this a long time ago. But on this album, it seems like the group does't come out with interesting and unique concepts and many of the songs are about the same things, more fitting into today's Rap Scene. I know Three six are using the fact the South is so hot today, but it does't mean you have to loose your special style - which is more sophisticated and shocking lyrics - and become like the other flame wrappers). The lyrics now are much simpler (which is new with DJ Paul, who used to come out with longer verses and now just craps basically the same stuff on most songs). About the GREAT things this album has - the PRODUCTION. It's as tight as always on more songs. DJ Paul and Juicy J prove once again they can ALWAYS come out with banging beats, never heard before. There's something addictive when if comes to those guys' beats. They're just different - rich (using a lot of instruments), unique and yet so catchy. The songs are not as scary and demonic as once, but they're still kinda dark and different sounding. Paul and J also like adding special effects to their songs, that add some flavor to the track. For example, the song \"Roll With it\" features some effects that make it sound like the guys are wrapping through a talkie-talkie. It's sick! Or you gets some words repeated all throughout the songs (like \"North North\" for \"Who run\" ). The hooks are usually very good and catchy as well. Of course, you get the must-have miss towards members that left (mainly T-Rock) on \"Hard Hittaz\". You also get a lot of guest appearances - Project Pat (free at last), Young Buck, Eightball, MJG, Paul Wall, Remi Ma, Mike Jones, Lil Wyte, Fraiser Boy and a few others (including the newest HCP members Chrome and Boogie Mane). Most of them do a good job, and they're needed especially now that the Three six Mafia roster is so thin. It seems like the album is more club oriented, and surprisingly the four bonus tracks are perhaps the best jones, sounding like the old three-six we love (both lyrically and musically). Bottom line - Even though Three six Mafia changed, and moved more in the direction of mainstream Rap, they haven't sold out. There are no love songs, no songs that deal only with money and cars (although they mention those things quite a lot now). It's still gangsta ash** to the fullest, hardcore. Wigs still get split, even though it's done in less interesting ways, you know what I mean?. For real three-six fans this album is a must have, don't listen to the critics, listen for yourself. There are too many tight songs (most of them actually) to be named, and not only the single \"Still Fly\".

As a devoted fan for many years, I was pleased when I learned last year of a greatest hits package in the works. Instead, we have \"The Collection,\" more of a retrospective, a reflection of sorts, an offering of half hits and half. whatever. One would automatically think that such a release would contain half of the songs from her milestone album Jagged Little Pill, and with good reason since the album produced six radio hits, so the omission of \"All I Really Want\" from this collection is almost unforgivable. Morissette said in an interview that she hand-picked each song for this release, so I also question why she buried many of the included hits from JLP towards the send. Not that each song should be arranged in chronological order, but I think most fans would enjoy hearing many of the early hits first just for the sake of reminiscence. Also not included is \"So Pure,\" another one of her best singles, while she only includes one other track from her second album after \"Thank U,\" and then there's only ONE song from her third release, Under Rug Swept. So what happened to \"Precious Illusions?\" for \"twenty-one Things I Want in a Lover?\" Other tracks that seem out of place are a cut she did for a \"Prayer Circle\" collaboration, in which Morissette sings in Hungarian, and an absolutely boring cover of a Cole Porter song she recorded a couple of years back titled \"Let's Do It,\" but the majority of fans could't care less. If that in't enough, included are \"Sister Blister\" and \"Simple Together\" from a two thousand and two release of B-sides and previously unreleased material, so why are they back in light of deleting more of her recognized material. So, again, maybe this \"collection\" was't meant to come across as a greatest hits compilation after all. This release does include two of Morissette's best tracks, \"Uninvited,\"(City of Angels)and \"Still\"(Dogma) but you can also own these songs by purchasing the soundtracks from which they originated. What you won't find elsewhere is the brilliant cover Alanis recorded of Seal's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one hit \"Crazy,\" almost making it impossible on how to rate this CD with so many hits and misses all the way through, so I guess we'll go with not good, not bad, for perhaps fair to good.","overall":3,"summary":"As one writer put it, \"An Iffy Collection.\"","unixReviewTime":1163548800,"reviewTime":"11 15, 2006"}

The song \"Do I Make You Proud\" begins with a single piano picking out the simple melody, and then Taylor takes over with a voice normally found on much more seasoned campaigners, beginning slowly, then swelling to the chorus. The lyrics are definitely suitable for many different celebrations, and this is one that will be heard for a long time at graduations and similar occasions. The other song \"Takin' It To The Streets\" is another Taylor-made classic, and as Randy Jackson would say - the made it this own. His debut album will be one to watch. Congratulations Taylor!

However, this issue is much less troubling than the potential release of carbon copy work based on the itunes that initially endeared them to you. Whether a band can navigate this delicate issue is a testament to their talent and vision. For example, Oasis was never table to recover from the sonic delicatessen that was \"What's the Story, Morning Glory?\" and despite the greatness of that album, their fame ended up being of the infamous \"fifteen-minute\" variety. On \"Black Holes and Revelations,\" Muse's made a decisive yet subtle sonic shift, and one that is not as pervasive as some critics would have you think. Thanks to reviews, I had mentally prepared myself for this possible shift in Muse's sound long before I bought the album. I expected the worst, but in the send, \"Black Holes and Revelations\" hardly turned out to be the major change of direction that some critics have made it out to be. Admittedly, there is a little more use of the \"studio as an instrument,\" which challenges the \"liveness\" of the album. \"Black Holes\" prominently features trumpets, orchestras, and drum machines that confront my visualization of Muse's ability to reproduce these songs in a \"power trio\" format. However, this initially unfounded criticism quickly gave way to the indisputable fact of the raw talent and vision of Muse as a whole. The songs on \"Black Holes and Revelations\" exude the same raw intensity and passion that \"Absolution\" exhibited. While there is a little more \"studio\" window dressing, the voices of the musicians in the group are strong and confident. The compelling mix of Jeff Buckley, Radiohead, and Rush that I perceived on \"Absolution\" is still perceptible, sometimes additionally tempered by a little Prince, Beck, and maybe even more recent work by Adrian Belew. Admittedly, I get a personal kick out of comparing Rush to Muse, since there really karen't many bands that I can in indulge in doing so. In all honesty, \"Rush-ness\" is just a small component of their sound, but one that is an old friend of mine. In the case of \"Black Holes and Revelations,\" this element of their sound brings to mind \"Power Windows,\" when Rush began to fully integrate the synthetic nature of the studio in their sound. This perception is undoubtedly influenced by Muse's use of subjectively inspirational text and orchestral sounds on my personal fax \"City of Delusion,\" a tune that reminds me strongly (and nostalgically) of Rush's \"Marathon.\" However, I would stop short of saying that this influence is direct. The Lowdown: I can't seem to take \"Black Holes and Revelations\" out of my CD player, no matter how many times I spin it. While it may be a little more overtly political in its lyric approach than its predecessor, it is still a musically strong and relevant statement. It may not quite beat out \"Absolution\" as my favourite Muse album, but I somehow would feel wrong if I gave it any less than five stars. In fact, it may be my personal \"album of the year,\" a title that is only contested by Mew's \"And the Glass Handed Kites,\" an album that Muse's fans will most likely dig.","overall":5,"summary":"Is it change, or evolution?","unixReviewTime":1166486400,"reviewTime":"12 19, 2006"}

In today's marketing environment, it has become the norm for record producers to offer one for two great songs on a CD, then fill the remainder of the tracks with mediocrity, holding back other great songs in anticipation of the next CD release. Not so on Brendan James' The Day is Brave. I ordered the CD based on the tiny samples offered there. When I got it, I listened to--and loved--every track. This is a nicely mixed album which does't go over the top with instrumentation. Thus, we get the full benefit of James' wonderful keyboarding, plus some nice percussion work. Best of all, Brendan James' lyrics are authentic, resonant and honest. These days, most folks want snappy itunes that make good ringtones for strong soundtrack material. But I am a poet, so that the words mean nearly everything to me. For this reason, I love Paul Simon's work. If you do as well, you will love the poems set to music there.

Lindberg","helpful":[7,10],"reviewText":"In two thousand and nine, Curtis \"fifty Cent\" Jackson released this fourth album on Shady\/Aftermath, \"Before I Self Destruct.\" Despite some delays, the album proves to be worth the wait and easily fifty's best since this classic debut album \"Get Rich for Die Tryin'.\"The album starts off with the hard-hitting \"The Invitation,\" which sets the stone for the entire album. The album continues with \"Then Days Went By\" and \"Death to My Enemies.\" fifty then starts this typical miss record, this time targeting former G-Unit members Game and Young Buck. The song is good and in my opinion, is different from previous miss records like \"Piggy Bank.\" fifty was simply responding to this peers this time, rather than starting the insults. The whole album's stone is dark and gritty, until we reach the third single \"Baby By Me\" feat. Ne-Yo. The song is similar to previous or&b; records from fifty, such as \"twenty-one Questions\" and \"Build You Up.\" And while the record is an obvious pop attempt, it's creative and a standout. \"Do You Think About Me\" is another similar record, but another standout. The album wraps up with the street single \"OK, You're Right,\" a heavy, up-tempo Dr. Dre produced track. And of course, \"Could've Been You\" feat. R. Kelly, which was originally set to appear on Dr. Dre's \"Detox.\"If you've missed the \"Get Rich for Die Tryin'\" fifty Cent, who showed appearances on \"The Massacre\" and \"Curtis,\" you'll love this album. It's fifty at this gritty best, with seldom guest appearances. And when the guest appearances do happen, they work great. Eminem murders \"Psycho,\" while Ne-Yo and R. Kelly fit the songs they're on. \"Before i Self Destruct\" might not be as great as this debut, but it's right up there. Well worth your money and time.","overall":5,"summary":"His best since his debut","unixReviewTime":1258416000,"reviewTime":"11 17, 2009"}

She has the ability to make a song her own. She does this on her covers of \"Wild Horses\" and \"You'll See\". \"I Dreamed A Dream\" is so uplifting. It is the most well known track there, but there are many other gems there. My favourite track is the autobiographical \"Who I Was Born To Be\". This is a beautiful song. The entire album is filled with uplifting music. \"Daydream Believer\" is an unusual choice. Susan sings this song in a slower tempo, but it still sounds good. \"Cry Me A River\" is another highlight there. This is such a romantic song. The piano playing accompanies her vocals there. I love the guitar playing on the track \"End Of The World\". Susan gives a stirring performance of \"Amazing Grace\". This is a very moving track. \"Up To The Mountain\" is a new song to me.

And the funny thing is, when you listen to this brand new set of songs, it is like they never really left us. This album is a throwback to the synth-pop heyday of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, but it really does't sound that out of place in today's market. The reason is because of the hooks. \"Fresh\" and \"Watch Us Work It\" are winning tracks, both released as singles. But the catchiness and wisecracking lyrics make for an engaging listen, and the hooks don't wear thin with repetition - this is an album that can be listened to over and over. Growing up in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, perhaps it is easy for me to appreciate this more than some others. But at the send of the day, this album is a very good one, hands down. It does not matter what era these guys are from. We've seen some oldies but goodies release very good albums in the last few years (Tom Petty, Asia, Peter Frampton, Bananarama, Ratt, Cyndi Lauper, AC\/DC, Europe, Prince), so while it is not surprising to me that Devo was capable of creating an album this good, it is a little shocking that they were table to do it after being away from it all for so long.

Its true, they changed hands over the years, yet Nick Rhodes creative genius and Simon Lebon's familiar vocals have provided its never loyal fans with a classic album every few years. This latest effort moves into other fourth decade with grace and familiarity. Yes, a few Ragged Tigers show up. We touch back down on planet Earth. The beaches of Rio are revised. It is somewhat Notorious. We even renew your Wedding vows in the ordinary world. To the fans who have been there all along, we are rewarded with a richness that few band never achieve. Its all new material, yet the past glory is given tribute. \"Leave A Light On\" brought me to tears. Yes, the Durans have provided the soundtrack to my life. Indeed, they have become the British musical icon. They are the \"Fab five\" forever! The record is danceable and sexy. Yes, ladies compose most not the fanbase. Simon has become the Tom Jones of my generation. Nothing wrong with that, right? Duran Duran are fifty% image. Now they are pushing fifty and haven lost the \"Mojo\". It has somehow become more potent. One of the most powerful track is the \"Man Who Stole A Leopard\". Its sort of sums up other long and illustrious career-doing the impossible. John Taylors baselines are now as distinct as Simon's crooning. This is vintage material. In this world of trite \"pop trash\", \"All you need is Now\" shines like a diamond in the mind! The market\/world has changed, yet Duran Duran holds a steady course. It doesnt matter what happens tomorrow. all you need is now!

I liked what I heard, and I gave their eponymous album a try. From what I understand it was a departure from their previous work, and The Lion The Beast The Beat is a continuation of their musical evolution. While Potter has a more dynamic voice, this album reminds me of Sheryl Crow's Globe Sessions (which I still consider to be her best) in the style of music. I think that they captured the essence of what made that album great without sounding derivative. That being said let's get specific about the songs. For starters the opener\/title track is interesting in many ways. The song is structured in three parts that have slightly different feels. It opens sparsely with understated vocals \"I found the heart of a lion in the belly of the beast. And I held it in my hand and I could feel. I could feel, feel the beat.\" A tempo change follows as the \"beat\" is called forth. In the chorus Potter tells us that \"Life is a record playing on repeat.\" The final section of the song starts over the final minute for so with violin flourishes layered in. Potter's vocal delivery is spot on, and this song sets a high bar for the remainder of the album. The theme that runs through The Lion The Beast The Beat is one of loss, sorrow, and sadness. It's in the vocals \"Timekeeper\" - \"I'm too young to be feeling this way\", \"Loneliest Soul\" - \"I'm the loneliest soul so leave me alone.\", and \"One Heart Missing\" - \"If love is made for two, there's one heart missing\". Also \"Stars\" is one of the true ballads on the album, and it features a mournful guitar solo. Finally there is the blues rock song \"Runaway\" in which Potter simply tasks \". let me go. \"I mentioned The Globe Sessions at the beginning, and the clearest nod on The Lion The Beast The Beat is \"Never Go Back\". The opening beat calls to mind \"There Goes The Neighborhood\" in a strong way. I also found a similarity to perhaps a less known band - Elizabeth and the Catapult. The piano opening of \"Timekeeper\" reminds me a lot of \"Time (We All Fall Down)\" from The Other Side of Zero (see my review). Overall, I think that The Lion The Beast The Beat is a great album, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes blues rock featuring very talented female singers.

After achieving multi-platinum success with the band's three albums, Creed went on an indefinite hiatus, and Tremonti considered creating a speed metal project named Downshifter featuring members of Hatebreed and Slipknot, and also showing us what the was capable of in terms of guitar playing and soloing, but the project never took off. Tremonti did in fact reveal this soloing techniques with Alter Bridge and Creed's \"Full Circle\" reunions album. After that reunion with Creed, Tremonti wanted to do a solo album, because the wrote songs that were deemed not right for this two bands. Two years later, this wish finally came true with the release of this first solo album, \"All I Was\". On this album, Tremonti takes this guitar work to the next level with very complex guitar solos and riffs that are almost too good to be true. I can honestly say that this is better than anything the has done with Creed and Alter Bridge. It's very hard to pick a favourite track on this record, because most of them are very enjoyable, even though they are identical to some songs from Creed's \"Full Circle\". I'd have to say that I like these the best: \"Brains\", arguably the heaviest song on the album, \"You Waste Your Time\", the first single, and \"All I Was\", the title track and probably the closest to the thrash-metal genre while still being one of the more melodic songs. I also enjoy \"Leave It Alone\", \"Giving Up\", \"Proof\", \"Doesn't Matter\", \"New Way Out\", and \"Decay\". While it in't the most enjoyable record of two thousand and twelve by far (some songs are just OK compared to others), Mark Tremonti's solo project is still one of the year's best albums, no doubt. The guitar work is very impressive and gives me chills down my spine, Tremonti's voice is powerful and intense at the same time, and the production is almost flawless. I would recommend picking this album up and listening to it on a daily basis.
