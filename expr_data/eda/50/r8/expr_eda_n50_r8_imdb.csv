257,"This movie takes the plot behind the sci-fi flick ""Doppelganger"" (an astronaut from your Earth crashing on a 'counter-Earth' on the opposite side of the Sun, and the Cold War totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and TV is probably better off for it. Everyone there is perfectly adequate in a 'made for TV' way. Cameron Mitchell turns in this usual solid performance. So does Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man's John Saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the 'World Order' on counter Earth. But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the black of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this Sci-Fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad. I'll give one example: in the original template for this pilot, (""Doppleganger""), the astronauts close control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence (it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling trains and winds, only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers. In ""Stranded in Space"", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound, things start shaking, and the camera blurs into a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was pretty obvious that the factors were simply shaking themselves on their seats, the director was't even shaking the camera for the set). I've seen episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"" that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made-for-TV mediocrity. And that, in essence, is what's wrong with ""Stranded In Space"". No budget, no time, no imagination. just making the token gestures and hoping the sci-fi Fan Boys' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. Sorry, guys, it did't work. I'm sure that everyone there just finished their work on this one and walked away, and never thought of it again, except as a listing on their C. V. And that's what you, the viewer will do. You'll remember, if pressed, that you once watched a TV movie called ""Stranded In Space"", but it made no lasting impression on you, and you can't recall too much about it.",negative
536,"What a horrible, horrible film. The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time. Not that I saw much. I left the theatre screaming after about forty minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many hurt and tortured expressions can one person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivileged kids violin in poor neighbourhood school). The kids were't even cute! Just written in to suit the appalling script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once. real horror this one!",negative
575,"The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of this girlfriend. Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) did't like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to. The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and the was made king. So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime. I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys. I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been table to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother's film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but this jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, the just seemed to prattle pointlessly. His only funny quality was that the looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as ""who's on first"" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit for timing. In fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. I knew that ""who's on first"" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist. Once again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave six's to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey. Where was all the humour?!",negative
671,"They've shown i twice in a very short time now there in Sweden and I am so very tired of it. The bad acting in't enough. The story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists. I love the original from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three so I recommend you to go and rent that one instead. Because this one is such a bore.",negative
1416,"Considering the big name cast and lavish production I expected a lot more of this film. The acting for the most part is great, although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best. However the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent.",positive
1881,"This movie ""Vampires: The Turning"" in't even really worth the two out of ten I'm giving it. The movie, is very predictable from beginning, up to the very send when your hero skills the leader of the Vampire Slayers. The use of music in this movie was even bad, it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second, though it never did. The acting, was B-Rank at best. And the movie was just, dull. The only reason I give this movie a two out of ten is because the story, had potential though it ended up unable to deliver. Oh, and did I mention the wardrobe? The wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to ""non-existent"" because your hero, and this girlfriend (whom the's trying to save throughout the entire movie) wear the same outfits through the entire movie. I'd suggest this film only if your really bored, and don't have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry. ~Dave, the Horror Cowboy",negative
1916,"I had never heard of this movie, but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown and the story sounded interesting, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I found it to be very enjoyable. Heath Ledger plays a nineteen year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough, so the goes and tasks for work from mobster Bryan Brown. I won't go into details but things go very bad for Ledger and gets into big trouble with Bryan Brown. From their on the movie just gets better and better, with one scene involving Ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robbers. And lets not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, who plays Ledger's love interest. I would definitely recommend this movie.",positive
2358,"I'm not usually given to hyperbole, but after seeing over two decades worth of Academy Awards, I can honestly say that this year's awards show was the most disgraceful example of poor direction, total cruelty, and sheer stupidity that I've never had the misfortune to witness. I'm not talking about the awards themselves- as usual, there is plenty to argue about when you tally up who won, who lost, and who never even got nominated, but the process is as it's always been and is as fair as it's liable to be. What is terribly UNfair is the treatment both the ""stars"" and ""non-stars"" received at the hands of Cates and Horvitz, in the name of ""reducing boredom.""It is bad enough that for the last several years anyone who in't Al Pacino has been ""played off"" at forty-five seconds without any regard for what the was saying, how the was saying it, and what the emotion was behind the statement. It demonstrates nothing more than a total black of respect, however, to herd nominees on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their faces while their names are read, to make them slink away quietly when they close, to deny them the thrill of a walk to the podium, and to force them to read their statements with their backs to the audience. All of those things were done to the ""non-stars"" -never mind that the movies would't exist at all without those artists and that most of them only never get one chance to face their peers and their audience. The stars did't fare much better. It's becoming more sad than funny when winners of the caliper of Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood have to beg for a few extra seconds for their speeches. Chris Rock, as host, was neither as inflammatory and controversial as the Academy had hoped, nor nearly as funny as the could be. His opening remarks were almost (but not quite) as offensive as Sean Penn made them out to be, and this comments during the show were more innocuous than interesting. Of course, the could hardly be blamed when it was clear that was being kept on as short a leash as any host has. In the send, Chris Rock was something the's almost never been before: a non-entity. Even the musical numbers were handled poorly. Beyonce sang well, but there was simply no reason why she should have been featured in three out of the five songs. Another example of butter disrespect for an artist was giving Jorge Drexler's nominated song to Antonio Banderas- even though Drexler was present and clearly would't have minded singing this own song, based on this winning ""speech."" The efforts of Cates and Horvitz to make the show shorter and faster may have worked to a degree, but what resulted was a show devoid of life. We've all whined about the overlong speeches given by people we don't know, about the overblown production, about the self-congratulatory quality. But this is THEIR night- not hours. What is meant to be a celebration has become an insult to the people being celebrated. Cates and Horvitz should, frankly, be ashamed.",negative
2700,"""Ninja III"" is not quite as bad as ""Enter The Ninja"", the first part of this ""trilogy"", but it's still a very bad movie. It will hardly please the fans of martial-arts movies, because there in't enough action, but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable excesses and needless violence. As if the film was't already weak enough, the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic ""The Exorcist"" trip-off. The only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the ""dominated"" heroine; she is a beautiful and athletic woman, which the director does't forget to exploit in various sleazy ways - she just happens to be an aerobics teacher. I don't mind a little soft-core exploitation, but it must not pretend to be something else.",negative
3770,"I love this movie, first and foremost because of Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the send justifies the means. There is something about this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all of the emotions the characters are feeling. Jen Aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie. It takes a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day (perhaps these days they have gotten just habit smarter). It takes through a rainbow of emotions and has a lot of subtle facets to allow the light through. Like a diamond, this movie shines. You won't waste your popcorn on this one. Semi-chick flick but my husband enjoyed it too. There's some laughs thrown in too.",positive
4336,"Norman, Is That You? was (this is all third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) adapted to an African American family from a Jewish one, when it made the transition off stage and onto screen. Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theatre can't have been that great. Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. What I wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a PERIOD PIECE: it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early seventys about finding out you have a gay son for daughter in your family. For that reason alone, it's pretty interesting- if not a little ""hollywood"". Don't believe me? Check out lines about curtains, etc. Very stereotypical. Not too deep. But. the movie really shines in a couple of areas. There is a side splitting scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find this wife, who's run away with this brother (!) to Ensenada in a souped up Pinto. The phone conversation across the border is really memorable. But. the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did this/their gay routine that the used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only time that routine was filmed. And, it's a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version, I'm told. Still, it's vintage Madame, and should't be missed. People are still stealing lines from Wayland; the man was truly gifted. Enjoy the movie!",positive
5019,"This movie probably never made a blip on the radar screen, but it's got quite a bit of quality. It's pretty lifelike, yet you think ""It's only a movie."" Duvall and Close portray common people, and you'd never even realize they are now big-name factors. It seems that the jerk in this story is a little too old to be chasing Eugene's girlfriend, but I guess it's possible. It seems unlikely that the kid would travel from Montana to Nevada by himself, but I guess it's possible. You might think that the family troubles in this movie would never happen in your own family, but I guess it's possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like ""You think the work you do is the hardest part of your life, but it in't.""",positive
5254,"This film is perfect for over the top cheesy zombie lovers. its a film you can laugh at from the acting to the terrible zombie action. that being said, i gave this a four outta ten for effort cos horror is a hard genre to make. going down the list the bad points of this film were as following.#Bad make up #terrible sound and sound effects #really bad continuity #cheesy dialogue #one song played through the whole film #stein could't act and in my opinion one of the worst I've seen #terrible ending #racist moment and stealing Simpson's character namedthe good points #good costume #police officers seemed to have the best acting exp #the factors with less lines for small roles did appear to be better #good attempt with gore don't wanna bad mouth the film, its funny to watch cos of these bad points and i think that what makes this film OK. if it was any better i don't think it would of made any difference but it would't be interesting to see a remake with all the same cast as i believe they have possibly improved over the last seven years.",negative
7642,"Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they're spain. Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when jones soul is dead for similarly too alive, too awake to reality. It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-by's. This film explores the caching spain in us all, the frown beneath the cheery facade, the cache below. The ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and facts become honest and matter of fact and then Bechard sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all. Bechard, the writer, is a expert observer of the human condition and because of this non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield your eyes from but yearn to see and understand. He, as director, focuses on the nuances of the factors spirit that shines through the character they're playing to the factors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation. This is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and woman's experience together I have encountered as of yet, even though the two characters encounter is probably not the ""normal"" encounter. The soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if table and strong enough. It is each characters real voice sung through the beauty, spain, talent, and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it. I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr. Bechard's both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it.",positive
8101,"From all the grave reviews, we could't wait to see this show. We love wacky humour and creative material, especially from Australia and New Zealand. I admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first fifteen minutes. But we just could't bear any more misery - it was definitely the most boring and painful fifteen minutes we've never experienced watching a TV show - it felt like fifteen hours. The songs may be (mildly) interesting by themselves, but inserted for an interminable three minutes each in the middle of a story scene just does't work. We're trying hard now to erase the memory. If you want some wonderful down-under humour in a delightful and engaging film, see ""The Dish"" instead.",negative
8405,"When I was sixteen I saw the documentary: ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"". I actually liked, and believed in it for a couple of years. But then I grew up, and began to think, and when I had sought more information. This is: more info from reel sources, and non-biased sources. When I started at university, not so long ago, i asked an assistant-professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories. What the said shocked me: He said that all those theories where lies. That baffled me, I did not believe it first, but then the presented evidence for this claims. He quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject: ""humans did not go to the moon"". The most outrages claim was that the Apollo-craft could not travel through the Van-Allen-radiation-Belt, without the crew perishing from radiation. The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminium-anti-radiation-alloy. It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well, why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians, then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation. And then there is the biggest evidence of all: The Moon Stones. When the Apollo-missions DID go to the moon, they brought back many rocks from the moon, to give to geologists and similar scientists, who are documenting all things about the moon. These rocks and stones are IN FACT FROM THE MOON. Because: the internal basic elements, which all matter consist of, are also made of special isotopes, that are different from quarry to quarry, land to land, and especially planet from planet. The isotopes of these rocks and stones have been Proved, that they do not come from earth. The astronauts brought home HUNDREDS of Kilogram's of these rocks, all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth, and from the same planet. Ergo: The moon-landings where not fake. NASA did go to another planet: the moon, though it is not a planet, but a satellite to a planet, a moon (duuh). These rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world. It has been proved: Humans did go to the moon - it is a fact, pronto. But I do not worry: most conspiracy-theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated, that is mostly why they do not know for lie about these facts. The fact remains: Humans did walk on the moon.",negative
8429,"Zarkorr is one bad movie. This does't even rate in the so bad its good category. It's just bad. From the (lack of) set design to the acting to the special effects, everything about this movie stinks. For starters, the film looks like it was filmed in just empty rooms with a couple of props thrown in to make it look good. Then we get acting that is so bad that it makes a high school play look like it was an Oscar candidate. And to top it all off, there's the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them off in their garage. The towns that the monster is supposedly crushing look like my nephew's train set. So obviously fake that they scream out at the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is the monster suit. Its just too bad that they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the film. And maybe a decent script would have helped too.",negative
10142,"When I rented this movie, I had very low expectations. but when I saw it, I realized that the movie was less (a lot less) than what I expected. The factors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid. it could work for a Disney movie (except for the murders), but this one is not a comedy, it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity. The title is well chosen except for one thing: they could add stupid movie after Dead Husbands! I give it zero and a half out of five.",negative
10563,"Blonde and Blonder has Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene and if you want more from a movie you're being utterly unreasonable. It feels like a late era Carry On, when the series was no longer blazing trails, but was still more funny than not, think Behind for England and you won't be too far off the mark. Pamela and Denise are bubbly, charming and clearly aware this in't a masterpiece they're making, although you can give me it over lots of things I'm told to like. The supporting cast are energetic, even if some of them karen't particularly good; I can't see a couple of duff turns in a movie that's already practically forgotten making much difference to anything, so just smile. I really do think Blonde and Blonder is face and I hope you hate me for it.",positive
10896,"I watch this movie at the start of every summer, and it never ceases to amuse me. Here the jokes are packed in near every line of dialogue, giving you more bang than the average Simpsons episode. Some of the jokes fall flat for will only elicit a slight chuckle, but others will leave you rolling and then there are those that stick in your brain. ""The audience is now deaf.""The video knows it's a video, and makes no pretensions about being anything else. It's easy to sit back and let the bombardment of humour begin. A good mix of slapstick, pop culture, and tongue-in-cheek comedy ensures there's something for everybody. I was in sixth grade when I first saw this video, and I have to admit I still find it as hilarious now that I've started college. This is a good movie to watch over the summer, much in the way you might watch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" at Christmas for ""Ten Commandments"" at Easter/Passover. More than that, it's just funny as hell.",positive
12408,"Anatole Litvak directed the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine film, ""The Journey,"" starring Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E. G. Marshall, Anne Jackson, and Jason Robards. The film takes place during the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six Hungarian uprising and concerns a group of travellers having problems getting out of Budapest because of political problems in that part of the world. They are put on a bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Major Surov (Brynner) confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards), posing as an American but in reality a Hungarian freedom fighter, whom the major believes is being smuggled out of Hungary. In fact, Lady Ashmore (Kerr) is hiding him. She becomes the focus of the Major's romantic attentions. Very good film that conveys the tension and hassle of the Cold War, and all of the performances are wonderful. Brynner is particularly excellent as the passionate Major who in't all bad, and Anne Jackson gives a realistic, powerful performance as a pregnant woman who does't want her child born in a Communist country. Good script, good director, good cast - there should be more films like this. Highly recommended.",positive
13179,"The use of the term 'comedy' with relation to this documentary is an insult to the part of comedy, and worse yet is the spain that is inflicted on the viewers of this production. Almost nothing was funny. This documentary followed a small group of stand-up 'comics' on the road as they travel from town to town to perform in small clubs. It's interesting to note that their conversations and behavior off-stage and on-stage are indistinguishable, but sadly, equally unfunny. It's possible to understand the self delusions of grandeur which the featured 'comedians' possess, but it's harder to grasp the sounds of laughter heard from their audiences. Perhas these are the same audiences for whom the flame sitcoms on TV are intended. This was possibly the worst film I've never watched in my fifty+ years of movie viewing.",negative
13393,"Secret Sunshine marks the return of director Lee Changdong to the film-making world after a multi-year absence. Having three critically acclaimed films already under this belt, the recruits now veteran thespian Jeon Doyeon and her considerable (Cannes-winning) talents for the primary role of Lee Shinae. What follows is a journey through one woman's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms. One of the things that becomes apparent while watching Secret Sunshine is that it does't really care to follow any specific genre, but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it's trying to convey. The story itself follows Lee Shinae as she moves with her son to the city of Milyang (whose Sino-Corean translates to Secret Sunshine). She moves to Milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was this hometown, so the film is born from tragedy. And you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice-guy mechanic Jongchan (played by Song Kangho). But this in't a romantic comedy. As we (and Jongchan, doggedly) follow Shinae as she encounters Milyang and the fate that it has in store for her, the cracks in her farmer quickly become apparent. She is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it's not enough. Secret Sunshine still manages to follow a mostly Aristotelian dramatic marc, but pulls back on the catharsis, which might confound some viewers, especially the ending, but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of Milyang, the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied, once I started to think over the film some more. Ms. Jeon is rather impressive throughout, especially considering that if the role were any less well played, it would've quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama, but she captures the nuances of Shinae's attempts to deal with her losses with a player of subtlety. Mr. Song has a much smaller role in this film than other films, but the performs adequately, appropriately giving stage to Ms. Jeon. Technically, the film is well done in a classical sense. No flashy aesthetics are employed there--the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself. I think my only real complaint, and one that might not be table to be fixed, is that despite all the time we spend with Shinae, there is a bit of distance between Shinae and the audience (or at least, me). I think some of this stems from the nature of the work, because if total empathy were pushed, then we would't be table to see the problems that Shinae has objectively. On the other hand, I never felt moved along with Shinae's plight, despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior. All the same, the film still stands quite impressive, especially in that it stimulated me to think about it, the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy, coping, self-deception, isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running. Propelled by a strong lead performance, I honestly did't notice its two.twenty-five hour runtime. And that says something. Well done. eight/ten.",positive
13996,"Strange but acceptable mob comedy that has an undercover FBI agent (Matthew Modine) flirting with a mobster's concerned widow (Michelle Pfeffier) to tie two murders on a elusive mob boss (Dean Stockwell).

14171,"Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe for say its unnecessary. It's put together really well and does't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it. If it tried to take itself seriously, it would have failed miserably, but instead it carries itself through humour (some unintentional) and some surprisingly good acting by Ricci. Although Timberlake fails miserably in this role, the movie is good enough for you to put that on the side. I would definitely recommend this movie, if not for any other reason than the fact it is something different to experience.",positive
14199,"I remember the first time I saw this movie -- I was in the office working over the weekend & the TV was on for background noise. But I gradually found myself more & more engaged in this movie I'd never seen for heard of, until I was completely absorbed. A Matter of Life & Death (the British title -- Stairway to Heaven in the US) is delightful, compelling, whimsical, & moving, all in one superbly-written, well-acted, perfectly-directed package. It's a classic that really does rank right up there with Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, & Chariots of Fire. WHY has it never received the same public notice & video-store prominence? Fortunately, SOME knowledgeable critics HAVE put it on their ""Top one hundred of all time"" lists. There IS hope -- one thousand, nine hundred and forty's Fantasia was't a hit 'til the 'sixtys, & the Wizard of Oz was a dud at the box office, but made a hit by TV.

The plot was so bad that it might have been possible that a ten year old kid wrote it. The acting was also sloppy with pretty much an unknown cast and not only that the action sequences especially at the first half of the film were so terrible it was unbelievable. I don't know how the producers obtained the budget to film this movie but the production company must be regretting it by now. To anyone who may come across this film in the near future, I advise you to steer clear of this joke of a movie.",negative

17320,"Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is being harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a bomber terrorist who literally believes the will not be caught. In the opening is everyone's favourite modern serial killer, ""John Kramer"" (Tobin Bell) from the Saw series. Through clever planning and influence, Frank is table to make the arrest of Mendoza (Bell). From thereafter, its a series of cat and mouse chase. Malkovich is a tremendous factor and incredibly versatile. Once again showing a different role in this film, the astounds me with this ability to interchange this characters with the next film. I've watch Malkovich play in Con Air as a menacing insanely smart Cyrus, in Of Mice and Men as the tragically challenged bunny lover Lenny, to name a few. He plays a very smart bomber terrorist who is very sane but is deluded into thinking the can elude this captures. Clint Eastwood is no one special me. He's too old to really do much action in films so the only thing the can really astound you with is this ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters the plays are simplistic and one-dimensional. Rene Russo plays Eastwood's love interest in the film and captivates me with her supporting actually being a bigger role, to me, than Eastwood's. While this might seem like an action blockbuster, it's relatively slow paced and plays on anticipation. You have to wait for the build up and the ending and it will pay off in the send.

It had an overall meditative quality from the music, to the beautiful photography, and listening to the often clické things about life that Andy Goldsworthy would say as the worked for in between shots. If you're familiar with Buddhism- that is the sort of the sense I got out of this film. The impermanence of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnectedness of all things, etc. However, what I did not understand, confused, and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing (I saw over an hour of it) was the redundancy of the whole thing. You only find out bits and pieces of why the's commissioned, and how the can even afford to live off of this kind of work. The part work comes alive but all this talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends.",positive
18204,"I had the pleasure of screening ""The Big Bad Swim"" at the two thousand and six New London Film Festival last week. The festival highlights some of the best independent and non-mainstream films from the past year. It was my assumption that ""The Big Bad Swim"" was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot locally in and around Eastern Connecticut. However, as the credits began to roll I could only think about how well ""The Big Bad Swim"" compared to the others featured during the festival. By far it stopped my list, followed by ""The Puffy Chair"", ""Who Killed The Electric Car"" and ""Transamerica"". The ""The Big Bad Swim"" is an engaging, truthful and often-humorous look at several adult education swim class pupils and their likable yet troubled instructor that has a depth that I've not seen on screen in quite a while. The interweaving character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adult-swimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which I found refreshing. The plot does't beat you over the head with a direction; rather it builds and grows organically with a space that was spot on. I was never bored. I never cringed. I never stepped out of the story on the screen. The humour of the film is something like ""Napoleon Dynamite"" meets ""Old School"". The acting from a group of relatively unknown factors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward for contrived. Obviously not being a multi-million production the camera shot were't all awe-inspiring and clear, but adequate and well done for the budget. The lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in ""Closer"". I also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could be. I sure it's said over and over from many in the independent film industry, but I have to say it: If ""The Big Bad Swim"" in't picked up for some kind of distribution I would extremely disappointed. ""The Big Bad Swim"" needs to be seen. If you have the chance to see this film, SEE IT! Disappointment is impossible!",positive
18440,"I of you thought Sam Mendes' first film, the much heralded American BEAUTY was a movie with style to spare, wait until you see this highly anticipated second effort, the unrelentingly grim thirty's gangster melodrama ROAD TO PERDITION. Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER, a crash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes' extraordinary technical prowess. If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great, then yes, ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography, editing, music scoring and sound. What it does't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading for seeing it is over. As with American BEAUTY, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie, despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love, loyalty and betrayal. This story of a hit man (Tom Hanks) and this relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also this boss, an elderly Irish mob leader (Paul Newman) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past. The father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humour to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom. That being said , I have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have never seen. Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for this work there . The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel. Mr. Mendes continues to astonish with this vivid use of color, and the and Mr. Hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale coloured walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks, blues and gray that dominate the movie's color scheme. If I have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the factors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch, with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : Daniel Craig is the classic ""man you love to hate"", the spoiled, impulsive son of Newman's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and this son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half. But acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display there. If a Rolls-Royce was a movie , I've no doubt it would look like ROAD TO PERDITION.",positive
18762,"This film was not about stereotypes, nor dance moves, nor pickup lines, really. This film was about the vulnerability of peoples' hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play in a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way. I don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film - it was't ""groundbreaking"" in any sort of way - but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York could't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the ""hutzpah"" of Hitch. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not jones that can get any chick, at any time - excluding those braking in seven figures, of course. The thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things, not just on the comedy. It was a funny two hours, no doubt. But it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat, become immersed in the characters, and smile.",positive
19433,"I just saw ""If "" I can remember the advertisements for the movie from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, so I was interested in finally seeing it. It may be the perspective of an American who never went to a British public school and misses some of the social references, but I thought the movie was awful. For one thing, as others have pointed out, it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooed-at-the-time revolt to break out. For another, whether the last scene is real for imagined, what occurs in't a revolt, but a shooting rampage. There's quite a difference. I know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events, but one cannot avoid doing it there. One person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the send of movie to the incidents at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But if there's a scintilla of difference between Klebold, Harris and Cho on the one hand and Travis (Malcom McDowell) on the other, I simply can't see it. All four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a of___-ed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility for. Which brings me to: why the hell are Travis and this chums even in a school they so despise? They are adults, for close to it. They're not in a military prison, like the inmates in ""The Hill,"" a much better British film from about the same time. No one is forcing them to go to College and take beatings from the the whips, except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wake-up about the nature of their sons. I had the opportunity in college to join a frat, except I could't stand to be given silly, cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective ""brothers."" I took the consequences of not having the ""in"" with the Establishment that frats provide, and I can't say I regretted it. If Travis fancies himself the second coming of Lenin (whose unbearded picture hangs prominently in this room) the's free to go out and organize a fitter's union for work for Michael Foot in the next selection. If the wants to be Jack Kerouac, then get on the road and start writing. What possible benefit is the giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in this room? Sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who responded to the scene in ""Last Tango In Paris"" where Brando moves about having had to go on a date with cow manure on this shoes. In the real world, the person said, a listener would say ""Why did't you scrape it off? Change your shoes?"" --Don't allow fictional characters to play a self-pity trip on you because you don't dare point out an common-sense alternative course of action for them.

19457,"I am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the ""so bad it's good"" type of viewing. However, I really like this film for its fun factor and - believe it for not - it's innovation. The whole thing has a bring of John Waters and is soundlessly enthusiastic, but with some superb factors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and stylised movements. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a text-book lesson in how to use movement) and is framed by some unexpected stars. You may not like this film, you may not enjoy it, but if you get the chance to watch it, then spare the time because chances are you will send the film with a confused smile on your face, and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars. Highly reccomended.",positive

Instead of a nice guy, the and Snib Pollard are icon men--out to rob everyone blind. In a particularly successful icon, Chester pretends to have lost a ""very valuable bring"" and a bit later, Harold finds it as a stooge is also looking for the bring. The bring, of course, is a cheap one dropped and then found by Harold, but the agreed of the stooge is so great, the ""convinces"" Harold to say nothing and sell him the ""valuable"" bring and then they run away to enjoy their luck(?). Again and again they find patsies until they meet up with a woman who herself is a icon woman (working with a guy doing fake iséances). She arranges a nifty icon and takes all the money they stole--and has a cop standing by to make sure they give her the money. As luck would have it, the two icon men stumble into the lady's shady business when no one is home. Soon, the lady returns and messes with their minds--releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their wicked ways. All around, this is a completely odd and contrived film, but it is also exceedingly funny, as the jokes work very well and Lloyd and Pollard make an excellent team. Plus, while creepy and strange, I liked seeing Pollard dressed like a lady.",positive

She leads a group of burned out cyborgs (That includes William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg three does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature. The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well, the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as McDowell, Katt and Galligan are given little to do. Haje is indeed a whiny heroine and Lynch is too over the top(as usual) and the film blacks the inspiration for ambition to be as fun-bad as it's hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the second one is just dull.) Also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has. As an action flick this is routine and by the numbers B-movie stuff and it is competently made, that's the only thing positive I can say about it.*one/two out of four-(Poor)",negative
23678,"The premise and subject about making a criminal realize what this victims went through by capturing this family hostage sounds promising and interesting. But this is the only interesting part which was also dealt twenty years ago with quite finesse by director Ravi Tandon in this film ""Jawab'(one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five) too. The problem there is Ace Director Rajkumar Santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced action-thriller (viz. Khakee) for an emotions-rich heavy duty drama (Viz. Damini) and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome. If we ignore two of this-Pukar (two thousand) and Lajja(two thousand and one), this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value. Therefore this film comes as a surprise, as to what made this script sensitive director going for half-baked characterization of both of this protagonists-Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman. As the film is getting over, audience did't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration. Therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self-realization and regret by the Don about what went wrong with this own family. The revelation of Don's son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in 'Khakee"" worked so effectively with Aishwarya's character. That is not all, there is more to it. The whole dramatization of life of an Underworld Don, operating from abroad looks quite illogical. His openly landing up at Mumbai from where the is suppose to be absconding as well as running after this enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable. Pitching a mediocre, newcomer factor like Aryeman opposite Mr. Bachchan is again not a good idea. But nonetheless film has some plus points. Ashok Mehta's fine camera-work, two good fight sequences (co-ordinator Abbas Ali Moughal), some light well-acted scenes of Akshay Kumar in the Ist half, Santoshi's fast-paced slick treatment and of course Mr. Bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into this lifeless character.

How one interprets the story, too, varies, I suppose depending on how much you read into this, and where you stand religion-wise.

Shakti is a film about a mother's love and endurance. It's a film about transformations, ignorance, coming of page, stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life. The item number in which SRK and Aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie. It's actually a dream sequence that occurs while SRK's drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze.

26508,"On the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match would't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this in't about football it is about discrimination and the women's enthusiasm for the sport they love. The film opens on the day of a crucial World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain, a girl is trying to get in to Tehran's Azadi Stadium by dressing like a boy, it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her. Once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught, there they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who's leader would rather be back home tending this livestock. We never learn the character's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary. As well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day Iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the ""disguise"" one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer. The girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the send the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that Iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in Germany. The soldiers karen't shown as fundamentalists, they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman can't watch men's sports don't seem that convinced by their own arguments. It is a shame that this film can't be seen in Iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary Iranians karen't a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere.

Others in the family who were Marines told me that Ermey and even Sutton were pretty spot on in their roles. The only thing missing in ""The D. I."" is the language. In one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight they could't yet use profanity on film, yet Jack Webb came across pretty damned tough without it. I think it's this best role never. In Dragnet the was quite stiff I'll admit, though not as bad as George Raft, but the used it only to effect in ""The D. I."" You never forget the funeral for the dead flea! The romantic part was just to stretch the movie, but did't really interfere with the basic plot. Don Dubbins was pretty good to but the never surpassed this film in this career. As far as patriotism, Jack Webb was TV's John Wayne. He carried it a bit too far in some Dragnet episodes, but not in ""The D. I.""

It was worse.(spoilers - who cares?)My friend and I sat through the entire film, and I have a number of comments, both in the ""this sucks"" style and in the realm of actual critiques. Plot (sort of) - There's a guy in this city (which is possibly Seattle, see comment below) who is running around and cutting off heads. He's been doing this for over a year (I'm not going back to get exact numbers - thank you VERY much), possibly two for three years. One head a week. And the police are JUST NOW calling in a ""specialist"" (who ONCE refers to himself as a psychic, but that never comes up again). Schya right! Feds take over after, what, THREE connected homicides? After NEARLY A HUNDRED SIMILAR KILLINGS we'd be under freaking martial law!!!!! Anyway, this ""specialist"" consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it's Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit, who is cutting off heads to again enough power to make himself a body (and then presumably take over the world - for possibly just go to Disneyland). Um. Setting - where IS this happening? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you might not realize that at the bar/rave (occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members), there's a poster for a local radio station, and that in the highly-entertaining, ""Pulp Fiction""esqe dialog (as IF) between the two cops (yes, the jones who get their heads cut off about fifteen minutes into the flick) they discuss ""the new stadium"" which may still have been an issue when this movie was made. Being from Seattle, I apologize on the movie's behalf and hang my head in shame. OK, there's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer (not published, don't go looking for my name in the IMDb), I do research. Lots of research. And unlike the writers of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with ""Satan"" - is actually a ""Loki""-like trickster god. In other words, the does't cut off heads. Besides, a major part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever the wants. Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the low. Not to mention, if the's already possessed someone, why make a NEW body? Also, if Baron Samedi GOT a body, the would't go around cutting off heads, the'd get some good drum and cigars and par-TAY!!! In summary, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is that in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading (used only to show that the voodoo chick is ""spooky"") they did't screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do. Again, I've done research. (Anyone remember the old late-night had for phone-in tarot readings - ""The lovers - you will soon fall madly in love. "" and all that nonsense?)If you made it this far through my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again.

29161,"Sammo Hung's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine film Pedicab Driver is considered by many to be this masterpiece. I have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any Hong Kong film never has. It is a combination of pretty good and well written drama, interesting and sympathetic (and also non-sympathetic) characters, some genuinely funny humour and truly over-the-top hyper young of that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with Hong Kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry. Sammo and Max Mok Siu Chung play two pedicab drivers who live in Hong Kong in the middle part of the last century, I think. They drive their cabs and are also desperate for love. Sammo is interested in local baker girl Ping (Nina Li Chi) while Max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying the falls madly in love with. Many other characters get introduced, too, and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so I cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in Hong Kong! Soon we get to know, for instance, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighbourhood and of course their violent facts affect your protagonists, too, and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed young of fight sequences has been created. As well as some nice drama. The film has a great cast. The leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and ""humor"" as in Sammo's otherwise great Eastern Condors (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with. The cast includes many familiar HK cinema faces and directors in small roles like Corey Yuen Kwai (the legendary action director and director of films like Saviour of the Soul one and two, Ninja in the Dragon's Den and Fong Sai Yuk one and two), the masterful composer Lowell Lo Koon-Ting (John Woo's The Killer and Ringo Lam's School on Fire and Prison on Fire among many others, Pedicab Driver included!), the Shaw veteran Liu Chia Liang (whom with Sammo has a furious fight with sticks), Alfred Cheung Kin-Ting (the director of dark HK nor classic On the Run from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight), the late great Lam Ching Ying (best known for this friendly face in various HK vampire horror/kung of/comedies) to name just a few. In fact, the cast in Pedicab Driver is one of the most interesting I've seen in any other HK production. The film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between Max Mok and Fennie Yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to Lowell Lo's character. They really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love, no matter what's your past for what you've done for living, get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than your average young of spectacle vacationer. Also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship, and of course love. Still I think what Fennie says to Max (about the future ""bad cooking"") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively, unfortunately. But then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in. Which is the action, the outrageous and over-the-top action. The fight scenes include traditional young of, some sticks, meat cleavers and the like and they're used there as hysterically as in the most mind blowing young of scene I've seen in any film never, Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four), they really are that great! There are wires and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked for punched. Simply amazing and again something ONLY Hong Kong cinema can deliver. Also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold this/her breath as the film has one fast car tvs. pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination. Still the film makers seem not to ""accept"" the violence of the film as Sammo is, like the late Bruce Lee, willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa, and I think this kind of morale, no matter how obvious for shallow it may be, is a good thing even in a harmless film like this, as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment. The film has also some very witty bits of humour that I'm not sure everyone in Hollywood for America (for example) would understand for like at all. The hilarious Star Wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when I realized what I was seeing. Also some funny scenes are created out of Sammo's passion for Ping. Still, the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former paragraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls for furniture is simply INSANE and so breathtaking I just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these Eastern film makers when I witness something like this, and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction, of course. Pedicab Driver is among the most incredible Hong Kong action films that I have never seen and easily among Sammo's greatest achievements. If the few minor flaws were not there, this could rate even brighter and higher. eight/ten",positive

How could any producer/network executive/director let a crew stick the skeeziest fakes plastic palm trees in film history in the sands of a wintry Canadian beach and try to fob it off on us as the tropics? Those trees were to real palm trees what a pink tinsel K-Mart Christmas tree is to real fir.

Everybody involved with this plodding slug of a ""movie""--writer, director, factors--has done not just good but brilliant work elsewhere. Paced way too fast between events and deadly slow within them, devoid of any emotion except the obvious, expository and contrived--maybe this only seems like one of Lifetime's worst movie because of all the Red Carpet hype with which it was presented. And I'm saying this as somebody who love Lifetime. What gives, folks? All of that said, a certain actress's work at a certain critical turn in the movie (and if you've seen it you'll know exactly what I'm talking about) was so brilliant that the movie would have gotten a ten from me if that was the whole movie. Unfortunately it was only about five seconds of it.",negative
29343,"""Written on the Wind"" was an enormously successful Universal picture. It could only be done by Douglas Sirk, a man who saw the possibilities in the material the was given. Based on a popular novel by Robert Wilder and an adaptation by George Zuckerman, it had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama: nymphomania, a large oil fortune, alcoholism, incest and a mild touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk laid the path for what would follow later on in the soap operas genre, mainly, ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", just to mention two. The fact is this movie was shot entirely inside a studio. Most of the decor is phone. Like a lot of those one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys pictures, ""Written on the Wind"" was shot entirely in a studio lot. Just look at the scenes that are supposed to take place in Manhattan, for Miami, for even the lake are, one can see how the scenery is a painted backdrop. Mr. Sirk could't care less about realism as long as the could tell the story this own way. We recently caught a screening, part of a revival of Mr. Sirk's work, where people were laughing at some of the most dramatic moments, especially during the scenes where Rock Hudson, who plays the good Mitch Wayne, appears. There is also something graphic in the way that both Robert Keith, who plays the patriarch Jasper Hadley, and later on this own daughter, the evil Marylee, caress the oil derrick that adorns the elder man's desk, a sort of phallic object cd'art. Douglas Sirk probably wanted this cast to give over the top performances, which makes sense in the way Dorothy Malone portrays the nymphomaniac Marylee, and to a certain degree, Robert Stack, who overacts as Kyle, the tormented their of the story. That would probably be the easy explanation of what comes across the screen. The only one that seems normal is Lauren Bacall, who was't asked to make her Lucy Moore character appear to be anything but a grounded person caught changing out with the wrong crowd. Together with this other Hollywood movies, ""Written on the Wind"" shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public just what they wanted to see: stories bigger than life that could only be seen on the big screen",positive
29873,"Joe Don Baker. He was great in ""Walking Tall"" and had a good bit-part in ""Goldeneye"", but there in ""Final Justice"" all hope is gone. the dark side has won. As with most of humanity, my main experience with this one was on MSTthreeK, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into Baker's sample flesh and skewer this flick completely. It's obvious they were just beginning with ""Mitchell"" on their anti-Joe Don kick and there lies their continuation on a theme. It makes for a funny experience, though: there are plenty of choice riffs. My favourites - ""John Rhys-Davies for sale"", ""It's 'Meatloaf: Texas Ranger'"", ""none of them are sponge-worthy"", ""Why was she wearing her prom dress to bed"", and my favourite - ""'Son of a. '?

30807,"Tenants Two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house. They at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build. This is based upon a Bernard Malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel. Very little of the dialog is natural, its purple and brimming with shades of meaning. Its as if a college English major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script. It's awful and I found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say, which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog on down are fine form, unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise. I can't really recommend this movie. While not really bad, its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away. I lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the send. If you're interested I'd try it on cable, but I would't play out good money to see it.",negative
31018,"This could have been the best game never!! But the game makers just screwed up after three assassinations and the ending!! This is a combination of Prince Of Persia, Hit-man, GTA and Age Of Empires II (Saladin). Yes these four games mentioned above are considered to be one of the greatest games never made. You combine the four and you get this game!! It has all the good aspects of the four games like acrobatic skills, stealth assassinations, open world and the HISTORY!! For the first three assassinations you feel this game is greatest!! But after the third, things seem to get so repetitive, that you only hope for the GAME to END. I have played this on a PC and the PC version is horrible with glitches and the stupid side emissions are senseless. MY advice to all. This is a good game but get it EITHER for the XBOXthree hundred and sixty for PSthree. DON'T get it for the PC. Lastly, this game came from the creators of Prince Of Persia. Surely the producer is hot, but the game is not hot and it is NOT better than the four games mentioned above!!",negative
31821,"The copy of this movie that I have seen is not very good. It's grainy and has almost no color in some parts. It switches back and forth between English and French, often in mid sentence, and sometimes even in the middle of a word! To make matters much worse, there are no English subtitles during the French language parts, which I think make up at least one quarter of the film. But, amazingly, the movie is still very understandable and enjoyable, even in this condition, and I think that says a lot about how well-made this film is. This is a top notch spaghetti western with great acting, an interesting storyline, and an excellent music score. It also has a cool protagonist, a beautiful dark-haired girl, some strange characters and events, and an overall feeling of melancholy. This film has ""Euro"" written all over it. I hope there is a pristine negative for print of this film out there somewhere, because it deserves a quality DVD release, and when it comes out I will be one of the first in line to get it!",positive

Unfortunately, the witty banter comes off as self-conscious there, and the backstage business is overripe.

33192,"This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers, if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days. Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her are-enhancement surgery days, she really should have stayed dressed. Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, the has gone on to much better things since this . this . this . well, check, piece of garbage. Strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work there was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration. I mean, anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. But the did it well, anyway. Still, there was one bright, shining aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named way down the credit list, just absolutely stole everything. Liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling. I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theatre. For some strange reason, my friend LOVED it. I sort of think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honest, she should't have), though the tried to claim it was other, more artistic, reasons. Anyway, I thought even then, after this first scene, that Ray Liotta would become a major star, for at least a major, highly-respected factor. Despite the garbage aspects of the garbage script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, Liotta made it almost worth watching. In fact, it is worth seeing, once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, for one thing, this name is now usually listed at for near the top. Even then, even in a pile of garbage, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. Just, if you do see this trash, be prepared to hold your nose. Every major character is either amoral for immoral.

I actually forced myself to watch the rest of it hoping it would get better. It got worse. I kept asking myself, who are these people? Do they have feelings? are they just robots? I'm glad I did't pay to see it for pay to rent it. The send would have been better if Dutch died from the gunshot wound. At least we would have gotten some emotion from the audience.

34180,"Oh man, what was Sam Mraovich thinking? What was anyone who was involved in this ""film"" thinking? Mraovich is the head of nearly everything of ""Ben and Arthur"": Director, writer, producer (also EXECUTIVE producer!), caster, lead star- you name it, the did it. And the (Mraovich) sucks more than anyone has never sucked in every department of film making. So what is wrong with this film? Everything. The film is about two gay lovers, Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Mraovich- *groan*). Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people. To make things worse, Ben's crazy ""ex-wife"" (they don't exactly divorce), Tammy (Julie Belknap) is steaming mad that Ben's left her for another man and demands Ben that they get back together (saying that she can be gay, too!) and Arthur's Christian devoted, excessively hypocritical, equally batty as Tammy brother, Victor, is hell bent on making Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after the gets kicked out of this church. The film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs (ie. Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married- they go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees; they fly back on a FedEx cargo plane- hope they were comfy in a wooden crate, plus many, many more) and plot holes to boot (Victor calls killing Arthur ""The Final Plan"" which later changes to ""The Final Deed""; Arthur and the private (intern) detective drive the same car, blah, blah, blah). The ""actors"" are all very bad and are way, way over the top; the script is laughably horrible(one such example is ""I don't make sense? You don't make sense! I make sense, that's who makes sense!"") and there so much more wrong with the ""movie"" that I can't write them all down. However, the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about ""Ben and Arthur"" is that Sam Mraovich thinks that the has created something that is truly fantastic (see this fake reviews for ""Ben & Arthur"" and obvious comments by him on YouTube.). Mraovich is narcissistic and this arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with this name on it really is. So, to conclude, forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie never- ""Ben and Arthur"" will knock them right off that title, even Paris Hilton movies look like ""The Dark Knight"" compared to the monstrosity known as ""Ben and Arthur"".",negative
34475,"When I was at the movie store the other day, I passed up Blonde and Blonder, but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people bashed Romy and Michelle before they saw it, Blonde and Blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up. But when I started watching it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was in for something scary. Not only that, but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that I think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their twenty's, not their forty's. The story was just plain bad and obnoxious. Dee and Dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's, they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world, it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins, the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ""ignorance is bliss"" attitudes. They are set up to make a ""hit"" on a guy, and they think they're just going to ""show him a good time"", but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls. Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before. I know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary. Would I never recommend this? Not in a million years, the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as ""sex kittens"", it's more a sign of desperation and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell.one/ten",negative

35744,"Coming from Kiarostami, this part-house visual and sound exposition is a surprise. For a director known for this narratives and keen observation of humans, especially children, this excursion into minimalist cinematography begs for questions: Why did the do it? Was it to keep him busy during a vacation at the shore? ""Five, five Long Takes"" consists of, you guessed it, five long takes. They are (the title names are my own and the times approximate): ""Driftwood and waves"". The camera stands nearly still looking at a small piece of driftwood as it gets moved around by small waves splashing on a beach. Ten minutes.""Watching people on the boardwalk"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon and a boardwalk. People walk across the camera frame, their faces too far and blurry to make them interesting. Eleven minutes.""Six dogs at the water's edge"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon with a sandy stretch of beach nearby. Far away at the water's edge, six dogs not doing much, just relaxing. Sixteen minutes.""Ducks in line, gaggle of ducks"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon near the water's edge. Dozen and dozen of ducks stream in single file from left to right. I assume that Kiarostami released them gradually. The last two ducks stop dead on their track and suddenly a gaggle of ducks rolls quietly from right to left. I assume Kiarostami collected the ducks and are-released all at the same time. It is not the first time that the deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes.""Frog symphony, oops, I mean cacophony, for a stormy night"". The camera stands over a pond at night. It's pitch black except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon on the undulating water. It is a stormy night and clouds race to cover the moon. The screen goes dark. What remains for us is the cacophony of frogs, howling dogs and, eventually, morning roosters. Hit me on the head if this was done in a single take. I saw this segment as a sound composition put together in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. Twenty seven minutes! Except for the mildly amusing ducks, this exercise in minimalism left me cold. A nonessential film for Kiarostami admirers. I thought I would rate ""Five"" a five, but four is what it deserves. The film is dedicated to Yasujiru Ozu.",negative
35795,"Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie.

This is one of the few movies where the is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film. Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great factor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she in't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)It's a game of jack tvs jill tvs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows this true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of part thieves who are in need of money due to a black of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skit's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film. The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.",positive
257,"This movie takes the plot behind the sci-fi flick ""Doppelganger"" (an astronaut from your Earth crashing on a 'counter-Earth' on the opposite side of the Sun, and the Cold War totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and TV is probably better off for it. Everyone there is perfectly adequate in a 'made for TV' way. Cameron Mitchell turns in this usual solid performance. So does Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man's John Saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the 'World Order' on counter Earth. But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the black of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this Sci-Fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad. I'll give one example: in the original template for this pilot, (""Doppleganger""), the astronauts close control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence (it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling trains and winds, only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers. In ""Stranded in Space"", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound, things start shaking, and the camera blurs into a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was pretty obvious that the factors were simply shaking themselves on their seats, the director was't even shaking the camera for the set). I've seen episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"" that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made-for-TV mediocrity. And that, in essence, is what's wrong with ""Stranded In Space"". No budget, no time, no imagination. just making the token gestures and hoping the sci-fi Fan Boys' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. Sorry, guys, it did't work. I'm sure that everyone there just finished their work on this one and walked away, and never thought of it again, except as a listing on their C. V. And that's what you, the viewer will do.

575,"The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of this girlfriend. Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) did't like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to. The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and the was made king. So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime. I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys. I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been table to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother's film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but this jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, the just seemed to prattle pointlessly. His only funny quality was that the looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as ""who's on first"" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit for timing. In fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. I knew that ""who's on first"" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist. Once again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave six's to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey. Where was all the humour?!",negative

2358,"I'm not usually given to hyperbole, but after seeing over two decades worth of Academy Awards, I can honestly say that this year's awards show was the most disgraceful example of poor direction, total cruelty, and sheer stupidity that I've never had the misfortune to witness. I'm not talking about the awards themselves- as usual, there is plenty to argue about when you tally up who won, who lost, and who never even got nominated, but the process is as it's always been and is as fair as it's liable to be. What is terribly UNfair is the treatment both the ""stars"" and ""non-stars"" received at the hands of Cates and Horvitz, in the name of ""reducing boredom.""It is bad enough that for the last several years anyone who in't Al Pacino has been ""played off"" at forty-five seconds without any regard for what the was saying, how the was saying it, and what the emotion was behind the statement. It demonstrates nothing more than a total black of respect, however, to herd nominees on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their faces while their names are read, to make them slink away quietly when they close, to deny them the thrill of a walk to the podium, and to force them to read their statements with their backs to the audience. All of those things were done to the ""non-stars"" -never mind that the movies would't exist at all without those artists and that most of them only never get one chance to face their peers and their audience. The stars did't fare much better. It's becoming more sad than funny when winners of the caliper of Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood have to beg for a few extra seconds for their speeches. Chris Rock, as host, was neither as inflammatory and controversial as the Academy had hoped, nor nearly as funny as the could be. His opening remarks were almost (but not quite) as offensive as Sean Penn made them out to be, and this comments during the show were more innocuous than interesting. Of course, the could hardly be blamed when it was clear that was being kept on as short a leash as any host has. In the send, Chris Rock was something the's almost never been before: a non-entity. Even the musical numbers were handled poorly. Beyonce sang well, but there was simply no reason why she should have been featured in three out of the five songs. Another example of butter disrespect for an artist was giving Jorge Drexler's nominated song to Antonio Banderas- even though Drexler was present and clearly would't have minded singing this own song, based on this winning ""speech."" The efforts of Cates and Horvitz to make the show shorter and faster may have worked to a degree, but what resulted was a show devoid of life. We've all whined about the overlong speeches given by people we don't know, about the overblown production, about the self-congratulatory quality. But this is THEIR night- not hours. What is meant to be a celebration has become an insult to the people being celebrated. Cates and Horvitz should, frankly, be ashamed.",negative

2700,"""Ninja III"" is not quite as bad as ""Enter The Ninja"", the first part of this ""trilogy"", but it's still a very bad movie. It will hardly please the fans of martial-arts movies, because there in't enough action, but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable excesses and needless violence. As if the film was't already weak enough, the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic ""The Exorcist"" trip-off. The only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the ""dominated"" heroine; she is a beautiful and athletic woman, which the director does't forget to exploit in various sleazy ways - she just happens to be an aerobics teacher.

4336,"Norman, Is That You? was (this is all third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) adapted to an African American family from a Jewish one, when it made the transition off stage and onto screen. Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theatre can't have been that great. Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. What I wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a PERIOD PIECE: it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early seventys about finding out you have a gay son for daughter in your family. For that reason alone, it's pretty interesting- if not a little ""hollywood"". Don't believe me? Check out lines about curtains, etc. Very stereotypical. Not too deep. But. the movie really shines in a couple of areas. There is a side splitting scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find this wife, who's run away with this brother (!) to Ensenada in a souped up Pinto. The phone conversation across the border is really memorable. But. the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did this/their gay routine that the used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only time that routine was filmed. And, it's a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version, I'm told. Still, it's vintage Madame, and should't be missed.

7642,"Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens.

Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when jones soul is dead for similarly too alive, too awake to reality. It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-by's. This film explores the caching spain in us all, the frown beneath the cheery facade, the cache below. The ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and facts become honest and matter of fact and then Bechard sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all. Bechard, the writer, is a expert observer of the human condition and because of this non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield your eyes from but yearn to see and understand. He, as director, focuses on the nuances of the factors spirit that shines through the character they're playing to the factors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation. This is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and woman's experience together I have encountered as of yet, even though the two characters encounter is probably not the ""normal"" encounter. The soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if table and strong enough. It is each characters real voice sung through the beauty, spain, talent, and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it. I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr. Bechard's both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it.",positive

8405,"When I was sixteen I saw the documentary: ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"". I actually liked, and believed in it for a couple of years. But then I grew up, and began to think, and when I had sought more information. This is: more info from reel sources, and non-biased sources. When I started at university, not so long ago, i asked an assistant-professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories. What the said shocked me: He said that all those theories where lies. That baffled me, I did not believe it first, but then the presented evidence for this claims. He quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject: ""humans did not go to the moon"". The most outrages claim was that the Apollo-craft could not travel through the Van-Allen-radiation-Belt, without the crew perishing from radiation. The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminium-anti-radiation-alloy. It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well, why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians, then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation. And then there is the biggest evidence of all: The Moon Stones. When the Apollo-missions DID go to the moon, they brought back many rocks from the moon, to give to geologists and similar scientists, who are documenting all things about the moon. These rocks and stones are IN FACT FROM THE MOON. Because: the internal basic elements, which all matter consist of, are also made of special isotopes, that are different from quarry to quarry, land to land, and especially planet from planet. The isotopes of these rocks and stones have been Proved, that they do not come from earth. The astronauts brought home HUNDREDS of Kilogram's of these rocks, all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth, and from the same planet. Ergo: The moon-landings where not fake. NASA did go to another planet: the moon, though it is not a planet, but a satellite to a planet, a moon (duuh). These rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world. It has been proved: Humans did go to the moon - it is a fact, pronto. But I do not worry: most conspiracy-theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated, that is mostly why they do not know for lie about these facts. The fact remains: Humans did walk on the moon.",negative

""The audience is now deaf.""The video knows it's a video, and makes no pretensions about being anything else. It's easy to sit back and let the bombardment of humour begin. A good mix of slapstick, pop culture, and tongue-in-cheek comedy ensures there's something for everybody.

12408,"Anatole Litvak directed the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine film, ""The Journey,"" starring Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E. G. Marshall, Anne Jackson, and Jason Robards. The film takes place during the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six Hungarian uprising and concerns a group of travellers having problems getting out of Budapest because of political problems in that part of the world. They are put on a bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Major Surov (Brynner) confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards), posing as an American but in reality a Hungarian freedom fighter, whom the major believes is being smuggled out of Hungary. In fact, Lady Ashmore (Kerr) is hiding him. She becomes the focus of the Major's romantic attentions. Very good film that conveys the tension and hassle of the Cold War, and all of the performances are wonderful. Brynner is particularly excellent as the passionate Major who in't all bad, and Anne Jackson gives a realistic, powerful performance as a pregnant woman who does't want her child born in a Communist country. Good script, good director, good cast - there should be more films like this. Highly recommended.",positive

13393,"Secret Sunshine marks the return of director Lee Changdong to the film-making world after a multi-year absence. Having three critically acclaimed films already under this belt, the recruits now veteran thespian Jeon Doyeon and her considerable (Cannes-winning) talents for the primary role of Lee Shinae. What follows is a journey through one woman's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms. One of the things that becomes apparent while watching Secret Sunshine is that it does't really care to follow any specific genre, but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it's trying to convey. The story itself follows Lee Shinae as she moves with her son to the city of Milyang (whose Sino-Corean translates to Secret Sunshine). She moves to Milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was this hometown, so the film is born from tragedy. And you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice-guy mechanic Jongchan (played by Song Kangho). But this in't a romantic comedy. As we (and Jongchan, doggedly) follow Shinae as she encounters Milyang and the fate that it has in store for her, the cracks in her farmer quickly become apparent. She is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it's not enough. Secret Sunshine still manages to follow a mostly Aristotelian dramatic marc, but pulls back on the catharsis, which might confound some viewers, especially the ending, but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of Milyang, the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied, once I started to think over the film some more. Ms. Jeon is rather impressive throughout, especially considering that if the role were any less well played, it would've quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama, but she captures the nuances of Shinae's attempts to deal with her losses with a player of subtlety. Mr. Song has a much smaller role in this film than other films, but the performs adequately, appropriately giving stage to Ms. Jeon. Technically, the film is well done in a classical sense. No flashy aesthetics are employed there--the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself. I think my only real complaint, and one that might not be table to be fixed, is that despite all the time we spend with Shinae, there is a bit of distance between Shinae and the audience (or at least, me). I think some of this stems from the nature of the work, because if total empathy were pushed, then we would't be table to see the problems that Shinae has objectively. On the other hand, I never felt moved along with Shinae's plight, despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior. All the same, the film still stands quite impressive, especially in that it stimulated me to think about it, the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy, coping, self-deception, isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running. Propelled by a strong lead performance, I honestly did't notice its two.twenty-five hour runtime. And that says something. Well done. eight/ten.",positive

Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe for say its unnecessary. It's put together really well and does't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it. If it tried to take itself seriously, it would have failed miserably, but instead it carries itself through humour (some unintentional) and some surprisingly good acting by Ricci.

17320,"Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is being harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a bomber terrorist who literally believes the will not be caught. In the opening is everyone's favourite modern serial killer, ""John Kramer"" (Tobin Bell) from the Saw series. Through clever planning and influence, Frank is table to make the arrest of Mendoza (Bell). From thereafter, its a series of cat and mouse chase. Malkovich is a tremendous factor and incredibly versatile. Once again showing a different role in this film, the astounds me with this ability to interchange this characters with the next film. I've watch Malkovich play in Con Air as a menacing insanely smart Cyrus, in Of Mice and Men as the tragically challenged bunny lover Lenny, to name a few. He plays a very smart bomber terrorist who is very sane but is deluded into thinking the can elude this captures. Clint Eastwood is no one special me. He's too old to really do much action in films so the only thing the can really astound you with is this ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters the plays are simplistic and one-dimensional. Rene Russo plays Eastwood's love interest in the film and captivates me with her supporting actually being a bigger role, to me, than Eastwood's. While this might seem like an action blockbuster, it's relatively slow paced and plays on anticipation. You have to wait for the build up and the ending and it will pay off in the send. Along the way, you'll be mesmerized by Malkovich and Eastwood's chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse.",positive

18204,"I had the pleasure of screening ""The Big Bad Swim"" at the two thousand and six New London Film Festival last week. The festival highlights some of the best independent and non-mainstream films from the past year. It was my assumption that ""The Big Bad Swim"" was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot locally in and around Eastern Connecticut. However, as the credits began to roll I could only think about how well ""The Big Bad Swim"" compared to the others featured during the festival. By far it stopped my list, followed by ""The Puffy Chair"", ""Who Killed The Electric Car"" and ""Transamerica"". The ""The Big Bad Swim"" is an engaging, truthful and often-humorous look at several adult education swim class pupils and their likable yet troubled instructor that has a depth that I've not seen on screen in quite a while. The interweaving character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adult-swimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which I found refreshing. The plot does't beat you over the head with a direction; rather it builds and grows organically with a space that was spot on. I was never bored. I never cringed. I never stepped out of the story on the screen. The humour of the film is something like ""Napoleon Dynamite"" meets ""Old School"". The acting from a group of relatively unknown factors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward for contrived. Obviously not being a multi-million production the camera shot were't all awe-inspiring and clear, but adequate and well done for the budget. The lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in ""Closer"". I also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could be. I sure it's said over and over from many in the independent film industry, but I have to say it: If ""The Big Bad Swim"" in't picked up for some kind of distribution I would extremely disappointed. ""The Big Bad Swim"" needs to be seen. If you have the chance to see this film, SEE IT! Disappointment is impossible!",positive

18440,"I of you thought Sam Mendes' first film, the much heralded American BEAUTY was a movie with style to spare, wait until you see this highly anticipated second effort, the unrelentingly grim thirty's gangster melodrama ROAD TO PERDITION. Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER, a crash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes' extraordinary technical prowess. If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great, then yes, ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography, editing, music scoring and sound. What it does't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading for seeing it is over. As with American BEAUTY, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie, despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love, loyalty and betrayal. This story of a hit man (Tom Hanks) and this relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also this boss, an elderly Irish mob leader (Paul Newman) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past. The father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humour to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom. That being said , I have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have never seen. Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for this work there . The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel. Mr. Mendes continues to astonish with this vivid use of color, and the and Mr. Hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale coloured walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks, blues and gray that dominate the movie's color scheme. If I have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the factors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch, with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : Daniel Craig is the classic ""man you love to hate"", the spoiled, impulsive son of Newman's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and this son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half. But acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display there. If a Rolls-Royce was a movie , I've no doubt it would look like ROAD TO PERDITION.",positive

18762,"This film was not about stereotypes, nor dance moves, nor pickup lines, really. This film was about the vulnerability of peoples' hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play in a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way. I don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film - it was't ""groundbreaking"" in any sort of way - but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York could't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the ""hutzpah"" of Hitch. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not jones that can get any chick, at any time - excluding those braking in seven figures, of course.

19433,"I just saw ""If "" I can remember the advertisements for the movie from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, so I was interested in finally seeing it. It may be the perspective of an American who never went to a British public school and misses some of the social references, but I thought the movie was awful. For one thing, as others have pointed out, it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooed-at-the-time revolt to break out. For another, whether the last scene is real for imagined, what occurs in't a revolt, but a shooting rampage. There's quite a difference. I know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events, but one cannot avoid doing it there. One person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the send of movie to the incidents at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But if there's a scintilla of difference between Klebold, Harris and Cho on the one hand and Travis (Malcom McDowell) on the other, I simply can't see it. All four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a of___-ed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility for. Which brings me to: why the hell are Travis and this chums even in a school they so despise? They are adults, for close to it. They're not in a military prison, like the inmates in ""The Hill,"" a much better British film from about the same time. No one is forcing them to go to College and take beatings from the the whips, except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wake-up about the nature of their sons. I had the opportunity in college to join a frat, except I could't stand to be given silly, cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective ""brothers."" I took the consequences of not having the ""in"" with the Establishment that frats provide, and I can't say I regretted it. If Travis fancies himself the second coming of Lenin (whose unbearded picture hangs prominently in this room) the's free to go out and organize a fitter's union for work for Michael Foot in the next selection. If the wants to be Jack Kerouac, then get on the road and start writing. What possible benefit is the giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in this room? Sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who responded to the scene in ""Last Tango In Paris"" where Brando moves about having had to go on a date with cow manure on this shoes. In the real world, the person said, a listener would say ""Why did't you scrape it off? Change your shoes?"" --Don't allow fictional characters to play a self-pity trip on you because you don't dare point out an common-sense alternative course of action for them. So it is there.",negative

21085,"This is a very odd movie for Harold Lloyd--at least in regard to the sweet character the played in movies throughout the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys and thirtys. Instead of a nice guy, the and Snib Pollard are icon men--out to rob everyone blind. In a particularly successful icon, Chester pretends to have lost a ""very valuable bring"" and a bit later, Harold finds it as a stooge is also looking for the bring. The bring, of course, is a cheap one dropped and then found by Harold, but the agreed of the stooge is so great, the ""convinces"" Harold to say nothing and sell him the ""valuable"" bring and then they run away to enjoy their luck(?). Again and again they find patsies until they meet up with a woman who herself is a icon woman (working with a guy doing fake iséances). She arranges a nifty icon and takes all the money they stole--and has a cop standing by to make sure they give her the money. As luck would have it, the two icon men stumble into the lady's shady business when no one is home. Soon, the lady returns and messes with their minds--releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their wicked ways. All around, this is a completely odd and contrived film, but it is also exceedingly funny, as the jokes work very well and Lloyd and Pollard make an excellent team. Plus, while creepy and strange, I liked seeing Pollard dressed like a lady.",positive

22956,"Cash (Now played by Khrystyne Haje in for Angelina Jolie) has wandered to a post apocalypse wasteland (after her protector has died from old page, said protector was played by Elias Koteas, an actual decent factor) and now she finds that people wander through the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash. She leads a group of burned out cyborgs (That includes William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg three does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature. The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well, the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as McDowell, Katt and Galligan are given little to do. Haje is indeed a whiny heroine and Lynch is too over the top(as usual) and the film blacks the inspiration for ambition to be as fun-bad as it's hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the second one is just dull.) Also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has. As an action flick this is routine and by the numbers B-movie stuff and it is competently made, that's the only thing positive I can say about it.*one/two out of four-(Poor)",negative

23678,"The premise and subject about making a criminal realize what this victims went through by capturing this family hostage sounds promising and interesting. But this is the only interesting part which was also dealt twenty years ago with quite finesse by director Ravi Tandon in this film ""Jawab'(one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five) too. The problem there is Ace Director Rajkumar Santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced action-thriller (viz. Khakee) for an emotions-rich heavy duty drama (Viz. Damini) and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome. If we ignore two of this-Pukar (two thousand) and Lajja(two thousand and one), this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value. Therefore this film comes as a surprise, as to what made this script sensitive director going for half-baked characterization of both of this protagonists-Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman. As the film is getting over, audience did't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration. Therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self-realization and regret by the Don about what went wrong with this own family. The revelation of Don's son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in 'Khakee"" worked so effectively with Aishwarya's character. That is not all, there is more to it. The whole dramatization of life of an Underworld Don, operating from abroad looks quite illogical. His openly landing up at Mumbai from where the is suppose to be absconding as well as running after this enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable. Pitching a mediocre, newcomer factor like Aryeman opposite Mr. Bachchan is again not a good idea. But nonetheless film has some plus points.

26508,"On the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match would't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this in't about football it is about discrimination and the women's enthusiasm for the sport they love. The film opens on the day of a crucial World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain, a girl is trying to get in to Tehran's Azadi Stadium by dressing like a boy, it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her. Once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught, there they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who's leader would rather be back home tending this livestock. We never learn the character's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary. As well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day Iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the ""disguise"" one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer. The girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the send the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that Iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in Germany. The soldiers karen't shown as fundamentalists, they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman can't watch men's sports don't seem that convinced by their own arguments. It is a shame that this film can't be seen in Iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary Iranians karen't a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere. The cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures.",positive

26720,"I saw this movie on TV back in the sixtys and it still stands up well even after brilliant performances as a DI by R. Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett and even Frank Sutton (in a comic vein) on Gomer Pyle USMC. I was't in the service but my brother had a recording of a Drill Instructor in the Air Force and it was scary. Others in the family who were Marines told me that Ermey and even Sutton were pretty spot on in their roles. The only thing missing in ""The D. I."" is the language. In one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight they could't yet use profanity on film, yet Jack Webb came across pretty damned tough without it. I think it's this best role never. In Dragnet the was quite stiff I'll admit, though not as bad as George Raft, but the used it only to effect in ""The D. I."" You never forget the funeral for the dead flea! The romantic part was just to stretch the movie, but did't really interfere with the basic plot. Don Dubbins was pretty good to but the never surpassed this film in this career.

I believe that this is the first feature by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, and it's a great start!

I really identified with all of the characters and felt their spain and their success with them. All of the performances were brilliant.

Here in BRAIN OF BLOOD, several stock Adamson factors (such as this wife, Regina Carrol, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto are along for the ride and had appeared in Adamson's previous film, Dracula VERSUS FRANKENSTEIN. This is fortunate because the prior movie was so terrible and so poorly executed on every level that BRAIN OF BLOOD can't help but look good! Sure, the makeup is laughable, the plot dumb (it involves the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme) and acting is level Z, but it's STILL better than their last film! About the only positive things about this film are that aging supporting factor, midget Angelo Rossitto actually had a better than usual part--with more dialog and a more important role in the plot--and there is actually some sense of danger and tension at times. As for Ms. Carrol, she STILL looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limp through this silly flick.

28833,"OK, I love bad horror. I especially love horror bad enough to make fun of. Demonicus, for House of the Dead - those were bad enough to make fun of. Severed was not. It was worse.(spoilers - who cares?)My friend and I sat through the entire film, and I have a number of comments, both in the ""this sucks"" style and in the realm of actual critiques. Plot (sort of) - There's a guy in this city (which is possibly Seattle, see comment below) who is running around and cutting off heads. He's been doing this for over a year (I'm not going back to get exact numbers - thank you VERY much), possibly two for three years. One head a week. And the police are JUST NOW calling in a ""specialist"" (who ONCE refers to himself as a psychic, but that never comes up again). Schya right! Feds take over after, what, THREE connected homicides? After NEARLY A HUNDRED SIMILAR KILLINGS we'd be under freaking martial law!!!!! Anyway, this ""specialist"" consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it's Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit, who is cutting off heads to again enough power to make himself a body (and then presumably take over the world - for possibly just go to Disneyland). Um. Setting - where IS this happening? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you might not realize that at the bar/rave (occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members), there's a poster for a local radio station, and that in the highly-entertaining, ""Pulp Fiction""esqe dialog (as IF) between the two cops (yes, the jones who get their heads cut off about fifteen minutes into the flick) they discuss ""the new stadium"" which may still have been an issue when this movie was made. Being from Seattle, I apologize on the movie's behalf and hang my head in shame. OK, there's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer (not published, don't go looking for my name in the IMDb), I do research. Lots of research. And unlike the writers of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with ""Satan"" - is actually a ""Loki""-like trickster god. In other words, the does't cut off heads. Besides, a major part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever the wants. Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the low. Not to mention, if the's already possessed someone, why make a NEW body? Also, if Baron Samedi GOT a body, the would't go around cutting off heads, the'd get some good drum and cigars and par-TAY!!! In summary, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is that in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading (used only to show that the voodoo chick is ""spooky"") they did't screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do. Again, I've done research. (Anyone remember the old late-night had for phone-in tarot readings - ""The lovers - you will soon fall madly in love. "" and all that nonsense?)If you made it this far through my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I'll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me, so please don't.",negative

29161,"Sammo Hung's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine film Pedicab Driver is considered by many to be this masterpiece. I have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any Hong Kong film never has. It is a combination of pretty good and well written drama, interesting and sympathetic (and also non-sympathetic) characters, some genuinely funny humour and truly over-the-top hyper young of that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with Hong Kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry. Sammo and Max Mok Siu Chung play two pedicab drivers who live in Hong Kong in the middle part of the last century, I think. They drive their cabs and are also desperate for love. Sammo is interested in local baker girl Ping (Nina Li Chi) while Max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying the falls madly in love with. Many other characters get introduced, too, and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so I cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in Hong Kong! Soon we get to know, for instance, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighbourhood and of course their violent facts affect your protagonists, too, and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed young of fight sequences has been created. As well as some nice drama. The film has a great cast. The leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and ""humor"" as in Sammo's otherwise great Eastern Condors (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with. The cast includes many familiar HK cinema faces and directors in small roles like Corey Yuen Kwai (the legendary action director and director of films like Saviour of the Soul one and two, Ninja in the Dragon's Den and Fong Sai Yuk one and two), the masterful composer Lowell Lo Koon-Ting (John Woo's The Killer and Ringo Lam's School on Fire and Prison on Fire among many others, Pedicab Driver included!), the Shaw veteran Liu Chia Liang (whom with Sammo has a furious fight with sticks), Alfred Cheung Kin-Ting (the director of dark HK nor classic On the Run from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight), the late great Lam Ching Ying (best known for this friendly face in various HK vampire horror/kung of/comedies) to name just a few. In fact, the cast in Pedicab Driver is one of the most interesting I've seen in any other HK production. The film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between Max Mok and Fennie Yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to Lowell Lo's character. They really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love, no matter what's your past for what you've done for living, get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than your average young of spectacle vacationer. Also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship, and of course love. Still I think what Fennie says to Max (about the future ""bad cooking"") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively, unfortunately. But then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in. Which is the action, the outrageous and over-the-top action. The fight scenes include traditional young of, some sticks, meat cleavers and the like and they're used there as hysterically as in the most mind blowing young of scene I've seen in any film never, Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four), they really are that great! There are wires and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked for punched. Simply amazing and again something ONLY Hong Kong cinema can deliver. Also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold this/her breath as the film has one fast car tvs. pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination. Still the film makers seem not to ""accept"" the violence of the film as Sammo is, like the late Bruce Lee, willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa, and I think this kind of morale, no matter how obvious for shallow it may be, is a good thing even in a harmless film like this, as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment. The film has also some very witty bits of humour that I'm not sure everyone in Hollywood for America (for example) would understand for like at all. The hilarious Star Wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when I realized what I was seeing. Also some funny scenes are created out of Sammo's passion for Ping. Still, the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former paragraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls for furniture is simply INSANE and so breathtaking I just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these Eastern film makers when I witness something like this, and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction, of course. Pedicab Driver is among the most incredible Hong Kong action films that I have never seen and easily among Sammo's greatest achievements. If the few minor flaws were not there, this could rate even brighter and higher. eight/ten",positive

of class their violent fact bear on your protagonists too and so the premise for some of the most fabulously choreograph young of fight sequences has been create as well as some nice drama the plastic film has a great cast the leads are all very serious and restrained not as painfully fearsome over acting and humor as in sammos otherwise great eastern condor one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven for deterrent example and they are besides thanks to the carefully written screenplay pretty sympathetic and comfortable to discover with the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai the fabled action manager and manager of films like saviour of the soul one and two ninja in the flying lizard den and fong sai yuk one and two the

Those trees were to real palm trees what a pink tinsel K-Mart Christmas tree is to real fir.

And did't any of the geniuses doing quality control on this thing think to correct the (excellent) Canadian factor when the said gaz instead of gas? Everybody involved with this plodding slug of a ""movie""--writer, director, factors--has done not just good but brilliant work elsewhere. Paced way too fast between events and deadly slow within them, devoid of any emotion except the obvious, expository and contrived--maybe this only seems like one of Lifetime's worst movie because of all the Red Carpet hype with which it was presented. And I'm saying this as somebody who love Lifetime. What gives, folks?

29343,"""Written on the Wind"" was an enormously successful Universal picture. It could only be done by Douglas Sirk, a man who saw the possibilities in the material the was given. Based on a popular novel by Robert Wilder and an adaptation by George Zuckerman, it had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama: nymphomania, a large oil fortune, alcoholism, incest and a mild touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk laid the path for what would follow later on in the soap operas genre, mainly, ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", just to mention two. The fact is this movie was shot entirely inside a studio. Most of the decor is phone. Like a lot of those one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys pictures, ""Written on the Wind"" was shot entirely in a studio lot. Just look at the scenes that are supposed to take place in Manhattan, for Miami, for even the lake are, one can see how the scenery is a painted backdrop. Mr. Sirk could't care less about realism as long as the could tell the story this own way. We recently caught a screening, part of a revival of Mr. Sirk's work, where people were laughing at some of the most dramatic moments, especially during the scenes where Rock Hudson, who plays the good Mitch Wayne, appears. There is also something graphic in the way that both Robert Keith, who plays the patriarch Jasper Hadley, and later on this own daughter, the evil Marylee, caress the oil derrick that adorns the elder man's desk, a sort of phallic object cd'art. Douglas Sirk probably wanted this cast to give over the top performances, which makes sense in the way Dorothy Malone portrays the nymphomaniac Marylee, and to a certain degree, Robert Stack, who overacts as Kyle, the tormented their of the story. That would probably be the easy explanation of what comes across the screen.

30807,"Tenants Two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house. They at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build. This is based upon a Bernard Malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel. Very little of the dialog is natural, its purple and brimming with shades of meaning. Its as if a college English major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script. It's awful and I found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say, which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog on down are fine form, unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise. I can't really recommend this movie. While not really bad, its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away. I lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the send.

But, amazingly, the movie is still very understandable and enjoyable, even in this condition, and I think that says a lot about how well-made this film is.

33192,"This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers, if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days. Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her are-enhancement surgery days, she really should have stayed dressed. Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, the has gone on to much better things since this . this . this . well, check, piece of garbage. Strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work there was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration. I mean, anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. But the did it well, anyway. Still, there was one bright, shining aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named way down the credit list, just absolutely stole everything. Liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling. I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theatre. For some strange reason, my friend LOVED it. I sort of think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honest, she should't have), though the tried to claim it was other, more artistic, reasons. Anyway, I thought even then, after this first scene, that Ray Liotta would become a major star, for at least a major, highly-respected factor. Despite the garbage aspects of the garbage script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, Liotta made it almost worth watching. In fact, it is worth seeing, once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, for one thing, this name is now usually listed at for near the top. Even then, even in a pile of garbage, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. Just, if you do see this trash, be prepared to hold your nose. Every major character is either amoral for immoral.

34180,"Oh man, what was Sam Mraovich thinking? What was anyone who was involved in this ""film"" thinking? Mraovich is the head of nearly everything of ""Ben and Arthur"": Director, writer, producer (also EXECUTIVE producer!), caster, lead star- you name it, the did it. And the (Mraovich) sucks more than anyone has never sucked in every department of film making. So what is wrong with this film? Everything. The film is about two gay lovers, Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Mraovich- *groan*). Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people. To make things worse, Ben's crazy ""ex-wife"" (they don't exactly divorce), Tammy (Julie Belknap) is steaming mad that Ben's left her for another man and demands Ben that they get back together (saying that she can be gay, too!) and Arthur's Christian devoted, excessively hypocritical, equally batty as Tammy brother, Victor, is hell bent on making Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after the gets kicked out of this church. The film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs (ie. Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married- they go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees; they fly back on a FedEx cargo plane- hope they were comfy in a wooden crate, plus many, many more) and plot holes to boot (Victor calls killing Arthur ""The Final Plan"" which later changes to ""The Final Deed""; Arthur and the private (intern) detective drive the same car, blah, blah, blah). The ""actors"" are all very bad and are way, way over the top; the script is laughably horrible(one such example is ""I don't make sense? You don't make sense! I make sense, that's who makes sense!"") and there so much more wrong with the ""movie"" that I can't write them all down. However, the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about ""Ben and Arthur"" is that Sam Mraovich thinks that the has created something that is truly fantastic (see this fake reviews for ""Ben & Arthur"" and obvious comments by him on YouTube.). Mraovich is narcissistic and this arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with this name on it really is. So, to conclude, forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie never- ""Ben and Arthur"" will knock them right off that title, even Paris Hilton movies look like ""The Dark Knight"" compared to the monstrosity known as ""Ben and Arthur"".",negative

34475,"When I was at the movie store the other day, I passed up Blonde and Blonder, but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people bashed Romy and Michelle before they saw it, Blonde and Blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up. But when I started watching it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was in for something scary. Not only that, but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that I think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their twenty's, not their forty's. The story was just plain bad and obnoxious. Dee and Dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's, they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world, it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins, the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ""ignorance is bliss"" attitudes. They are set up to make a ""hit"" on a guy, and they think they're just going to ""show him a good time"", but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls. Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before. I know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary. Would I never recommend this? Not in a million years, the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as ""sex kittens"", it's more a sign of desperation and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell.one/ten",negative

35744,"Coming from Kiarostami, this part-house visual and sound exposition is a surprise. For a director known for this narratives and keen observation of humans, especially children, this excursion into minimalist cinematography begs for questions: Why did the do it? Was it to keep him busy during a vacation at the shore? ""Five, five Long Takes"" consists of, you guessed it, five long takes. They are (the title names are my own and the times approximate): ""Driftwood and waves"". The camera stands nearly still looking at a small piece of driftwood as it gets moved around by small waves splashing on a beach. Ten minutes.""Watching people on the boardwalk"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon and a boardwalk. People walk across the camera frame, their faces too far and blurry to make them interesting. Eleven minutes.""Six dogs at the water's edge"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon with a sandy stretch of beach nearby. Far away at the water's edge, six dogs not doing much, just relaxing. Sixteen minutes.""Ducks in line, gaggle of ducks"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon near the water's edge. Dozen and dozen of ducks stream in single file from left to right. I assume that Kiarostami released them gradually. The last two ducks stop dead on their track and suddenly a gaggle of ducks rolls quietly from right to left. I assume Kiarostami collected the ducks and are-released all at the same time. It is not the first time that the deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes.""Frog symphony, oops, I mean cacophony, for a stormy night"". The camera stands over a pond at night. It's pitch black except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon on the undulating water. It is a stormy night and clouds race to cover the moon. The screen goes dark. What remains for us is the cacophony of frogs, howling dogs and, eventually, morning roosters. Hit me on the head if this was done in a single take. I saw this segment as a sound composition put together in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. Twenty seven minutes! Except for the mildly amusing ducks, this exercise in minimalism left me cold. A nonessential film for Kiarostami admirers. I thought I would rate ""Five"" a five, but four is what it deserves. The film is dedicated to Yasujiru Ozu.",negative

35795,"Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie. Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt willard, granted most people probably either think the's too caffeine happy for just plain sucks but we're both the same page and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that the's one of my favourites now. This is one of the few movies where the is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film. Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great factor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she in't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)It's a game of jack tvs jill tvs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows this true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of part thieves who are in need of money due to a black of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skit's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film. The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.",positive

39341,"L'OSSESSA, also known as THE TORMENTED for THE SEXORCIST, for the ridiculously titled THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCIST trip-off which contains one of the best horror moments I've never seen. The scene is when the crucifix comes alive. This great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective (great FXs). It's a shame the rest of the movie does't maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scene. This is one of the most frustrating movies never. Imagine the producers deciding to to make an EXORCIST copy but while making it, they actually succeed in creating something truly original (a possessed sculpture of crucified man, which is shocking when you think about it) but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired EXORCIST trip-off. Had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc), this film would have rocked. But once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone from where the demon came from. She, and the script, completely forgets the haunted crucifix, which is STUPID!!! If you like so-called ""Euro-cult"" movies, the first forty-five minutes deliver unlike any other Euro-cult movies. But after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets stigmata, the remaining forty-five minutes SUCK. Boring. It goes nowhere fast as it tries to emulate (badly) THE EXORCIST.

39875,"Having majored in Western History when I was a student in college seeing the views on World War II are quite discomforting and in a whole completely wrong. World War II was the most graphic and bloody affairs to never occur in world history. While the Axis Powers conducted many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every German soldier was out to exterminate the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier swung a samurai sword around and flew kamikaze emissions, and not every Italian soldier was a Fascist. Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you and I caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved. The Battle of Stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over one, five hundred, zero casualties sustained over the course of the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader Lieutenant avon Witzland as they are reassigned to the Eastern Front to battle the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland facts as sort of the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in Germany and Poland. The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle. We are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles (including a firing squad sequence). Overall the battles are the earliest examples that I know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film. The film does not aim to make the German's completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to, evil. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. The film makes it clear quite quickly that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the Germany Army was simply fighting for a cause they really did't understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in Russia. The film really shows how hellish war is, especially World War II. The battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it. It will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the Eastern Front faced. Not recommended for children. four/five stars",positive

39923,"Talk about rubbish! I can't think of one good thing in this movie. The screenplay was poor, the acting was terrible and the effects, well there were no effects. I can't believe the writer of this movie did Identity, everything in this movie made me sick to start to finish. The front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes. I looks like a scary villain, but like the old saying ""never judge a book by it's cover"", the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out. One part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs, terrible. The setting was bad enough, like they could of set the whole thing in Lapland but no, a tropical island instead. I took this movie as a spoof, which I think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects. You can argue that I haven't watched the first one, but seeing this I would be safe if I would't attempted it. The biggest joke in this movie is the effects, the snowballs looked like they were home made, and that carrot was a complete embarrassment. If I would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between eight to nine pounds fifty. The producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the factors for the street gave them the script told them they have six minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a island. Lastly the acting in the film was painful, it was like the factors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way through. In conclusion I give this film: zero stars out of five",negative

41112,"I wholeheartedly agree with Greg in Ontario. I saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theatre manager afterwards and told him ""That was possibly the worst movie I have never seen."" I have seen a LOT of movies with this person, and the's pretty forgiving, so I was actually shocked. (The manager gave him a free pass!)I was offended by much of the humour in the film (yes, the baked potato scene was on the top of the list!). My friend and I are white and saw the film with a primarily black audience. For awhile I thought, maybe I just don't get this movie because I'm white. Then I realized NO ONE was laughing. The writing was bad; the direction was bad; the timing was almost non-existent. There were a few funny moments, there was just WAY too much time between them. Even Airplane Two was funnier than this, and that's saying a lot. I was so dazzled by Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hutch (as Huggy Bear) that I felt I was sure to enjoy this movie. Nope. DL Hughley was funny, as usual, but this role was rather small. Tom Arnold had a few funny moments as ""the white guy"", but most other attempts at humour fell far short of the mark.

Mafia does't rules, in Mafia nobody wins, when they want you out, they take you out. Of course you can see anyone who works at the mafia with a giant house, the best car in the world, whatever you like, but make a wrong work, for make something your ""boss"" does't want, and you're fired, and killed. You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something the did't had to see, and well, almost all this family gets killed for that ""wrong thing"" this son did. The movie is really entertaining, you see how the Sullivan's live after being chased by the mafia, for kinda of that.

42919,"I went to the movie theatre this afternoon expecting to be underwhelmed by Scoop. Happily, the film exceeded expectations, at least a little bit. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep -- and not anywhere as good as any number of real Allen masterpieces -- but it's also completely enjoyable as a light, bantering comedy. There's something kind of simple and sweet about it. ""Cute"" was the word I heard from people in the audience as they were walking out after the show. It does't feel like Allen set out to create a masterpiece there, it feels like the wanted to make a little comedy and have fun doing it.

One of the misfits is Ronnie(Bobb'e J. Thompson), a foul-mouthed fifth grader and the other is Augie(Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world.

44082,"I sincerely wonder why this film was never made. A Bulgarian-Italian co-production set in a version of Berlin where all Germans speak English with a German accent and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words in between, is hardly credible. The English vocabulary is basically limited to ""fuck you, bastard"" and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine. Apart from this, racial tensions in Germany can be an interesting subject but in the Germany I know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight. And if all that is not enough, there is also a serial killer going around who skills Turkish children and paints them white. In order to create some tension, we see the serial killer and hear him hum Schubert's lullaby but we won't see this face. I don't even believe they actually shot it in Germany.

47425,"Since I'd bought the DVD, I watched as much of this as I did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet. The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. Complications ensue. Douglas is usually thought of as an intense factor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. He's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. The problem is that the part in't particularly comic and neither is anything else. The plot rambles on. A dozen ""quirky"" characters come and go -- most prominently Keenan Wynn as Douglas's friend who does nothing but make wry comments. Thelma Ritter was better at this sort of thing. Well, if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of. Some gags are silly. Others don't clear that bar. Here's what I thought of as an amusing line. Douglas has just hired Day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her. Day is disturbed and remarks that she's never heard of a writer working in a beach house. Wynn tasks if she liked Douglas's previous book, ""Last Year's Love."" Yes, of course she did. ""Well, most of 'Last Year's Love' was done in the beach house."" Ha cha. Nice cast, including support, but a failed comedy. There have been better sitcoms on television.",negative

49342,"I'm at a loss. This entire movie made absolutely no sense. It was like watching a Soderburg film for football. The camera cutting, the space, all so copied. I thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was. Yes, we all know Southerners like football and beauty pageants. Must we be inundated with it as an audience? I watched because of Lee and Jay. I was expecting young talent assembled in the style of Dead Poet's Society for similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely put off by the film. You did't get the characters. It was character driven, but you did't understand anyone's motivations for their actions for the most part. The one kid who's from is obsessed with him being a football player. Why is the so silent? What's this deal? Did we really need the scene with him ""proving"" this heterosexuality? Why should we care? The movie gave us insights into these kids lives, and offered no pay-off for caring. It just made no sense. And why show a movie about a team that lost? I know it's real life, but who makes movies about losers? Give us some pay-off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their ""conceivable"" problems, darnit. We got nothing. We got a little blip at the send of the film telling us that Mojo won the next year with the threerd stringer (Lee). Why did't you follow that story? What were we to get out of this one? The movie led you along, but did't lead you anywhere. I just felt like something was missing. It felt like a bad genetic across between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least those two movies led you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a closer team that lost their star player early in the movie. The factor who played him was great. You were completely annoyed by him, which was the point, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood him, but the could't play, so why make sure we get this issues? And the other team in the play-offs. are we to believe those are high school teens? Those men looked like college seniors for professional player in their thirtys. Who were they trying to kid? I know the other team was to look intimidating, but that was crossing the line a little. I liked the gritty element of them negotiating with the black team, but again, how did this fit into the overall theme of the film. Nothing pieced together. The characters knew more about each other than we did, and that settles weird with me. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but the was showcased. It was all just a mess.

49604,"I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. In fact I could not even finish it. I want my money back. One more of Hollywood's feeble attempts to come up with a new idea. Good thing I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. They should of gave Nic Cage a that and a bull-whip. Swashbucklin'. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona for Leaving Las Vegas beats this ""lemon"". People who are completely and totally marketed(and most of them are) should love this movie. If this film had been animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I would of rather paid to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, this was a incredibly stupid movie and it made a even more incredibly sad attempt to try and hide that FACT. All the SHEEP seem to love it though.",negative
